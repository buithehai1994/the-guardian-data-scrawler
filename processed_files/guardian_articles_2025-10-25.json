Now he’s lining up projects with everyone from Ron Howard to Edgar Wright. Could he be Texas’s answer to Tom Cruise?Sat 25 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareThere’s that famous line in the first episode of The Sopranos, where Tony laments his place in the timeline. “Lately I’m getting the feeling,” he confides, “that I came in at the end. The best is over.” I know Tony was talking about the mindful joy of building an incredibly violent organised crime enterprise from the ground up – but lately I’ve been thinking about his words every time I watchGlen Powellgiving it 200% as a movie star. Glen Powell is Hollywood’s hottest mid-level actor; but because of the harsh realities of modern movie stardom, a lot of people still don’t know who he is. You get the feeling he’s coming in at the end of something.Yet barely a week goes by where I don’t hear of an uncast starring role – the bodyguard in the Bodyguard remake, the cybercriminal in the Matrix remake, the hot soldier in the Starship Troopers remake – and not think: tell you what, Glen Powell could do that for you. Glen Powell could deliver that. He’s not going to turn up late to set, he’s going to work harder than anyone else, he’s going to promote the arse out of it – and if all that can open a wormhole back to the era when literally everyone knew who movie stars were, then Glen Powell is sure as hell going to take the opportunity. He is, quite simply, a one-man cargo cult for Hollywood’s vanished primacy.View image in fullscreenJumper, trousers and shoes: Tom FordI’m kidding,of course. Because the good news, I discover as I sit with him, is that you can kid around with Glen Powell: actor, writer, proud Texan. And also: condimenttycoon, at a price point America can afford (more on that later, rest assured).“Truly, I don’t know how anyone takes themselves seriously in this job,” he laughs. And yet, so many do, Glen. “No, but I really don’t. It’s so funny. On every movie I literally sit there thinking: there is no way you can be a self-serious person and do this job well, because it’s so ridiculous.” It’s hard to disagree, thinking back to this morning’s photoshoot, where I watched Glen wearing an extremely expensive top-to-toe purple outfit while wiping the floor after a little accident by his internet-famous dog, Brisket. A beguiling fluffball, Brisket has attended a lot of premieres, and takes second billing to Glen – for now. You have to remember this is a dog-eat-dog business.In the flesh, Glen is chirpily handsome and category five amiable – a sort of Mickey Mouse Club version of James Dean. He’s about to open in Edgar Wright’s remake of The Running Man, based on the Stephen King novel – another of those dystopian fictions that sees society as a death game that are (for whatever reason!) having a long cultural moment. “I’ve watched everything Edgar has ever done,” Glen enthuses – and it’s fun thinking of him enjoying the lost British males of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and The World’s End, and then offering up his own all-American hunkdom to the Wright vision.View image in fullscreenPowell as Ben Richards in Edgar Wright’s The Running Man.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy Stock PhotoSo we’re in a big moment for Glen Powell – yet, simultaneously, he’s fully aware that being a major movie star is a different game from what it was last time this particular action title was on cinema marquees. (The year: 1987. The star: Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger.) “Yeah,” he smiles. “It’ll never be what it used to be.”We’re being brought takeaway pasta at a picnic table on the Paramount Pictures lot – perhaps fittingly, the last bit of Hollywood still located in actual Hollywood – and I’ve tactically ordered ravioli because it’s the least messy, and I’m worried about having 2ft of spaghetti trailing out of my mouth while I’m asking Glen Powell about the fracturing of shared contemporary culture. Glen’s gone for something involving significant amounts of one of those spiky lettuces that Americans have fancy names for. Could be dangerous.Anyway: the lost past. Glen likes to tell a story about the education he received around a decade ago onThe Expendables 3. (Important Glen Powell fact: he loves nothing more than an education, and is fully committed to meeting his heroes and learning everything about the business from them.) The Expendables is the franchise where Sylvester Stallone keeps getting a bunch of action stars of the 1980s and 90s together for one last job. On Glen’s iteration of the series, he was in the gang with Stallone, Harrison Ford, Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren and Antonio Banderas. The full action retirement community. “All those guys were really so great,” he remembers. “They were legends. And they were like: man, you’re doing this at thewrongtime …”Does he wish he were born in that earlier time (a bit like that stripe of modern British politician who secretly imagines they’d have been just the man for the bygone glories of the 20th or even 19th centuries)? “Look, every era of Hollywood has the sky-is-falling mentality. It was always better back then. But my favourite movies are, like, 90s, early 2000s. That’s what I grew up watching, and what made me come out here [to LA].”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIn Top Gun: Maverick (2020), with Daisy Edgar-Jones in Twisters (2024) and in Chad Powers (2025), starring and co-written by Powell. Photographs: Collection Christophel/Alamy; TCD/ProdDB/ Alamy; Daniel Delgado/DisneyHe’s certainly remade a few of them, or at least starred in modern reboots of them. His serious breakout was in 2022’sTop Gun: Maverickas Hangman, the spiritual heir to Val Kilmer’s swaggering Iceman in the original. Then there wasTwisters, a sequel to the mid-90s Twister, and now The Running Man, while one of the many projects in the pipeline is a Ron Howard movie about firefighters, which it’s hard not to feel is at least in the Backdraft extended universe. Surely one can teleport our entire culture back to the golden age of action stardom?But there’s also the other side to his career – movies such as the 2023neo-noirHit Man, co-written with Richard Linklater, which made some film snoots suddenly feel differently about him. And the small matter of his saving romcoms – twice – withSet It Up(2018,huge for Netflix), and 2023’sAnyone But You, where he starred opposite bombshell turned culture-wars lightning rod Sydney Sweeney, and served up a surprise box-office hit. That one came with a side performance of fauxmance, as the pair allowed the media to think they were maybe dating to promote the film (they weren’t). Meanwhile, he’s co-writtenChad Powers, a new TV sports comedy for Hulu – and just wrapped on Ghostwriter, a fantasy film for JJ Abrams. It’s quite the mix.Tom Cruise told me: you’ve got to have skin on the line. You’ve got to show up for the audienceView image in fullscreenJumper: Tom Ford“If you meet my family,” he explains, “you’ll probably see why.” (Vital Glen Powell fact: Glen Powell is utterly devoted to his parents, Glen Sr, an executive coach, and Cyndy, a homemaker and frequent cameo in his movies. Ditto the two sisters he falls in the middle of – Leslie is a musician, and Lauren has just given birth to her second set of twins). “This would be a family where you go see a Yankees game and a Broadway show in one day. I loved Gene Kelly, and I love Bruce Willis.” But they were homebodies, too. “Oh yeah. You go to the ranch in Texas, and the kitchen – that’s where all life happened.”And you love romcoms. “Well, I grew up with sisters, and so many female cousins – the women in the Powell family really run the roost. I mean, my dad took my mom’s last name.” Well, fancy that. “Right? But actually there’s something about romcoms. A lot of actors tell me their favourite movies and I’m, like, that’sdark. I always like movies that are rewatchable, that fill you up.” Comforting things? “Yeah, comforting things. I sort of like escapist things, where you’re not pulling people’s energy, you’re giving them energy. And that’s what romcoms are to me.” He can quote Legally Blonde in its entirety. In fact, because of the meeting-his-heroes thing, Glen made it his business to connect with Karen McCullah, the great romcom writer who gave us Legally Blonde. And then he knew just who he had to introduce her to. “When my family met Karen McCullah, it was like they were meeting the Beatles.”View image in fullscreenPowell and his family attend a Hit Man premiere, 2024, in Austin, Texas.Photograph: Rick Kern/ Getty Images for NetflixEven so, movie romance feels endangered. There was astudy saying intimacy on screen had decreased 40% since the millennium. Glen, I’m worried hot people aren’t getting it on in the movies as much as they used to. “Is that right? Why do you think that is?” I dunno. Changing tastes in a disinherited generation? I tell him I noted the last scene of Twisters seemed to be him asking for Daisy Edgar-Jones’s informed consent to even phone her. Although, I read they did film a kiss but the directordidn’t use it. “I blame myself,” Glen cackles. Just botched the kiss? “I tried! I did my best!”You see, he looks like this alpha, macho, watch-loving guy – but he’s always out there subverting it. Maybe that’s the Glen Powell special sauce (not the actual sauce; we’ll get to the sauce). “I mean … it’s not a conscious thing. You know, I grew up with big dogs. And when I was going to adopt a dog, I went to look at big dogs. But then I liked Brisket. A little fluffy, cute, part-chihuahua was not in the plan – but we found each other.” I realise Glen reminds me a lot of the oldAthena posterof the hot, shirtless guy holding the baby. If you’re my age or over, you’ll remember it. If you’re younger, all I need to tell you is that this was the biggest-selling poster of the 1980s and made the photographer so much money that he bought a plane.Having said that, Glen’s vibe wasn’t ringing the tills for a long while back there. He dropped out of his University of Texas degree in Spanish and early American history. (Of course – of course – he is now completing this degree aged 37, remotely, while shooting films. Glen Powell sees things through. Also, it would make his mother really happy.) He moved to LA with the kind of charmed introduction that must have felt like he was 10 minutes from stardom: Denzel Washington, who’d cast a teenage Powell in The Great Debaters, hooked him up with his agent, Ed Limato. At which point … Glen settled into a long, long period of rejection and disappointment. I heard he flunked auditions for Han Solo and Captain America? He pauses to dentally extract a particularly lengthy piece of lettuce. “Now, you’re talking about the big ones. But I also failed a lot of auditions for really bad jobs. Like, some bad roles.” So you had range? “Oh yeah, I had real range in my failure. I didn’t get cast in some really bad movies, too.”Things took a serious downward turn when Limato diedin 2010. Glen still remembers exactly where he was when he got the call that the agency was dropping him. “I knew that would be the beginning of a really tough road. You had a guy who was the top of the food chain, and he was really looking out for me. But when he died, and I got let go, I knew I was in for a scrappy little run.” On the plus side, those agents will be massively kicking themselves now? “Oh, I talk to some of them – they’re still friends of mine. But I do give them shit about it,” he confirms with a twinkle. “You have to.” But maybe not becoming famous in your 20s is good? “Oh man, I think it’s really good. Honestly.” We then have to pause for the extraction of a piece of lettuce so big it needs its own trailer.One thing Limato managed to do for Powell before he died was get him a job reading scripts for the late producer and writer Lynda Obst, responsible for movies from Sleepless in Seattle to Interstellar. He adored it. “It was a really cool thing. She was one of those really special producers. You know, Texans have this really weird thing – ”Sorry, wait – you’re from Texas?“Ha! I haven’t told anyone … Break the story that I’m Texan! But, listen, Texans really do take care of other Texans.” (Even honorary ones do – Obst was born in New York, but had made a home in Texas.) “She was a Longhorn! So I got to go and sit on the Sony lot and read scripts for her. I was the fastest reader by far. I did three scripts a day.”You’re not going to see me talk politics. But movies – that’s how I express myselfView image in fullscreenJacket: Brioni. Polo shirt: ZegnaFlash forward several years to Tom Cruise offering him a role in Top Gun: Maverick, and Glen is (a) broke, but (b) really knows what he needs from a script. And somewhat bizarrely, given (a), he almost didn’t take the part of Hangman, summoningthe confidence to push back against the original script until Cruise reconfigured his character’s place within in it. “But doing it that way was the greatest decision I ever made. It could have been me sitting on the sidelines, kicking my heels, thinking: ‘Man, I burned a few years.’ But it was the best film school. The fact that Tom is such a close friend now – when I got Running Man, he was literally my first call. I said: ‘Dude, you’ve been doing this for decades.’ He has picked up every trick in the book. And he’s so generous – I thought I was going to talk to him for 10 minutes. He stayed on the phone for two hours plus.”Give us a peek at the Tom Cruise trick-book, then. “He’s like: ‘Tell me some of the stunts you’re doing.’ I said: ‘OK, I’m jumping off exploding bridges, falling off roofs.’ He said: ‘Are you running at night?’ Yes. ‘OK, that means you’ll probably wrap at five in the morning. Don’t do any sprinting shots at five in the morning. Your body’s going to be out of whack and you’ll get hurt. They’re always going to do a wetdown at night.’” (A wetdown is when the crew hose down the ground both because the reflections look cooler in the dark, but also because it hides tyre skids or footprints or whatever for continuity.) “So Tom says: ‘That’s fine if you’re running straight. If you’re taking a corner, no.’”This is when meeting your heroes saves you a torn knee ligament. What else? “He goes: ‘If you’re hanging 11 storeys up, make sure people see how high you are. Make sure the shot reflects depth and dimension. You are selling the fact thatyouare doing these things.’”Something a lot people say, in these days of endless CGI, is that there’s a kind of empty feeling when you know it was all just done on green screen. It doesn’t really connect. Is this why Tom Cruise – and now you – want to do as many as possible of your own stunts? “Right. It really sells it because if the audience know that you are in peril, there is an inherent investment. I believe you have to give the audience their value in the ticket. If people are actively going to the theatre, getting a babysitter, maybe doing dinner, you’ve got to justify that ticket price. And that’s what Tom always talks about – you have to have skin on the line. If they’re showing up for you, you’ve got to show up for them.”But bingo cards at the ready, because the next movie Glen will shoot will be something he co-wrote with Judd Apatow in which he shows up as … a country singer. “I’ve always been so nervous to sing,” he admits. “I was obsessed with Elvis as a kid. And my little sister used to sell girl scout cookies, and there was a honeysuckle bush next to our house. And for everyone that bought one of her cookies, I gave them an Elvis song. But I couldn’t sing in front of them, so I hid behind the honeysuckle bush and sang.” Oh Glen. I think I just OD’d on Americana. Will Judd Apatow be providing you with a honeysuckle bush? “No! I have to do it in front of everyone.”It seems as good a time as any to say that I wonder if it’s hard being all-American in such a divided America? “Yeah,” he exhales. “I’m not a political person. I like things that bring people together.” Sure. But it feels like you’re the type of actor who wants to be for everyone, and that’s getting so much harder now there are fewer parts of culture enjoyed by both sides, as it were. Take something like late-night television, which back in the glory days of David Letterman was TV watched by everybody, of all political leanings, but is now perceived to be siloed for only one side. (And that’s what remains of late-night. Soon after this interview, Jimmy Kimmel wastemporarily yanked off air.) Maybe action movies are one of the last bastions of truly shared American culture?“That’s a good point. There’s a universal language of action, which is also why those movies translate so well internationally. Running Man is about something universal – what you would be willing to do for the people you love? But also how people can feel powerless in the face of a world that feels more and more unequal, more unfair. So, you’re not going to see me talk politics. But movies – that’s how I express myself. Movies are a conversation; politics always felt to me like two people trying to prove a point.”View image in fullscreenWith Sydney Sweeney at an Anyone But You premiere, 2023.Photograph: John Lamparski/ WireImageUnfortunately and undoubtedly, though, the erosion of shared mainstream culture makes that conversation smaller than it was. I say to Glen that it’s as if there are fewer and fewer people who everyone is permitted to like, no matter what “side” they’re on.The Rock’s one, and maybeTravis Kelce. He agrees. Of all the people coming up to big-time stardom in recent years, I would have picked him and Sydney Sweeney as having that kind of broad appeal. Except now, Sweeney’s beenmired in a raging culture war, after some people decided a denim advert in which she participated was … I can’t quite believe I’m typing this, but it is, after all, 2025 … eugenicist. Something to do with “good jeans” and “good genes”, apparently – but, please, don’t dig further. Every second spent on it would make you stupider.Put politely, I tell Glen, I thought this was bullshit. And yet, I don’t think people in the business came out to defend her. Is it because it’s just a relief that the firestorm isn’t happening to them at that moment? Or is it a form of cowardice? A pause. Not lettuce-related. “I think people weighed in on it,” he says of the Sweeney firestorm. I don’t, I say. I think she was left to twist in the wind. “But I think people are aware that it’s bullshit.” Yet they didn’t say that publicly. “Look, in an era in which businesses are evolving and are seeing their mortality in front of them, sometimes they are desperate to make anything run. Whether it’s true or not, whether it hurts anyone – there is no accountability any more.”View image in fullscreenCoat: BrioniI think he’s talking about the news media and how it operates in a digital age – because if you think Hollywood is past its heyday, then it’s got nothing on journalism. Back in the day, stars gave reflective, candid interviews, and those discussions sat relatively isolated in magazines and colour supplements or on evanescent episodes of celebrated talkshows. But these days, people want a news line or six out of an interview, and they want to put it in the headline, even though they know it’s going to get scraped and clipped from here to kingdom come by every clickbait news website out there, within moments of it dropping online.And this is why celebrities don’t want to say anything eye-catching in interviews any more. This is why we can’t have reflective things. Any star, any author, any musician – anyone in the entertainment business these days who sits down to an interview has one overwhelming goal: tonotmake news. I tell Glen I can see why people would never really want to offer an opinion, because then you’ve got three days of “Glen Powell Wades IntoSydney SweeneyDiscourse” headlines, and it’s a nightmare and a distraction and it gets in the way of the work you want to do. Is that what it feels like? Another pause.“The sad part is you do have to separate yourself,” he sighs. “You can’t get caught up in it – it has nothing to do with you, it has to do with ad dollars. And, you know, there is no course-correcting. If something’s false, you’re not actually setting the record straight, you’re just feeding the beast. That’s why I don’t say shit – just let it come, and let it go. Not feeding the beast and not trying to fight anything. I’ve realised the smart people in Hollywood don’t try to fight anything that has nothing to do with them.”And yet, when all eyes were on Jimmy Kimmel’s return after that controversial suspension, who should turn up as his very first guest? Why, I do believe it was Mr Glen Powell, bringing a smile and a care package of warm anecdotes, and declaring straight out of the gate that he was “honoured to be here”. And who should be pictured shortly thereafter at Sydney Sweeney’s space-themed birthday, wearing a hilariously cheap Nasa astronaut costume that I refuse to believe he didn’t buy on Amazon? Well, you get the point.Still, he must fear it’ll be his turn to be in the woodchipper for something one of these days? “Oh, it’s inevitable. It’s not an if, it’s when. It’s been an adjustment. I try to be honest, work really hard, and treat people well – that’s how I try to move through my life. Inevitably, you’re going to catch some strays. But that’s the nature of the job and I’ve watched it happen to other people.”Tangentially, it strikes me that “the job” has morphed beyond anything it was in the past. Remember whenMark Wahlberg’s routinedropped online, and it involved him getting up at 2.30am for the first of several workouts, as well having to incorporate meetings, prayer time, and the conflicting demands of family interaction andcryo-chamber recovery? Glen laughs. In the modern style, even he is capable of giving a detailed explanation of the type of physique required for Ben Richards, his character in The Running Man. “He works in a factory, he’s a guy whose body is like a tool. So I wanted him to be strong and durable – blue-collar strong, but not like he goes to a gym.” Needless to say, this requires a significant amount of time in the gym.I love acting. The exhausting part, the part that throws me, is when I’m in the real worldView image in fullscreenJacket: Louis Vuitton. Watch: OmegaIt must be weird – you get into this job because you like the feeling of acting, and the bit where you’re doing that specific thing ends up being a small fraction of your time, around all the meetings and photoshoots and endless workouts and whatnot. Perhaps this is why, for all his easy charm, Glen has flipped to finding movie sets the sane places of the world. “Do you know what’s hit me in the last little bit? I love acting. I love the process of bringing a team of people together and we all come together and make something really cool. I’m not exhausted by that – it’s fun. But the exhausting part, the part that throws me, is when I’m in the real world right now. On a movie set, you have your head down, you’re collaborating with people, it feels very ordinary. But the part that I’m getting used is this other thing.” Fame? “Yeah. I’m still figuring it out.”He has, at least, figured out how to shift a load of ketchup. As mentioned, the modern actor has to be very diversified. So, back in April, Powell launchedSmash Kitchen, a range of organic ketchups and mustards and mayonnaises, ideal for pairing with the great Texas cuisine of barbecue. It has already sold more than a million units in its first three months and is expanding at pace. As for where it’s sold? Walmart, obviously. Cheapest sauce in the range is under two dollars, nothing costs more than five. I mean, it’s too on the nose, and yet unavoidable – Glen Powell wants to be mass market, both as a movie star, and as a sauce mogul. “Sauce mogul! Sauce mogul! I have not heard that before …”Maybe the best thing success has brought him, apart from unlimited condiments, was the right to move back to Texas, and escape from LA. “When this town feels like Hollywood is happening here, there’s nothing better. And when it’s not, then … it’s a harder place to live. But I always wanted to go back to Texas. That’s where my family is, that’s where my friends are. I have friends here, but I can bring them back to Texas.” As he points out, it helps that Hollywood “decentralised overnight” in the pandemic, because of Zoom, self-taping, a general cultural shift. “It’s no longer a brick-and-mortar business.” It’s no longer a lot of things, but it’s great that Glen has conquered it sufficiently to be allowed to WFT (Work From Texas).Which about wraps us up, bar my minor panic that the interview has not, in fact, recorded. The problem, I tell him as I fiddle doubtfully with the recording device, is that I don’t do many interviews. In fact, I honestly don’t think I’ve done one for more than a decade. “That’s a long time! Who was it?” I think it was a politician called Nigel Farage. “Nigel Farage?” says Glen. “I haven’t heard of him.” Well, short answer, it’s just possible he’s going to be prime minister of the United Kingdom one of these days. So what this logically means, Glen Powell, is that in around 13 years you’re going to have to drop what you’re doing … “and be prime minister! Ha!”Listen, in a darkening world, we can only live in hope.The Running Man is in cinemas on 12 NovemberExplore more on these topicsGlen PowellAction and adventure filmsSydney SweeneyComedy filmsRomance filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The mystery of Prince Andrew’s moneyThe disgraced royal has lived in luxury for decades despite being an outcast and having no obvious means of financial supportRob EvansSat 25 Oct 2025 03.43 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 05.30 EDTShareIt is one of the mysteries of the modern monarchy – and one that is under more scrutiny than ever before.How on earth doesPrince Andrewfund his lifestyle?This is a man who has lived a life of luxury for decades, been an outcast for years because of his association with Jeffrey Epstein, yet has no visible means of financial support.Even King Charles is said to be unsure about some of the sources of his brother’s income, particularly how he finds the significant sums of money needed to afford the upkeep of his home, the30-room Royal Lodge.The disgraced prince has been able to keep his financial affairs from the public for years through a mixture of the traditional secrecy which envelops the Windsors and the confidentiality of his dealings with wealthy, mainly foreign, people.But the public furore over his alleged abuse of Virginia Giuffre may make it more difficult for him to justify the grandeur in which he has been living and to maintain the veil around his financial affairs.The outrage has puncturedthe usually suffocating consensus within Westminster in which politicians refrain from publicly criticising the royal family. Keir Starmer has said he favours proper scrutiny of the prince’s housing arrangements, and a committee ofsenior MPs has now requested more details. Among those speaking out this week was Robert Jenrick, the Tory shadow justice secretary, who said: “It’s about time Prince Andrew tookhimself off to live in private and makehis own way in life. He has disgraced himself, he has embarrassed the royal family time and again. The public are sick of him.”Andrew’s only current source of income that is declared is the pension he gets from his daysin the navy between 1979 and 2001. This is said to amount to £20,000 a year – hardly enough to buy chalet Helora, the lodge inSwitzerland that he acquired in 2014 for a reported£18m, nor to maintain the Royal Lodge, a Georgian mansion sitting in 40 hectares of secluded grounds in Windsor Great Park.View image in fullscreenChalet Helora in the Swiss resort of Verbier, which was bought by Prince Andrew in 2014.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesAndrew acquired the lease to the lodge in 2003 after making a one-off payment of £1m after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who had lived there until the year before she died. As part of the deal, he was required to spend £7.5m on refurbishing the property. Official records suggest hecompleted the bulk of the renovationby 2005. He pays no rent.The conditions of the lease require him to keep the mansion in good condition to avoid being evicted. Last year a newspaper report suggested the mansion needed repairing, with signs of peeling and black mould. The bill was an estimated £2m.He also faces a bill for his police security – reportedly £3m a year – after Charles stopped funding it.View image in fullscreenActivists from the anti-monarchy group Republic, protesting at the gates to Royal Lodge this week.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesPublic records show that the late queen’s second son received official payments from the public purse as a working royal between 1978 and 2010. In 2011, David Cameron, while prime minister, decided to change the way the monarchy was funded by taxpayers.As part of this change, Cameron, a self-described “passionate monarchist”, deliberately prevented the regular publication of how much public money Andrew and the other Windsors received. Camerondecried the “painful annual discussionon every aspect of royal expenditure, accompanied by a tabloid-led debate about whether individual members of the family were ‘good value for money’”.The last published figure for how much public money Andrew received is £249,000 a year in 2010. After that, the queen made direct payments to him from her own private wealth while he carried out royal engagements. In 2019, he was forced to stand down as a working royalas a result of his disastrous BBC interviewabout the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged abuse of Giuffre.Over the previous four decades, he had received nearly £13m to fund his royal work, according to an investigation by the Guardian in 2023as part of its cost of the crown series on the monarchy.After 2019 it appears the queen and Charles continued to give Andrew an annual allowance from the Windsors’ private wealth, believed to be £1m a year. But the king reportedly stopped paying this last year amid the “siege of Royal Lodge”. Charles has long wanted him to move into more modest accommodation.View image in fullscreenPrince Andrew (left) and the then Prince Charles attending the annual Order of the Garter service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in 2015.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/PAWhen Andrew retired from the navy in 2001, he enjoyed a measure of popularity as he was well regarded for his naval service, particularly fighting in the Falklands war.He could have lived on the income he was receiving from the public purse – at £249,000, a significant amount for ordinary Britons – and carry out good works as a diligent royal.But he wanted money – and lots of it.In 2001, he was appointed to be the government’s trade representative. Formally this job required him to travel abroad and help drum up business for British companies.But it has long been alleged that, on the side, Andrew exploited this post to gain access to wealthy people around the world and cut commercial deals to enrich himself, either by acting as a middleman or making introductions.The claim he faced was that he was using his public role for personal gain, or put more simply, corruption.Getting to the truth has been hindered by successive governments’ refusal to disclose documents that could help explain Andrew’s activities.Andrew Lownie, who wrote a book about the prince calledEntitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, submitted hundreds of freedom of information requests over four years but to no avail. “Itis clear that obstructions have been placed in front of Andrew. One has to ask why,” he has said.His relations with wealthy people appears to be largely transactional, particularly since his commercial acumen was seen as minimal.Lownie has cited Epstein as an example. “The prince was a useful idiot who gave him respectability and access to political leaders and business opportunities. What drew Andrew to Epstein? An opportunity to join the super rich and a lifestyle to which the duke had long aspired, a supply of available women, a chance to make money himself and someone who would bankroll his life … both men, ostensible friends, used each other but it was an unequal relationship.”Andrew was the subject of a series of controversies over his close links with unsavoury foreign dictators and businessmen. He took a holidaywith a Libyan gun smuggler, criticised aSerious Fraud Office investigation into corruption involvingthe arms giant BAE andlunched at Buckingham Palace with a leadingmember of the subsequently deposed Tunisian dictatorship.His dealings with the elite of Kazakhstan show a flavour of what he was up to. In 2007, he sold Sunninghill, a mansion near Ascot that had been a wedding present from the queen, to the son-in-law of the autocratic president of Kazakhstan for £3m over the £12m asking price. Andrew made regular official and private trips to the country.The mediareported the contents of emailsthat suggested Andrew worked for Greek and Swiss firms who were bidding for large contracts in Kazakhstan in 2011. It was Andrew’s job to help introduce the firms to senior Kazakh political figures. He was to have been paid a commission of 1%, or £3.85m, for helping broker a successful deal, according to the reports.How the British royal family hides its wealth from public scrutinyRead moreBy 2011 the stench around Andrew, then fourth in line to the throne, was too much for the government and he was forced to step down as the trade representative.Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and former minister who had called for his removal, said: “It is not before time – and there are quite a lot of people in the Foreign Office who will be very pleased too,even if they cannot say so.”The move followed the publication of the now notorious photograph of him with his arm around Guiffre and criticism that he was still consorting with Epstein after he had been convicted.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell posing for a photo, reportedly in 2001.Photograph: US district court – southern district/AFP/Getty ImagesEpstein had given £15,000 to Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, to reduce some of her debts. Like Andrew, Ferguson has faced long-standing criticism of seeking to use her royal status to make money.Andrew’s efforts to pull in millions have continued in recent years but have remained opaque. Glimpses are seen in court documents from time to time. Last year, it was revealed that Yang Tengbo, a business partner of the prince, was alleged to be a Chinese spy. The prince had authorised Tengbo to seek investors in China as part of a commercial initiative they were promoting.In 2022, Andrew faced calls to explain why he received at least £750,000 in payments linked to Selman Turk, a financier who was facingallegations of fraud in the high court. Andrew repaid the money.Another source of Andrew’s wealth will be investments in the shares of commercial companies but the value of these are unknown. The Guardian has revealed that the prince took advantage of agovernment-backed shell companythat wascreated to conceal royal investments from public scrutiny.Andrew would also probably have received bequests from relatives but details are hard to come by.What now for Andrew’s finances? If the furore dies down and he fades from public view, he may be freed up to make more money in the future, but he may also find it more difficult to capitalise on his now-ruined royal status.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Crisp, mahogany-red rashers of smoked streaky bacon are the food of the gods. Naturally rich in glutamates –umamicompounds that make food deeply savoury – it’s no wonder that the smell of sizzling bacon has such legendary allure.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As the name suggests, layers of fat are marbled through a rasher of streaky bacon, which comes from the lower belly of the pig. Fat holds flavour and distributes it through the meat, resulting in a full, long-lasting taste experience.I prefer dry-cured bacon to brine-cured – it has less water, meaning less shrinkage and, crucially, more flavour. A good dry cure gives the meat a deep red colour and an air-dried ham-like appearance. Thicker, juicier, brine-cured rashers work better in a classic bacon sandwich, because they offer substance, chew and bite (though they can still be crisped up by cooking them for longer). Thinner slices tend to crisp up quicker and more evenly. They’re still good in between bread, but are even better suited for topping a caesar salad or as a garnish.Having worked on a pig farm as a teenager, animal welfare is close to my heart.Pigs are highly intelligent animals, yet too oftenmistreated in industrial systems. I try to buy nothing less than free-range bacon, though it’s more pricey (I’ll put fewer rashers in my butty to save money, which is of course better for my waistline too), but it’s not always easy to find in supermarkets.RSPCA Assured, British “outdoor-bred” is the next best option, where pigs are born outdoors butfattened in sheds. The standards are far from perfect, but generally much higher than uncertified industrial pork. If you’d like to find out more, check out theRSPCAandCompassion in World Farming.As the authorMichael Pollan says, “You are what you eateats.” Meaning, the quality of an animal’s diet directly translates into the nutrition of the bacon, and the taste too. A diet of fortified soy and corn pellets – such as I used to haul around at the pig farm – lacks variety, whereas a pig that is fed a more diverse diet, and allowed to forage grass layers and root out hazelnuts, acorns and vegetables, can result in richer, more complex-tasting meat.You may have heard about nitrate-free bacon. Sodium nitrite is a preservative used in deli meats to extend shelf life, give bacon its familiar pink colour and enhance flavour. However, some studies link ahigh intake of processed meats containing nitrites to an increased risk of cancer, which is why moderation is advised. That hasn’t been easy with so many rashers to try for this test. Nitrite-free options have a more natural colouring and taste, but the ones I tried below scored really well all round.But enough about science and farming – let’s see how these rashers taste when they hit the pan.The best streaky baconBest overall:Waitrose No 1 British free-range beech smoked streaky baconView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 230g at Waitrose (£2.07/100g)★★★★☆Thick, large rashers with a pink tone and some caramelisation.

Made with British pork and smoked over oakwood chips. Contains both sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite. Red Tractor certified – which sadly means only that it hasbasic welfare standards. Some good points, but not outstanding.Exceptional by Asda dry-cured oak-smoked streaky baconView image in fullscreen£3.24 for 180g at Asda (£1.80/100g)★★☆☆☆Ironically unexceptional. Very thinly sliced with noticeable shrinkage during cooking, but they crisped up nicely with a light golden-caramel hue. A salty, classic flavour with subtle smokiness.

Contains sodium nitrite. A dependable, quintessential rasher.Bacon by Nature smoked streaky baconView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 200g at Ocado (£1.88/100g)★★★★☆Another Denhay brand with a thin rasher that caramelised well with a brown-pink hue as it’s nitrite-free and flavoured with mushroom extract.

Tastes like a real-life Frazzle: rich, smoky, and full of umami. Best used as a garnish or in a salad; perhaps too delicate for a sandwich. Made from British outdoor-bred pork. Contains sodium nitrate and potassium nitrite.Duchy Organic free-range British smoked streaky baconView image in fullscreen£5.50 for 184g at Waitrose (£2.99/100g)★★★★☆Medium-thick rashers with a deep red hue and golden edges. Powerfully smoky with a bold, distinctive flavour. A thicker, chewier rasher that works well in a sandwich. Made from organic British pork and smoked over cherry wood for an intense sweet aroma. Contains sodium nitrite.Helen Browning’s organic smoked streaky baconView image in fullscreen£6.95 for 184g at Ocado (£3.78/100g)★★★★☆Nicely caramelised with a golden colour. Impressive depth of colour and nitrite-free. Subtle, sweet smokiness that doesn’t overpower. Crisps up easily. Made from free-range organic pork from the UK and EU. Flavoured naturally with lemon and carob, and produced by Helen Browning, a respected figure in the organic farming movement and chief executive of the Soil Association, which makes this my best splurge.For more, read the food Filter’s guides to thebest supermarket free-range eggsand thebest supermarket coffeeExplore more on these topicsPorkThe FilterFoodMeatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At 9.30am on Sunday, four men arrived in a truck outside the Louvre in Paris, driving right up under a balcony and setting up a ladder with a furniture hoist. Two of them casually climbed up to the balcony and cut through the reinforced glass of a window; on the other side of the glass was the Apollo gallery, the most ornate and arguably the most beautiful room in the museum,Helen Piddhears. Using an angle grinder, they broke into cases holding France’s crown jewels, before escaping back down the ladder and disappearing on motorbikes.The audacious burglary of one of the most famous museums in the world has shocked France, especially because the jewels had been bought back for the nation after originally being sold, reports the Guardian’sPariscorrespondent,Angelique Chrisafis.The art detectiveArthur Brandhas spent his life hunting down stolen Picassos, artefacts and even Oscar Wilde’s ring.

In fact, the Black Swan started out as one, with Banks working behind the bar of his family’s pub before graduating to the kitchen. In 2023, he opened the Abbey Inn in Byland, and he has recently launched a hospitality arm dedicated to restoring other pubs across the UK. First up is the eight-bedroom General Tarleton in the village of Ferrensby, near Harrogate. Food, naturally, is top notch with polished takes on pub classics made with local produce (steak and Black Sheep ale pie; burgers made from Dexter beef from the Banks’ farm) – the perfect fuel for walks along the river and into the Nidd Gorge, a local beauty spot.Doubles from£175 B&B,generaltarletonferrensby.co.ukThe Bat and Ball, OxfordshireView image in fullscreenIt’s dogs by the fire and dog collars at the bar at this charming pub in the village ofCuddesdon, best known for its clergy college. It was opened at the start of the year by the owners of theLamb Innin nearby Little Milton, and the chefs at both outposts cut their teeth at two-Michelin-star Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons down the road. The Bat and Ball is the more casual of the pair – there’s even a dart board – and dishes take typical pub fare (sausage and mash; ham, egg and chips) and dial them up with carefully sourced local ingredients. The five bedrooms have walls painted in rich autumnal shades to match the surrounding countryside, which is sandwiched between the Cotswolds and Chilterns.Doubles from£140 B&B,batandballcuddesdon.co.ukKing’s Arms,Lake DistrictView image in fullscreenThis family-owned pub, which reopened at the end of August, is at the heart of the Lakeland village ofHawkshead, around the corner from the Beatrix Potter gallery and the Hawkshead Grammar School museum, where a young William Wordsworth carved his name into his desk. There’s plenty of history in the oak beams and slate floors at the King’s Arms too, which dates back to the 17th century. Behind the dark-wood panelled bar is a roster of local beers including Coniston Old Man Ale and Cumbrian Ales Loweswater Gold, while the food leans towards classic with Cumberland scotch eggs and beef wellington. Just the thing to be tucking into after a stomp up nearbyLatterbarrowfell.Doubles from £145 B&B,kingsarmshawkshead.comThe Wellington at Boscastle, CornwallView image in fullscreenKnown affectionately as The Welly, this centuries-old coaching inn overlooks Boscastle harbour on the rugged north Cornwall coast. St Austell Brewery recently splashed millions doing it up, and it shows in the cosy dining rooms, snugs and stained glass panelling. The pick of the bedrooms are the two in the pub’s turret with freestanding baths, but all 14 come with local art on the walls and OS maps and a South West Coast Path national trail book for walks. The path runs right outside: west to Tintagel Castle, birthplace of King Arthur according to legend, or round pastPentargon waterfalleastward. After a coastal hike, there’s pints of Proper Job by the fire (plump for the sofas in the Chart Room) and plates of fish and chips to look forward to, made with local catch in Gem Ale batter.Doubles from£145B&B,wellingtonhotelboscastle.comThe Woolpack Inn, HampshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jake EasthamFresh from a makeover by influential interior designer Nina Campbell, this country pub is the centre of life in the tiny hamlet of Totford in the tranquil Candover valley. It is surrounded by fields and woodlands, so head chef Luke Stradling has plenty of local produce to draw on – supplemented by the pub’s large kitchen garden, right now filled with pumpkin, celeriac and winter leaves. As well as supplying almost all the vegetables on the menu, the team also donates 20% of the harvest to local charities and homeless shelters. Upstairs, eight bedrooms are named after game birds, but it’s fly fishing that’s the local star draw – casting for trout in the world renowned chalk stream of the River Itchen.Doubles from£100 B&B,thewoolpackinn.co.ukThe Fleur de Lys, DorsetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dave WattsPub and restaurant firm Chickpea has nailed the modern country pubs with rooms formula – great food, friendly bar and keen prices for overnighters. The latest addition to the fold is the Fleur de Lys, a 17th-century inn in the village of Cranbourne. The novelist Thomas Hardy was a regular guest here and makes reference to it in Tess of the D’Urbervilles. The revamp reflects its period charm: hops hang over the large open fireplace, candles flicker on tables and, upstairs, the nine bedrooms are decorated in muted colours. Walking routes loop around Cranborne Estate, with dishes such as Brixham sea bass, venison barnsley chop and sticky toffee pudding to look forward to back at the pub afterwards.Doubles from£120 B&B,fleurdelyscranborne.co.ukThe Penny Bun, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jake EasthamNamed after a mushroom found in local woods, the Penny Bun is a departure from your traditional boozer. With its clay-plastered walls and palette of earthy browns, the look is more wabi-sabi minimalism than brass beer pumps. Between Ilkley and Otley in the Yorkshire Dales, the recently opened pub is part of the Denton Reserve, a 1,012-hectare (2,500-acre) estate undergoing a sustainably led transformation, shifting to carbon sequestering and regenerative farming. It provides many of the ingredients found on the menu at the Penny Bun, such as Tamworth pork croquette salad or gnocchi with roasted garden beetroots. The calming aesthetic particularly suits the five bedrooms (the plum one comes with a freestanding bath), with deep beds to sink into after walks across Ilkley Moor, right outside the front door.Doubles from£180room-only,pennybunilkley.co.ukThe Ship,NorfolkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Patricia TobinThis summer, Sisters Siobhan and Caitriona Peyton rebooted this historic coastal inn with nine beamed bedrooms in the village of Brancaster. The cooking here has a light Mediterranean touch, and while menus have one eye on the sea (less than a mile’s walk away), game from local estates is the star turn in autumn. For Sunday lunch expect whole pot-roasted venison shoulders served with local wild mushrooms instead of the usual chicken or beef, while in the front bar settle in by the fire and tuck into a mangalitza pork sausage roll or monkfish scampi with a pint of Moon Gazer Ale. Outside, Norfolk’s big skies look especially arresting at this time of year – look out for flocks of migrating pink-footed geese – and walks cut through dunes and salt marshes.Doubles from£145B&B,theshipbrancaster.ukThe Leicester Arms, KentView image in fullscreenAcross the road from the entrance to medieval Penshurst Place and Gardens, this Grade II-listed pub is looking prettier than ever after a £1.2m revamp last year. It’s easy to see why it scooped Kent’s county prize at the 2025 National Bar and Pub Awards: there are deep leather armchairs by the fire in the bar, real Kentish ales from nearbyLarkins, and cut-above cooking in the dining room. The menu focuses on local produce, with Kent lamb scotch egg and Whitstable oysters, while the 11 botanically named bedrooms are decorated in an attractive heritage style. Four of them come with rolltop baths for post-walk soaks after a ramble around the Penshurst Estate past the River Medway, lakes and giant oak trees.Doubles from£150B&B,theleicesterarmspenshurst.co.ukThe Swan,West SussexView image in fullscreenThe two-and-a-half year refurbishment of this Grade II-listed coaching inn in Fittleworth on the edge of the South Downs was worth the wait. Original features from its 14th-century roots mix with stylish comfort in the bar, restaurant and 12 beautifully designed rooms – though it remains “proudly old fashioned”, says owner Angus Davies. Meals served in the wood-panelled, painting-lined dining room draw on seasonal local produce (foraged ceps and fresh plum pudding on our visit) and lavish breakfasts are served in the barn in the pretty gardens. The old visitor books are fascinating: notable guests include JMW Turner, John Constable and Rudyard Kipling. There’s plenty to do nearby, from antique shopping in local villages to walks on the Downs,Petworth HouseandArundel castle.Doubles from £195B&B,swaninnfittleworth.comThe Nevill Arms, LeicestershireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clive Doyle PhotographyWith its honeyed hamlets, pretty market towns and rolling countryside, the Welland valley is in a part of the country sometimes referred to as the Notswolds (similar to the Cotswolds but without the price tag). The Nevill Arms in the village of Medbourne was revamped in 2023, with 10 bedrooms (some with four-poster beds) spread between the pub and its converted stables – and next year they’ll add a three-bedroom stone cottage next door too. On the food front, beef, pork and lamb are reared on the owner’s farm, while in the inky blue-painted bar there’s a rotating line up of Langton Brewery beers on tap – the most popular of which is an amber bitter,Inclined Plane, named after the canal lift at nearby Foxton Locks.Doubles from£155 B&B,nevillarms.co.ukNew Inn Yealand, LancashireView image in fullscreenYoung couple Ben and Lauren Sandiford took on the running of this seven-bedroom village inn in April. Ben brought his chef experience to the kitchen, which now turns out classy comfort food (shepherd’s pie with mash and ewe’s cheese crumb; beef and ale suet pudding) to be eaten in the beamed dining room beside the log burner. The bar is filled with a locals sipping on beers including Lancaster Blonde and Ruskin’s Best Bitter. Dogs and walking boots are welcome, and there are plenty of places to get those boots muddy nearby.RSPB Leighton Mossis within walking distance, or head for the coast at Morecambe Bay, part of the beautiful Arnside and Silverdale AONB.Doubles from£144 B&B,thenewinnyealand.co.ukThe Merry Harriers, SurreyView image in fullscreenThis popular pub in the Surrey Hills village of Hambledon, a few miles south of Guildford, was taken on by young gun publicans Sam Fiddian-Green and Alex Winch at the end of 2023. The pair, who grew up nearby, had earned their stripes in Michelin-star restaurants (Fiddian-Green as chef, Winch as restaurant manager and sommelier) and gave the Merry Harriers a suitably foodie injection, but not enough to scare away loyal locals (wisely they didn’t dispense with the Saturday meat raffle). Local ingredients – some from Fiddian-Green’s family farm in the Wintershall valley – are magicked up into bangers andcolcannonwith onion gravy or autumn-favourite pheasant schnitzel.

The George has had a few facelifts since then, most recently last year after storm damage, but its link to the famous novelist holds, especially in the Lady C Suite (one of 24 bedrooms), where it’s said Charlotte stayed.

It became the village pub in 1805, and remained so until chef Mark Poynton introduced “accessible” fine dining in 2020. With a new owner, but Poynton still at the helm in the kitchen, it reopened in July, with four bedrooms at the back. Tasting menus have been chosen to reduce kitchen waste (£35 for three courses, £55 for five, £85 for seven), with dishes such as monkfish crudo, and venison loin and haunch with star anise carrot. It’s a lovely three-mile stroll along the Cam to central Cambridge, or amble the other way to the thatched village of Horningsea for an ale at the Crown and Punchbowl.Doubles from£94room-only,ancientshepherds.comThe Gaskell Arms, ShropshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon Whaley Landscapes/AlamyThe medieval market town ofMuch Wenlockhas a fascinating claim to fame.

Wenlock’s Olympian Games still take place each year, and a trail tracing their history leads to the 17th-century Gaskell Arms, where opening day speeches were once held. The 14-bedroom pub was taken over by new owners this summer and it’s a fine spot to recover after other arduous endeavours – such as a hike up the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge – with pies and pints of Shropshire-brewedHobsons ale.Doubles from £92 B&B,gaskellarms.co.ukThe Royal Forest,LondonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nick SmithOn the edge of Epping Forest (a 10-minute walk from Chingford station), this blue-blooded pub is next door to the timber-framedQueen Elizabeth Hunting Lodge, built on Henry VIII’s orders in 1543. A few hundred years later, Queen Victoria stayed at what was then the Forest Hotel, giving the name the regal upgrade. The 28-bedroom landmark is now part of the fast-growing, Raymond Blanc-backed Heartwood Inns group, which reopened it last year with William Morris-style fabrics in the guestrooms, and sustainable-sourcing a priority for menus.

The pub itself is filled with motoring memorabilia (vintage tyre signs above the kitchen pass; the rear of a classic Mini emerging from the wall), while former Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons executive chef Luke Selby takes over the food at the estate in January, injecting his flavour to menus that already lean heavily on local ingredients such as meat from Bala butcher TJ Roberts and vegetables grown five minutes down the road.Doubles from£140B&B,thebryntirion.co.ukGlan Yr Afon/Riverside, Eryri/SnowdoniaView image in fullscreenPennal village.Photograph: Keith Morris Aerial Imagery/AlamyWhen Pennal’s village pub came up for sale in 2022, funds came from far and wide – including from Cardiff-born actor Matthew Rhys whose father had grown up nearby – to help the community to buy it.

Fortunately, after a few changes of hands (most recently to the Inn Collection Group, who gave it a refresh in 2023) the critique doesn’t stand today. While the Bull’s listed bar is still filled with artefacts from its 500-year history, the menu runs from sides of black pudding bonbons to rich lamb massaman curry.

How are teachers reacting?Jane ClintonandAlfie PackhamSat 25 Oct 2025 04.39 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 05.38 EDTShareAcross the UK, school pupils have beenshouting out the words “six-seven”during lessons in the latest meme-based craze to sweep through classrooms.While some teachers have chosen to stoically ignore the trend, others have embraced it. Five teachers explain how they’re coping.‘I thought I had said something rude’Back in September, I had been talking to my year 11 tutor group about preparing for their GCSE exams in June. I can’t remember exactly what it was in reference to, but I said something like “ … if you’re working to grades six, seven …” and the whole class burst out laughing. It took me completely by surprise.My first thought was that I’d made an allusion to something rude, or that they’d heard something in my accent that sounded funny. A bit exasperated – but genuinely curious and aware that they weren’t intending to be mean – I got them to explain. To be honest, the explanation they then gave didn’t make much difference – I still had no idea.‘What does it mean? No one knows’: six-seven meme invades UK classroomsRead moreWhat might have made it extra funny was the weighing-up gesture I had made while speaking. I have since found out that this often accompanies “six-seven”: I had intended it to help convey the act of me thinking aloud.In order to kill it off I try to mention it as much as I can. Nothing deflates a craze like this more emphatically than an adult trying to join in.James, secondary school teacher, north London‘If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno’Being aware of it helps so that you can avoid just blundering into statements like “well, there were 6, 7 million unemployed people in Germany in 1933”. If the number combination is unavoidable, having a rock-solid school behaviour policy and expectations on student conduct really helps, as you can sanction it as you would any other disruption, but I’ve not really had to do that. Policies are one thing, but if students buy into what the school is doing, they’ll be less distracted by the internet crazes (at least in lesson time).With six-seven, I haven’t lost any lesson time, other than for an occasional eyebrow raise and saying “yes, that’s a number, well done”. If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno. I treat it in the same way I would treat any other disruption.There was the 9 + 10 = 21 craze a while back, and there will no doubt be another craze after this. It’s what kids do. When I was growing up, it was doingKevin and Perryimpressions (admittedly out of the classroom).Children are unpredictable, and I think it’s an adult’s job to react in a way that redirects them back to the path that will get them where they need to go, which, fingers crossed, is coming out with qualifications rather than a behaviour list a mile long for the use of random numbers.Connor, 39, history teacher, London comprehensive‘They want to feel a part of a group’The children use it like a bonding chant in the playground: one says it and the others respond to show they are in the same group. It’s like a call-and-response or a football chant – an agreed language they share. I don’t think it has any particular meaning to them; they just know it’s a thing to say. Whatever the latest craze is, they want to feel part of it.It’s banned in my classroom, though – it’s a warning if they shout it out – just like any other shouting out is. It’s particularly tricky in maths lessons. But my class at year 5 are nine to 10-year-olds, so they’re quite accepting of the rules, whereas I understand that at secondary [school] it may be a different matter.I’ve been a teacher for 15 years, and these crazes last for three or four weeks. This craze will die out soon – they always do, especially once their younger siblings start saying it and it’s no longer cool. Then they’ll be on to the next thing.Jane, early 50s, primary school teacher, north-west England‘You just have to laugh with them’I started noticing it in August, while teaching English at a foreign language school. It was mostly boys saying it. I taught ages 12 to 18, and it was prevalent among the younger pupils. I had no idea what it was at the time, but I’m 24 years old and I realised it was just a meme similar to when I was at school.The crazes are constantly changing. “Skibidi toilet” was a popular meme back when I was at my training school, but it didn’t really exist as much in the classroom. Unlike “six-seven”, “skibidi toilet” was never written on the board in class, so students were less able to pick up on it.I just ignore it, or sometimes I will laugh with them if I accidentally say it, trying to empathise with them and understand that it is just pop culture. I think they just want to feel that sense of community and camaraderie.Harriet, 24, English teacher at a foreign language school, southern England‘Playfully shouting it means I rarely hear it now’I’ve done the job for 30 years and I’ve seen crazes come in and out of fashion, it’s just one of those things.The first time I heard it when I came back after the summer break, I said: “That’s exactly how many examples you need for the reading paper examples; well done!” That, combined with me playfully shouting it at the students (including hand signals), means I rarely hear it now.The students roll their eyes in an amused way, and you can tell by their faces they are thinking “for god’s sake”. Seeing a teacher old enough to be their grandfather [saying it] has put them off, as it puts the cringe factor up to 11.Paul, 54, secondary school teacher, Cheshire‘Part of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words’This meme-ification of a brain-rotty statement isn’t anything new. “Sigma”, “skibidi”, “cooked” are all examples of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words. The most striking thing for me with regard to “six-seven” is how widespread and globally recognised it is, at least in the anglophone world. At the risk of sounding already teacher-ish, I will say that back in my day, schools had their own local, homegrown slang.The children all end up seeing the same videos on social media, and with the ease of sending them to each other, they blow up – and fast. I think children today are far more globally connected with trends and popular culture. With the advent of short-form video, children are able to whiz through far more information, and access far more meme-able popular culture, than before. Combine that with the vastly popular culture exports of the US, and you end up with a “six-seven” around every corner.George, 26, trainee history teacher, LondonExplore more on these topicsTeachingInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She said she had been given “a clear mandate that members want their voice to be heard at the top of the party”.The Manchester Central MP won 54% of the vote, polling 87,407 votes, while Phillipson received 73,536. Turnout was just 16.6%, which someLabourinsiders say points to widespread disillusionment within the party.The result was announced on Saturday against the backdrop of Labour’scatastrophic byelection performance in Caerphilly. The party came third, behind Plaid Cymru and Reform, polling just 11% of the vote in a previously safe seat that had been held by Labour since the creation of the Welsh Senedd in 1999.Both Labour deputy leadership candidates spoke in favour of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, something believed to be unpopular with members.Speaking to the Guardian, Powell said: “I think we often feel like our members and elected representatives are something we need to stand against or not value. They are our strengths.“They connect us to the national conversation. Instead of just telling people what we want them to do, we need to respect, value and include them more, and recognise that debate is not division or dissent, and recognise you have to take people with you and hear from broader voices, not just a narrower group of voices.“They haven’t felt they have been included and connected as they should in recent months, and that’s what often happens when you go into government.“I’m going to really help to do that, to re-engage with the party, and make them feel part of the conversation again. I’ll do that through working with Keir [Starmer], working with government, working right across the party in the leadership roles that I will have.”Powell, who was sacked as Commons leader by Starmer in September, said she would get to work “straight away” to shore up Labour’s support before local elections next May. She said the party needed to be clearer about its successes in office.She said: “I’m not writing off any elections next year. These are important elections in Wales, in Scotland, in London, and right around the country.“I’m going to get to work straight away on how we can mobilise for these elections and how we can rebuild our voter coalition and recognise there is a progressive alliance in this country. We need to be the leaders of it and not out-Reform Reform because that just doesn’t work.“It’s not that long. I think we’ve got to seize back the agenda – we’ve ceded too much in recent months.“We’ve got loads of great things we’ve done, I think we can all agree on that, from giving workers more rights, to pay rises, to more hospital appointments, to free school meals, to breakfast clubs.“I think we just need to bring them all together in a stronger way – our agenda on how we are working in the interests of the many and not the few.”On Saturday evening the health secretary, Wes Streeting, compared the Caerphilly byelection result with the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, which left Starmer considering quitting as Labour leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And he used Hartlepool and the experience of Hartlepool to drive through the change in the Labour party necessary to make it electable and capable of winning a general election that no one thought we would win.“I have no doubt that, having done that before, Keir can do that again.”One ally of Phillipson, widely perceived as Downing Street’s favoured candidate, said it was “always going to be hard to assuage the anger of members, who have shown how unhappy they are through this result”.They added: “Bridget stood out of loyalty to Keir. She believed that standing was the right thing to do when it was clear no one else from cabinet was prepared to stand.”Starmer congratulated Powell on her victory. He said the Conservatives and Reform wanted to take Britain to a “dark place” – prompting one strategist to suggest he was leaning into a more progressive brand of politics.The prime minister referenced comments made by the Conservative MP Katie Lam, touted as a possible future party leader. She said she believed “a large number of people” living legally in the UK should have their right to stay revoked and be forced to “go home” in order to create a “culturally coherent group of people” in the UK.Starmer said: “Our job, whoever we are in this party, is to unite every single person in this country who is opposed to that politics, and to defeat it, once and for all.”Explore more on these topicsLucy PowellLabour party deputy leadershipLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The best outcome for you is to make contact directly with us by either calling 999 or reporting yourself to a police station.”He urged anyone “who sees him, knows where he is or has any information” to call 999 immediately, adding that police believe Kebatu “has access to funds, and critically, in both Chelmsford and London, sought assistance from members of the public, and has spoken to station staff”.1:32Met police appeal to Epping sex offender to hand himself in – videoIn an update on Saturday evening, the Met said officers had now confirmed that Kebatu was last seen shortly before 8pm on Friday evening in the Dalston area of Hackney.“He was still wearing his prison-issue grey tracksuit top and bottoms, but is now carrying his belongings in a distinctive white bag with pictures of avocados on it,” the Met said.“Additional officers have been deployed to the area to carry out further searches, but we are appealing for the help of local residents to report any sightings as soon as possible.”The 41-year-old was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre to be deported but was released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex by mistake, it has emerged.A delivery driver has described seeing Kebatu return to HMP Chelmsford in a “very confused” state “four or five times”, only to be turned away by prison staff and directed to the railway station.The driver, named only as Sim, told Sky News that he saw Kebatu come out of the prison saying “Where am I going? What am I doing?” and hanging around for about 1½ hours as he tried to find out where he should be going.He said that Kebatu knew that he should be deported but the prison staff were “basically sending him away” and saying to him: “Go, you’ve been released, you go.”The driver said: “He kept scratching his head and saying: ‘Where do I go, where do I go?’ The fourth or fifth time [he went into the reception] he was starting to get upset, he was getting stressed. I’m not sticking up for the guy, but in my eyes, he was trying to do the right thing.“He knew he was getting deported, but he didn’t know where he was going or how he should get there.”Kebatu appears to have been spotted later in Chelmsford town centre asking for assistance before getting on to a train to London.GraphicEssex police confirmed Kebatu was seen catching a train at Chelmsford railway station at 12.41pm on Friday. Met police confirmed he was seen getting off the train in Stratford in east London at about 1.10pm on Friday.As a result, the Met was handed responsibility for the investigation on Saturday morning, the force said.Conway had said earlier that finding Kebatu was a “top priority” for the Met.He added: “The manhunt is being led by an experienced senior investigating officer. He has teams from the specialist crime command with expertise in tracking down wanted people at his disposal, as well as other resources from across the Met.“We are examining CCTV from [Stratford] and farther afield, including on the transport network, to establish information about his subsequent movements.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place.According to the Telegraph, Kebatu was wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be released on licence and handed a £76 discharge grant.Foreigners underrepresented among prisoners in England and Wales, report findsRead moreOne prison source described the incident as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, and dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time.Aaron Stowe, the president of the Criminal Justice Workers’ Union (CJWU), called Kebatu’s mistaken release “a profound failure of duty”.He said: “The release of Hadush Kebatu is a betrayal of the victims, the community, and the principles of justice. We demand a full investigation and immediate reforms to ensure this never happens again.”Mike Rolfe, the CJWU’s general secretary, added: “The justice system is stretched to breaking point, the public’s confidence is collapsing, and those tasked with enforcing the law are left to pick up the pieces of political cowardice.”The father of Kebatu’s teenage victim told Sky News: “The justice system has let us down.”A report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons after an inspection in January and February 2024 said HMP Chelmsford faced “considerable pressures” because of “national capacity issues”, while suffering staff shortfalls in reception and the pre-release team.A spokesperson for the Prison Service said it had launched an investigation into the incident and was “urgently working” with police to return Kebatu to custody, adding in a statement: “Public protection is our top priority.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the release was “totally unacceptable” and that he was “appalled”.Annual government data for prisons shows that262 prisoners were released in errorin the year to March 2025, an increase of 128% on the previous year.Kebatu was found guilty of five offences last month after attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl twice, before sexually assaulting her, and sexually assaulting a woman and trying to kiss her too.He committed the offences just days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping. His case triggered protests outside the hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests.At his trial, the district judge Christopher Williams said Kebatu posed a “significant risk of reoffending”, was “manipulative”, and had acted “ignorantly and repulsively” towards the woman he had assaulted. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and had served just 31 days when he was released.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationImmigration and asylumMetropolitan policeLondonEnglandEssexnewsShareReuse this content"

A visual guideRead more“People are still really angry,” said Rosa Cerros, a 42-year-old public servant who took part with her husband and two young daughters.“Why weren’t people evacuated? Its incomprehensible,” she added.Mazón’s administration has been heavily criticised for not sending out flood alerts to mobile phones until 8.11pm on 29 October 2024, when flooding had already started in some places.That was more than 12 hours after the national weather agency had issued its highest alert level for torrential rains.People told Spanish media that by the time they received the alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets and pouring into their homes.The floods hit 78 municipalities, mostly in the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia, killing 229 people in the region. One body was found as recently as Tuesday.Despite the warning signs, Mazón went ahead with an hours-long lunch with a journalist on the day of the floods, also appearing in photos tweeted by his staff receiving a sustainable tourism certification.“Mazón wasn’t where he should have been that day, he wasn’t up to the task,” said another protester, Gonzalo Bosch, a 38-year-old accountant from Paiporta, one of the towns worst hit by the floods.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Carlos Mazon and his regional vice-president, Susana Camarero.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesDemonstrators held signs with messages calling on Mazón to resign or even be imprisoned as they made their way through the streets of Spain’s third-largest city.Under Spain’s highly decentralised system, disaster management is the regional administration’s responsibility.But Mazón, a member of the conservative Popular party (PP) which sits in opposition to the Socialist-led national government, has argued his administration did not have the information needed to warn people sooner.In a poll published earlier this month in the national daily El País, 71% of residents of Valencia said they felt Mazón should resign.Almost half of the people who died in last year’s catastrophic floods in Valencia were 70 or older, a fact highlighted by some protesters.They accuse the authorities of having failed to protect the region’s most vulnerable residents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the alarm sounded people had already drowned or were in real danger,” the 51-year-old social worker told AFP.“All those deaths were completely preventable,” she added.Campaigners have staged regular demonstrations against Mazón often on or near the monthly anniversaries of the disaster.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Valencia on the first anniversary of the floods.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe PP’s national leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has stood by Mazón despite his unpopularity because “he has no other choice”, Anton Losada, a politics professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela, told AFP.Mazón’s resignation would trigger early elections in Valencia, which would probably be “catastrophic” for the PP and Feijóo’s leadership, Losada told AFP.The party is hoping a successful reconstruction effort will help restore its standing, he added.A state memorial ceremony will take place on the first anniversary of the tragedy on Wednesday in Valencia, attended by King Felipe and the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.Explore more on these topicsSpainFloodingProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said he would “do it again tomorrow”.Bob Vylan ‘not regretful’ about IDF chant at Glastonbury: ‘I’d do it again tomorrow’Read moreBritish Airways told the PA Media that the podcast’s content breached its sponsorship policy.A spokesperson said: “Our sponsorship of the series has now been paused and the advert has been removed.“We’re grateful that this was brought to our attention, as the content clearly breaches our sponsorship policy in relation to politically sensitive or controversial subject matters.“We and our third-party media agency have processes in place to ensure these issues don’t occur and we’re investigating how this happened.”The rap duo had to postpone two gigs after the fallout from their Glastonbury performance – including a show in Manchester – after calls from MPs and Jewish community leaders.Bob Vylan was dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the members’ visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour.In the podcast, recorded on 1 October, when Theroux asked if Vylan stood by the chant and if he would do it again,he said: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again.“I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays. I’m not regretful of it at all, like the subsequent backlash that I’ve faced. It’s minimal.“It’s minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through. If that can be my contribution and if I can have my Palestinian friends and people that I meet from Palestine that have had to flee, that have lost members in double digits of their family and they can say: ‘Yo, your chant, I love it.’ Or it gave me a breath of fresh air or whatever.”He said that he did not want to overstate the importance of the chant. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?”Vylan’s Glastonbury set was livestreamed by the BBC, which faced criticism for not pulling the feed. It was foundto have broken its own editorial guidelinesover “harm and offence”.Explore more on these topicsBob VylanIsrael-Gaza warBritish AirwaysnewsShareReuse this content"

Heather Humphreys, a former cabinet minister who ran for the rulingFine Gaelparty, won 424,987 votes, or 29%, in a two-horse race. Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Jim Gavin, had dropped out of the campaign but his name remained on the ballot and he won 103,568, or 7%.Connolly’s triumph was marred by a turnout of 46% – low by Irish standards – and 213,738 spoiled or invalid votes, an unprecedented number that reflected frustration over the lack of choice. In some Dublin constituencies up to a fifth of votes were spoiled.The presidency is a largely ceremonial office but Connolly’s victory was a stinging rebuke to the centre-right government.Catherine Connolly: the outspoken leftwinger set to be Ireland’s next presidentRead moreAnger over a housing crisis and the cost of living, campaign blunders by Fine Gael and its ruling partner Fianna Fáil, rare unity among leftwing parties and deft use of social media combined to make Connolly asymbol of change.The prospect of Connolly succeeding President Michael D Higgins and serving a seven-year term at Áras an Uachtaráin, the presidential residence, thrills supporters. She wishes to ringfence Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism” and has accused the UK and US of enabling genocide in Gaza.The former clinical psychologist and barrister enthused young people through podcasts and posts that went viral on social media, including videos that showed her doingkeepy-uppy. Artists and musicians such as Kneecap and the Mary Wallopers endorsed her.Critics depicted Connolly as a radical who dodged awkward questions and could damage Ireland’s relations with Washington and with its European allies.Irish presidents traditionally played quiet, symbolic roles, but since 1990 Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and Higgins have turned the office into a more visible platform.Connolly said during the campaign that she would respect the limits of the office, which some interpreted as a tacit promise to rein in controversial views, but analysts predicted friction with the government.She was a marginal political figure when she declared her candidacy in July, and only small parties – the Social Democrats and People Before Profit – backed her. Labour then endorsed her, and Sinn Féin, which had decided to not run its own candidate, threw its formidable resources and electoral organisation behind Connolly.Celebrities such as Bob Geldof, Michael Flatley, Conor McGregor and others had expressed interest in running for president butfailed to win the political backingto get on the ballot.Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Gavin, was a political novicewho withdrewafter a financial scandal imploded his campaign.Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Humphreys. The border -county Presbyterian was deemed to have wholesome, mainstream appeal but performed badly in debates.Higgins, who has been president for 14 years, congratulated Connolly in a phone call. “The president-elect will have the full support of this office as she prepares for her inauguration next month,” he said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsIrelandFine GaelFianna FailEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.”Born in New York City in 1925, Lockhart was the daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart. She first appeared on the stage at just eight years old in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. Her first film appearance came in 1938’s A Christmas Carol, playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit.On Broadway, she starred in For Love or Money in 1947 and The Grand Prize in 1955. Her performance in For Love or Money earned her a special Tony award for outstanding performance by a newcomer in 1948.The actor began her television career in 1949 with guest appearances on programs such as Hallmark Hall of Fame, Shirley Temple’s Storybook, Wagon Train and Gunsmoke. Over nearly 80 years in entertainment, she continued to work steadily, appearing in shows such as Petticoat Junction, General Hospital, Beverly Hills 90210, The Beverly Hillbillies, Happy Days, Full House, Roseanne and Grey’s Anatomy.She achieved particular fame for her leading role on Lassie beginning in 1958. Then, from 1965 to 1968, she portrayed the matriarch of a family of space explorers in Lost in Space. Decades later, in 2021, she made a voice cameo in Netflix’s reboot of the same series.Speaking withNPRin 2004, Lockhart reflected on how the Lost in Space series had inspired viewers: “People would tell her that watching Lost in Space inspired them to become scientists. I did Lassie for six years, and I never had anybody come up to me and say: ‘It made me want to be a farmer.’”Lockhart received two Emmy nominations, including one for best actress in a leading role in a dramatic series, for Lassie. She was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film and one for television.In 1951, she married John F Maloney. The couple had two daughters, Anne and June Elizabeth, before divorcing in 1959.Funeral services will be held privately. The family has requested that, instead of sending flowers, donations be made to the Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog Inc.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The anxious period of stoppage time the home side endured was out of keeping with everything that had gone before.Brentford tend naturally to a direct approach anyway, but Arne Slot’s grumbling last week about Manchester United’s long balls was an open invitation. Liverpool never got to grips with the pace of Kevin Schade running in behind their back four, and they looked uncomfortable as well against Michael Kayode’s fusillade of long throws. Every side now knows that Liverpool are vulnerable to balls played in behind their full-backs. The opening goal, scored after five minutes, stemmed from a Kayode throw, but that was the result of Giorgi Mamardashvili mopping up as Schade chased behind Conor Bradley. It was already the second time he had done so.Arne Slot admits Liverpool’s Brentford defeat among his worst as losing run goes onRead moreSome long throw specialists rely on power, the body contorted to become a grunting trebuchet, but just as the fastest bowlers or the golfers who drive the ball furthest tend to be the most graceful, so Kayode seems to generate his distance with rhythm. There is a lithe fluidity to his run-up and release, the trajectory oddly flat, more metal wood than seven iron. Some long throws are dangerous because they drop so slowly that it’s difficult for defenders to achieve distance with a clearing header, but not Kayode’s. His deliveries scud on a low parabola, a more accurate version of a cross from the same position. Kristoffer Ajer flicked on and Dango Ouattara smashed in a falling volley with Liverpool’s defence apparently mesmerised.It was Schade’s pace that brought the second on the stroke of half-time. Hugo Ekitiké lost possession and Mikkel Damsgaard, who would twice be denied by spectacular saves from Mamardashvili, opened Liverpool up with a typically incisive through-ball, Ibrahima Konaté effectively giving up the chase before Schade beat the keeper.Full-back has been a problem position for Liverpool this season, especially on the left where Milos Kerkez looks nothing like the thrusting player he did at Bournemouth last season. He wasted possession repeatedly, confidence fraying, as well as collecting a needless booking, but he did slam in a low Bradley cross deep in first-half stoppage time.Brentford’s players and fans protested about how long the half had been allowed to go on for – too long, it turned out, for the referee Simon Hooper who had to be replaced for the second period. But if their fear was that the goal had offered Liverpool a lifeline, it was misplaced. The home side continued to dominate and extended the lead when a foul given for Virgil van Dijk’s kick on Ouattara was deemed to have taken place inside the box. Igor Thiago converted the penalty.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade leaves Ibrahima Konaté in his wake to make it 2-0.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesSlot responded with a flurry of substitutions, most of them forwards.By the 70th minute, Liverpool were playing a sort of 4-1-5, with Florian Wirtz and Federico Chiesa as shuttling inside forwards. Chiesa has now played more league minutes this season than he did in the entirety of last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has not been as bad as some have made out but, equally, when a player arrives for £116m there is always going to be expectation, and when he is a forward who fails to score or register an assist in his first eight league games, that is transformed into pressure. Back in the middle for the first time in the league since the 1-0 win over Burnley in mid-September, he looked visibly tense and, when a chance fell his way midway through the first half, he snatched at it. But he is not the only one out of sorts.Mohamed Salah had barely been involved when he gathered Dominik Szoboszlai’s cross with a fine first touch and lashed a shot in off the underside of the bar with a minute remaining.Even that seemed to come from nothing, the result of a moment of Brentford carelessness rather than of concerted Liverpool pressure.There were understandable nerves as the line approached, but despite another extended period of stoppage time, and a corner given for Caoimhín Kelleher wasting time, Brentford finished as they had been throughout: by far the superior side.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

AReform UKspokesperson said the committee meeting was cancelled because it was not quorate.View image in fullscreenLinden Kemkaran, the leader of Kent county council, with Nigel Farage in July.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAKemkaran may have been able to mute her critics in the testy online meeting, but in the real world her detractors may not be so easy to dismiss and moves against her authority have already begun.The Guardian has also learned that Kemkaran failed to ensure that her register of interests listed the fact that her husband is the director of digital transformation at East Kent’s health authority.The omission from her declaration of interests was only corrected at the end of September after it was highlighted by an official. Kemkaran refused to take responsibility for the omission, with a Reform spokesperson referring to a statement by council officials blaming an “administrative oversight”.This late amendment has not washed with opposition politicians, who are calling for her to resign. Kent county council has key connections with the NHS through a range of partnerships.Mark Ellis, the chief whip for the Liberal Democrats on the council, said: “It is surprising in the extreme that Ms Kemkaran did not declare her husband’s senior role in the NHS until four months after her election, and after a concern was raised by a member of our integrated care board.“She is putting party interest ahead of the public, using grossly unprofessional language towards her own colleagues, and losing a number of councillors in just six months.”A council spokesperson blamed an “administrative oversight” for the omission, saying Kemkaran had raised the employment situation during her induction “but through no fault on her part, it wasn’t recorded on the system”. The Lib Dems say this is not right and that all councillors know it is their responsibility to fill in forms correctly.Kemkaran’s attempts to exert control over Reform councillors after the suspensions, by asking for her group to sign an “oath of loyalty” to her, also appear to stalling. After 57 Reform councillors were elected earlier this year, numbers are down to 50 after the four suspensions, two others and a defection by one councillor to the UK Independence party.One source in the Reform group said that by Wednesday night Kemkaran only had 37 signatories to her loyalty pledge. The remainder were said to be waiting for the findings of a disciplinary panel into the conduct of Thomas and Fothergill, along with Bill Barrett and Oliver Bradshaw. A fifth councillor, Robert Ford, who was suspended last week for alleged lewd behaviour, is still awaiting his panel outcome.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage, centre, councillor Brian Collins, left, and Linden Kemkaran, right, with other members of Kent county council during a visit by the Reform leader in July.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyMeanwhile, the day-to-day business of running what is England’s second largest council by population does not stop.The clock is ticking on the two major challenges facing Kemkaran and her team: one is local government changes driven from Whitehall that could ultimately lead to the dissolution of Kent county council. The other is Kent’s need to meet its statutory obligations to balance its £2.5bn annual budget.A central government recalculation on council tax could means Kent is among the local authorities with extra wriggle room in the coming years. Even so, a senior member of Reform’s Kent teamlet slip earlier this monththat rates may have to rise by the maximum of 5%.This would fly in the face of the promises to actually cut council tax that appeared on Reform leaflets during the local elections. Quite whether the voters of Kent will be willing, in the words of the council leader, to “suck it up” remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageKentThe far rightEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But even Trump painted a dire picture of the South American country’s stagnating economy last week, telling reporters: “Argentina is fighting for its life … They are dying.”Trump has warned he could axe the aid package if Milei fares poorly in Sunday’s vote, when half of the seats in the 257-member lower house are up for grabs as well as 24 seats in the 72-member senate. “If he doesn’t win, we’re gone,” Trump said last week while hosting Milei at the White House.Trump’s apparent attempt to influence Argentine voters is not his first intervention in South American politics this year. Starting in July, the US president set about trying to derail the trial of his far-right ally, the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions against Brazil and its officials. But that campaign failed, boosting the political fortunes of Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, while also failing to save Bolsonaro from a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup.In Argentina, Milei’s political opponents also predict Trump’s manoeuvres will backfire.View image in fullscreenJavier walks among supporters during his arrival at a campaign rally  in Rosario on Thursday.Photograph: Tomás Cuesta/Getty ImagesItai Hagman, an economist and Peronist seeking re-election to the lower house in Buenos Aires on Sunday, accused Trump of trying to “extort” Argentine voters with his threat to withdraw his rescue package.“It is a clear interference in the internal affairs of another country,” said Hagman. “The Argentine people [will] … defend their sovereignty and their democracy. They will not vote based on what the president of another country tells them, but on their own interests and will.”Hagman called Sunday’s elections a referendum on “a libertarian anarcho-capitalist experiment” that was “causing brutal economic and social suffering” with its severe austerity measures and had “decided to delegate economic management to officials from another country”.Milei allies are asking voters to be patient. “We cannot solve all the problems that the country has had for 100 years in two years,” said Gonzalo Roca, Freedom Advance’s main congressional candidate in Córdoba. He insisted the country was “on the right path”, but admitted Milei’s blueprint required “effort and sacrifice”.Gustavo Córdoba, a political analyst and the co-director of the consultancy Zuban Córdoba, predicted voters would “punish Milei for their economic hardship” with his polling showing that 60% of Argentinians could not make ends meet.Benjamin Gedan, the director of the Latin America programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said public dissatisfaction had been building since earlier this year among voters who had been promised “a period of shared prosperity” if they endured Milei’s structural adjustment.“That really hasn’t materialised,” Gedan added, pointing to a growing sense among Argentininians “that prosperity is around the corner – and always will be”.Gedan believed Milei faced a crunch moment this weekend. He said:“If he does very badly you could have a real economic and financial crisis and another run on the peso.”Gedan said a “muddled” result was more likely, which would allow Milei to claim some success in increasing his party’s representation in congress and enable him to see out the remaining half of his four-year term but make it “really difficult for him to continue transforming Argentina in any sustainable way”.Argentina’s president, according to Gedan, had enjoyed a long honeymoon despite his politically damaging budget cuts.“There weren’t tremendous public protests. He wasn’t beset by national strikes at union activism … But inevitably his political honeymoon would end: his was longer than that of many of his peers’ – especially given the shock therapy he was imposing. But it couldn’t last for ever.”Explore more on these topicsJavier MileiArgentinaTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They feel if they can march through our borough with impunity, they can go anywhere. For them, it’s like Wembley (stadium), it’s the ultimate goal,” said Glyn Robbins, co-founder of United East End, an anti-far right coalition of community organisations.In the East End, the historically working-class neighbourhoods in the shadow of the City of London, there’s a feeling that history is repeating itself. It was 89 years ago this month that local people, many of them British Jews, drove out Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirt militia from Whitechapel in the East End, in what has become known as theBattle of Cable Street.In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the East End. In 2025, communities are fighting back against the hard right yet again.View image in fullscreenThe Brick Lane curry festival in September to celebrate East London’s history of migration.Photograph: Kois Miah/Tower Hamlets CouncilThis week, rather than attempting to escort protesters, as they had in Mosley’s day, London’s police stopped the hard right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a “crusade on Whitechapel” in the borough of Tower Hamlets, where 40% of the population is Muslim and 14% were born in the EU. TheMetropolitan police said the ban was to prevent “serious disorder.”It comes weeks after Tower Hamlets council passed a motion that said flags were “important emblems of patriotism and pride”, but condemned “outside far-right agitators … attempting to import division into our borough,” particularly on the Isle of Dogs, where the far-right BNP won a council seat back in 1993.Furious far-right influencer Tommy Robinson tweeted the photographs of nine British Muslim councillors to his 1.7 million followers, saying: “Here’s a list of the names and faces of Tower Hamlets council for some perspective.”The government’s decision to place asylum seekers at Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf, Tower Hamlets has attracted intense anti-migrant protest since the summer, including from a group called the Pink Ladies who say they are concerned about safety.While this weekend’s Ukip march has been stopped, counter-protesters still plan to gather in Whitechapel on Saturday. Dave Rosenberg, who has run walking tours through the East End since 2007, including on local anti-fascist history, will be among them.“I think we owe it to our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents to continue that struggle in the East End,” said Rosenberg, 67.View image in fullscreenDave Rosenberg.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFor Rosenberg, the ban on the march was a “double-edged sword” – “a relief to the most targeted communities”, but also “giving wider and wider powers to police to say who can demonstrate and where”.“There’s a very direct parallel with the 1930s,” he said. In 1936, the Public Order Act was introduced to inhibit Mosley’s British Union of Fascists. Mosley’s wasn’t the first anti-immigrant movement to target the area – back in 1901,the British Brothers’ League (BBL)launched itself with a 1,000-strong rally in the East End, with the slogan “England for the English” and targeting Russian and Polish Jewish migrants.View image in fullscreenA pedestrian crossing near the Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersFor Rosenberg, the repeated battle against the far right in the East End reflects two different visions of working-class life – one diverse, the other homogenous.“It’s this sense that those organisations have had, from BBL to Ukip today, that this is ‘our territory’… and people are invaders and encroaching in our territory,” Rosenberg said.Last week, Safia Jama, the 47-year-old CEO of the charity Women’s Inclusive Team, was chairing a Stand Up to Racism meeting when it was disrupted by rightwing protesters.View image in fullscreenSafia Jama.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“I did not feel safe. I never ran out of somewhere so quickly,” she said. When she was a young girl, her father was attacked in Tower Hamlets and left disabled as a result.The community has seen “huge achievements” since: Brick Lane and Spitalfields have experienced profound regeneration – and gentrification – and Canary Wharf is a leading financial centre.While 62.7% of all residents in employment are in managerial or professional occupations, the borough has the highest rate of child poverty in the country, with about 27,000 people on the housing list, and about 15,000 people in overcrowded homes. With a median age of 30, it isthe youngest borough in England and Wales, as well as one of the UK’s most socially and ethnically diverse areas.“This is our home. We’ve made it our home,” Jama said. “We’ve invested tears, sweat, blood, whatever it might be, we’ve really worked hard to create an environment that is beautiful.”But for months, tensions have been simmering in Tower Hamlets, as rightwingers have made its diversity the centre of a culture war.View image in fullscreenAnti-fascist protest in Tower Hamlets in August.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe latest escalation began in February, when Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe tweeted about dual language signs in English and Bengali at Whitechapel tube station.“This is London,” he wrote. “The station name should be in English, and in English only.” Elon Musk replied: “Yes”.By June, Robinson was complaining about bilingual children in Whitechapel, adding “a district once synonymous withJack the Ripperand theKray twinsand home to the nation’s true cockneys, now this.”Lutfur Rahman, Tower Hamlets’ British Bengali mayor, described the online attack as “despicable”. Rahman has defied controversies to lead the borough repeatedly since 2008, with progressive social policies.All primary and secondary schoolchildren enjoy free school meals, the borough provides university bursaries and the education maintenance allowance for working-class teenagers and is investing, the leadership says, £700m in council homes, funded by “taxing wealth, and high business rates for big business”.Rahman said: “In the late 1980s and early 90s, parts of the borough were no-go areas for people of colour. Since then successive leaders have invested in the people of the borough – and it’s worked well for us. We have over 300,000 people, we don’t want anyone to feel left out.“Now, 90% of our residents say they get one with each other. I grew up in this borough, our white neighbours helped my mother, helped me when my father went to work. My mum couldn’t speak English, it was our neighbours, the community spirit of the East End, that got us through those difficult days in the 70s and 80s.”In September, the borough hosted a festival to celebrate this legacy, in a direct response to Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rally in central London. New dual language signs were unveiled on the town hall – the restored former Royal London hospital – a snub to Lowe and Musk.Pearly kings and queens, a steel band, Celtic dancers, klezmer musicians, Bengali, Somali and Chinese acts performed and told stories of the East End through the ages, while a curry festival took place on Brick Lane, events attracting 25,000 people over two days.“The truth is, in the midst of all rancour and in the midst of all uncertainty, there is hope,” said Rev James Olanipekun, co-chair of the Tower Hamlets interfaith forum. “We are united and we are together.”View image in fullscreenJames Olanipekun.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianLiving in the borough has not been without incident for Olanipekun. Once, a brick was thrown at his wife’s car. “I didn’t look at it, I said nothing. After all, I was insured,” he said with a laugh.“Racism has a long history and Tower Hamlets, we’ve had a particular variant of it,” Robbins, a university lecturer who has seen off numerous far-right marches since United East End was created in 2010. “(But) now, what they’re saying is being echoed by the government, or the government in-waiting.”Explore more on these topicsFar rightOswald MosleyLondonEnglandUK Independence party (Ukip)featuresShareReuse this content"

It was December 2020, I was 27 and living on my own in south-west London after coming out of a three-year relationship with a man who was nice but wasn’t right for me.My type was basically men who were taller than me (I’m 6 foot). I’d been on a few dates with a lovely man who worked as a debt collector but I wasn’t feeling it. One night I thought to myself, I can’t date men any more. I’d always been interested in dating people other than men so I thought, why don’t I try now, and changed my Hinge settings to women. All expectations of what I wanted went out of the window. I just started swiping.The moment I knew: he was so open and vulnerable, even as a bloke’s blokeRead moreThe first person I matched with was Nic – an Australian speech pathologist who used they/them pronouns, played rugby and had been living in London for three years. I remember getting to the door of the pub for our first date and thinking, “Oh God, what have I done?” I was wearing leggings and a baggy jumper and hadn’t really stopped to think about what I was wearing or the fact that I was about to go on a date. Fight or flight was my state at the time.Nic walked in wearing a chequered shirt and a long camel jacket and I remember thinking they looked really cool – but it was the Aussie accent that sold me. I was so nervous I didn’t take my coat off. I just bombarded Nic with a million questions and excused myself after less than two hours because I’d arranged to go for a roast dinner with my parents. We gave each other an awkward hug and I phoned a friend to tell her the date had been a disaster.Nic and I shared a few messages after that but I bumped into my ex a few days later and it threw me so much I stopped replying. After a few weeks I told friends I wished I hadn’t ghosted Nic and they encouraged me to send a follow-up. Nic didn’t reply, which was fair enough. I figured I had nothing to lose so eventually sent a third message saying how sorry I was. Nic eventually agreed to meet.View image in fullscreenThe couple at a Mardi Gras event in Sydney – Gemma’s first Mardi Gras experienceThen I got sick with Covid, which was a disaster. It was January 2021, the depths of winter, so once I was feeling better I invited Nic to come and sit at a social distance outside my flat. I was a lot more comfortable and confident this time, and we ended up sitting outside for three hours, talking non-stop despite the hypothermia conditions. I had a friend staying with me and she spent half the date with her ear pressed up to the window trying to listen in.Things moved quickly after that. About a month in I was tidying my room after Nic stayed over and realised they’d left their Vegemite pyjamas under the pillow. I texted Nic to let them know. Nic replied saying it wasn’t an accident; they’d meant to leave the pyjamas there. This incredible feeling washed over me, like butterflies. I knew it was love – a love I’d never felt before. A forever kind of love. I got very drunk that weekend and tried to say it out loud but it didn’t come out right. When I did eventually say it properly, Nic left me in a six-week limbo before saying it back.Nic’s hesitance was probably because they were due to move back to Australia in a few months. Nic had never hidden that fact from me and said they hadn’t been in the market for a serious relationship – they’d said yes to that second date because they were intrigued. I remember being quite bold quite early on into dating and asking Nic over message whether, if they met the right person, they’d consider taking that person back to Australia. Nic said something about not wanting to get too involved or hurt one another – but it was too late. I was already all in.View image in fullscreenGemma and Nic with their cavoodle Billie“What am I going to do when you leave?” I asked Nic on Bournemouth pier during our first weekend away together. “Come with me,” was Nic’s response. That was it, really. Within weeks I had a flight booked.Nic moved to Sydney that September – two months ahead of me, which was horrendous. I moved out that November and, aside from a couple of what-have-I-done moments when I didn’t have a job in my first month, we haven’t looked back. Since then we’ve married, bought our first flat in Sydney’s inner west and acquired our cavoodle, Billie, who is the centre of our lives. I miss home, of course, but we’ve built a better life here than either of us could have imagined.I have no idea where we’ll be in a few years’ time. We’d love to start a family and live on the coast somewhere. But I don’t mind where we end up as long as we’re together. We are family now. Nic says they felt that change much earlier in our relationship but for me the shift since getting married has been seismic.Before I met Nic, it was hard to imagine finding anyone – I never thought I was good enough. Then Nic came out of nowhere and three years later here we are.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

I love peeking into kitchens and observing the daily habits and techniques of local cooks, which always include some new-to-me gadgets or implements less common in the United States. After my first trip to France, for example, I convinced myself I needed a Nespresso machine and a breadboard for morning tartines and coffee. The habit stuck.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Nowadays, if I am shopping for souvenirs, I’m likely browsing the shelves at a local culinary store to see what I can tuck into my luggage, or I am taking mental notes for what to search for when I get back home. But you don’t need to leave the country to find inspiration or get your hands on some genius culinary tools that many Americans haven’t yet embraced. Here are some of my favorites and why chefs around the world find them indispensable.All prices current at the time of publication.Terracottacazuela (Spain)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$59 at La TiendaFrom pintxo and tapas bars to more elaborate restaurants, the fairly inexpensive and very versatileterracotta cazuelais one of the most commonly used vessels I saw inSpain’s restaurants. “I mostly use it for recipes that need gentle, consistent heat–like albóndigas en salsa, fabes con almejas, or even gambas al ajillo,” says Guillermo Varela de Limia Muñoz, chef atCooking From Spain.It can go from stovetop and oven directly to the table, and comes in a multitude of sizes. Grab a handful of petite ones for serving olives, nuts or condiments, medium ones for appetizers, or larger ones for making stews and casseroles, or simply serving as a tray for chips during a party.Crepepan (France)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$50.47 at AmazonWe love crepes in our house, so I lugged a large aluminum Tefal crepe pan purchased from aFrench supermarketback to the states in my suitcase. “The flatness of the pan will ensure even cooking, and also allows for the use of a râteau (like a tiny wooden rake) to spread your crêpes and galettes like a pro,” says Omid Tavallai, the owner of Paris-based purveyorEmperor Norton. “It may be a specialty pan, but it’s also extremely flat, so it won’t take too much storage space in the kitchen.”It’s no one-trick pony either; the large surface can be used as a griddle for pancakes and bacon or as a comal for heating tortillas. The induction-ready pan I bought isn’t available in the US market, but I have used thisTefal Elegance panmany times at my mother-in-law’s house on a gas hob with consistently excellent results. And because it’s nonstick, a quick hand wash with warm, soapy water is all it takes to get clean.Nakiriknife (Japan)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The GuardianThis versatile Japanese chef’s knife has lasted longer than some of my relationshipsRead more$163.95 at Shun$163.95 at Williams SonomaThere is aJapaneseknife for every task, and for cutting vegetables it’s a Nakiri. “The way we cut ingredients directly affects how they feel when eaten,” says Shota Nakajima, Top Chef finalist and owner of Seattle-based restaurantsTakuandKobo. “Slicing through the fibers rather than tearing or crushing them keeps vegetables crisp, helps them absorb seasoning evenly, and brings out a more delicate mouthfeel.”Built like a miniature cleaver, its flat edge ensures full contact with the cutting board, making it perfect for straight-down, clean cuts without requiring a rocking motion (unlike western chef’s knives). ThePremier Nakiri from Shunis made of 68 layers of stainless Damascus steel cladding, making it extra durable and resistant to corrosion. A full-tang blade and finished Pakkawood handle ensure optimal control, whether you’re slicing tomatoes, julienning carrots, or creating thin sheets of daikon or cucumber using a katsuramuki cut.Stainlesssteelchopsticks (Korea)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$4 at Crate & BarrelI grew up using the long, plastic chopsticks commonly found atChinese restaurants, or Japanese lacquered wood chopsticks, which require careful hand-washing and drying. In Korea, metal chopsticks are more common, as they were originally used by royals and were eventually embraced by the general public. “Metal chopsticks are less porous than wood chopsticks and don’t absorb bacteria,” says SuYeon Lee, owner ofPalace Cooking, a Korean cooking school in Seoul. “It’s considered more hygienic since communal eating is central to Korean culture.”Since they are sturdy and easier to keep clean, I sought out a set immediately. While it is challenging to find flat stainless chopsticks in the US like those commonly seen in Seoul, the squarish shape ofthis pairis easier to handle for most people. High-quality stainless steel makes them dishwasher safe, ensuring that they will make it through the wash unscathed and sparkling clean.Electrickettle (UK)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$150 at Saki$150 at AmazonAccording to myBritish friends, microwaving water for tea is a mortal sin – they insisted I needed an electric kettle. “The only way to prepare good tea is by pouring water at the correct temperature onto the loose leaves or teabag,” saysJane Pettigrew, a tea historian and the director of studies of theUK Tea Academy. “A well-designed, reliable, temperature-controlled kettle can be set to reach the most suitable temperature for each chosen tea.”Enter theSaki Luna Kettle Pro, with its sleek, modern design and stainless steel interior. This model checks all the boxes, with a variable temperature control and seven presets that come in handy when you’re switching between hot beverages. Additionally, you can toggle the digital display between celsius and fahrenheit, depending on your preference. I use this kettle daily, for makingpour-over coffee, tea, and heating water to add when cooking, so I don’t drop the temperature of what is already in the pot.Tortillapress (Mexico)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$95 at MasiendaI watchedstreet taco vendorsin Puerto Vallarta and Ensenada churn out little corn tortillas to order, and I decided I needed to up my tortilla game at home. “A metal tortilla press is always the best, the heavier the better,” advises Fátima Juárez, chef and co-owner ofKomalin Los Angeles. “The heavy weight will help with even distribution when pressing the masa flat into your desired thickness.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you have a gas stove or barbecue grill, you can also pick up aMasienda x Made In Comalto cook up to four taco-sized tortillas at a time.Mokapot (Italy)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$64.99 at Macy’s$64.99 at AmazonIf you appreciate a simple but bold cup ofcoffee, you may understand why themoka potis a fixture in manyItalian homes. “It produces a coffee that satisfies Italy’s espresso-loving palate,” says Alberto Polojac,Bloom Coffee School’s director and the 2018 winner of the Professional Moka Challenge. “In many ways, it bridges the gap between home brewing and the espresso bar, bringing a taste of the Italian cafe ritual into the kitchen.”Its compact design makes it easy to store in a kitchen lacking in storage space, and it requires no special expertise to use. Just fill the bottom chamber with water, add grounds to the coffee basket, and put it on the stove, and in minutes, you’ll have a seriously strong cup ready to go.The best instant coffees in 2025: we tested 24 US varieties from powders to pastesRead morePeppermill (France)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$69 at Crate & BarrelI haven’t used pre-ground black pepper in years, thanks to myPeugeot Paris Bistro Pepper Mill. I love its rounded shape and hefty weight; it has multiple grind options and looks great sitting on the countertop. “Everyone’s got room for a pepper mill,” says Tavallai. “Not only can you have freshly ground pepper on top of your dishes, you can choose what kind of pepper you want to fill your mill with. Kampot, Penja, Tellicherry, the world – or at least the global south – is your oyster.”I bought the walnut finish version 13 years ago, and though the wood finish is a bit worn, its mechanism – backed by a lifetime warranty – is still going strong. Since I keep multiple types of black pepper on hand, I recently purchased the same model, this time in durable stainless steel.Claytagine (Morocco)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The GuardianNamed after the North African stew that it is intended to cook, theMoroccan Cooking Taginehas been around for more than 2,000 years. “It isn’t just a cooking vessel, it’s a symbol of how we approach food: slow, generous, and deeply layered in flavor,” says Nargisse Benkabbou, chef and author ofCasablanca: My Moroccan Food. Like a Dutch oven, it maintains heat well and keeps moisture and aromas contained during the cooking process.Moroccan Cooking Tagine For Two$60 at Verve CultureWhen looking for a tagine, take note of its construction. According to Benkabbou, it needs a snug-fitting lid to trap steam, and the clay must be dense yet slightly porous, allowing the food to cook gently and evenly while keeping moisture in. Thismodern versiondoesn’t require the same curing and care as its terracotta cousin, though either option makes for a beautiful serving presentation – the conical lid helps keep food warm and also adds a little flourish when removed to reveal its contents.Emile Henry French Ceramic Tagine$134.95 at Amazon$149.95 at Williams SonomaQualityteatowels (France)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bernadette Machard de Gramont/The Guardian$17.97 at Amazon$23.67 at WalmartAvailable in a multitude of designs,tea towelsare one of my favorite souvenirs to bring home from France. Made of cotton jacquard, they are both beautiful and functional. “Torchons are plentiful in any professional French kitchen and should be at home,” says Tavallai. “They’re inexpensive and versatile, and having a neatly folded stack of them within easy reach makes any kitchen feel that much more organized.” Whether I’m drying dishes, wiping hands, covering rising bread dough or grasping a hot lid handle, I use them in some capacity every single day. Even with frequent laundering, they keep their color and shape nicely for years on end.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe Filter USSpainFranceKorean food and drinkBritish food and drinkMexican food and drinkFrench food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This Saturday, there was a marked change of tone but the problem was the same. “They’re a very good team in winning duels and second balls,” he said, “and you have to give them credit for that. It’s also difficult to win a game of football if the set-piece balance is in their favour.”Brentford’s opening goal stemmed from a long throw from Michael Kayode, an increasingly familiar weapon. Long thows, Slot said, were “the only thing we did yesterday on the training pitch, preparing for that. And the meeting today.Brentfordare also known for very good set pieces, but they are also, in my opinion, known for a fantastic counterattack.”Their second came from a counter, soon after Cody Gakpo had tumbled in the box. Brentford’s third was a penalty initially given as a free-kick only for VAR to conclude the contact had occurred on the line.“I think if you would show both situations,” Slot said, “the penalty we conceded, and that moment, and you show this to every referee in the world, he would tell you maybe both are nothing, but if he had to give one of the two, he definitely would give the one to Cody.”The loss was Liverpool’s fourth in a row in the league; if Arsenal beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, they will lead the champions by seven points. “We don’t compete up there because we simply concede too many goals,” said Slot. “If you change quite a lot during the summer, then I think it’s not a surprise that it can go a bit like this, but I didn’t expect it to go with four losses in a row. It’s always a bit of a bumpy road. I don’t know if that has been seen as an excuse, but from the last six games we’ve played, it’s been five away.”For Keith Andrews, the Brentford manager, the key was the way his side, having conceded in first-half injury time, didn’t let Liverpool dictate the first 10-15 minutes of the second half and play their way into confidence. “The message was we don’t take a step back,” he said.“The team’s growing, clearly: the relationships of the players, the rapport of the players; there’s trust in the group. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I felt teams were coming here and having a comfortable game.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

It would have been about Enzo Maresca’s shortcomings against a low block, the creative deficit caused by Cole Palmer’s absence and the inconsistencies preventing the youngest team in thePremier Leaguefrom muscling their way into the title race.Victory would have lifted Chelsea two points off top spot before Arsenal host Crystal Palace on Sunday. Victory, though, was never within their grasp.Sunderland, again showing why they are such a fine addition to the Premier League, never allowed the world champions to assume control.Manchester United v Brighton: Premier League – live updatesRead moreThe day belonged to Régis Le Bris and his magnificent team, who finished the day in second thanks toLiverpool’s defeat at Brentford. Sunderland, who have made the best start to a season by a promoted side since 2008, were superb. This was their best result since coming up and nobody could argue that it was undeserved, even if it was not until the 93rd minute that the Sunderland substitute Chemsdine Talbi scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were stunned. They were in front after four minutes, Alejandro Garnacho scoring his first goal for the club, but this was a blunt performance.Chelseacreated few clear openings and were ruffled in defence. They were pegged back when Wilson Isidor scored from a long throw and were beaten when a Sunderland counterattack finished with Brian Brobbey, another substitute, laying the ball off for Talbi to guide a composed finish beyond Robert Sánchez from the edge of the area.Sunderland, who look sure to end the trend of all the promoted sides going down, were competitive from the start. They were energetic, organised at the back and aided by the flexibility of their 5-4-1 system. Chelsea, who have dropped eight points at home this season, never solved the tactical conundrum. They did not move the ball with enough intensity. Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo are two of the best midfielders in the league but they were matched by Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki. João Pedro, operating at No 10 while Chelsea wait for Palmer’s groin to heal, has not scored since August and was poor. Marc Guiu was ineffective on his first league start since joining from Barcelona last year.Dan Ballard and Lutsharel Geertruida shackled the 19-year-old forward, who was recalled from a brief loan spell at Sunderland after Chelsea lost Liam Delap to injury and loaned Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich at the end of the transfer window. The game was played on Sunderland’s terms. They had Chelsea lifting aimless crosses into the area long before half-time.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho of Chelsea scores the opening goal, his first for the club.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty Images“We were not good enough,” Maresca said. “We didn’t create a lot apart from the goal. We struggled. We need our players to perform 100%.” It had seemed that Sunderland were in for a long afternoon when Chelsea’s wingers combined in the fourth minute. Pedro Neto launched a counterattack and found Garnacho on the left. The former Manchester United winger drove at Nordi Mukiele before slamming a low shot through Robin Roefs.Sunderland stirred. Maresca, immune to the charms of English football’s new embrace of getting it launched, looked on in frustration as his defence failed to deal with a long throw from Mukiele in the 22nd minute. A mess ensued. It was 1-1 when Wilson Isidor, played onside by Josh Acheampong, turned in a shot by Bertrand Traoré.Isidor was a handful in attack for Sunderland. Chelsea drifted into sterile domination, Garnacho fading before making way for Estêvão Willian early in the second half. Guiu tired badly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Excluding own goals, only Manchester City have had more scored from a specific nation this term (Norway, Haaland, x 11).Photograph: Chris Foxwell/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sunderland’s commitment was ferocious. Reinildo Mandava, back from suspension, was exceptional at left wing-back and Le Bris freshened his team up with smart changes. He got the better of Maresca, whose decision to introduce the height of Tosin Adarabioyo after Brobbey came on did not work.The game was decided when Geertruida stepped forward and played a long ball to Brobbey. The striker held off Adarabioyo and Trevoh Chalobah, waited for support and found it from Talbi, who surged forward to make it 2-1.The challenge now for Sunderland will be keeping expectations realistic. Le Bris said the target is still to hit 40 points but his team are in the Champions League places. This is no relegation battle.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Leah Williamson remains sidelined with an injury the captain picked up in Switzerland, while Lauren Hemp and Lauren James are also long-term absentees. Williamson’s club replacement at Arsenal, Katie Reid, and Manchester City’s Grace Clinton were forced to withdraw from this camp through injury, while Lotte Wubben-Moy left for home with an illness, Jess Park withdrew under the concussion protocol and Hannah Hampton was not included in the squad to face Brazil because of an elbow injury.The backline to face Brazil in the Lionesses’ first outing since that historic penalty shootout win over Spain was where most of the changes fell as a result. Khiara Keating was handed a first start in goal, becoming England women’s first black goalkeeper to receive a cap. The Manchester United centre-back Maya Le Tissier deputised for the right-back Lucy Bronze, who is being eased back from the tibia fracture she infamously played on with during the Euros. Meanwhile Esme Morgan and Jess Carter partnered up in the centre of defence and Alex Greenwood was shifted to left-back.The defence struggled against the Copa América champions in front of a crowd of 37,460, the pace of Ludmilla, Zaneratto and Dudinha particularly troublesome against the slower centre-back pairing.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s Angelina (right) fouls England’s Ella Toone, and was sent off shortly afterwards.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersLudmilla fired the first warning shot, shooting wide of Keating’s far post in the third minute, and their opening goal came in the ninth. Carter was unable to halt Zaneratto after Morgan was drawn out of position and the forward powered the ball into the bottom corner. The celebrations from the Brazil bench were wild, a testament to the scalp England are viewed as.The task got greater for the hosts in the 18th minute. Toone lost possession in the middle and the visiting team were away, Dudinha flicking the ball goalwards with the outside of her foot to send it in off a post.England had their best chance of the half soon after: Greenwood’s free-kick came back off the crossbar and Carter’s follow-up header flew over. This all came after Angelina had been shown a straight red on 21 minutes for knocking over Toone as she broke clear on goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They knew how to carry out what we trained and planned for the game. Of course, after the red card there was resilience and maximum effort. You have to have that in this national team – spirit and dedication.”England’s fortunes shifted after the break: Mead was caught by Zaneratto as she went to shoot and Stanway scored from the spot.It was all England after that, as Brazil failed to maintain the intensity of their press and Stanway rattled the bar with the best chance of an equaliser. The Euro 2025 hero Michelle Agyemang was sent on late but, despite intense pressure, England couldn’t find the breakthrough they were looking for.“It was about the decision-making in the final third and the execution that has to be aligned a little better,” said Wiegman.No team wants to lose but England have suffered worse and more consequential defeats. “When you go out on to the pitch you always want to win,” said Wiegman. “Yes, it hurts because that’s the environment we’re in but, at the same time, it’s not the Euros or the World Cup. There are no consequences. You can take these opportunities to try out things.”Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamBrazil women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

However, you can have all the motivation in the world but in the end, in the pressure cooker that is international rugby league, there is simply no substitute for class.How the hosts were taught that in a brutal lesson to leave Wembley feeling flat, and this series feeling as though it is heading only one way. The suggestion had been that England’s best chance was to catch the Australians cold in game one, with it almost certain they will improve over the next fortnight.England 6-26 Australia: rugby league Ashes first Test – live reactionRead moreEngland can take heart from the fact that for the opening half-hour, they went toe to toe with the Kangaroos and matched them in most areas, but not the one that really mattered. The better chances came the way of the hosts during that period, but on multiple occasions they failed to make any pressure count.Unsurprisingly, when the Kangaroos had their first real chance, they scored. That proved the theme for the whole afternoon. Australia’s class shone in the most clinical moments, with their outstanding full-back Reece Walsh at the heart of everything they did well at both ends of the field.Had Walsh not successfully intercepted two England breaks in the first half, the score – and perhaps the outcome – could have been completely different. By half-time, it should have been 12-8 in favour of the hosts but Walsh thwarted walk-in tries for Dom Young and Mikey Lewis, before scoring a sensational effort of his own at the other end. He was, in a game of such fine margins, the difference here.View image in fullscreenEngland players react after Australia’s fourth and final try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe second half was one-way traffic, with England bruised and ultimately punished by those earlier missed opportunities. This leaves the equation quite simple for the hosts now: they have to win at Everton next Saturday to send the series to a decider at Headingley. They will have to overhaul their attacking potency to stand any chance, with Shaun Wane, the head coach, backed into a corner and likely in need of changes to solve that problem.“We were poor,” Wane said. “It wasn’t close really, they were the best team – no question about that. It hurts a lot. Every single position will be analysed for next week.”Walsh was the game’s standout player here, and the sole reason Australia led 8-0 at half-time instead of perhaps going in behind. His interception of a Herbie Farnworth break with the game at 0-0 was crucial. Ten minutes later, the Kangaroos broke from deep and Walsh was in support to touch down for the opening try of the series. He then stood tall at the other end once again, with Jake Wardle this time the player who broke for England as Walsh stopped his pass from reaching Lewis for a certain try.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England had to score first after the break to stand any chance, but when Angus Crichton broke through a worrying gap in the hosts’ defensive line and pushed past Jack Welsby – the full-back whose position for Everton may well be under threat – it made it 14-0 and suddenly Wane’s side needed to score three times.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowEnglandWelsby; Young, Farnworth, Wardle, Johnstone; Williams, Lewis; Havard, Clark, Lees, Bateman, Pearce-Paul, Knowles.InterchangeLitten, Walmsley, Trout, McMeeken.TryClarkGoalLewisAustraliaWalsh; Nawaqanitawase, Staggs, Shibasaki, Addo-Carr; Munster, Cleary; Carrigan, Grant, Fa’asuamaleaui, Crichton, Young, Yeo.InterchangeDearden, Collins, Cotter, Koloamatangi.TriesWalsh 2, Crichton 2GoalsCleary 5Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Unfortunately, that never looked likely. Any doubt about the outcome of the first Test was firmly removed from the equation when Crichton cut through for his second before Walsh, never far from the action, finished another scintillating move. England at least avoided the ignominy of being scoreless when Daryl Clark scored with five minutes left, but the hosts – and Wane especially – are faced with some tough questions, with England in must-win territory.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueEngland rugby league teamAustralia rugby leagueAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Almost instantly Anthony Taylor blew for time and “Glory, Glory Man United” blared out at Old Trafford.So Brighton, winners of three of the last four meetings, motor back to the south coast defeated and Amorim’s team are starting to build some momentum. They are fourth overnight, thanks toLiverpool losing at Brentford.Manchester United 4-2 Brighton: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThe Portuguese was not happy at the late near-capitulation but can be content with how his tactic of having Luke Shaw move up from left centre-back to harry Georginio Rutter led to Mbuemo’s first strike having already played a part in Casemiro’s goal. Shaw certainly looked to have fouled the No 10 in the build-up but, with the video assistant referee uninterested, Mbeumo raced on to a cute Benjamin Sesko pass to fire a 20-yard finish which went through Lewis Dunk’s legs and beat Bart Verbruggen to the goalkeeper’s left.Cut to the head coach’s celebration and verses of “Ruben Amorim, Ruben Amorim” from the ecstatic home fans, who heralded at the close a third consecutivePremier Leaguewin in the same season for a first time since February 2024.View image in fullscreenDanny Welbeck (left) watches his free-kick clear the Manchester United wall for Brighton’s first goal.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesBut this was confirmed only after Patrick Dorgu’s pulling down of Yankuba Minteh precipitated United conceding twice. First, Danny Welbeck blazed a free-kick beyond Senne Lammens, the United goalkeeper surely disappointed not to deal with it better as the ball went at him rather than for a corner. In added time James Milner’s corner from the right caught United slumbering and the unmarked Charalampos Kostoulas headed in.In all this were signs of the project in progress United still are, but it finished as a good day’s work that began with two penalty shouts being turned down by Taylor. An Amad Diallo jink past Maxim De Cuyper caused the left-back to clip him but the referee was unmoved – to home ire. Further fury followed when Dunk seemed to grab Mbeumo in the area.Amorim spoke of attitude being key and his men kept on and got their reward. The ball dropped to Bruno Fernandes, whose instant no-look pass to Casemiro was a moment to grace a 300th United appearance. The Brazilian tapped the ball left to his compatriot Matheus Cunha and a touch to tee it up was followed by a superb curling finish that skimmed past Verbruggen’s fingertips into the bottom left corner.This was the £62.5m summer signing’s first goal, in his 10th appearance. If “about time” is a fair call on the strike’s arrival, United’s delight soon doubled as Amorim’s deployment of Shaw as a pickpocket hit the first jackpot.View image in fullscreenAmad Diallo hitches a ride on Casemiro after the latter scored Manchester United’s second goal.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAA Jan Paul van Hecke pass aimed for Rutter was nicked from him by Shaw.

Slick interplay involving Fernandes put Sesko in but he sliced wildly off target from only yards out.Brentford v Liverpool: Premier League – live updatesRead moreRutter did the same at the other end, though he may have been hurt moments before, impeding his movement. There was, though, zero excuse for the amateurish effort Carlos Baleba ballooned over as the second half began – hardly a prime advert for a player wanted by United in the previous window.Seconds later, Fernandes showed Baleba how it should be done. Cunha found Diallo deep in Brighton’s area, he picked his captain out, and Fernandes’s pile-driver stung Verbruggen’s palms. The Brighton keeper made another routine save from Sesko while Lammens had to be far more alert when a curving Minteh cross missed everyone and was sneaking into the right corner before the keeper tipped it out.So United’s only home outing in a period of 50 days, with no fixtures at Old Trafford until 24 November, ended in victory: a fine way to sign off.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Briton left his title rivals in his wake and in so doing earned a chance to make a major impact on the championship standings and potentially retake the lead.Enjoying a huge boost to his world championship ambitions, Norris delivered perhaps his best lap of the season in qualifying, to beat the Ferraris ofCharles Leclercand Lewis Hamilton into second and third. Of greater import was that his fellow title protagonists Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri, Norris’s McLaren teammate, could manage only fifth and eighth fastest respectively.Lando Norris takes Mexico Grand Prix pole: Formula One qualifying – live updatesRead moreThe pole was a real statement of intent from Norris andMcLarenand exactly the riposte they required after the recent momentum Verstappen has gathered as he closed the gap to the leaders. Having been 104 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August, the defending champion has won three of the last four meetings and is now just 40 points off the Australian and 14 points behind Norris.It has been an extraordinary turnaround forRed Bulland their driver, and after which Norris badly needed to reassert some authority, having not taken pole since the Belgian GP. To finally do so and start the race from the front foot was a major step in steadying the ship. If he wins and Piastri finishes below second, the British driver will hold the lead of the championship for the first time since the fifth round of the season in Saudi Arabia.Norris acknowledged that it had been a significant moment he hoped to exploit. “I’m happy to be back on pole, it’s been a long time,” he said. “It’s one of those laps where you don’t know what happened, it felt decent but when I saw it was a [one minute] 15.5, I was surprised.“I’m here to win. I’ll be looking forward, I have some quick guys behind me. I’m not expecting it to be easy.”He exhibited a cool command in qualifying that was indicative of how the McLaren remains an enormously strong car and indeed how comfortable and confident Norris can be when he has it hooked up. This stood in stark contrast to his teammate, however.Piastri struggled, off the pace of the frontrunners and unable to challenge for the top spot. It was a similar lack of competitiveness to that he experienced at the last round in Austin as the Australian’s pace over the single lap he demonstrated earlier in the season appears to be sorely lacking. He has not qualified better than third since the Dutch GP, which has been crucial in the way his title lead has been whittled away. He will start from seventh owing to a grid penalty for Williams’s Carlos Sainz.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri looks rueful after a tough qualification.Photograph: Peter Fox/Getty ImagesThird place was also a significant moment for Hamilton, his first top three qualifying place of the season and he enjoyed the moment after a difficult start to his new career withFerrari. “I’m really happy, I’m honoured to be up here with Charles and Lando, these guys have been so quick all year,” Hamilton said. “It’s obviously hard to beat these guys but P3 is the perfect spot at this track, so I’m hoping to make the most of that.”McLaren, who have not been on pole here since Gerhard Berger took the top spot in 1990, will also be confident there is more to come, for Norris at least. Their car has looked very strong in race-pace simulations in Mexico, with Norris putting in some very strong runs. The long drag to turn one of 830m may prove crucial as the leaders jockey for a slipstream, and emerging in clean air in front from the first corner could be key, but on this form keeping the leading McLaren behind in any circumstances is likely to be a mighty task.Quick GuideF1 Mexico City GP qualifying timesShow1Lando Norris(GB) McLaren1min 15.586sec2Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari1:15.8483Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari1:15.9384George Russell(GB) Mercedes1:16.0345Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1:16.0706Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes1:16.118*7Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams1:16.1728Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren1:16.1749Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls1:16.25210Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F11:16.460Eliminated in Q211Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull1:16.81612Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas F11:16.83713Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber1:17.01614Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin1:17.10315Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls1:18.072Eliminated in Q116Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber1:17.41217Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams1:17.49018Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine1:17.54619Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin1:17.60620Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine1:17.670*Relegated to 12thon the grid by a penaltyfrom the US Grand PrixWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Norris had been comfortably on top heading into the first runs in Q3 when Verstappen opened with a strong first lap with a time of 1min 16.455sec.

After goals from Dominic Johnson-Fisher and Christian Oxlade-Chamblerlain, Gateshead rebounded through Kain Adom and, in the 70th minute, Frank Nouble.Already this term Truro have made a trek to Carlisle for a 3-0 defeat that clocked up 878 miles.

We just have to get on with it, but with it being such a long journey, the longest it’s ever been in English football, it draws attention to it.”View image in fullscreenTruro City fans after the National League match at Gateshead International Stadium.Photograph: Harry Cornish/PPAUK/ShutterstockEven their Canadian chair, Eric Perez, who appreciates long-distance travel since he regularly flies seven hours long-haul from Toronto to London, understands the challenge facing the club he took over in 2023 with ambitions of “doing a Wrexham”.All this time on the road has benefits too for Cornwall’s first professional football club, he believes. “I’m not going to say it’s a short journey. It’s a ridiculously long journey in context,” Perez told BBC Sport. “But what that does is galvanise our side even further – everybody spends time together, we’re used to travelling together.”One of Truro’s stalwart supporters is resigned to long days of travelling but remains committed, despite the odd flight cancellation and wearisome train treks. John Joyce, who estimates Saturday’s trip cost him around £400 in expenses and lost earnings, told TalkSport: “I worked for Nato in the last six years of my career in the navy, and it was a shorter drive from Brussels back to Cornwall than it is from Cornwall to Gateshead.”As Askey said after their Carlisle odyssey: “The thing that makes Truro special as a club is that the supporters get behind the team no matter what. I know last season we were very successful [earning promotion from National League South], so it was easy to get behind the players, but from what I know the fans never even moan and they appreciate what the players have done.”Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

In a pulsating contest at the O2Arena, Wardley showed he has one of the toughest chins in the sport as he swallowed several huge punches from Parker before forcing the referee, Howard Foster, to stop the bout in an explosive 11th round.The WBO had ordered the experienced Parker to face Usyk, the undisputed world heavyweight champion, in July, but the New Zealander put his mandatory challenger status on the line against Wardley, who was still involved in white-collar boxing when his opponent was world champion in 2016.‘My Netflix title would be white collar to world champion’: Fabio Wardley on his boxing journey | Donald McRaeRead moreParker promised to be a “different level” to the 30-year-old and that appeared the case for much of the bout in London. Wardley seemed to have missed out on the chance to stop the bout in a back-and-forth second round and again in the 10th, which appeared a sliding doors moments for the Ipswich right-hander.Yet, after Parker could not get his rival out, Wardley roared back with a huge right to wobble the New Zealander in the 11th and a flurry of further punches forced a dramatic stoppage to continue his fairytale story in the sport.View image in fullscreenFabio Wardley knocks back Joseph Parker, watched intently by the referee, who in time stopped the fight.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesWardley, whose shorts bore the letters ITFC for Ipswich Town Football Club, produced a sensational 10th-round knockout to defeat Justin Huni on home soil at Portman Road in June – despite being behind on the judges’ scorecard – and four months later he had the golden carrot of Usyk in front of him. The Ukrainian was not in London, but ringside was a who’s who of the blue-riband division, with Tyson Fury, Daniel Dubois and Moses Itauma all in attendance and a December fight between the veterans Derek Chisora and Dillian Whyte announced before the main event.Wardley finally walked out to meet Parker, who got a fist bump from Fury ahead of his ring walk, before the bout got under way at 10.58pm.Parker, a 39-fight veteran, caught the British boxer on several occasion in a one-sided first round. A small amount of blood was visible from Wardley’s noise, but he fought fire with fire in a sensational round two. The Ipswich fighter initially targeted the body of his opponent before a huge right hand wobbled Parker, an uppercut followed but a loose gumshield forced referee Foster to step in.Wardley had scented blood and yet Parker survived before an even third round was followed by an explosive finish to the fourth. Parker caught Wardley, but the British heavyweight responded with a flurry of successful punches on the ropes to get the crowd on their feet.After a thrilling start, the volume of trade-offs reduced as Parker started to take control of the middle rounds and Wardley swallowed an enormous right towards the end of a tricky seventh round. The eighth followed a similar theme before Wardley looked in trouble at the end of round nine only to roll out and survive.Parker was again in control at the start of the 10th, but Wardley flipped the script to get his rival on the ropes. The referee did not step in on this occasion and, even though Wardley appeared to have emptied the tank, he went to the well at the start of round 11.Another huge right wobbled Parker and this time Wardley would not be denied as a flurry of punches followed which forced Foster to step in. Wardley collapsed on the floor after a herculean effort as he added another incredible chapter to his unique story after he sep up a shot at undisputed world heavyweight champion Usyk in 2026.View image in fullscreenFabio Wardley lies on the canvas and celebrates victory with his trainer.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesChisora and Whyte will headline at Co-Op Live in Manchester on 13 December. The pair were asked about a potential third meeting after Whyte (31-4, 21KOs) won the first two bouts and although Chisora(36-13, 23KOs), 41, initially kept his cards close to his chest, he insisted the 50th fight of his career will “100%” happen.“Yeah, if the contract is right. If the contract is right, but right now it’s not,” Chisora claimed, after he was greeted with big cheers. “Listen, I want the fight but the paperwork has to be right. You know what I’m talking about [Frank Warren]. The paperwork has to be right. The fight will be amazing. The fight will happen in December with Dillian, 100% and it will be an explosive fight.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is director general of the World Health OrganizationSupported byAbout this contentSat 25 Oct 2025 09.37 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 09.38 EDTShareThe last outbreak of cholera in Britain was in 1866; in the United States there has not been an outbreak since 1911.And yet today people are sick with this ancient disease in32 countries, with more than 6,800 deaths reported so far this year –already exceeding all of last year’s toll of6,000 deaths, which was itself a 50% increase on 2023.The most severe outbreaks are in Africa, where conflict is accelerating the spread and hampering control efforts in some countries.Cholerais the definitive disease of deprivation. It persists not for lack of science or solutions, but because leaders have failed to act with the urgency and commitment the crisis demands.A consortium of more than 50 partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), is responding to these outbreaks through theGlobal Task Force on Cholera Control– a partnership established in 1992 to enable access to essential supplies, as well as work on the detection, prevention and treatment of cholera and set global priorities to sustainably control the disease.Complementing the work of the taskforce, in August the WHO and theAfricaCentres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a continental cholera emergency response plan.Sudan cholera outbreak kills 40 in a week as health centres overwhelmedRead moreCholera is caused by a bacterium ingested in food or water contaminated with faeces from an infected person, and the only way to prevent it is by ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. This is why it is now practically unheard of in countries with those facilities, but thrives in communities afflicted by inequality, poverty, conflict, displacement and climate-related disasters.The disease can be prevented with effective vaccines. An injectable vaccine was first developed in the late 19th century, and was superseded by oral vaccines in the 1980s.But because the disease afflicts almost exclusively the poorest countries and communities, the vaccine does not attract investment from developers, for whom it offers little market opportunity. There is currently only one manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns: EUBiologics, based in South Korea.To manage cholera outbreaks, the WHO and other partners established a globalcholera vaccine stockpilefor outbreaks in 2013 under the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) to ensure rapid, equitable and effective access to vaccines in emergencies, especially in low-resource settings. Since then, the stockpile has distributed almost 255m doses of vaccine to 34 countries.Almost 75% of those doses have been distributed since 2021, in response to the global resurgence of cholera. So far this year, the stockpile has disbursed more than 49m vaccine doses – already eclipsing the previous record for a single year.Given the increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, vaccines from the stockpile can only be used to bring outbreaks under control, rather than to conduct preventive campaigns in areas at risk of cholera.The stockpile is replenished every week but production cannot keep up with demand, and it is regularly below therecommended thresholdof having 5m doses ready to respond to outbreaks at any time.To stretch supplies further, the ICG suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in 2022 in favour of a single dose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Single-dose vaccination is only therefore a temporary solution to scarce supplies.Demand shows no sign of abating, meaning supply must increase.In October 2024,Zambiasigned a memorandum of understanding with China’s Jijia Medical Technology Company to establish a cholera vaccine-production facility in Lusaka. The planned production will still require rigorous quality assurance and clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy before any locally manufactured doses can be approved by the WHO and deployed in mass vaccination campaigns.While expanding vaccine production in Africa is essential for preventing and responding to outbreaks of this historical disease, the only long-term solution is for governments to invest in safe drinking water and sanitation.There are some diseases that cannot be completely prevented, such as Alzheimer’s and most cancers. But cholera is not one of them – it can be stopped. Cholera persists because poverty, inequality, conflict and displacement persist.Stopping it is therefore not a scientific, medical or technical challenge; fundamentally, it’s a political one.Hakainde Hichilema is president of Zambia and control champion for the Global Task Force on Cholera Control.

Now he’s not. Here’s whyJoe EskenaziThe US president’s reversal was as capricious as his original plan. What if local billionaires had urged him to stick with it?Sat 25 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 13.45 EDTShareThis story was published in collaboration withMission Local.The mayor ofSan Franciscosaid on Thursday that Donald Trump had simply called him – no go-betweens or consigliere required – and told him there would no longer be a deployment of federal agents or troops to the city.The president simply dialed Daniel Lurie up and talked at him. And, just like that, a daylong crisis and flood-the-zone news cycle across the Bay Area regarding the imminent deployment of border protection agents to the region was quelled. Or not: Oakland’s mayor, Barbara Lee, said the president didn’t callher.Lurie and other local leaders are taking the president’s words to mean that the rest of the Bay Area will be spared – but there was no overt pledge regarding that.It’s great for the people of San Francisco that the president has capriciously decided to unsend the troops he capriciously decided to send. But the real story here is, per the president’ssummation on social media of his discussion with Lurie, that the commander-in-chief is overtly stating that he is basing a domestic military deployment upon what local “friends of mine” (the billionaire CEOs Jensen Huang of Nvidia and thelocal boy Marc Benioffof Salesforce) lobbied him to do. Trump also noted that Lurie asked him “very nicely” not to establish a military beachhead in San Francisco.All for the good. But what if Huang and Benioff had been in the mood for a military parade and called for sending in the troops? What if Lurie had been less polite?If things had gone even slightly differently, it stands to reason that federal immigration agents and/or armed troops could be rolling through the city by now.There are only so many turns of phrase you can employ: this is just a profoundly fucked-up way to lead a country. It’s like dealing with King George or a warlord out of the dark Ages.This city’s billionaires are very good at some things, and those things have made them a lot of money. But being good at those things doesn’t make your average billionaire anexpert on military intervention, the local drug trade or, for that matter, immigration policy or crime in the city.Speaking of capricious, Benioff wasfor sending in the guard before he was against it.It figures: Salesforce veterans tell me they expect Benioff would do great schmoozing in a one-on-one with the president – because their personalities are so similar.For a guy who drinks so much coffee, Daniel Lurie is remarkably even-keeled. When asked about his discussion with Trump, Lurie told the press that he simply recited all ofSan Francisco’s heartening crime statisticsover the telephone – and kept reciting them, sprinkling in a little real estate boosterism along the way.“Everything I told you is all I said to him,” the mayor said today. “I keep repeating, and I said to him, that we are at 70-year lows when it comes to violent crimes. Tent encampments are at record lows. I spoke about more office space being leased than vacated. For the first time, retail is back. Hotel bookings are up 50%. Convention bookings are also up 50%. This is a city on the rise. And that’s what I said to him. And that’s what I say to everybody.”The president, Lurie said, “asked nothing of me”. Nobody was made to purchase Trump’s555 California Stproperty at an exorbitant markup. No promises to build a Trump Tower on top of Salesforce Tower were required to call off the troops. It remains unclear whether Luriefinally referred to Trump by namewhen on the phone with Trump. Evidently, he wasn’t asked to.I’d like to think the mayor really did say “retail is back!” to the man presently tearing down the White House to install a ballroom fit for people who feel Versailles is too understated. If he did, it worked.But nobody is expecting peace in our time: “They want to give it a ‘shot’,” Trump wrote. “Therefore we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”All of the things Lurie told the president – and “everybody” – are true.We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: subjectively, you may not feel safe in San Francisco. Objectively, you’ve rarely been safer. San Francisco’s reported crime totals are low, and that’s something you could say before this mayor or this president. We are on pace for our lowest homicide total since 1954, but last year’s total was the lowest since 1961. Car break-ins, which were long part of the San Francisco Condition and gave us the municipal nickname “bip city” are way down.But the fact that it was true does not matter: what Huang or Benioff or other billionaire pals tell the president is what matters.The problem, however, is that parts of San Francisco still look gnarly – gnarlier, arguably, than they didin the 1970s when teams of serial killers roamed the streets. There are swaths of the city in which people are living in overt filth and misery and are overtly buying, selling and using drugs. There are still unhoused people, drug addicts and unhoused drug addicts shambling about. They may be disinclined to give you the Zodiac killer treatment, but their presence makes people uncomfortable. This makes people – including terminally online tech CEOs and venture capitalists –feelunsafe. This makes ostensibly intelligent tech barons ping the president on social media and ask him to send in the national guard.If Lurie did indeed stave off an intervention of armed soldiers or rampaging immigration agents by telling the truth, then more power to him. To paraphrase the familiar quote, honesty is one of thebetterpolicies.But the “shot” Lurie has apparently been granted was to clean up a problem he has explained – quantitatively – that we don’t have. Lurie will purportedlymeet with the attorney general, Pam Bondi. But it remains to be seen whether any federal assistance from the FBI or DEA to combat drug trafficking doesn’t come with serious – and capricious – strings attached. Every bargain with Trump and his gang is a Faustian bargain.San Francisco’s crime stats have been headed the right way for a while. But our gnarliness vibes have not – so we recalled our district attorney and dumped our prior mayor. It’s not enough for Lurie to point to numbers. He has to deliver the right vibes – the kind of vibes that can appease our billionaire class and the president they call up and lobby. That’s a hard job. Get that man a cup of coffee.Retail, they say, is back. It remains to be seen whether and when federal immigration agents will be, too.Joe Eskenazi is an editor and columnist forMission Local.

Two remarkable works that have profoundly influenced me are James and Wounded, both bythe brilliant Percival Everett.I had the privilege of attending the Booker prize ceremony last year, where I was in the same room as Everett. Although he didn’t win for James, the reading by Nonso Anozie was both devastatingly moving and hilariously insightful. Everett is a masterful African-American author who captures the complexities of contemporary Black identity in the US.James by Percival Everett.Photograph: PicadorJames is a literary remix of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, told from the perspective of Jim, the enslaved character. It’s a funny and thrilling exploration of racism, slavery and humanity’s capacity for cruelty. Everett’s retelling allows Jim and his fellow plantation workers to communicate in a way that transcends the often parodic depictions of Black speech. The line, “Dey takes the lies dey want and throws away the truth dat scares ’em”, reflects a deep wisdom. This novel reveals that compassion, humour and kindness can be found in the most unexpected places. The transformative power of literacy shines through when Jim realises, “If I could see the words, then no one could control them or what I got from them.” This message should be shared with every child at the start of Black History Month.I’m equally captivated by Wounded, set in Wyoming, where John, a Black horse trainer, assists a young man ostracised for his sexuality. The story navigates heavy themes of homophobia and love with grace and humour. It’s beautifully written, and I eagerly await its film adaptation, but read the book first! Percival Everett continues to be a literary hero for me, embodying the wisdom that “If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not learning.”Pan-Africanism awakened my fascination with historyZeinab BadawiBroadcaster, journalist and president of Soas University of LondonA defining thought for me was the doctrine of pan-Africanism. That really awakened my interest in history, because I really would like to see history as part of that pan-African drive to unite the people of Africa and also people of African descent. History not only explains our past, it also defines our present.You can’t reduce the experiences of people of African descent to one narrative but there are more unifying factors than ones that divide. The main one is that there is nowhere in Africa that didn’t experience foreign subjugation in one way or another.If anyone exemplified that thought for me, it wasGamal Abdel Nasser, of Egypt. I choose him because he is seen as an Arab leader and yet he was also very firmly anchored in the concept of pan-Africanism. He even arranged a marriage forKwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister and president of Ghana, ensuringhe had a wife from Egypt, in a spirit of pan-Africanism and unity of the people of the continent.A lot of people tend to hive off the north of Africa and say it is part of the Arab world and not part of Africa proper – and Nasser countered that view. As someone who was born in Sudan, very much at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa – at least the northern part of Sudan where I am from – Nasser and Nkrumah helped shape my view of pan-Africanism.Winifred Atwell’s virtuosic musicianship was an early lesson in freedomYolanDa BrownSaxophonist, composer, broadcaster and chair of the British Phonographic IndustryI recently unveiled the blue plaque to the pianist and composerWinifred Atwell, and hearing the joyful bounce ofThe Black and White Ragplaying out in the street in front of where she lived brought it all back to life for me. I could feel the sparkle in her playing, precise yet playful, classical yet carefree. When I first heard her music, I was in my teenage years and completely intrigued. I learned that this vibrant sound came from a Trinidadian woman who had topped the UK charts in the 1950s, a broadcaster and entrepreneur too, opening one of the first Black hair salons in the UK.Atwell’s story speaks to possibility. A classically trained pianist who refused to be boxed in, she moved effortlessly between Chopin and boogie-woogie, and played everywhere from concert halls to variety shows. She was an elegant Black woman redefining what the piano and who a pianist could be.For me, Winifred Atwell’s music was an early lesson in freedom. She showed me that you could carry your heritage into any room and still fill it with your own voice. Her example whispered reassurance, as I began to carve my own path in music, blending jazz, reggae and soul … there’s space for all of it.Atwell played with joy that transcended boundaries. Watching old footage now, I see more than show-womanship – I see courage. She turned the piano into a meeting place of cultures, histories and hope. Through her, I learned that the most powerful statement you can make is to be unapologetically you.I strive to carry forward the flame of Jamaican activist Marcus GarveyNadine WhiteJournalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondentI first heard the name Marcus Garvey in the reggae songs my mum played throughout my childhood – roots tunes from Burning Spear and Culture booming through our small London flat. I remember thinking, “Who’s Marcus?” and being told stories about this great Jamaican man who taught pride and self-determination. I listened to my older brother, Sam, talk about his movement.Mum was a collector of Black art back in the day and bought a striking painting of Garvey that took pride of place in our living room. Within a Eurocentric society, that culturally Jamaican home was my haven … full of music, books and images that told me who I was and who I could be. I grew up literally watching Garvey.Later, I readColin Grant’s biographyof him, Negro With a Hat,and pored over Garvey’s speeches. Garvey was flawed like anyone, but his message – that we must organise, create and own our stories – shaped how I move through the world.His use of media as a tool for liberation still fuels me; when I asked the health secretary questions during a televised Covid press conference at Downing Street, it was the aforementioned portrait of Garvey that hung in the background of my home. When I make films or build platforms to amplify Black voices, I’m carrying that same flame. Garvey taught me that pride and purpose are not luxuries; they’re a responsibility.Marvin Gaye articulated my angst – and that of an entire generationGus Casely-HayfordCultural historian, broadcaster and lecturer, and the inaugural director of V&A EastI felt politics long before I understood what it was. Even as a very young child, I sensed something in the dignified rage of Muhammad Ali, I felt it in the defiance of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, the indefatigability of Arthur Ashe. Alongside their brilliance, I detected an epigenetic rage, something that felt old and raw and right – it electrified me, even as a child. And who could resist such exquisite, stately, controlled anger, channelled with forensic effect to offer deep, enduring, emotional and communal catharsis.My sister Margaret was, and remains, the most beautiful and inspiring person I have ever met, and on this particular afternoon she was looking the kind of cool that could have got her cast in an early Melvin Van Peebles movie. She was wearing a fawn suede waistcoat, a brown flowery shirt and her afro was fringed with the special sepia-tinted sunlight that warmed our south London living room on late summer afternoons.View image in fullscreenA mural of Marvin Gaye by the artist Dreph, Brixton, south London, 2021.Photograph: Matt Crossick/PAShe walked over to the radiogram – and dropped the needle on a track. The sound was turned way up – there were two seismic crackles that could have been heard in Tooting Bec, and then Marvin Gaye began: “Mother, mother”, It was a ballad, a prayer, an ode, a love song to a generation, a political tractus, a lament to what was lost – but most profoundly, it was a song for the rest of us.Our planet, hope, compassion were dying – and those that cared were not being listened to.It articulated the angst of a generation, it asked for love, reason, rapprochement – but it also asked something of you: that you stand up.Tupac Shakur’s poetry inspired me to call out inequalitySimone OrefuwaVice-president of the National Black Police AssociationMusic was a cornerstone of my upbringing – my father was a huge reggae and dancehall fan, always buying records. I’ve yet to meet anyone with as much vinyl as him! But when I discoveredYo! MTV Raps, I instantly knew I had found my genre. There was something powerful in the rhythmic storytelling, where words danced over beats.Rap music exposed me to the struggles of Black communities in the US and UK, where they spoke about poverty, racism, inequality, police brutality and broken families, while also rapping about resilience, hope and empowerment.The list of rappers I listen to is extensive, but for me,Tupac Shakurwas a musical genius and my favourite poet. Many of his songs are social commentaries on injustice and compassion. Changes highlighted the systemic oppression, the mental toll this can take and the need for social reform.Soulja’s Storycovered racism and police brutality experienced as a young Black man. Meanwhile, songs such asKeep Ya Head UpandDear Mamashowed empowerment for Black women while expressing vulnerability, tenderness and optimism.For me, rap was more than just the music, it was also about the fashion. I begged my parents for clothing from brands such asKarl KaniandCross Colours. I loved the baggy jeans, oversized tops, trainers/Timberlands and bandanas. It gave me a confidence to celebrate my Black identity and showcase Black designers.As I continue to listen to Tupac’s lyrics, I’m struck by how powerful his words remain today as we face the rise of the far right and misogynistic behaviour. Tupac inspired me to use my voice to challenge and call out inequality: something I’m proud to do now through my work with the National Black Police Association.The Hip-Hop Preacher taught me the true value of hard workMichael AkadiriDoctor and standup comedianI’ve long found “Monday motivation” – the posting of motivational quotes on Monday mornings – quite insipid. I understand the rationale; few are bullish about work on a Monday especially after a decompressing weekend. However, I’ve always queried the benefit a motivational quote will have if that desire doesn’t come from within.That’s until I came across American motivational speakerEric Thomas, AKA The Hip Hop Preacher,and his famous mantra“when you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful” a few years ago. A friend had shared a short clip of Thomas delivering this potent line and I suspect it was the forceful delivery, the pure emphasis on “breathe” that struck a chord with me.My medical background is perhaps the reason for this but, of course, you don’t need a medical degree to know breathing is essential for life. Immediately the internal interrogation began: am I pursuing my career goals with the sheer intensity that they’re essential for life? Am I leaving no stone unturned? Or am I cruising on talent and a bit of effort and hoping divine intervention will make up the shortfall? If I’m honest, it’s probably the latter.Yet my inner cynicism tried to rear its ugly head: “Technically, breathing is involuntary.” A deflection attempt made in vain. Deep down, I knew Eric was right. Being obsessive and determined have underpinned my successes to date. Thomas’s quote was a timely reminder that if I want to continue succeeding – within medicine, comedy or even both – I need to perceive accomplishments as being as essential as oxygen is to staying alive.The confidence and conviction of Mia Mottley showed me true leadershipShana MaloneyPriest in charge of St James church, Clapton, east LondonI grew up in Barbados with Mia Mottley as the most prominent female in the political and public life of Barbados – as the opposition leader – a familiar voice that carried across the island. You didn’t just hear her; you felt her influence in the way people spoke about possibility and in how young people, especially girls, looked to follow in her footsteps. Even as a child, I recognised and was drawn to her confidence and conviction – her belief that people could and should reach further. In some part of my young mind, I would tell people: “If Mia is opposition leader, then I will be the first female prime minister of Barbados.”View image in fullscreenMia Mottley speaking after her Barbados Labour party won a landslide victory in the country’s first election since it became a republic, Bridgetown, 20 January 2022.Photograph: Nigel R Browne/ReutersMia Amor Mottley is a barrister and politician who has served as the prime minister of Barbados since 2018 – the first woman ever to hold that office. She previously served as minister of education, attorney general and deputy prime minister, leading with intellect and a striking sense of purpose. Under her leadership, Barbados became a republic in 2021, marking a defining moment of transformation within the Caribbean.Like her, and possibly because of her, I studied law – drawn by the same pursuit of justice and service for others. My path later led to the priesthood, but both vocations and her example have taught me that leadership is about service and the flourishing of people. Though we don’t share the same political views, I deeply respect her clarity of thought, courageand commitment. Mia Mottley embodies leadership rooted in intellect, responsibility and compassion.The Supremes sparked my diva worshipJason OkundayeAssistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianThere’s a phenomenon among gay men called “diva worship” that is our veneration of female singers whose artistic style, lyrics, dancing and beautiful voices trigger a latent flamboyance or accentuate it. Over the years this figure in my life has taken many forms – Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, Whitney Houston. But the first divas I worshipped were the Supremes who, as a child, gifted me with a language through which to parse love and heartbreak well before I would come to know what position those emotions would have in my life.My favourite of the classics had always been their 1966 hit You Keep Me Hangin’ On – my childhood self, who would skip around the house singing it, couldn’t have known that it would become my go-to song whenever I wanted to be “set free” by yet another situationship who was sending me mixed signals or giving me hot-and-cold treatment. Then there was Baby Love and Stop! In the Name of Love (you can imagine me in front of the telly, left hand on hip, right hand in the air palm spread). But I loved the deep cuts too, from the sentimental to the smitten, which would prepare me for the pleasures and disappointments of love: Time Changes Things, It’s All Been Said Before, He’s All I Got. Buttered Popcorn, which allowed Florence Ballard to lead and showcase her commanding, soulful timbre (sadly when I tried buttered popcorn I was disgusted by it, though it spoke to my experience with greasy, sticky, salty men).I have no musical talent, but I think the Supremes were pretty formative to how I would come to approach prose – being sincere with emotion and feeling, and the stakes when you expose yourself to being bruised. So thanks for guiding my pen, and carrying me through heartbreak.The Black Panther soundtrack pushed me to make consequential workAthena KugblenuComedian and writerIf you’re not fanatical about the soundtrack to Eddie Murphy’s movieThe Nutty Professor, you must think Foxy Brown is a shade from Farrow and Ball. So what if the soundtrack had almost nothing to do with the film? It had everything to do with the tastes of the people who might watch actually the film. I didn’t mind that. That was its genius to me.Some 22 years later, watching the movie Black Panther changed my mind. Its final moments carry a powerful message of pan-Africanism that redeem Killmonger, the anti-hero. The revolution he wanted could be instigated by Wakanda after all. As the credits roll, this mesmerising notion is followed byAll the Stars by Kendrick Lamar and SZA. I realised this soundtrack has everything to do with the film, and a lot to say.View image in fullscreenLupita Nyong’o as Nakia, and Letitia Wright as Shuri in the 2018 film Black Panther.Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyAll the Stars is about the responsibility that comes with love and the consequences of achieving your dreams, a commentary on T’Challa’s story in the movie. The entire soundtrack is a conversation between Africa and the African diaspora, as is the film, layering trap, rap and R&B with South African artistry, reflecting where many of the film’s cultural references were drawn from.It can be adored by anyone who listens but demands intellect to truly understand. The biggest film franchise in the world made an album with one of the biggest artists in the world that rewards us for paying attention. Now, as then, in these “swipe early, swipe often” times, I find something deeply refreshing about this. This soundtrack is a reminder to me to make consequential work. Plus, it never reneges on its one requirement: the songs still have to slap. On the soundtrack to Black Panther, they do.My 25-year career in the NHS all started with reggaePaulette HamiltonLabour MP for Birmingham ErdingtonGrowing up in Handsworth, Birmingham, with very little, we were grateful for what we had. While we couldn’t afford the games other kids had, we had music and dance – not just any music, but reggae. This music did more than entertain us; it shaped the person I am today.I will always remember hearing Gregory Isaacs’sNight Nursefor the first time. That smooth, comforting rhythm drifted from my father’s radio and, years later, from my husband Dennis’s sound system as he DJ’d in our home. There was something truly transformative about that song. There are multiple interpretations of it, but to my mind, Isaacs sang of care, compassion, and being there for someone in their time of need, concepts that resonated deeply with my young mind.For me, a Black British woman, reggae was a cultural anchor. It connected me to my Jamaican heritage while giving me strength to face life’s challenges in Britain. When teachers dismissed children such as me, suggesting we were “only destined to have babies,” this music reinforced my sense of worth and ambition.Night Nurse became more than a song; it became a calling. Its lyrics about watching over someone and offering comfort and relief shaped the kind of nurse I aspired to be. It was the inspiration for my 25-year career in the NHS.Today, the music remains a powerful companion. It reminds me that from Birmingham to parliament, I’ve always been guided by one principle: true service means being present for those who need us, just like the night nurse in Isaacs’s timeless song.Seeing patois respected on the page transformed my TV reporting styleSymeon BrownReporter and journalist at Channel 4 NewsIn college I was one of those boring boys who refused to read fiction. I learned the error of my ways when a good friend suggested that I pick up Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. If that book enlightened me to the human revelations that only fiction can deliver, it would be Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners that changed me. The 1956 novel about the Windrush arrivals is a reflection of its characters: laid back, mischievous and the depth broods beneath the surface. It was the first time I saw patois respected on the page – the dialect is a forefather of my own multicultural London English. The connection has stayed with me even as a television news reporter. In a field that defers authority to softened received pronunciation my own cadence remains instantly recognisable and different.View image in fullscreenA production based on Sam Selvon’s book The Lonely Londoners, with Carol Moses as Tanty, Jermyn St Theatre, London, 6 March 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe Lonely Londoners is quintessentially a story about the original mandem too. Moses, Galahad and the boys were gyalis, hustlers and black aspirants in a racially hostile Britain. As the Windrush generation have been upgraded to “good immigrants” who “helped the mother country”, the balance provided in The Lonely Londoners and its nonfiction heir Journey to an illusion by Donald Hinds in 1966 constantly remind me that the good, the bad and the ugly of our stories must be told too.Finding The Lonely Londoners set off a bomb in me. The novel is a cornerstone of a black British canon that is far too invisible to black Britons themselves. It led me first to work in the Black Cultural Archives and then as a gatherer of black British stories as a news correspondent. If there is one urgency for Black History Month it must be to remember our forgotten canon. Read them. Watch them. Share them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Because he wants toArwa MahdawiThe president’s mega-project raises a lot of questions – including when he’s planning on leavingSat 25 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 19.37 EDTShareDonald Trump has quite the passion for American history. If there’s a controversial statue commemorating a dead white supremacist out there, there’s a good chance the president has gone to bat for it.“Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,”Trump tweetedin 2017, in response to a push to remove Confederate monuments. “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!”Trump added.Trump is right that you can’t change history. But, if you’re the president, you can abruptly bulldoze it with no permits and no public input. The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, the home of officesfor every first ladyfor almost half a century, is now apile of rubble. AfterTrump said in Julythat the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom.According to Trump, there was a teeny littlechange of plans“after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”.Speaking of plans,the bulldozing went aheadwithout any such thing being submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government building. But don’t worry, according to the White House, construction plans will be coming soon. Watch this space!While the likes of the National Trust for Historic Preservation areupsetabout the destruction of a “National Historic Landmark, a National Park, and a globally recognized symbol of our nation’s ideals”, some large corporations appear to be looking on the bright side. Trumphas saidthe new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be “paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”. Now the world’s CEOs have a wonderful opportunity to prove just how friendly to Trump they are. A list of donors including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project. Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Palantir – who seem to know a thing or two about reducing belovedbuildings to rubble– are alsoreportedlyfunding the project. If this sort of thing were happening in a developing country it might smack of corruption. But this is the United States, so it’s obviously all above board.National history aside, this sudden demolition of the first ladies’ headquarters raises a lot of questions. If I lived in a house that I didn’t own – one that I was scheduled to move out of in January 2029 – I probably wouldn’t start an enormous and extremely controversial construction project. Why is Trump doing this?The short answer is: because he wants to. As I think we all know by now, the president does whatever the hell he feels like regardless of norms, conventions or silly little laws. And, increasingly, there’s nobody there to stop him. The only checks that Trump cares about are the ones made out to him and the only balances he is interested in are those of his bank accounts.Trump has given a few rationales for the project that go beyond “because I want to”. He’s argued that the old East Wing was no longer fit for purpose and a much larger space was needed. There are some people out there who agree with him. Gahl Hodges Burt, for example, who was social secretary for three years under Ronald Reagan, told theNew York Timesthat tearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was unfortunately necessary and overdue.Beyond practical issues, there’s also ego. Trump’s big-boy ballroom will be a big shiny monument to him long after he’s gone.Still, you’ve got to wonder whether this mega-project means the president is not actually planning on going anywhere anytime soon. Particularly since Trump doesn’t seem to be the sort of person to start a large project he won’t have a chance to personally enjoy. The US constitution’s 22nd amendment makes itvery clearthat a president cannot have more than two terms. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly teasing the idea that he mightserve a third term. In March, he told NBC News he was “not joking” about the idea and that there were methods for doing so.Trump’s army of sycophants certainly seem to be exploring these methods. Earlier this year, the Tennessee Republican representative Andy Ogles proposedamendingthe constitution to allow Trump to serve three terms. And this week, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steven Bannon,told the Economistthat the president will “get a third term”. Bannon said that there’s “a plan” to deal with the 22nd amendment and “at the appropriate time” they’ll lay out the plan.It may seem unthinkable that Trump could seek to serve a third term. To quote the president again, however: “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it.” And if there is one lesson to be learned from Maga history, it’s that you should never underestimate Trump or overestimate the institutions that are supposed to keep his megalomania in check. The president will do anything he thinks he can get away with.Google drops a key career resource program for women in tech“The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,”one tech worker told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.” Google can’t be wasting time thinking about equality for women – it’s got Trump’s ballroom to fund!Misty Copeland takes her final bow at retirement showIn 2015, Copeland became thefirst Black female principal dancerin the American Ballet Theatre’s 75-year history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voters now face a clear choice between two very different futures, and Caerphilly shows that it is Plaid Cymru’s bold, inclusive vision that carries momentum.Caerphilly was one of the safestLabourseats in Wales. Many London commentators expected the seat to fall to Reform – perhaps even hoped it would. It would have fit the narrative that post-industrial communities naturally drift to the populist right. We proved them wrong. A message built on fairness, community and national purpose resonated with voters, and a comfortable majority voted for it.Reform UK threw everything it had at this campaign. Busloads of activists came from Kent. Their anti-refugee banners and billboards made local people feel uneasy and sought to pit neighbour against neighbour. Reform thought it could surf a wave of anger and fear, but people in Caerphilly saw through their cynicism. They rejected the idea that Wales should be used as a stepping stone for Farage’s next Westminster project.Plaid Cymru’s message of hope beat Reform’s hate. Where Reform shouted division, we talked about belonging. Where they peddled blame, we talked about community. That matters not just for us in Wales, but for progressives everywhere. The populist right can be beaten when people are offered hope and a vision of a fairer future.The result couldn’t be more damning of Labour. Eluned Morgan and Keir Starmer’s brand of managerial politics does not speak to Welsh voters any more. Labour once claimed to be thenatural partyof Wales. “Natural” parties die when they stop standing for something. In Caerphilly, decades of complacency caught up with them.People here no longer believe Labour represents their communities, their values or their ambitions. They see a party that has swapped conviction for calculation and focus-grouped slogans. The byelection result shows that Labour’s hold onWalesis gone.Winning almost half the vote was no statistical fluke. It was the result of thousands of doorstep conversations, a campaign powered by volunteers, a message grounded in belief, and the charisma of a local champion in Lindsay Whittle, whose decades of hard graft mean he is known and loved by people here.Conviction politics still works. Clarity and passion can defeat cynicism and drift.Momentum is now with Plaid Cymru. As we move towards a fully proportional Senedd, the possibilities for genuine, people-led government have never been greater. Caerphilly has lit a fuse underWelsh politics, and it is burning brightly towards 2026.Wales faces a simple choice. One path is regressive, built on resentment and division, dressed up in Reform’s slogans. The other is progressive, inclusive and confident, led by Plaid Cymru. The people of Caerphilly have already chosen, and their message will echo far beyond their constituency.There are lessons here for every progressive movement in the UK. You don’t defeat extremism by copying its language or trimming your values to fit a poll. You defeat it by standing for something real. When Reform tried to weaponise Welsh programmes that help refugees to integrate, making Ukrainiansfeel unwelcome, we stood up to them. We defended what is right and stayed true to our values.We are focusing on policies that will transform people’s lives, not just tinker at the edges. Our free childcare plan isworth more than £30,000in childcare costs in the first four years of a child’s life – the most ambitious in the UK. Our manifesto will be grounded in a recognition that too many in our communities have been left behind. We are determined to change that. Like Scotland, we will take real action to tackle child poverty through a new child payment. This is what bold, practical politics looks like – politics with purpose, ambition and heart.When voters see authenticity, they respond. Former Labour voters, and many who had given up on politics, did not come to Plaid reluctantly. They came enthusiastically. They saw a movement that reflects their aspirations and speaks their language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It shows that Starmer’s Labour, and Westminster politics as a whole, can no longer take Wales for granted. The old order of British politics is breaking down.Starmer’s cautious managerialism offers no answers to the cost of living crisis, the climate emergency or the constitutional question. People want more than competence. They want conviction. Caerphilly shows that Wales is ready to build the government it deserves, in the country it believes in.This was never about just one seat. It marks a shift in spirit. Caerphilly has opened a new chapter in Welsh politics. Hope has proved stronger than hate, belief has beaten cynicism.The people of Caerphilly have shown the way.

Now we need to hear about a concrete planSat 25 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 05.07 EDTShareThese days present quite a unique phenomenon: the first-ever US march of the babysitters. They vary in their qualifications and attributes, but they all share the same mission – to prevent an Israeli breach, or even destruction, of Gaza’s fragile ceasefire. Since the war ended, there have been few days without at least one of Donald Trump’s envoys on the ground. Just this past week saw the likes of Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff,JD Vanceand Marco Rubio – all arrivingto perform their duties.Israel keeps them busy. In just a few days it launched a series of attacks in Gaza after the killings oftwo Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers– resulting, according to reports, in dozens of Palestinian casualties. Several ministers called for a resumption of the war, and the Knesset passed a preliminary decision to annex the West Bank. The US reaction was somewherebetween “no” and “hell no”.Yet in more than one sense, the Trump administration seems more focused on maintaining the current, uneasy phase of the ceasefire than on progressing to the next: the rehabilitation ofGaza. When it comes to that, it appears the US may have ambitions but no concrete plans.For now, it remains unclear when the proposed international governing body will actually take power, and the same goes for the designated security force – or even the identity of its soldiers. On Tuesday, Vance said the US would not impose the composition of the foreign force on Israel. But if Benjamin Netanyahu’s government continues to reject one alternative after another – as it did theTurkish proposalthis week – what happens then? There is also the reverse question: who will determine whether the forces favoured by Israel are even interested in the mission?The question of how long it will take to disarm Hamas is equally vague. “Our hope in the administration is that the international security force is going to now take the lead in disarming Hamas,”said Vance this week. “That’s going to take some time.” Trump only reinforced the uncertainty, saying in aninterview with Fox Newson Sunday that there is no “hard” timeline for Hamas to disarm. So, theoretically, the unknown members of this yet-to-be-formed international force could enter Gaza while Hamas militants still hold power. Would they be facing a governing body or a guerrilla movement? These are just a few of the questions arising. Others might ask what the verdict will be for ordinary Palestinians as things stand, with Hamas continuing to target its ownpolitical rivals and dissidents.Recent events have once again highlighted the blind spots of Israeli media coverage on both sides of the Gazan border. Every outlet seeks to examine every possible angle of Hamas’s violations of the ceasefire. And, in general, the fact that Hamas has been stalling the return of the bodies of killed Israeli hostages has dominated the headlines.By contrast, coverage of civilian casualties in Gaza resulting from Israeli strikes has received little attention – if any. Take the Israeli retaliatory attacks following Sunday’s Rafah incident, in which two soldiers were killed. While Gaza’s authoritiesreported 44 deaths, Israeli television commentators criticised the “light response”, which targeted only infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past weekend, Gaza’s media office accused Israel ofviolating the ceasefirewith Hamas 47 times since the truce came into effect, killing 38 Palestinians and wounding another 143. The claim appeared irrelevant to most Israeli news programmes – it was simply absent. That included reports that 11 members of a Palestinian family were killed by Israeli forces last Friday.Gaza’s civil defence agency said the family had been trying to return to their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when the bus they were in was attacked for allegedly crossing the “yellow line” that demarcates areas under Israeli army control. That yellow line is invisible to the human eye and appears only on maps and in official documents – not always available to ordinary people in the territory.Even that incident barely rated a mention in Israeli media. Channel 13 News referred to it briefly on its website, quoting an IDF spokesperson who said that after a suspicious vehicle was identified, troops fired warning shots towards it, “but the vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them. The troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.” No casualties were reported.With this framing, it is little wonder many Israelis feel Hamas alone is to blame for violating the ceasefire. That perception risks fuelling calls for a more aggressive approach in Gaza.At some point – perhaps sooner rather than later – it will no longer be enough for all the president’s men to play kindergarten teachers, telling Israel what not to do. They will have to say what should be done, and exactly how.Roy Schwartz is a senior editor and op-ed contributor at HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But history tells the tale of its resilienceSat 25 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 08.44 EDTShareIn the classic dinner-party scene in the film Notting Hill, Tim McInnerney’s character promises a brownie to “the saddest act here”. In response, the guests (including the glamorous movie star played by Julia Roberts) try to outdo each other with tales of their painful suffering and pathetic failures.In our gloomy autumn of 2025, western democracies could play quite a convincing version of this game. There is the depressed United Kingdom, where Keir Starmer’s approval ratingshave fallen to record lowsand Reformleads in the polls. There is the deeply broken United States, where a supine oppositionseems incapableof preventing Donald Trump from chopping away one guardrail after another of our constitutional order. There is Spain, where this summer a Socialist party scandalthreatened to topplethe fragile minority government of prime minister Pedro Sánchez.But as winter approaches, it might seem as if France deserves the brownie. Its government has limped along in a state of paralytic ineptitude since adisastrous snap electionin July 2024 produced the mother of all hung parliaments. Since then, Emmanuel Macron has gone through five prime ministers (counting poor Sébastien Lecornu’s second go-round), while his own popularity hovers around a disastrously low 20%,and dropping. Two-thirds of the Frenchsee politicians as fundamentally corrupt, and as apparent proof of this belief, former president Nicolas Sarkozyreported for prison this weekto begin serving a five-year sentence for campaign finance violations. Meanwhile, the public deficit is expected to rise to a dangerous 5.4%, leading to thedowngrading of France’s credit rating.The French public is still reeling fromthe trial of Dominique Pelicotand the more than 50 men whom he allowed to rape his drugged and unconscious wife, which was widely seen as symbolising a dire national failure to address the abuse of women. And as if all this weren’t enough, on Sunday morning thieves brazenly broke into the Louvre and, in ahumiliating security failurefor the government, made off with millions of euros worth of France’s crown jewels.View image in fullscreenPolice officers block an access to the Louvre museum after a robbery on 19 October 2025.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APSmall wonder that in a new poll, fully 90% of the Frenchbelieve that the country is in decline.And, since despondent moods tend to build on themselves, events that might otherwise be taken as incidental (the Louvre break-in) or as demonstrating the strength of republican institutions (Sarkozy’s jailing), instead have been widely cited as further evidence of national decadence.Small wonder then that the bleak mood has driven so many voters into the arms of the far right – in this case, the National Rally of Marine Le Pen. As Americans know well, alluringly simplistic stories of great nations laid low by feckless elites and unchecked immigration tend to play very well with older white voters who feel economically blocked and socially disdained. Polls show that in new parliamentary elections, the National Rallywould far outpace its nearest competitor.Macron has not helped matters with his haughty insistence that, despite last year’s electoral defeat and the catastrophic polling, his office not only gives him the right to impose unpopular policies, but to lecture the French on their shortcomings when they object.There’s no denying the depth of the problems, yet there are still reasons to question whetherFranceis heading into violent catastrophe, or just dealing with a series of grave, but still relatively ordinary, crises.View image in fullscreenThe former French president Nicolas Sarkozy leaves his Paris home to start his sentence.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAFor one thing, diagnosing national decline and blaming it on a kind of pervasive moral rot is practically a French national sport. The practice goes back at least to the 1760s, when defeat in the seven years’ war, and the loss of much of the colonial empire, provoked anguished debate about the population’s supposed lack of patriotic fervour compared to that of the hated English. After Napoleon’s defeat, a generation of writers worried that France’s days of glory and splendour lay in the past. In the mid-19th century, Alexis de Tocqueville criticised his countrymen for submitting to “soft despotism”, and in the midst of the second world war, the great historian Marc Bloch blamed France’s “strange defeat” in large part on the corrosive divisions of the interwar years. More recently, French bestseller lists have featured titles such asLa France Qui Tombe(The France That Falls) andLe SuicideFrançais(The French Suicide). It’s also worth noting that the first book to bear the title The Decline of France waspublished in 1842.But despite all this breast-beating, the country has often shown unexpected resilience in the face of crisis. Earlier in this century, after the large-scale 2005 riots by youths, many of them Muslim, in the miserablesuburbancités, many French writers predicted imminent social breakdown or worse. Drawing on them in 2014, the British academic Andrew Hussey published a controversial book calledThe French Intifada. Yet more than a decade on, his dire predictions have not come to pass, and the French Muslim population remains on a path – difficult and terribly uneven, but a path nonetheless – of integration into French society. Hussey himself hasjust publisheda new, equally pessimistic book entitled Fractured France: A Journey through a Divided Nation, but tellingly focuses as much on the disaffected white working class as on Muslims.France today is unquestionably divided, giving rise to enormous pain and anger. But at the same time, it is worth asking how deep the divisions actually extend, in comparison both to the past and to what exists elsewhere.In the century after the French Revolution, the country was also divided, and the divisions ran deep indeed. Should the country be a monarchy or a republic? Should the Catholic church be the state religion, with control over the educational system? Should the state strive to redress social inequalities? In 1820, the historian Augustin Thierry called France “two nations on the same soil, two nations at war in their memories and irreconcilable in their hopes for the future.” During the revolution of 1848,the Paris Commune of 1871, and the second world war, civil strife took tens of thousands of lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the anger stems above all from a sense of being left out, abandoned by the state and arrogant social elites (both embodied all too well by Macron), rather than from fundamental disagreements over the proper organisation of the state and society. Large majorities favour the maintenance of the social safety net (including national health insurance), gender equality, abortion, birth control, gun control, secular public schooling, and respect for science. The single issue that has cost Macron the most support was his attempt (now suspended) to raise the retirement age by two years. Opponents cast it as a neoliberal betrayal of French workers, but it was an adjustment to the social safety net, not a full-scale repudiation.Compare this situation to the one in the US, where the ferocious polarisation of recent years corresponds to much deeper cultural and ideological divisions. The Maga Republicans want to gut the central government to an extent utterly unimaginable in France. They want to ban abortion and restrict access to birth control, allow virtually unlimited gun ownership in the name of personal freedom, challenge the authority of medical science and reintroduce religion (meaning Christianity) into public classrooms. Democrats (and a substantial portion of the general population) oppose these moves.France still faces enormous challenges in the coming year. It is hard to imagine Macron finding a way out of the current political impasse, and while he adamantly promises to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027, an inability to pass a budget by the end of December, or additional votes of no confidence could yet force his resignation (which70% of the population desires). And it is widely expected that, after Macron, the National Rally will finally come to power.Even so, I have confidence, born out of many years observing the country, that things will not go as badly for the French as the French themselves predict. When it comes to the prize for the “saddest act” among the western democracies, I still think the US deserves the brownie.David A Bell teaches French history at Princeton.

Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats such as olive oil and “polyunsaturated fats from other plant sources can really improve metabolic health and reduce heart disease risk, but that’s not saying that saturated fat is necessarily harmful”, Krauss said. His research also found that replacing saturated fats with sugars and carbohydrates can actually increase heart disease risk.Krauss said that guidelines that create a particular cutoff point for saturated fats, like the current guideline of 10%, tend to be arbitrary.But, Anderson explained, “if you don’t focus so much on where the line might be drawn around how much saturated fat, what you can see is that the more saturated fat that’s consumed in the population, the higher the risk for elevated cholesterol, the more people develop cardiovascular disease”.While Anderson agrees with Krauss that what people choose to eat instead of saturated fats matters, she does not agree that saturated fat is itself “neutral”.“When you look at the current American diet, there’s too much saturated fat in it, and so, currently, it’s not having a neutral impact on our population,” she said.Still, Anderson and Krauss agree that nutritional guidelines should move away from focusing on specific nutrients like saturated fats.“People don’t eat nutrients. They eat foods,” Anderson explained. “When you ask someone what they had to eat, they don’t tell you: ‘I had fat, or I had carbohydrates, or I had protein.’Focusing on foods rather than nutrients is not only less confusing for the public, it’s also more scientifically sound, Krauss says. For example, there is plenty of evidence that meat intake, especially processed red meats, is associated with elevated heart disease risk.“Now the question is: is that due to saturated fat, or is it due to other properties of these meats? And we really don’t have the answer to that,” Krauss said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because of this, nutrition researchers must tease out years of observational data, which can be more difficult to interpret.Inside the Republican network behind big soda’s bid to pit Maga against MahaRead moreTypically, Anderson said, nutritional guidelines are years in the making. It’s not normal for the HHS secretary to change them overnight. Every five years, the dietary guidelines advisory committee publishes theDietary Guidelines for Americansreport based on rigorous review of the latest research. The latest version of that report has yet to be released, but “would have been expected to produce guidance for 2025 through 2030”, Anderson said, adding that the current administration does not appear to be following the usual protocol.Krauss said it appears that report is “being overruled, in a sense”, and he’s not sure what Kennedy’s recommendation will end up looking like. He noted it could have a direct effect on the nutritional makeup of school lunches and military rations, specifically if saturated fat levels in those meals go up to 18% or 19%.According to the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health, the recommended percentage allowed in both school lunches andmilitary rationsare currently less than or equal to 10% of total calories from saturated fat.“That could certainly have an adverse effect on the population’s cholesterol levels, and that would be predicted to impact heart disease risk,” he explained.Krauss continued: “The guy is looking at evidence in a very cherrypicking kind of ways. There’s certain things that he says that sort of fit what I would consider responsible recommendations regarding processed foods, etc, but then it’s mixed up with this other thing, which makes it sound like the whole recommendation is evidence based, but it’s just not true.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrHealthFoodTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She lambasted her former rival as a “tyrant” with “thin skin” who is weaponising the justice system.Harris pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he joked about Republican reaction to the killing of rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel’s ousting was celebrated by Trump, and came after a Trump-appointed regulator threatened ABC.“He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice – and he has done exactly that … His skin is so thin he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process,” she said.Harris also slammed business leaders and institutions in the US whom she accused of submitting to Trump’s tyrannical demands: “There are many … that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.”In a response to the BBC, a White House spokesperson said: “WhenKamala Harrislost the election in a landslide, she should’ve taken the hint – the American people don’t care about her absurd lies.”Harris is on an international book tour promoting 107 Days, her account of her abbreviated 2024 presidential run, which began only after Joe Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his cognitive decline.She blamed the election loss on the unprecedentedly short campaign, but questions about her communication style, authenticity and failure to connect with working-class voters remain unanswered. Harris – and the Democratic party more broadly – have also failed to fully acknowledge the role Biden’s unchecked and uncritical support of what theUN has described as Israel’s “genocidal”war on Gaza played in alienating voters.Explore more on these topicsKamala HarrisDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

An ICE agent administered CPR to Castro Rivera, but he died at the scene, according to the official.The fatal incident took place on the busy Interstate 264 eastbound at the Military Highway interchange in Norfolk in south-eastVirginia. The Virginia state police said they were not involved in the pursuit and the fatal crash remains under investigation.This is the third known deadly incident involving immigrants trying to flee immigration raids by masked, armed federal agents that are spreading across the country, as part of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrants and unprecedented expansion of ICE.In August, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala was killed on the freeway after fleeing an ICE raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, about 20 miles (32km) north-east of downtown Los Angeles. The home improvement retailer, which has long been a meeting spot for employers to recruit documented and undocumented day laborers as roofers, painters and construction workers, has been targeted by the Trump administration for ICE operations.The Guatemalan man’s death came just a month after another deadly ICE raid in southern California.Democratic senators call on education department to stop ICE raids by schoolsRead moreMexican farm worker Jaime Alanís García, 56, died after falling 30ft (9 meters) from a greenhouse while fleeing federal agents at the state-licensed Glass House Farms cannabis facility in Camarillo, Ventura county. Alanís García, who had been living and working in the US for about three decades to support his family in Michoacán, Mexico, climbed onto the roof in a desperate effort to get away from the masked ICE agents and national guard soldiers during the July raid, in which more than 300 people were detained. He suffered catastrophic injuries and was taken off life support after two days.Trump and his anti-immigrant advisers have repeatedly claimed that the unprecedented resources and power being gifted to ICE is about removing “illegal criminals” off American streets.Yet official government data shows thatimmigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in US immigration detention. The number of people with no criminal history arrested byICEand detained by theTrump administrationhas surpassed the number of those charged with crimes.At least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year, according to arecent NPR investigation, making it the deadliest year since 2004.Explore more on these topicsVirginiaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)HondurasUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Robeson’s office said GPS data shows he never visited those locations before he asked the dispatcher to clear him from the scene.They say Bollaro instead headed to Duke’s Pizzeria in Pittstown, where he remained for nearly an hour.

Prosecutors say the two had been shot to death by New Jersey state police lieutenant Ricardo Santos, who had later killed himself.Bollaro has been charged with official misconduct for knowingly refraining from performing his police duties, prosecutors said. He also faces a charge of tampering with public records for knowingly making false entries in his incident report.Bollaro is due to appear in court 5 November.His lawyer, Charles Sciarra, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday but, in a statement to the New York Post, called the charges “unfortunate”. He maintained “nothing Kevin Bollaro did or did not do that day impacted or could have stopped” the killings.The families of the two shooting victims, meanwhile, have said they are “shocked at Sgt Bollaro’s egregious conduct” and believe it is the “tip of the iceberg of the many failures by the local and state police” in the killings, WABC-TV reports.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyUS policingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The Seattle firm operates hundreds of active facilities, with many more in development despite concerns over how much water is being used to cool their vast arrays of circuitry.Amazon defends its approach and has taken steps to manage how efficient its water use is, but it has faced criticism over transparency. Microsoft and Google regularly publish figures for their water consumption, but Amazon hasnever publicly disclosedhow much water its server farms consume.When designing a campaign for water efficiency, the company’s cloud computing division chose to account for only a smaller water usage figure that does not include all the ways its datacentres use water so as to minimise the risk to its reputation, according to a leaked memo seen bySourceMaterialand the Guardian.Amazon as a whole consumed 105bn gallons of water in total in 2021, as much as 958,000 US households, which would make for a city bigger than San Francisco, according to the memo.Asked about the leaked document, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan described it as “obsolete” and said it “completely misrepresents Amazon’s current water usage strategy”.Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead more“A document’s existence doesn’t guarantee its accuracy or finality,” she said. “Meetings often reshape documents or reveal flawed findings or claims.” Callahan would not elaborate on which strategic elements of the document were “obsolete”.The memo was dated one month before Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, debuted a new sustainability campaign in November 2022 called “Water Positive”, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses” by 2030.In the memo, ahead of the campaign’s launch, executives grappled with whether to include public disclosures about “secondary” use – water used in generating the electricity to power its datacentres.They warned that full transparency was “a one-way door” and advised keeping AWS’s projections confidential, even as they feared that their advice could invite accusations of a cover-up. “Amazon hides its water consumption” was one negative headline the authors anticipated.Callaghan said efficiency savings have already been achieved and pointed out that other companies also don’t count secondary water use.Executives opted to use only the relatively smaller figure of primary use, 7.7bn gallons per year, roughly equivalent to 11,600 Olympic swimming pools, when calculating progress towards internal targets because of “reputational risk”, fearing bad publicity if the full scale of Amazon’s consumption was revealed, the document shows. Ultimately as part of the campaign for water efficiency, Amazon aimed to cut its estimated 7.7bn gallon primary consumption to 4.9bn by 2030 – without addressing secondary use.Using the higher of two water usage estimates, the one that would include secondary use, “would double the size and budget” of the campaign “without addressing meaningful operational, regulatory or reputational risks”, they warned, adding that there was “no focus from customers or media” on water used for electricity.“We may decide to release water volumes in the future,” the document said. “But … we should only do so if the lack of data undermines the programme or is required by regulators.”Scientists balked at the selective disclosure and the choice not to include secondary use of water in the total.“In environmental science, it is standard practice to include both to more accurately capture the true water cost of datacentres,” said Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.Amazon’s Water Positive campaign is still active and does not take into account secondary use, while the company continues to keep its current overall water consumption confidential.As US tech companies ride the wave of AI investment and pursue greater heights of computational power, the $2.4tn corporation is building new datacentres in some of the world’s driest areas, SourceMaterial and the Guardianrevealedin April.Feeling water positiveIn November 2022, AWS debuted its new Water Positive sustainability campaign, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses by 2030”. The campaign only applies to AWS. The wider Amazon group, including the world’s biggest online retail business, has an overall water consumption that is far higher, 105bn gallons per year.“The models referenced in this document were preliminary and unvetted,” said Amazon’s Callahan, who declined to provide any alternative figures.The document’s authors advised the company not to release data about the wider company, but they also warned that selective disclosure could lead to accusations of a cover-up. There was “reputational risk of publicly committing to a goal for only a portion of Amazon’s direct water footprint”, they wrote. They even suggested negative headlines that might result including “Amazon disappoints, failing to take full responsibility for water”.“It would be better if they could own up to it,” said a current Amazon software developer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Even if they said it was a low priority, at least that would be honest.”In a sustainability report in August, AWS claimed it had achieved 53% of its Water Positive goal. The division’s plan for reaching the target relies mostly on “water replenishment” projects, some in partnership with Water.org, a non-profit organisation co-founded by actor Matt Damon. The strategy document refers to these projects as “offsets”, describing initiatives like using Amazon computer technology to help utilities prioritise which pipes to fix in order to minimise leaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts said this amounted to incomplete accounting.“Regardless of what sort of offsetting or replenishment you do, it doesn’t necessarily nullify the water footprints of your own operations,” said Tyler Farrow, standards manager at the Alliance for Water Stewardship. “Calling your operations water positive or water neutral is misleading.”Amazon’s Callahan said that the “replenishment spending”, which other tech companies also undertake, is a voluntary, not a regulatory, requirement.“We’ve expanded well beyond what was imagined in the document because it’s the right thing to do for the world and for the communities in which we operate,” she said.‘Obfuscate the water footprint’Amazon is also engineering industry standards to downplay its water use and avert scrutiny, said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at the company.The corporation has funded efforts by the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute non-profits, alongside LimnoTech, a consultancy, “to create a globally accepted methodology for quantifying the benefit of watershed restoration projects”.‘The city that draws the line’: one Arizona community’s fight against a huge datacenterRead moreResponding to questions from SourceMaterial, all three organisations defended their integrity and independence, insisting that Amazon had no undue influence on any methodologies they had created.“They spend a lot of time creating methodologies that are used to obfuscate the water footprint,” Wangusi said, referring to Amazon.Callahan said Wangusi’s claim was “contradicted by facts”. “Amazon’s water use reporting is based on third-party assured data from actual utility bills, not estimates or self-reporting,” she said. Wangusi’s claim, though, was not about Amazon’s water-use reporting, but about measuring the effects of water offsets.Callahan said these efforts were “standard practice” and that Amazon’s “customers expect us to hold ourselves accountable to credible guidance and best practices”.As well as choosing not to disclose water use from electricity generation, Amazon has estimated its larger “indirect” water footprint, the document shows. This extra usage, which falls under a classification known as “scope 3”, includes water for production and construction – in Amazon’s case, mostly irrigation of cotton plantations supplying its fashion brands, and vegetables for its grocery arm, Amazon Fresh.Here, too, Amazon decided to keep its consumption confidential, even though “indirect water use represents roughly 90% of Amazon’s total water footprint”, according to the document.AWS avoided establishing targets for indirect water use because that figure would be “much more significant for the rest of Amazon, especially in the agricultural supply chain, and the team does not want to establish a standard for addressing scope 3 water use that the rest of Amazon would need to follow, given the larger resource implications”, the authors wrote.“You don’t need to obscure or obfuscate,” said Wangusi, who believes he was “hounded out” of Amazon for criticising the company’s approach. (Amazon declined to comment on his departure.)“It doesn’t make you more profitable,” he said. “It makes you less trustworthy.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Instances cited include describing global heating as “the climate scam” and suggesting the government was going to introduce “enforced veganism”.Ofcom has received 1,221 complaints related to the climate crisis since January 2020, when its searchable database began. None resulted in a ruling that the broadcasting code had been breached. In fact, only two such breaches have been found since 2007.More than 50 of the complaints were made by the campaign group Reliable Media about GB News programmes since March 2024. The group said the segments included false statements about climate breakdown that had either gone unchallenged or had failed to be balanced. Ofcom assessed but did not pursue any of the complaints. The campaigners accused Ofcom of “effectively suspending its accuracy rules on this life-and-death issue”.GB News viewers more likely to wrongly believe net migration to UK rising, study findsRead moreIn contrast, the French regulator Arcom has found four broadcasting code breaches related to the climate crisis in the last two years. In one, the rightwing channel CNews wasfined €20,000(£17,000) for a segment in which a speaker said climate change was “a lie, a scam”.GB News said the campaigners were politically motivated and wanted to shut down public debate.The Guardian reviewed a sample of 18 of the complaints made by Reliable Media. They included the GB News host Ben Leo describing global heating as“the climate scam”in April 2025 and a guest on a September 2024 show hosted by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage,criticising those“who say ‘Oh global warming, global warming, global warming’ as though this were a problem. You just go outside tonight, you’ll see it isn’t really”. In November 2024, the GB News host Leo Kearse misleadingly suggested that the UK government was going tointroduce “enforced veganism”.A regular contributor to the Headliners show, Lewis Schaffer, claimed in July 2024that “climate change is rubbish”and that “climate is the full-on war” as opposed to a “culture war”. A few weeks earlier Schafferclaimed“the truth is climate change is not a real thing” and that “we’ve been lied to”.View image in fullscreenLewis Schaffer claimed in July 2024 that ‘climate change is rubbish’ and that ‘climate is the full-on war’ as opposed to a ‘culture war’.Photograph: GB NewsAnother guestsaid in June 2024that “since 1979 we’ve been checking the change and comparing it with the forecast of the UN models … and it just doesn’t happen as advertised”. In fact, UN climate modelshave been remarkably accurate.The burning of fossil fuels has“unequivocally caused global warming”, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC is a collaboration of thousands of leading scientists and its conclusions are signed off by its 195 member countries, including the UK. “Widespread losses and damages to nature and people” will continue to intensify, the IPCC said, and rapid cuts in carbon emissions to net zero are required: “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.”Ofcom’sbroadcasting coderequires that factual programmes “must not materially mislead the audience” and that “news, in whatever form, must be reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality”. The code further requires that “alternative viewpoints must be adequately represented” when programme presenters express their own views on matters of political controversy or public policy. Guidance notes for the code add that: “An example of an issue which Ofcom considered to be broadly settled is the scientific principles behind the theory of anthropogenic global warming.”“Obviously we’re all free as individuals to hold whatever opinions we like,” said Richard Wilson, the director of Reliable Media. “But running a TV or radio station [means] you’re promising to uphold some pretty basic standards around truth and accuracy. The problem is that Ofcom is now allowing some TV and radio stations to flout the rules and on an issue like climate change the stakes could not be higher.”Ofcom was “hiding behind a simplistic and distorted definition of freedom of expression”, he said, adding that Arcom’s approach in France showed it was possible for regulators to take robust action on climate misinformation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In line with the right to freedom of expression, our rules allow for robust debate about topical issues, and broadcasters are free to include controversial opinions in their programmes, providing they comply with the code.”In a response to a freedom of information request,Ofcom said“there have been no recent investigations” relating to climate change. It said the only investigations it held on record were from 2017 and 2007, in whichBBC Radio 4andChannel 4respectively were judged to have breached the broadcasting code.AGB Newsspokesperson said: “Like all these politically motivated activist groups the only thing that is ‘reliable’ is their desire to shut down public debate – even when a broadcaster is fully compliant with the rules. Unfortunately for them they are losing. GB News is fearless in its coverage of all perspectives including those which might challenge so-called consensus.”Arcom has declared four breaches of its broadcasting code related to climate change since 2023. As well as fining CNews for the 2023 television segment in which a speaker said climate change was “a lie, a scam” and “a form of totalitarianism”, Sud Radioreceivedwarningsafter programmes in which “several statements contradicted or minimised the existing scientific consensus on current climate change, in treatment lacking rigour and without contradiction”, which constituted “a failure by the company to fulfil its obligation of honesty”.Arcom’s deputy director, Pauline Combredet-Blassel,said in April: “Since there is a scientific consensus on climate change, we verify whether it is referenced in the disputed segment, and we only intervene if it is not.”Eva Morel, atQuotaClimat, the French campaign group that filed the climate complaints to Arcom, said: “It is perfectly OK to have different opinions on climate change. What becomes problematic is when a society can no longer agree on facts, because facts are the foundation of trust, which in turn underpins law, and ultimately, democracy.”She added: “When the media blur the line between facts and opinions, it doesn’t lead people to trust in alternative truths; it leads them to trust in nothing at all.

The migration is an eye-catching phenomenon loved by tourists and treasured by residents.Photograph: APSpawning typically occurs like clockwork in line with the lunar cycle, although the length of the migration can vary, triggered by the first heavy rains of the wet season, usually around October or November.Migration started a little earlier than usual this year, which was expected due to a negative Indian Ocean Dipole and warmer-than-usual waters - ripe conditions for rainfall in the region.It was not yet clear if and how climate change was impacting crabs or their migration patterns, although Mr Tiernan said the island was expected to experience more severe dry periods as global temperatures rose, accompanied by more intense downpours once they finally arrived.The annual migration creates plenty of work for park rangers, who use rakes to keep them clear of the busiest roads.Crab safety is taken seriously, with eco-hotel Swell Lodge’s owner, Chris Bray, developing a contraption to put on the front of vehicles to gently steer them out of harm’s way.Bray said he was forced to develop the “crab mobile” to travel to and from the lodge, with other residents typically able to stick with cleared and drivable roads.The design has changed little in the six years it has been in use.“The most important thing was it had to be durable, basic, easy to make and repair, and had to work even on the pretty rough roads around here, following the contours even in an eroded four-wheel-drive track,” he said.Explore more on these topicsChristmas IslandWildlifeAnimalsConservationShareReuse this content"

Before her death, Chloe had reported her former partner Marc Masterton to police, giving a two-hour video interview as evidence against him.After her death, Masterton was convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour and jailed for 41 months. He was later jailed for three years and seven months after a second woman came forward to report that she had been in a violent and abusive relationship with him.After Chloe’s death, Holland decided to campaign for a new law to bring perpetrators to justice, only to realise that laws already existed, they were just rarely used to secure prosecutions.“I decided it wasn’t a new law I needed, as existing laws were already there, and after finding out how much my daughter had been failed previous to her taking her life by the police and many other agencies, they needed to do their job properly, and things needed to change,” she said.“Over 47 families have found me and only four of us have had a conviction,” she added. “I was so shocked to see so many families who have been fighting the police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for years and getting no justice for their child or sibling, and didn’t have a voice and couldn’t speak out in case it affected investigations that weren’t possibly going anywhere.”Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie’s daughter Hannah died in May 2017 at the age of 30, in what she described as “the final act of violence” in a campaign of abuse.View image in fullscreenSaskia Lightburn-Ritchie: ‘When someone dies by suicide after they’ve endured domestic abuse, we have to investigate it for what it really is, which is homicide.’Photograph: MYCWA“[Hannah] was vibrant, she was loving,” Lightburn-Ritchie said. “She was full of promise, and she was an amazing, really loving mum to her two children, and she died by suicide after two years in a relationship where she was systematically destroyed by her partner.“She was physically beaten, she was psychologically tortured, she was controlled and broken down piece by piece until she could not see a way forward. The man who did this to her walked free because we call it suicide, we close the file and we move on.”Lightburn-Ritchie, however, could not move on, she said. “In truth, Hannah didn’t just die by suicide. She was killed. She was killed slowly and deliberately over a two-year period, and when I went to the police, when I begged them to investigate what he had done to her, I was told that there was nothing that they could do.“There was no investigation into her death. The domestic homicide review, which I had to fight for, took five years and changed nothing. A four-day inquest found death by suicide despite huge evidence over a very traumatic four-day period of domestic abuse and failings by multiple services.”Lightburn-Ritchie told the meeting that for eight years she had “been fighting a system that refuses to see what is right in front of it”.She said the Suicide is Homicide campaign was critical “because when someone dies by suicide after they’ve endured domestic abuse, we have to investigate it for what it really is, which is homicide.“We need to use the legislation we currently have effectively and it really isn’t happening at the moment, and we need to hold abusers accountable for driving their victims to death.“We have the laws. We need the will, we need police to investigate properly. We need the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute. We need judges to understand that words and control can kill just as much as hands and weapons.”At a second meeting in the House of Commons, chaired by the Labour MP Kirith Entwistle, and attended by the safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, the bereaved relatives again told their stories.Alex Davies-Jones, the minister for victims, told the meeting: “These deaths are often written off as if they were their decision, they chose to do this, when, in truth, these were the culmination of actually somebody else’s violence, and these aren’t isolated stories.”“Our law is broken, we know that,” she said. “Particularly around homicide, around murder or manslaughter, it is piecemeal. It’s not written in statute anyway, it has been developed with common law practices for centuries, and it is no longer fit for purpose, quite frankly, it’s the world that we currently live in.“I’m not going to pretend that it’s going to be easy to fix. It is incredibly complex and difficult, especially when you look at the issue of homicide, but we recognise that it needs to be looked at.”A CPS spokesperson said: “Domestic abuse is a heinous crime and our prosecutors are actively advised to consider murder and manslaughter charges in suicide cases where there is a known context of domestic abuse or other controlling or coercive behaviour.“We have previously charged a number of defendants for causing the death of a partner they abused, including in proceedings which are currently active.“We are also working with police and other stakeholders to ensure these kinds of offences are well-understood – so that we can bring perpetrators to justice for the full extent of their crimes.”In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

Turkey has said it is willing to offer troops, but Israel has let it be known that it disapproves of Turkish troops taking part in the force.Tensions between Israel and Turkey have grown over Syria and the Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanis seen by the Israeli government as too close to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Hamas itself. But the exclusion of Turkey from the stabilisation force would be controversial since it is one of the guarantors of the Trump 20-point ceasefire agreement, and is seen as one of the most capable Muslim armed forces.The force is still likely to be led byEgypt.Other contributors to the stabilisation force, such as Indonesia and the Emiratis, would still prefer the force to be given a UN security council mandate, even if it is not itself a UN peacekeeping force.Instead it will coordinate with a US-led military cell, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC), based in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Gat. The cell, which includes a small number of British, French, Jordanian and Emirati advisers was inaugurated on Tuesday by the US vice-president, JD Vance. The CMCC also appears to be taking on an aid coordination role inGaza, although key aid crossings remain closed.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that the US should do more to put pressure on Israel to abide by its commitments in the Trump peace plan.Photograph: Dia Images/Getty ImagesThe force will be tasked with disarming Hamas and securing a transitional Palestinian government, the formation of which is still being contested. The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has ruled out Palestinian Authority involvement in postwar Gaza, although on Friday the main Palestinian factions agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of the strip.In a sign of the tensions betweenTurkeyand Israel, Turkish disaster response specialists sent to help locate Palestinian and Israeli bodies inside Gaza remained near Egypt’s border with the strip on Thursday, awaiting Israeli authorisation to enter.The 81-member team from Turkey’s AFAD disaster management authority are waiting to enter with life-detection devices and trained search dogs.Erdoğan told reporters on Friday that the US should do more to put pressure on Israel, including through sanctions and arms sales bans, to abide by its commitments in the Trump plan.Rubio also said there could be no role for the UN’s Palestinian relief works agency, Unrwa, in Gaza due to the agency being a “subsidiary of Hamas”.His remarks will put him at odds with many European countries, the UN itself, and the international court of justice (ICJ), which said in an advisory opinion this week that the Unrwa was an irreplaceable vehicle to distribute aid inside Gaza.The ICJ did not accept that Israel had provided incontrovertible evidence that Unrwa had been irretrievably infiltrated by Hamas.Joint US-Israeli opposition to Unrwa presents a dilemma since Donald Trump, in his 20-point plan, has accepted a role for the UN in distributing aid in Gaza, but seems intent on excluding Unrwa, the main relevant aid agency. The UN faces a choice over whether or not to confront Trump over Unrwa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the Trump ceasefire plan, accepted by Israel, 600 aid trucks were due to enter Gaza daily. But since the agreement, the daily average has been 89 trucks a day on average – only 14% of the agreed amount.Unrwa criticised Israel, saying: “Since the start of the war in Gaza, the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has also seen a sharp escalation of violence.“Families know only fear and uncertainty. The growing annexation of the West Bank continues unabated, in flagrant violation of international law. This must stop. The future of Gaza and the West Bank are one.”The head of the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, Tom Fletcher, speaking to the BBC, said of his recent visit to Gaza: “It felt to me like I was driving through the ruins of Hiroshima, or Stalingrad, or Dresden”.Delegations from Hamas led by Khalil al-Hayya, and its rival,Fatah, led by Hussein Al-Sheikh, met in Egypt on Friday to discuss post-war arrangements in the Gaza Strip.Hamas said it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators that “the war has effectively ended”.A joint statement published on the Hamas website said the groups had agreed during a meeting in Cairo to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent ‘technocrats’, which will manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuTurkeyEuropeMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

The €5 fee was controversial at the time, but it did nothing to deter tourists, with more than 4 million visiting the site in 2024. Long queues often form in Piazza della Rotonda outside the monument.It is not the only tragedy to have struck tourists in Rome this year. In March, a 55-year-old woman from Spain died after falling from a high wall at the side of the Spanish Steps.In April, Grant Paterson, a tourist from Scotland,died after suffering severe burnsin a suspected gas explosion at a building in Rome where he was staying in rented accommodation.Paterson, 54, had arrived in the city a few days before the incident on a solo trip, visiting sites including the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and the Colosseum.There has been a boom in visitor numbers to Rome since the coronavirus pandemic, with a new record of 22.2m arrivals set in 2024.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The facility opened in August and is the second of its kind, located in eastern Ukraine not far from the frontline and thecity of Pokrovsk, in Donetsk oblast. “We are 6 metres below the earth. It’s the safest way of providing help to our injured soldiers. And it keeps medical personnel safe,” said the clinic’s surgeon, Maj Oleksandr Holovashchenko.The stabilisation point treats 30-40 patients a day. Their conditions vary. Some have catastrophic leg injuries requiring amputations, or serious stomach wounds. Others can walk. Almost all are the victims of Russian first-person view (FPV) drones, which drop grenades with lethal accuracy. “Ninety per cent of our cases are from FPVs. We see few bullet injuries. It’s an age of drones and a different kind of war,” the surgeon said.View image in fullscreenMaj Oleksandr Holovashchenko at the underground facility for treating wounded soldiers in eastern Ukraine.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianDuring one afternoon last week, three soldiers limped into the facility. The most lightly injured, 28-year-old Artem Dvorskyi, said an FPV explosion had ripped a small hole in his leg. “War is terrible. The guy next to me, Vasyl, was killed,” he said. “He fell down. Then the Russians dropped a second grenade on him.” He added: “Everything in the village is destroyed. There are drones everywhere and bodies. Ours and theirs.”Dvorskyi said his unit spent 43 days in a forest area near Pokrovsk, which Russia has beentrying to seize since last year. The only way to get to their position was on foot. All supplies arrived by quadcopter: food and water. A week after he was hurt, he walked 5km (about 3 miles), taking three hours, to where an armoured vehicle was able to pick him up. At the clinic, a medic checked his vital signs. After treatment, a nurse gave him new civilian clothes: a T-shirt and a pair of pale jeans.View image in fullscreenArtem Dvorskiy, 28, said a first-person view drone ripped a small hole in his leg.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAnother patient, 38-year-old Pavlo Filipchuk, said a drone blast had left him with concussion. “I was in a dugout. It suddenly went dark. I couldn’t feel anything or hear anything,” he said. “I think I was lucky to survive. My cousin has been killed. There are continuous explosions.” A builder working in Lithuania, Filipchuk said he had returned toUkraineand volunteered to fight days before Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.A third soldier, Taras Mykolaichuk, had been hit in the back. He groaned as doctors laid him on a bed, removed a bloody bandage and cleaned his two-day-old shrapnel wound. Wrapped in a foil blanket, he borrowed a mobile phone to ring his sister. “A piece of mortar hit me. It was a ricochet. I’m OK,” he told her. What were his plans now? “To get better. That will take a few months. After that, to return to my unit. Someone has to defend our country,” he said.View image in fullscreenDoctors treat Taras Mykolaichuk, who was hit in the back by a piece of mortar.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSince 2022, Russia has repeatedly targeted hospitals, clinics,maternity wardsand ambulances.

It is also stocking a bigger range of vapes and nicotine pouches.The action plan is to tackle a big sales drop after theApril hackthat resulted in gaps on its shelves.Called Powering Up: Focus Sprint: Cigs, Tobacco and Vape, the document says: “Sales haven’t recovered compared to pre-cyber.” In a section headed “Why we need to focus on this category?”, it says there are “£1m missing sales per week” and 100,000 fewer transactions.It states: “We know at least 40% of this is customers forming a new habit, shopping elsewhere as they wouldn’t go without their cigarettes, tobacco or vapes. This means we’ve also lost sales from what would’ve been in their basket.”The Co-op’s approach to selling vape products in its more than 2,000 grocery stores complies with UK legislation and government guidelines but staff have raised concerns about whether it is contrary to its standing as an “ethical” retailer.On its website, the Co-op spells out that it puts “principles before profit”. It says: “As well as having clear financial and operational objectives and employing 54,000 people, we’re a recognised leader for our social goals and community-led programmes.”The activity comes at a time of mounting concern about youthvapingafterevidence showingthat the numbers of under-18s trying or using vapes has soared in recent years. The brightly coloured packaging and flavours such as bubblegum or candy floss are a significant part of their appeal.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has raised concerns about the marketing of vapes, saying: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.”A source told the Guardian that staff had not been told explicitly to sell more vapes but whereas before their presence in store was low-key, there were now ads strategically placed in high-traffic areas and eye-catching display units.“Before [the hack] even if I didn’t always enjoy work I respected the Co-op,” the source said. “They present the lovely idea of ethical shopping – you might pay a bit more but they are doing things right. This strategy goes against everything we’ve done until now.”They said the Co-op was known for its ethical business model and that set it apart from other companies. “This recent decision to exploit a known health problem and make a profit goes against the values the Co-op was built on and stands for.”The government’s tobacco and vapes bill, which is making its way through parliament, will outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship. It will also restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products.A Co-op spokesperson said: “As a member-owned organisation, our longstanding commitment to ethical values and responsible retailing remains steadfast and at the heart of how we do business.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a recent business update, the retailer said the fallout pushed it into the red in the first six months of its financial year.The cyber-attack led to gaps on shelves in its grocery stores, while its more than 800 funeral parlours were forced to return to operating some services via paper-based systems because of having no access to digital services.The upheaval wiped more than £200m off sales, and the group anticipates the final bill will result in a £120m hit to full-year profits.The document seen by the Guardian relates to what is a store-wide “Power Up” programme covering all product categories.Explore more on these topicsCo-operative GroupSupermarketsRetail industryVapingSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

Customers do not have to pay the full cost of their flights upfront – they can spread the cost over instalments.AndAirbnbannounced in late 2023 that it was teaming up with Klarna in the UK so guests could spread the cost of stays over weeks or months. The service is available for reservations priced between £35 and £4,000.Data issued this week showed that searches on Google for phrases such as “buy now pay later flights” and “buy now pay later hotels” are up sharply on earlier this year, suggesting people are looking for ways to book more flexibly.BNPL is a form of credit where the cost of what you are buying is typically split into three or four instalments. If you keep to your repayment plan, you will not usually pay interest or charges.However, there is concern that some people could end up taking out loans they cannot afford to pay back on time, thereby incurring charges, tipping them into debt and damaging their credit score.Experts warn that using BNPL to pay for holidays or trips also offers fewer consumer protections than more traditional credit.“While it can be really convenient, it’s worth remembering that it doesn’t come with the same protections as a credit card,” says Matthew Sheeran from Money Wellness, a debt solutions and budgeting website.If you pay with a credit card, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act means that if a purchase between £100 and £30,000 goes wrong, the credit card provider is jointly liable with the retailer.Sheeran says that with BNPL, if there is a problem, “you’ll usually have to chase the retailer or travel provider yourself, which can be stressful and time-consuming. It’s worth checking whether the BNPL provider offers any dispute process, but these aren’t as robust or guaranteed as section 75”.He adds that while this form of payment is fine for smaller low-risk purchases, for bigger spends, a credit card still offers a safety net.“BNPL is starting to edge into travel because it offers a way for people to ‘buy now, budget later’,” says Maisie Blewitt at Transfer Travel, an online marketplace where people can buy and sell unused trips.She says that if you pay using BNPL and the airline or hotel goes bust, for example, your money could be at risk of being lost.“Refunds can be messy, too, because if a trip is cancelled, instalments can keep coming out of your account until the refund clears, which could take weeks,” she says.She adds that as this is a developing area of regulation, terms and protections can differ from provider to provider.“Before using buy now, pay later for a holiday, make sure you carefully read and fully understand the small print,” says Blewitt.People who use BNPL in this way typically do not have to pay for the trip before they travel, so charges may still be coming out of their account months after they have been away.There is no universal maximum spending limit, so how much you can borrow depends on which provider you use, your creditworthiness, and how much risk it is willing to take.“It feels risk-free, and that’s the problem,” says Sebrina McCullough from Money Wellness. “Interest-free offers make it feel like a payment method, not borrowing. But it’s still credit, and if you use it to fund what you can’t afford, the risks grow.”The UK’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is to start regulating BNPL from July 2026.This means BNPL loans will become regulated credit agreements and, crucially, people using this form of credit will be covered by section 75. They will also be able to access the Financial Ombudsman Service if they need to make a complaint.Explore more on these topicsBuy now, pay laterTravel & leisureConsumer affairsConsumer rightsAirbnbFlightsHotelsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The titular “summer people” are the Allisons from New York, who rent the same off-grid country cottage each year. This time, instead of heading back to the city, they decide to extend their holiday for a month longer – something that seems to unsettle everyone in the nearby town. All pass on the same veiled caution that nobody has ever stayed at the lake beyond Labor Day. Nonetheless, the Allisons are determined to remain, and that’s when things start to get increasingly weird. The man who delivers the kerosene won’t sell to them. No one will deliver groceries to the cottage, and when the Allisons attempt to drive into town, the car won’t start. A storm gathers, the batteries in the radio fade, and as darkness falls, “the two old people huddled together in their summer cottage and waited”. What are the Allisons waitingfor? What do the locals know? Every time I read Jackson’s unnerving and inspiring story, I’m reminded that the best horror comes from what’s left undisclosed.Saltwashby Andrew Michael Hurleyis published byJohn Murray.Mariana EnríquezRinging the Changes by Robert AickmanIn this short story a couple travel to an ordinary seaside town where bells ring the whole time, a constant chiming that is annoying and inexplicable. The first very scary scene happens at night, when they decide to take a walk and they can’t find the sea. There’s sand, there’s the smell of rotting fish and salt, there are waves, but the sea is a ghost, or something else and worse. It’s just insanely sinister and every time I go to a beach at night I think about this story that ruined the sea at night for me – in a good way.The newlyweds – she’s very young, he’s not – go back to the hotel and find out why the bells ring, in a long sequence of claustrophobia, necro-orgy and death-and-the-maiden meets danse macabre pandemonium. It’s an unnerving meditation on desire and decay, two bodies aging together as a couple, the attachment and violence and tenderness of marriage.Not only the scariest, but probably one of the best short stories out there, and a personal favourite. I read it in Spanish, in the first edition of Aickman stories to be published in Argentina in 2011, La aparición, edited by Matías Serra Bradford and translated by Agustín Pico Estrada and Laura Wittner.Somebody Is Walking on Your Grave by Mariana Enríquez, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Granta.Catriona WardView image in fullscreenZombie by Joyce Carol OatesI read Zombie by a pool in France in 2020. Despite the sunshine I felt cold creep through me. I also felt the electricity of excitement. I was writing my third novel,The Last House on Needless Street, and I had hit a wall. I didn’t know if there was any good way to write some of the fearful things the book contains. Reading Zombie, I saw that it was possible.Published in 1995, the novel is a dark flight through the mind of a young serial killer, Quentin P, based on Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer who murdered and dismembered 17 young men and boys in Milwaukee between 1978 and 1991. Infamously, Dahmer was obsessed with creating a zombie sex slave who would never leave him and made many grisly attempts to do so.The acts the novel describes are horrific, but equally frightening is its psychological persuasiveness. Quentin P’s terrible, fragmented world is simply narrated in spare prose, names redacted. The reader is sunk deep, trapped in his consciousness, forced to witness thoughts and actions that appal. The foreignness of his mind is like a physical shock – or being stranded on a barren alien world. Going into Zombie is less like reading than a full body experience. You are swallowed whole.Nowhere Burning by Catriona Wardwill be published by Viper inFebruary 2026.Daisy JohnsonView image in fullscreenWhite Is for Witching by Helen OyeyemiWhen I was a child, I sleepwalked and later started having night terrors. Once, the terror involved a dream in which I was stuck in a box and, when I woke up, I found that I had torn off the slat from the window, trying to get out. That house was crumbling; when it rained heavily the downstairs hall filled with water, fly larvae fell from the ceiling on to my parents’ bed, and once a large rat scaled the curtains in my sister’s room.When a friend gave me Helen Oyeyemi’s novel,I was no longer living with my parents, but the story of the house high on the Dover cliffs felt familiar to me, homesick as I was. It is a novel about a haunted, noisy, emotional house and a girl who eats chalk from the cliffs. I loved the book so much and returned again and again to it, always finding something new.The Hotel by Daisy Johnsonis published by Vintage.Ned BeaumanInfinite Jest at 20: 20 things you need to knowRead moreIncarnations of Burned Childrenby David Foster WallaceIf you were ever swapping scary stories around a campfire, and everyone else was talking about ghosts and ghouls and hitchers with hooks for hands, but when your turn came you adjusted your spectacles and said, “Actually, I think nothing is scarier than the thought of a parent accidentally harming their child” – well, you probably wouldn’t get invited camping again. Which is why I was reluctant to select this David Foster Wallace story about a baby getting burned by boiling water. It is not appropriate for Halloween; it will not give you anything resembling a delicious shiver down your spine. But the fact is, no other piece of fiction I have ever read, supernatural or otherwise, has haunted me like this one has, so it would be dishonest to pick anything else.And that’s despite my not being a parent – which, indeed, Wallace wasn’t, either. So, who knows, maybe this is just a bachelor’s idea of what hurting your child might be like, particularly since it first appeared in Esquire magazine, between an ad for hair-loss cream and another for Marlboro Lights. But for me, this story isn’t only about parenting, it’s about the possibility that out of sheer random chance you might become culpable for something that ruins someone else’s life as well as your own. In that sense, it may not look like horror fiction but it certainly functions as horror fiction.Also, Wallace was a Stephen King fan and put his novels on the syllabus when he taught college English, so as you read this scene of a mother and father tending helplessly to their maimed little son, it’s reasonable to wonder if Wallace had Pet Sematary at the back of his mind.The Captive by Ned Beauman, writing as Kit Burgoyne, is published by Titan.Stephen Graham JonesView image in fullscreenThe Girl Next Door by Jack KetchumHumans are the worst monsters. You never know what’s going on in your neighbour’s basement. But sometimes you do, and sometimes you’re part of it … It’s summer for some kids in 1950s suburban America, but instead of having a mystery to solve, a monster to put down, they have to face the darkness in themselves, and then live with that new awareness.You come out the other side of reading this book a different person, never mind if you liked it or not. This isn’t a novel you’re reallysupposedto like, yet it has a moral centre all the same. The question is: do you think that way too? Even for a glimmer of a moment, do you identify with someone here? The best art is dangerous and doesn’t flinch. This is that.The Buffalo Hunterby Stephen Graham Jonesis published by Titan.Hollie StarlingView image in fullscreenI Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonA century after humanity’s extermination, five people remain on Earth, kept alive and tortured for the sadistic pleasure of an omniscient supercomputer. Don’t be put off if you’re not a sci-fi reader; neither am I. Let me put you off another way. I first read the story in the waiting room at Doncaster station where my train home from university was often cancelled, meaning the two purgatories are sensorily wedded, like a madeleine made of melted eyeballs. I felt my tender brain plasticise around Ellison’s descriptions, sick and gleeful at being made toactuallyconsider “the smell of sulphur, of rancid butter … of human scalps”. I hated it then for what I couldn’t un-know. I hate it now because Ellison wrote it in one sitting without edits. His exquisite vision of synthetic hell is afirst draft.Reading it back, I find the camp excess very funny, but the famously nihilist ending is still the most frightening thing I’ve known. The horror of forces beyond our control – whether savage god, hostile landscape or distorted ideology – jangle my nerves more than any flimsy old ghost and was chief in my mind while putting together Bog People, a new collection of folk horror. My own contribution, Yellowbelly, also intersects with tech incrementalism but – I have no trouble admitting – pulls back from the brink. More dark parable, less dark night of the soul. A rail replacement bus to Scunthorpe is horror enough.Bog People: A Working-Class Anthology of Folk Horror, edited by Hollie Starling, is published by Chatto & Windus.Eric LaRoccaView image in fullscreenThe Auctioneer by Joan SamsonSamson wrote only one novel in her lifetime. In a sharp, corrosive story that predates Stephen King’s masterpiece Needful Things or Shirley Jackson’s seminal The Lottery, The Auctioneer is a chilling descent into the hell of small-town madness as a result of greed and paranoia.Set against the bucolic backdrop of a small community in the hills of New Hampshire, the story centres on a charismatic figure named Perly Dunsmore who arrives in the town of Harlowe and charms the unsuspecting townspeople into donating personal items for a community auction. As his grip on the community intensifies, Perly’s demands of the residents become more and more disconcerting. It is a wonderfully chilling meditation on the erosion of a close-knit community by an outsider with malevolent intentions.I think what continues to disturb me about this novel is how so much of the horror is grounded in reality. There are no obvious supernatural elements at play. Instead, it’s centred around human cruelty and suffering.We Are Always Tender With Our Dead by Eric LaRoccais published by Titan.Intan Paramaditha‘She wrote the best first line – and the most chilling stories’: Stephen King on the dark brilliance of Daphne du MaurierRead moreUrban legendWhen I was a child in Indonesia, I heard an urban legend that terrified me: if you didn’t rinse and properly wrap your menstrual pad, a ghost would come for you. The story went that a girl once left her pad unwashed in a toilet. When she returned to fetch a forgotten ring, she found the door ajar. Inside squatted a woman with long black hair, her back to her. Slowly, she turned. A pale face, lips slick red – and in her hands, the girl’s unwashed pad. The ghost licked it clean.That vision haunted me, but years later I understood it was more than a ghost story. It was also a lesson in shame, a way of disciplining girls’ bodies, teaching us that blood was dirty, dangerous, in need of secrecy.It inspired me to write Blood, published in my collection Apple and Knife. In the story, the narrator must confront the same cautionary tale told by her Qur’an teacher. As an adult copywriter in Jakarta, she is tasked with selling sanitary pads by casting menstruation as monstrous. Memories of becoming a woman and the relentless policing of her body collide with a vision of the ghost who appears in the office toilet, licking menstrual blood.Horror, for me, exposes how society treats women’s bodies as abject, shameful. Writing Blood was a way of reclaiming what had once made me afraid. The ghost still lingers, but now she walks beside me, her mouth red, her hunger reminding me of demonised, unruly, disobedient women.Apple and Knife by Intan Paramaditha, translated by Stephen J Epstein, is published by Vintage Classics.Paul TremblayTiptoe by Laird BarronView image in fullscreenRandall Vance is a photographer who grew up in the 1960s, the youngest of two children in an upper-middle class family. His enigmatic father, an engineer for IBM, liked to play a game called “tiptoe”. He would sneak up on his sons and pinch them. Sounds harmless enough, right? But his father never lost, never got caught, and the game represented his rather Darwinian philosophy that hinted at a secret ocean of menace. Maybe.First appearing in the Shirley Jackson tribute anthology When Things Get Dark, Tiptoe works, on one level, as a clever homage tinged with the wicked wit and everyday weirdness of a Jackson tale. There’s fraught family dynamics that are quaint and deeply dysfunctional. There’s class anxiety mixed within the ugly spectre of American history. There’s even an eccentric aunt who makes believable claims to being psychic. While there is nothing expressly supernatural in the story and no scenes of explicit violence on the page, I’ve never had a story get under my skin in the way Tiptoe does. It picks at one of our oldest, hardwired fears, that of being the unwitting prey to a predator that we are not equipped to avoid.Barron got my nervous leg twitching on the second page with “What I do know, is he was the kind of guy nobody saw coming.” It’s a chilling tone-setter to a story that becomes more ominous with every page. That line and all the unspoken hints and secrets are there, queuing up behind you, somewhere over your shoulder, there to see plainly if you only dare look. And in the last two breathtaking pages, Laird makes you look.Horror Movie by Paul Tremblayis published by Titan.CJ TudorView image in fullscreenDoctor Sleep by Stephen KingI spent most of my childhood being scared. I was scared of the dark, monsters, ghosts. I was scared of the derelict playground up the street, the house opposite where someone killed themselves. The list was long, random and inexhaustible.Despite this, I was also attracted to creepy stuff. I would watch horror films at my friend Kirsty’s house and read any scary books I could get my hands on.When I was trying to think of a book that scared me, I considered Stephen King – The Shining and Pet Sematary. But then I realised that those were books that had scared me as a kid. They didn’t hit so hard as an adult. Because your fears change.That’s what brought me to Doctor Sleep. The sequel to The Shining was published in 2013, the same year I had my daughter. And as a parent your greatest fear is something happening to your child.In Doctor Sleep the monsters of the book are the True Knot, a quasi-immortal group that hunts and kills children with the “shining”. Psychic vampires, they feed on the life force of their young victims. One of those victims is a young boy called Bradley Trevor who is abducted by the True Knot.King never describes in detail what they do to Bradley, but one line always haunted me: “The boy lasted a long time. He screamed until his vocal cords ruptured and his cries became husky barks.”I thought about that. A lot. My mind kept going back to it. Gnawing over it.The Gathering by CJ Tudoris published by Penguin.Alma KatsuView image in fullscreenThe Road by Cormac McCarthyThis is hands down the most realistic dystopian novel ever written. The unrelenting despair and undeniable reality of the world Cormac McCarthy has depicted will drive an icy spike of terror into your heart with every page. This will be us, your inner voice tells you, if the world doesn’t change.Adding to the verisimilitude, I was on a road trip with my husband when we listened to the audiobook. I’d had a rough idea of what the novel was about but not the specifics. With every mile, as the story got bleaker, I waited for my husband to tell me “enough”. He’s not much for fiction, let alone anything as dark as this, but we listened to every word.McCarthy does not tell us why civilisation ended, though – because the main characters are heading south to escape the killing winters, it’s been attributed to climate change. Does it really matter? A clever touch of the author’s is that the only characters you encounter are “have-nots”. There might be “haves” hunkered down on private islands stocked for survival, a truth for the modern day, but we don’t see them. The author knew, I think, that when the world has been laid to waste, through either stupidity or malice, you will only be a “have” for a matter of time. Time runs out for everyone, too late to see that we’re all in this together.Fiendby Alma Katsuispublished by Titan.Explore more on these topicsBooksHorror booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But forget the ghosts – this is really just a golden opportunity to weep with laughterSarah DempsterSat 25 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareAfull moon looms, a synthesiser gulps and – dun dun duuuuuuuun – we’re off to HMP Gloucester in a Skoda Octavia with Daisy May and Charlie Cooper’s NightWatch (Sunday 26 October, 9.30pm, BBC Two). Why HMP Gloucester? Because theformerVictorian prison is, according to our hosts – the titular, Bafta-winning siblings behind peerless mockumentaryThis Country– “supposedly haunted as hell.” A fitting setting, then, for the first episode of a series that finds lifelong paranormal enthusiastsDaisy May(39) andCharlie(36) stuff their slippers into the aforementioned family hatchback and set off to spend a night bickering and farting “in some of this country’s spookiest places.”An opening montage offers further elucidation. “Some people want to climb Everest,” explains Charlie while a theremin trembles over footage of the actors staggering like concussed Wombles through a succession of night-time locales. “We just want to see a ghost.” “Yeah,” agrees Daisy May, peering at us over her brother’s shoulder. “We just want to see a ghost.” As do we. Alas, years of low-resolution ITV2 series in which crestfallen celebrity ghost-hunters shout “I think it was just the wind” in abandoned branches of Wetherspoons have prepared us for disappointment. Will NightWatch break with tradition and offer viewers definitive proof of the supernatural? Seems unlikely! Anyway, we must park this question, for now, at the gates of HMP Gloucester, for here is former prison manager Clive, whose sudden appearance in a deserted corridor is met with bellows of terror. “Clive?! OH GOD,” roars Daisy May from the depths of her camouflage-print ankle-length puffer coat. “We thought you were AN APPARITION.”The mood (intense bewilderment punctuated by sudden bursts of deafening panic) thus established, Clive – who is not AN APPARITION but merely, as stated previously, Clive – proceeds to guide us around his ex-workplace. HMP Gloucester was built in 1792, he tells us, and closed in 2013. It was the site of several outbreaks of typhoid and 123 prisoners were hanged within its now-peeling walls.“Grim,” murmurs Charlie, a gentle and faintly embarrassed soul who delivers a string of sad one-liners – “sustenance”, “if walls could talk,” etc – in the manner of a minor uncle at a family wake.While Clive plods off into the night, the siblings prepare for beddy-byes in a tiny cell on A Wing. What happens next? Everything and nothing. They order a takeaway. They go to the toilet. Charlie calls Daisy May’s collection of crystals “glorified gravel.” She tells him to stop farting. They tiptoe around like Shaggy (Charlie) and Scrappy-Doo (Daisy May); she emitting sporadic honks of alarm at the prospect of an appearance from a long-dead inmate; he patiently suggesting she “bring it down a notch” (you imagine this is something he’s been asking her to do, futilely, for decades).They discuss the time Charlie and their dad chased a burglar down the street while wearing nothing but their pants. “It was back when Mum bought our underwear,” recalls Charlie. “F&F,” nods Daisy, sadly. “You know when the elastic’s completely gone?” continues Charlie. “They were just … loincloths. Flapping around.” They weep with laughter and Clive’s warnings of ghostly “knocks and whistling” fail to materialise.It’s at 11.58pm, when Daisy May announces she “might put some fake tan on,” that the penny finally drops: this show isn’t about ghosts at all! Just asMortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishingis more about the intimacy and ease of middle-aged friendship than the presence of carp, so NightWatch uses its “wooo, ghosts” hook as an excuse to spend time with the Coopers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then a scene in the TV show Kidding changed everythingAnonymous; As told toEmma LoffhagenSat 25 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareGrowing up, I was obsessed withJim Carrey. I was just entering my teens when The Mask came out, and I can still picture myself watching Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls on TV one weekend afternoon, absolutely howling at the silliness of it. His elastic facial expressions, the energy, the stunts – it was the perfect tenor of humour for a young boy.By the time I was in college, I had moved on to his more thoughtful films. The Truman Show was a favourite: still funny, but with a philosophical edge that spoke to me at the time. I loved seeing Carrey stretch into more serious roles, and as the internet made it easier to watch interviews, I came to admire him as a person, too.My cultural awakening: ‘Kate Bush helped me come out as a trans woman’Read moreWhich is why, when I found out he was doing a TV series called Kidding, I was thrilled. The idea of him playing a troubled children’s TV presenter was irresistible. I started watching as soon as it came out, not knowing that it would trigger a personal turning point.Around this time, I had started losing my hair. I was in my early 30s, which felt too soon. I thought I might start balding at 50, so I wasn’t mentally prepared. I’d always had thick hair, even wearing it long at university, so when it began to thin, I fought it. I tried combing it over to hide the bald spots, but eventually there was no hiding it. Every time I looked in the mirror I saw what felt like proof that I was getting old too early. It made me feel less attractive, as though something had been taken away from me.Then one night I sat down to watch Kidding. In the very first episode, Carrey’s character is fighting with his controlling father about the direction of his show. In a moment of frustration, he takes a pair of clippers and drags them from his forehead all the way to the back of his skull, ruining his perfect TV hair.I burst out laughing – but I also felt something shift inside me. What he did was was an act of liberation, of taking back control. And suddenly I saw my hair loss for what it was: not just a cosmetic issue, but something I’d let control me. I paused the stream, went to the bathroom, grabbed my beard trimmer and did exactly what Carrey had done. One long line straight down the middle. I looked ridiculous. I laughed for a solid minute, standing there, finally seeing the absurdity of how much energy I’d spent hiding those bald spots. Then I went back to the sofa and finished the episode, still with that stripe across my head. When the credits rolled, I went back and finished the job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The anxiety I’d felt every time I looked in the mirror was gone. I actually thought I looked pretty good. I had a nicely shaped scalp hiding under there! I couldn’t wait to show my friends. When I met them I wore a winter cap and did a dramatic reveal – every single one of them said I looked better shaved. Even my mother, who had struggled with the idea of her once long-haired son being bald, admitted she liked it.These days, I keep my head shaved most of the time, though occasionally I let it grow a bit. Either way, I’m comfortable with how I look. I still have plenty of insecurities – I think that’s normal – but I no longer feel as though I am ageing before my time. I know that there is social stigma around men balding, but I try not to let that affect me. I know that for every woman who prefers a man with a full head of hair, there will be someone out there who likes me the way I am.If I ever met Jim Carrey, I would thank him for teaching me to see myself in a lighter, sillier way. Losing my hair felt like something happening to me, something out of my control. But by laughing at it, by shaving it off on my own terms, I turned it into a choice, and that made all the difference.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

That in-between time was, he wrote, “a time of monsters”.Those words, a “time of monsters”, could be used to describe the period of death and destruction unleashed in the two years since 7 October 2023, in the narrow strip of land comprising theGazaStrip. If the deal reached betweenIsraelandHamasthat wasbrokeredbyDonald Trumpcontinues to hold, it raises questions about what type of future awaits the lands between the river and the sea – an Israeli-government and settler-controlled land mass that both Israelis and Palestinians inhabit, which represents Israel’s apartheid-based one-state reality.So what is next? The continuation of the apartheid regime? A two-state solution where one state has no or limited capacity to function? More Israeli military occupation? An accelerated Nakba that more methodically expels Palestinians from the land? A new colonial presence where some foreign entity or individuals are the de facto interim rulers?Or, eventually, something else – something requiring a transformation of existing relationships through a new process, one taking us firmly beyond our time of monsters.When theceasefire dealwas struck, theLos Angeles Times,in an article on reactions in Israel, quoted Udi Goren, an Israeli celebrating at Hostages Square whose cousin was killed on 7 October. Israel needed new faces to make change, he told the reporter: “Now is the time for us – Israelis and Palestinians – to support a better future, to draft a new narrative for ourselves.”A new narrative seems hard to imagine, given the last hundred or so years of history. But there are moments when transformation becomes possible, when changes on the ground can rupture longstanding beliefs and biases, and a new political and social set of relations make possible what for so long seemed impossible. We are nowhere near that moment, yet change is happening, including shifts in opinion, new political realities, and a far more expansive global solidarity movement forPalestinethan ever before.The possibility of such rupture and transformation is an underlying premise of Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man and Sarah Leah Whitson’s book, From Apartheid to Democracy: A Blueprint for Peace in Israel-Palestine. Published just days before the ceasefire deal was reached, the book describes in granular detail the conditions for dismantling apartheid in Israel-Palestine.Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson have been deeply engaged on the ground for years. Schaeffer Omer-Man, the former editor of +972 Magazine, and Whitson, who has been a human rights lawyer and former advocate at Human Rights Watch, both currently work at Democracy for the Arab World Now, which focuses on reformingUS foreign policyin the Middle East and north Africa from a human rights perspective. The group was founded by the former Washington Post columnist and Saudi democracy advocate Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by Saudi assassins seven years ago.When I first learned about Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson’s Blueprint concept a few months ago, I was skeptical given the horrific genocide unfolding inGaza. The intent of the titular blueprint is to “design the process for dismantling Israel’s military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and dismantling its regime of apartheid”. To do so, Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson created an actual working document for a transition that would end apartheid and establish the basis for democracy in Israel-Palestine. This will not occur, they argue, in the next day, nor the next month, nor the next year. It can happen only after a process that brings about a pivotal rupture that provides the basis for something new.We don’t know what that rupture will entail, but the ground has been laid over these last two years. Perhaps a shift in attitudes about Israel and Palestine in the US and Europe will finally bring about the end of arms sales, or expanded boycott initiatives. Perhaps bodies such as the international court of justice will bring new forms of pressure to bear – pressure that the diplomatic community decides to enforce. Such developments could combine with mass movements outside Israel, making international isolation so extreme that Israel will be forced to reconceive its underlying structures of inequality in order to rejoin the community of nations.Five of the best books to understand the Israel-Palestine conflictRead moreSchaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson are realists: apartheid rule is deeply entrenched, functioning in many ways beyond Israel’s military occupation through an entire system of laws, practices and norms that creates and maintains a system of domination, including in pre-1967 Israel. These laws affect everyday life, they write, including: “political representation and organization, free expression, land use, ownership, zoning and other property-related matters, immigration, personal legal status, including family law; access to natural and economic resources; the provision of state services and benefits; policing and security; institutionalized distrust and permanent suspicion of non-Jewish citizens and residents and others”.They conclude: “Simply ending the occupation and extending the existing legal framework to the occupied territories is wholly insufficient for dismantling apartheid.”In each of these areas, the blueprint provides a map of how to begin to dismantle a deeply unequal system and move toward meaningful democracy in Israel-Palestine, whether through a single democratic state, a confederation or even two states connected to each other, with both populations engaged in a democratic process to select the preferred option. One area where such a transition is fundamental is the freedom to move or remain in place, they write, as restrictions on movement, they argue, are one of the central tools the apartheid regime has used to manage the Palestinian population.The authors look to South Africa and Northern Ireland, both of which saw political change that had seemed unimaginable. Relying on those examples, the blueprint identifies a multilayered process of co-conciliation, reparations and the creation of an inclusive political framework.The book was published before the ceasefire was reached, but it is fair to say that the deal is not going to pave the way for the blueprint anytime soon. We are not yet at the point of rupture. Once we get there, it may reveal that new narrative that the blueprint will help shape.Robert Gottlieb is professor emeritus at Occidental College and the author of more than a dozen books, including, most recently, Care-Centered Politics: From the Home to the Planet (MIT Press)From Apartheid to Democracy: A Blueprint for Peace in Israel-Palestine is out now (University of California Press, $26.95)Explore more on these topicsPolitics booksIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineGazareviewsShareReuse this content"

She did not, however, entertain the idea of editing out the reflection of a passerby, saying, “The turn of her head and backwards glance, her cloak-like coat and the difference in scale between her and the monsters – she makes the image work for me.”The bicycle in the shop window is a regular fixture, but situated in this tableau it reminded O’Molloy of the scene from The Wizard of Oz where the Wicked Witch of the West cycles through the air as Dorothy spins in the tornado nightmare.

A part-time nanny studying for a master’s in speech therapy, she hides the problem with a fringe. When she goes out, she wears a cap or headband to anchor it down, but activities such as walking in the wind or swimming feel impossible. “Even a fringe is not protective enough because at any minute someone could flick it up,” she says. “It makes me feel so vulnerable.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Aria started watching YouTube and TikTok videos of hair transplants two years ago. Now she has decided to take the plunge herself, and in a few days’ time she will check into at a clinic in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a procedure that will cost £5,500.Hair transplants have been available since 1952, when the dermatologist Norman Orentreich performed the first one, in New York. In 2022, more than 735,000 men worldwide had the procedure, many encouraged by celebrities including footballer and manager Wayne Rooney and actor James Nesbitt openly discussing their experiences. Turkey has become a global hub for hair transplants, due to its lower costs. Some even refer to the national airline as “Turkish Hairlines” as so many men, particularly from the UK, return from Turkey with bandaged heads after receiving hair transplants.Now more women are having them, too – a global increase of 16.5% between 2021 and 2024, according to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery. It is still a male-dominated field – men account for 87% of the market – but the focus is shifting. Transplant surgeon Dr Edward Maitland Ball operated on one woman (and 83 men) in 2016, the year he founded the Maitland Clinic in Portsmouth; last year, 15 women (and 148 men).But hair loss has troubling resonances for women, and going public about a transplant is rare for a woman. “Women are supposed to be so many things. Thin, but fertile. Successful, but homemakers. And hair is not something women are supposed to lose,” one woman who underwent a transplant tells me. This, then, is a story about hair loss and femininity, of bald spots and shame, and why, among younger women in particular, hair transplants are on the rise. Ultimately, it’s a tale not only about the behaviour of women, but also about the standards and values imposed on them.About eight million women in the UK experience hair loss at some time in their lives. In men, it usually begins above the temples, the receding hairline eventually forming a characteristic M shape. Hair at the top of the head also thins. Women, on the other hand, will generally retain the hairline and thin out behind it. “It’s more of an overall, diffuse volume reduction,” says consultant trichologist Anabel Kingsley.There are three typical stages in female pattern hair loss. Stage one is thinning at the crown and central parting, leaving a forest of hair on either side. By stage two, the hair is in retreat from the centre, exposing the scalp in what’s known as a “Christmas tree pattern”. By stage three, large areas on top of the head will be hairless. Even so, Kingsley says, “there are huge variations. Some women can have more of a male pattern loss; in others it is more noticeable around the temples. It’s much more complicated than with men.”Baldness in men is triggered by the release of testosterone, which reacts with an enzyme in the blood to shut certain follicles off rather than turning them on. This leads to hair thinning and falling out. Male pattern baldness is at least 80% heritable. “We used to call hair loss in men and women androgenic alopecia,” Kingsley says, “which basically means it is genetic and due to the presence of androgens – male hormones. But now it’s thought that, in some women, testosterone doesn’t play a role. We call it ‘female pattern hair loss’ because the causes are not understood.”View image in fullscreenAria being prepared for surgery.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianHistorically, clinical drug trials have been done on middle-aged white men, she says, “so it’s no surprise more research is dedicated to male pattern balding, even though hair loss is both a male and female issue”. And the causes, for women, are many. Menopause (many postmenopausal women suffer hair thinning or bald spots); pregnancy; iron deficiency from periods; side-effects of the pill; crash dieting and restrictive eating; and medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome can all affect hair growth. Even hairstyles can play a role. Gymnasts and ballet dancers who wear tight buns or ponytails are at risk of traction alopecia, a type of hair loss that occurs when tension damages or inflames the follicles.And yet we are surrounded by images of women with artificially bolstered hair. A current trend on the red carpet, on Instagram and TikTok is “long, voluminous, abundant, shiny hair,” says Josh Wood, owner of aneponymous upmarket salonin west London and vice-chair of the British Beauty Council. The “power mane” – sported by the women of Trump world – signifies youth and fertility. It’s a style that might look free and easy, but achieving it is anything but, especially with older hair. “It looks like nothing’s been done, when you’ve virtually had the construction workers in,” Wood says.Harriet, 69, a retired teaching assistant from Devon, who is married with three children, first noticed her hair thinning at her temples in her late 50s. “At first, you lie to yourself. You say, ‘I think it’s OK.’ Then after a while, because it’s a slow process, you think, ‘No, it’s definitely thinning.’ I could see the hairline gradually moving back.My husband would say, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter.’ But it’s how you feel and I was very self-conscious about it. If it was windy, I avoided going out or wore hats.” If she went swimming, she’d try not to get her hair wet. If she was out with friends, she’d sit with her back to the light: “You don’t want the light shining on the front of you as they might notice.” She’d brush her hair forward, lock it in place with hairspray and constantly check her reflection in shop windows as she walked by. “It’s horrible,” she says. “It niggles and niggles.”Rogaine, the growth stimulant, helped. But it isn’t recommended for use after 65, “so I stopped. Then it started to get noticeably worse. I thought, is this just a part of getting older; can I accept it, like I accept having lines on my face? But this was worse, somehow.”Harriet decided she had to do something. “I went online and looked at where all the footballers had their transplants done.” But the thought of the long drive from a London clinic back to Devon with a bloody head was too awful to contemplate. Instead, she turned to Ball’s clinic in Portsmouth. He checked if she had enough hair in the donor area at the back of her scalp. She asked him, “Won’t the transplanted hair fall out at my temples, too?” He reassured her that, as the DNA of the transplanted hair was different, it would stay.It’s just societal pressure. Where once we were obsessed with straight teeth, now it’s the perfect hairlineA hair transplant costs between £3,000 and £10,000, depending on the number of grafts needed and the quality of the clinic. There are two techniques. Strip Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) is where a thin strip of skin is sliced from the back of the scalp, then dissected under microscopes into individual follicular units, or grafts, which are inserted into tiny incisions in the head. One of the main advantages for women is you don’t need to cut your hair for the procedure, which makes getting back to normal life a lot easier. The disadvantage is a scar where the strip was taken.Alternatively, Follicular Unit Extraction uses a small device to punch out individual hairs from the back or side of the head, one by one. The main disadvantage is that the “donor area” must be shaved down to the skin. On the other hand, there is no scar.Harriet had FUT and, two years on, she is thrilled. It looks perfectly natural, she says. It’s impossible to say where the original hair ends and the transplanted hair begins. “In terms of confidence and how much happier I feel about myself, it’s huge,” she says. But, apart from her husband, children and hairdresser, no one knows she’s had it done. “It’s personal,” she says. “It’s taboo.”Perhaps surprisingly, it is no longer just women with extensive hair loss who are having transplants. Dr Roshan Vara, a hair transplant surgeon and co-founder ofThe Treatment Roomsin London, says his clients fall into two broad camps: women who are peri- or postmenopausal and have hair loss related to hormonal changes, and young women who aren’t losing their hair, but want to correct a hairline they don’t like.High foreheads are not a beauty ideal trending on social media, he says. Instead there are memes mocking the singer Rihanna’s “fivehead”. Pinterest has 30 hair styles to hide big foreheads “so you never have to hear lame jokes or snide remarks again”. On TikTok, viewers are invited to watch “a hilarious video” of actor Dakota Johnson and others showing off their “big foreheads”.Another undesirable beauty standard peddled to young women on social media is a “masculine” hairline with deep temples. Never mind that hairlines are neither “masculine or feminine”, Kingsley says. “It’s just societal pressure; another way to make us feel a bit crap about ourselves.”Wood has noticed this greater focus on hairlines. “Women are on screen, pulling their hair back, wearing it in high ponytails, conscious of how the hairline frames the face.” Moreover, as cosmetic surgery and tweaks reset our standards of beauty, a natural hairline can start to appear an anomaly. “It doesn’t look right,” he says. Where once we were obsessed with straight teeth, he suggests, now it’s the “perfect hairline”.Aria wants surgery to fix her hairline, not just hair loss. The average size of a woman’s forehead is 4.5-5.5cm, measured from between the eyebrows. Aria’s is nearer 7.5cm. She wants her hairline lower, “rounder”.Aria lives in London with her parents, twin brother and an older sister who has, she says, an even higher forehead. “Some family members have said they could land a plane on her forehead. But she doesn’t care. She rocks it! She has a buzz cut! I love her for that.”Yet the idea has lodged in Aria’s mind that her forehead is a problem to be fixed. It started as a low hum 10 years ago, and has grown. “Every time I step outside, the first thing on my mind is my forehead,” she says.On holiday with a friend in Croatia, Aria marvelled at all the “beautiful things to do”. But each opened up a seam of worry. She refused to go snorkelling, but agreed to kayaking: “I wore a cap and said it was hot.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAria’s hairline before and after surgery. Photographs: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianAria has started dating a man in his late 20s. When they went on a mini-break, he wanted to ride a bike. She said no: she was worried the wind would blow, exposing her bare forehead. “And that was too anxiety inducing.” That night, he tried to stroke her hair. She jumped up, saying she needed to pee. “I had to make an excuse to get out of that situation,” she says now. It has begun to obsess her: “When I’m in lectures, I’m not paying attention, I’m looking at my fringe. I’ve got a mirror in the back of my phone, that’s the depth of my insecurity.”Aria is “excited” about the hair transplant, but her father believes it is a terrible idea and could be a slippery slope to other surgeries. “I asked him: why is it OK for a man to get a hair transplant to feel better? He couldn’t answer me. We are currently not on speaking terms.”Aria hasn’t told the man she’s dating, even though he has had a hair transplant himself. “He knows I’m having surgery next week,” she says, “but he thinks it’s for a gynaecological problem.”On the morning of Aria’s transplant, she arrives at the Maitland Clinic at around 8am. A friend from university is with her. They got the train from London the day before and are staying in an Airbnb in the centre of Portsmouth for a week, in anticipation of a difficult recovery. “I’m very prone to swelling,” Aria says.She had a consultation with Ball the night before. One of the things bothering Aria was the position of the new hairline. It was still too high. “Do you think Dr Ball will agree to lower it?” she’d asked when we first met.When she came back to the Airbnb that night, the situation had been resolved. The central part of the hairline would come down by another half inch. The cost had gone up: £8.9k for 1,500 grafts. Aria went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and burst into tears. It suddenly became clear her old self was about to go. “I was grieving my childhood features,” she says later.The Maitland Clinic is situated on the second floor of an unremarkable building in Lakeside North Harbour, a short drive from the centre of Portsmouth. Formerly IBM’s national headquarters, it is now a business park of four-storey office buildings arranged around a lawn, with a cafe and 30,000 car parking spaces. It is a banal location, and that’s the point, Ball says: it’s discreet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He swims and sails, and often cycles the 40 minutes to work from his home in a small village on Chichester harbour, where he lives with his wife, a GP, and their two children. A former GP and plastic surgeon, he trained with hair transplant pioneer Dr Craig Ziering in his clinic in Beverly Hills, California. He still benefits from this connection: “If his celebrity patients don’t want to travel to the US, he sends them to me.” The transplant he had done by Ziering in 2011 has, he says, given him a valuable insight into the trauma of hair loss. Every patient has a psychological assessment to ensure they are mentally robust and, for him, planning and preparation are everything.In the surgery room, Aria sits in what looks like a dentist’s chair. Her hair has been washed with medicated shampoo, then plaited and pinned into two “space buns”. Ball uses electric clippers to shave the back of her head. He injects her scalp with a mix of lidocaine and adrenaline to numb it. (He also injects bupivacaine afterwards, a longer acting anaesthetic.) She’s already been given two tablets of codeine, a sedative.Ball takes a scalpel and draws it across the back of Aria’s head. Her skin is pulled taut. He cuts a strip about 1.2cm wide and 17cm long, which is dropped into a petri dish filled with Plasma-Lyte (a solution that resembles human plasma). Aria says she can hear a “crunching noise” in her head as her scalp is cut open. Ball stitches up the wound and dresses it with a bandage, then stands back to admire his work. “The dressing has to be absolutely beautiful and symmetrical,” he says. “If you put on an ugly dressing with a scrappy bit of tape, the patient will think your surgery is scrappy.”Meanwhile, his hair technicians are busy dissecting the strip of scalp at a long counter. The first, eyes pressed to a microscope, cuts the strip into slices. The skin looks grey and muscular in the petri dish, like an anchovy fillet. The other three divide the slices into follicular units. Each is categorised according to the number of hairs sprouting out of it: one, two or three. These are then subdivided by thickness: finest for the front of the new hairline; coarser ones behind. Each unit has its own muscles, blood vessels, nerves and glands. The skill is to keep these intact, so the follicle can take root.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDr Ball operating on Aria. Photographs: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianAria, now relaxed from the codeine and anaesthesia, is watching Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason on a large screen a few feet away from her. Transplants can take up to 12 hours, with patients awake the whole time, so there is an extensive choice of TV channels, crisps and chocolate bars. For lunch, Aria has a salmon poke bowl ordered from the cafe downstairs.“Now for my favourite part – the arty bit!” Ball says. He takes a small blade with a sharp tip and repeatedly jabs it into the bare area of Aria’s new hairline, which he’s marked out with a black pencil. The best transplant surgeons copy nature with skilled incisions. Nearly horizontal slits for fine hairs at the brow that tend to jut forward. More vertical for hairs that stand up straight. The exact angle and direction varies with each slit to recreate the irregular wildness of a natural head of hair.After Ball has made about 1,550 incisions – he keeps track with a digital foot counter – his transplant technicians take over. They take the grafts and “plant” each one into the tiny hole using fine forceps and an “implanter”, a pen-like instrument with a hollow needle for the graft at one end and a plunger on the other. The design, direction, angle and distribution of hair growth has already been determined by Ball. “It’s like painting by numbers,” hair technician Kate Shears says. “He’s doing the painting. We’re colouring in.”Dr Vara is having an online consultation with Beatrice, a woman in her early 30s, who has inquired about a hair transplant. “Take me through what you’re worried about,” he says, to which she replies, “I want to see if you’re able to create a new hairline. Bring it down and maybe thicken it up a little bit.”Beatrice has three children under 12. During her first two pregnancies her hair “flourished”, she tells Vara. “It was so thick and healthy.” She lost a noticeable amount after she gave birth – postpartum shedding is common, due to hormonal changes – “But my hair recovered.” After her last pregnancy, two years ago, however, her hair is “all over quite thin, thinner than it used to be. The overall density hasn’t returned.” It’s getting her down. Beatrice, who is of African-Caribbean heritage, has been wearing a wig to hide the problem.She got the idea of having a hair transplant from her hairdresser, who had one in Turkey three years ago. “It looks amazing!” Beatrice says. Before that, she didn’t even know women could have them, and she became obsessed. It will cost around £5k, and she thinks it’s worth it. “It’s something I’ve struggled with for a long, long time and I think it would improve my confidence,” she tells Vara. She asks to book it in straight away, but Vara does not agree – not yet. He suggests Beatrice gets a blood test to check her thyroid function and iron levels, and recommends hair-growth stimulants, such as Rogaine. He asks if she can reduce her stress levels. As well as her three children, Beatrice has a full-time job in education. She is often harried and exhausted. Psycho-emotional stress can trigger and aggravate hair loss, and impede recovery after surgery. “A transplant needs optimal care and nutrition for three months. You may not have enough time for self-care,” Vara tells Beatrice. He suggests a review in six to nine months.A lot of women are very distressed about hair loss and may think a transplant is a solution – but very often it’s not“Actually, out of the patients I see who are female, over 90% aren’t candidates for surgery straight away,” he says.Hair lossneeds to have stabilised, otherwise, as the natural hair continues to recede, the plugs of transplanted hair are left exposed, surrounded by patches of bare scalp. The diffuse pattern of female hair loss can also make a transplant harder because of a limited amount of donor hairs to move to the new site. What’s more, “a lot of my female patients present with forms of hair loss that are relatively rare in men,” he says. For example, frontal fibrosing alopecia, a scarring condition that causes inflammation and destruction of hair follicles, leading to permanent loss, often at the hairline. “Conditions like these can’t be treated with surgery, certainly not in the initial stages,” he says, “though a lot of female patients do get treated in clinics that aren’t so experienced or reputable.”“A lot of women are very distressed about hair loss and may think a transplant is a solution – as it is for most men. But for women, very often it’s not,” says Greg Williams, vice-president of the British Association of Hair Restoration Surgery (BAHRS). “Unfortunately, unscrupulous practitioners will take advantage of women and transplant when it’s not appropriate or necessary.There is no accredited training for hair transplant surgeons in the UK,” he continues. “Basically, anyone can do it. It’s a wild west, both here and abroad.”Rogue clinics will drive punches in at the wrong angle, so if hair grows at all, it’s in different directions, bedraggled and clumpy. Hairlines can be set too low, throwing out the natural balance of a face, and moving follicles a few at a time is labour intensive. “Some clinics unfortunately delegate surgical steps such as cutting skin to non-doctors – that’s why they’re cheap because a doctor may be supervising more than one surgery,” Williams says. BAHRS has launched #WhoMakesTheCut,a campaign to emphasise the steps only a doctor should do (it is acceptable for surgical assistants to place the hair grafts into the incisions the doctor has made).Repairing transplant procedures now makes up 12% of Ball’s work, compared with 2% in 2019. “It’s becoming a problem,” he says. “People are desperate, and are told they can be fixed.” He puts me in touch with a woman, an actor whose voice is so well known I am allowed to communicate with her only by email, who he is seeing to repair a botched job on her hair.The idea came from her aesthetic doctor. “He told me I needed it,” she writes, “that I could stop having Botox and filler as it would sort out the asymmetry of my face – ie my high forehead.”I have not been seen in public without a hat for 10 years. Would a Turkish hair transplant change my life?Read moreHe recommended a friend. She later discovered he was not experienced. “I was essentially a guinea pig.”The procedure was done in a clinic in Harley Street. The doctor tried to record it on his phone while she was sedated. The room was “unsanitary”, she writes, “and the design and technique was terrible. Four or five hairs sprouting out of one follicle, then huge gaps.” He took a vast amount of follicles from the back of my skull – more than was needed, which will never grow back.”Her skin became infected. Three years on, it’s still lumpy, red and scaly. The repair has cost over £20,000.Women need to check the credentials of the surgeon, Ball says. Take time to do research and read patient reviews on forums such ashairlossexperiences.comor Reddit, and consult theBAHRS website. The doctor should carry out an unhurried and detailed consultation prior to surgery to establish the cause of hair loss and to properly understand goals and expectations. “Don’t rush into anything,” Williams says. “Consult a dermatologist or specialist first.”A hair transplant, when it works, can feel life-changing. “Women are suffering in silence,” Ball says. “There’s not so much information out there for them. No celebrities are talking about it, no one is making them feel normal, so they feel ashamed. It takes away their feeling of femininity and they feel guilty about worrying about it, or beat themselves up for being vain. It’s not vanity!”Still, they shouldn’t be the first port of call if you notice thinning. Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs Council, says in some circumstances it can be symptomatic of a more serious medical condition: “So if a patient is seeing an excessive amount of hair loss, they should seek support from their GP practice.”If hair loss is affecting your mental health,the NHS offers adviceon accepting the change and can point you towards support groups and cognitive behavioural therapy. “We recognise that hair loss can be distressing,” Hawthorne says, “but it is very normal for our hair to thin, especially as we age.”It is nearly a week since Aria’s transplant and she’s already back home in London. In the end her father drove to Portsmouth to collect her two days after the surgery. “He is being super attentive, checking on me, bringing me drinks,” she says. “Apparently he said to Mum, ‘I can see why she had it done. She looks better.’ So they are both very on board with it now.”She has a tight feeling around the scar in the back of her scalp and says she looked like a chipmunk for a few days: “My face was very puffy.” But she has finally told the guy she’s dating. “He said, ‘Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Now we’re hair transplant buddies!’ He says it looks cute, the little hairs sprouting through.”Those transplanted hairs will probably fall out soon and the follicles become dormant. Then, after about three months, they’ll sprout again. She’ll have to wait a year or so to see what finally grows. “I wake up in the morning and I wash my face and I feel so elated, so happy,” she says. “I like what I see. Everything looks more in proportion. It just works.”Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsHair lossCosmetic surgeryBeautyWomenWomen's hairfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He took them camping and on cycling trips, and he raved about them to friends. Slowly, they became a pantry staple for us. When I have the time, I like to batch-cook my own curry sauce and freeze it, but when there isn’t time, we love this meal. It feels embarrassingly easy to make, because the cubes bring all the flavour, and also quite fancy at the same time thanks to the egg yolk. We love it, and I hope you will, too.Japanese curry rice with soy-marinated egg yolkIf you want to make this vegan, just drop the egg. The most readily available brand of curry cubes,S&B Golden Curry, usesRSPO-certifiedsustainable palm oil in its products, but, if you’re keen to avoid the stuff, I’d recommendEmma Basic. Don’t throw out the egg whites; zip-lock them and save in the fridge or freezerto make a meringue.Prep15 minCook45 minServes44 tbsp light soy sauce, plus 1 tbsp extra4 tbsp mirin4 egg yolks(optional)350g short-grain rice½ tsp salt4 tbsp rapeseed oil1 brown onion, peeled and sliced150g shiitake mushrooms, sliced2 carrots(200g), peeled and finely diced300g green beans, cut into 1½cm pieces4 mild Japanese curry cubes, finely chopped10g fresh chives, very finely choppedIn a small bowl, mix the four tablespoons of light soy sauce with the mirin, then gently lower in the egg yolks and leave to marinate.Put the rice in a saucepan with 490ml cold water, add the salt, cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, leave to cook for 10 minutes, then take off the heat and set aside, still covered.Meanwhile, in a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil on a medium to high flame and, once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for five minutes, until soft. Add the mushrooms, cook for another five minutes, still stirring, then add the carrots, the extra tablespoon of light soy sauce and five tablespoons of water. Cover and cook for five minutes more. Add the beans, cover again and cook for four minutes. Stir through the curry cubes until they melt, then scoop the cooked rice into the pan (I find a spaghetti spoon useful for this). Cook, stirring, for another six to eight minutes, then take off the heat.Spoon a quarter of the rice into a bowl, pack it down, then invert on to a plate. Repeat with the remaining rice. Use the back of a spoon to make an indent in the top of each mound of rice, then, working one by one, lift the egg yolks from their marinade and place one on top of each portion of rice. Finish with a generous sprinkling of chives and serve.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.

Before 2020, I was spending £135 a week.”The family’s food costs are also affected by the need to buy “free from” products, which have become even more expensive.“I have two children with coeliac disease, so they cannot eat anything containing gluten,” Nikki says. They are unable to save money by opting for no-frills products as these “nearly always contain wheat as a filler”.While thecost of living crisisis no longer at the top of the news agenda, for many Britons it is worse than ever, particularly when confronted with the price of even a small basket of groceries at the till.When Karen recently posted on X a picture of her four neatly packed shopping bags with the caption “£98!!! At Aldi no booze included & only meat is sliced for a sandwich & a chicken to roast 6 months ago this would have been £70! Cost of living is just ridiculous”, the post went viral.Other Britons have taken to posting videos of their shops on TikTok as they become exasperated about their food bills.The latest Office for National Statistics data showedUK inflation was unchangedlast month at 3.8%. A breakdown of the figure offered some light at the end of the tunnel, as annual food price inflation eased from 5.1% in August to 4.5% – the first time it has slowed since March.Even though overall inflation is well below the 41-year-high of 11.1% recorded three years ago, the cumulative effect of rising prices means essentials such as groceries cost a lot more than they used to.Shona Goudie, a policy and advocacy manager at the Food Foundation, a charity, says that while food inflation was down from the previous month, “prices remain incredibly high. The cost of a weekly shop is still30% higher than in 2022, and this is continuing to have a huge impact on the lives of people up and down the country.”The charity’s data shows that one in seven UK households with children struggle to afford food.Of these “food insecure households”, 64% report cutting back on fruit and 50% have cut back on vegetables.Nikki was one of almost 100 readers who shared their experiences after we asked whether they were shocked at food prices in the supermarket.‘I buy mostly own-brand supermarket items’Chris, a stay-at-home father, is another reader who responded. “I used to be able to get a weekly shop for a family of five for about £90, plus maybe another £20 for additional bits later in the week. Now I’m spending £110-£120 and it doesn’t even cover what we need for the week,” he says.Reflecting a common theme among the respondents, Chris, who lives in Manchester, says the price of branded groceries “just go up and up. There doesn’t seem to be anything for less than £2-£3, so you end up with a bag full, maybe 10 or so items, and that’s £30 on its own.View image in fullscreenSwitching to a cheaper brand of pet food could save you money but may upset your furry friend if they are picky.Photograph: Irina Orlova/Getty Images“I now buy mostly own-brand supermarket items, but there are some items such as toiletries, cleaning products or pet food that you can’t scrimp on. A bag of dry cat food (that my cats will actually eat) can cost upwards of £6-£7.”‘I don’t buy branded anything if I can help it’Stacey, with a family of four – plus a cat – to feed, says it is a “struggle to keep my weekly shop below £100”, which she reckons is an increase of about £40 since lockdown.The special educational needs teaching assistant had previously stopped getting groceries delivered to her home in Thetford, Norfolk, because she struggled to meet the spend threshold. Now, she says, “I never don’t hit that”.The “almighty increase” in the price of minced beef has meant a switch to pork mince in her shepherd’s pie and bolognese. “I don’t buy branded anything if I can help it,” she says.Some readers say they are not prepared to pay silly prices for previously affordable branded foods such as baked beans, ketchup or tinned soup “on principle”. In Tesco, a four-pack of Heinz baked beans costs £3.90, compared with £1.60 for its own-brand beans.View image in fullscreenHeinz baked beans have come in for particular criticism from some readers.Photograph: bunhill/Getty ImagesReady meals – including Charlie Bigham’s got several name-checks – and treats such as chocolate and wine are also among the products being dropped from shopping lists due to the cost.‘£2 for a multipack of crisps – it’s just potatoes!’“Heinz soup is stupidly expensive,” says Richard, a scientist based in Berkshire. “Tomato sauce too. I no longer buy oat milk as a treat for my tea. Have you seen the price of minced beef? Also, Walkers crisps at over two quid for a multipack – it’s just bloody potatoes!”‘I paid £5 a jar of coffee last year, now it’s £8.35’Anne, a retired school teacher, does a big shop that generally comes in at £150, which she says is about £50 more than 18 months ago, “especially if it includes wine”. “I’ve bought the same brand of instant coffee since the 70s. Paid £5 a jar last year – now it’s £8.35.” Needless to say, Anne has switched to a cheaper brand.The decisions being made by shoppers are changing the shape of grocery sales, with supermarkets’ own lines now accounting for 51.2% of all takings, up from 50.9% a year ago, according to the grocery analysts Worldpanel. Its data shows shoppers swapping household names for premium own-brand ranges such as Tesco Finest or Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference.Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Worldpanel, says sales of premium own-label products have been rising at a rate of more than 10%. “Brands are holding ground in some categories, including baby toiletries, toothbrushes and frozen chicken, showing that consumers still value well-known names,” he says.‘The amount is reduced and the quality is poor’The march of food prices means a basket that used to cost £20-£40 is now £40-£70, says Eddie. Lamb, beef mince, fish, eggs, cheese, chocolate, cooking oils and ready meals are on his list of items he thinks have increased the most in price.View image in fullscreenThe ‘almighty increase’ in the price of minced beef has led to some turning to pork of turkey mince for their spaghetti bolognese.Photograph: Kritchanut Onmang/Alamy“It’s not just that the price has gone up – the amount you get has reduced and the quality is poor,” he says. “Even the plastic on some packaging is lower quality.”Based in Yorkshire, he would prefer to shop at a discounter but is unable to travel to one, forcing him to use his local Tesco. “Corners have been cut everywhere but prices continue to rise and the Clubcard offers aren’t as good as they used to be.”Like other readers, Eddie is buying supermarket own-label products these days over big-name brands, even for treats such as chocolate. “They’re the same price as the brand-name shop you could do four to five years ago,” he says.‘We buy based on what is on offer that week’It is the same story for Alison, with a family of four to feed in Redbridge, east London. “We have stopped buying anything which is not supermarket own brand,” says the former primary school teacher, adding that buying free-range eggs is her only red line. “We buy based on what is on offer that week,” she says.In 2024, a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed thebill for a weekly shopamong the poorest UK households increased by far more than that among wealthy homes at the height of the cost of living crisis, as the sharpest price rises affected cheaper brands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She works full-time but is on what she describes as a “low wage”.“I have to stick to a tight budget. While it was the three of us at home, I’d stick to £75 per week. When my eldest went off to uni in 2022, I expected to save money on food. I did to begin with, but now spend £75 per week for two people.“I’ve watched beef mince go up and up weekly over the last few months, and this week I made the switch to turkey mince. I’ve also swapped our much-loved Yorkshire teabags for supermarket red label.”View image in fullscreenReaders have been swapping big brand teas for supermarket own-brand versions.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA“I haven’t made a beef or lamb stew for several years now as these meats are too expensive. Same for roasting joints. When my shopping basket reaches £75, I stop adding things regardless, or make swaps if there are items I still feel we need.”The steepness of food price increases has led some to question whether supermarkets are profiteering.‘I am genuinely shocked at the rate of price increases’“Our weekly shop costs £100-£150 per week,” says Laurie, a public sector worker based in the West Midlands. She says she is “genuinely shocked” at the rate of price increases in her local Morrisons supermarket.“I can’t help thinking supermarkets might be profiteering,” she says. “I’m not suggesting that is happening, because I don’t know, but it feels like it.” In fairness to Morrisons, she notes that the price of its own-brand products remains low and it has maintained the quality.When fingers are pointed at the substantial profits made by the big supermarket chains – Tesco is on course to rake in £2.9bn-£3.1bn for the full year – business analysts in turn point to rising costs linked to government policies, Brexit and the impact of the climate crisis on food production.The British Retail Consortium says retailers, already operating on tight margins, have been hit with £7bn in additional taxes this year alone – costs they “simply can’t absorb”.‘I collect points wherever I can and I meal-plan’To navigate sky-high food prices, London-based Emma, who is expecting her first child, says the only solution is to become a savvy supermarket shopper and “play them at their own game”.She and her partner spend between £70 and £100 a week on food, but it can be more if they buy “big-ticket items” such as dishwasher tablets. “I look for deals only. I am not loyal to supermarkets or brands – I collect points wherever I can, and I meal-plan,” Emma says.*Name has been changedView image in fullscreenThe full price of Nescafé Gold Blend instant coffee (190g) has gone up by more than 90p on average at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons in two years.Photograph: AsherDB/Getty ImagesHow much?

Are they enjoying themselves? It’s hard to tellTim DowlingSat 25 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 13.09 EDTShareWe arrive home from our holiday to another household altogether: the oldest one, the middle one and the oldest one’s girlfriend have been in charge for more than a fortnight. The food in the fridge is strange, sourced from unfamiliar shops. The kitchen table looks like the centre of a boiler room stock fraud operation, with computer screens everywhere and power cords dividing the space at waist height. Below the sink, the dog and the cat are scrapping. After more than a year of avoiding each other, both animals have suddenly gone on the offensive.“They fight?” I say.“Yeah, this is normal now,” the middle one says.The dog corners the cat, over near the back door. The cat rears up on its hind legs and bites the dog’s left ear. The dog shakes the cat off and chases it in circles round the table, dodging power cords.“Normal maybe, but not natural,” I say.The cat rolls over on its back, adopting a submissive posture to draw the dog in. The dog takes the bait, and the cat sinks two sets of claws into the dog’s muzzle. The dog backs away, with the cat sliding along, hooked underneath.“I preferred it when they were afraid of each other,” I say.“I think they’re having fun,” the oldest one says. “Sometimes it’s hard to tell.”My wife walks in.“I thought they were going to take the scaffolding down,” she says.“They said maybe wait until it rains,” I say, “to make sure the roof is fixed.”“And I said I didn’t want to wait,” she says.“Yeah, I told them that, but they still didn’t come,” I say. Scaffolding is expensive, until you want it gone, at which point they’re happy to leave it with you for ever for free.“Can you call them again?” my wife says.“I will, just as soon as …” I say.The only time the dog and cat are at peace is in the hour before feeding time, when they agitate in concert to bring feeding forward an hour“Stop fighting!” my wife screams. The dog and the cat stop, turn, look at her, and then roll out of the room in a snarling ball.The dog and the cat fight on and off all morning. Sometimes it seems to be edging beyond playful, but the cat has ample opportunity to escape through the flap and it keeps coming back for more. To get away from the noise I retreat to my garden office, which is freezing cold, having sat unheated for two weeks. Eventually I’m driven back to the kitchen, amid the screens and the wires and my sons and the cat and the dog.The only time the dog and the cat are at peace is in the hour before feeding time, when they agitate in concert to bring feeding forward by an hour. The cat walks to the cupboard door, sits, and looks up at me.“Miaow,” it says.“Food happens at six,” I say. “Right now it’s five.” The cat begins to knead the cupboard door with its front paws.“That’s not even the right cupboard,” I say. The dog barks, to back up the cat.“One hour,” I say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The dog barks.“Ugh, fine,” I say.I feed the cat and the dog. The dog eats its food, and then crosses the room to watch the cat eat. When the cat is finished, it turns and takes a casual swipe at the dog. The dog gets the end of its nose under the cat and flips it upside down. The cat runs, stops, turns and attacks.“Enough!” I say. The dog and the cat pause briefly to look at me, before carrying on.The next morning I get up before dawn to sit in the quiet kitchen before anyone else wakes. Even the cat and the dog are asleep. For a few minutes the only sound in the house is me typing.The oldest one’s girlfriend walks into the kitchen, dressed for work, and fills a water bottle from the sink.“You’re up early,” she says.“Yeah,” I say. “I have to go to a photoshoot later, so I need to get some work done now, in case it goes on and on.”“That’ll be a nice day out for you,” she says.“Yes it will,” I say. “Meeting people, saying things.”“Have fun,” she says, striding towards the front door.The windows have begun to pale, revealing an overcast morning. Leaves drop from the big cherry tree in armfuls. I see the tortoise sitting in the corner of the room. We exchange a sorrowful glance as a snarling, rolling ball starts to make its slow progress down the stairs.Join Tim Dowlingat a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November.

Now I’m watching them as the cubs have grown up, ready to leaveSat 25 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareIhave been watching a family of foxes through my bedroom window for a long time now. Today I decided to record 15 minutes of one of the fox’s days. It went like this: 12:30pm – the fox is asleep, 12:40pm – the fox is still asleep (foxes are mainly nocturnal animals and sleep up to 10 hours during the day), 12:52pm – the fox wakes up and walks out of sight, probably to go through some bins or steal our garden gloves, 12:54pm – the fox jumps on top of the shed, 12:54pm – the fox is asleep again.Many urban foxes find shelter around people’s gardens. This can include under sheds, in bushes, behind bins or in their own burrows, called earths. In spring, baby foxes are born, and when we’re gardening they stare at us through the bushes, or quickly pass through when our backs are turned. I know I should clap and scare them away, but the cubs grow up bold, and it’s peaceful sometimes to pull up weeds and pretend you can’t see the amber eyes watching you.The baby foxes have now grown up. They’re about seven months old, meaning it’s time to leave home and have cubs of their own. The parents sometimes become aggressive to drive them away, encouraging them to go and set up new territories.My mum sees the foxes as pests, which I don’t blame her for, considering they poop everywhere and leave a mess. If you don’t want a fox around in your garden or allotment, make sure you clear away any leftover pet food or snacks. If they still come, make sure your bins are sealed shut! As for me, I will keep watch from my bedroom window.Julia, 14Read today’s other YCD, by Jasper, eight: ‘Fungi are my wonders of the woods’The Young Country Diarysubmission formis still open for autumn articles, closing at 10pm on Sunday 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsUrban wildlifeCountry diaryRural affairsAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the same time, global demand for chocolate continues to rise, putting further pressure on supply chains.“If you’re a company using chocolate today, you’re in crisis. Prices have more than quadrupled in three years. For some small businesses, that can be the difference between surviving or not,” said Mark Golder, the chief executive of cocoa-free chocolate maker Win-Win.Golder’s company is creating chocolate alternatives. Instead of relying on traditional cacao beans, it uses fermented cereals and legumes, including rice, to replicate the taste, texture and melt of real chocolate. Its process mirrors conventional chocolate-making, involving steps such as fermentation and roasting.There has been more interest in alternatives to chocolate as prices rise, according to Golder. “There’s been an explosion in interest over the last 18 months. We’re getting inbound inquiries all the time from customers across Europe and further afield,” he said.“The world loves chocolate, but cacao trees are suffering. Climate change is reducing yields year after year, and about 75% of the world’s cocoa comes from Ghana and Ivory Coast, where deforestation and child labour remain serious issues.”View image in fullscreenA big win? Win-Win’s cacao-free cocoa powder uses rice as a base ingredient.Photograph: Win-WinGolder said rice was the base ingredient which, he said, “surprises people”. He said that through fermentation his company could develop the “complex flavour profile of chocolate”.He said: “We then combine the fermented base with other ingredients [carob, fats and sugars] and use conventional chocolate-making processes. The end product looks, tastes and melts just like chocolate.”Others are also experimenting with new ways to make chocolate. The Swiss chocolate manufacturer Barry Callebaut has partnered with Zurich University of Applied Sciences to explore cell-cultured chocolate, which is made by growing cacao plant cells in a lab. The cells produce the same flavours and fats as real chocolate, but without needing cacao trees.Germany’s Planet A Foods, the company behind the ChoViva brand, uses oats and sunflower seeds that are roasted and fermented to recreate the taste and texture of chocolate without any cocoa. Planet A says its process produces up to 90% less carbon emissions and uses 90% less water than conventional chocolate. The company has already partnered with major food producers, including Aldi and Lidl, and has scaled up production to more than10,000 tonnes a year as demand grows across Europe.In the US, a California startup, Voyage Foods, has developed a product made from grape seeds, sunflower protein and shea butter. Voyage Foods has raised over $40m in investment to scale its operations and supply manufacturers.Prof Tim Spector, the co-founder of UK-based health and nutrition company Zoe, said: “Chocolate alternatives made without cocoa, including lab-grown varieties, form part of a wider, fascinating emerging field of food innovation that’s better for the planet. For example, ChoViva ferments sunflower seeds to mimic the flavour and aroma of cacao, which is genuinely exciting.”However, he added: “When it comes to nutrition, a new process doesn’t automatically translate into a healthier product. We understand that the fat in chocolate, though saturated fat, is actually beneficial for us when consumed as a piece of dark chocolate, for example.At the moment we don’t know whether these new ‘chocolate-like’ creations will have the same beneficial health impact. Minimally processed cacao is rich in bioactive compounds such as flavanols that are very good for our gut health, blood pressure and heart health.”Dark chocolate and raw cacao powder are “genuinely healthy foods to include in your diet”, Spector added, but he cautioned that consumers should be careful of thinking that “cocoa-free or lab-grown automatically means better in every sense”.“These new types of chocolate are great for the environment, but the best option for your health remains really high-quality dark chocolate with good manufacturing practices behind it.”I should cocoa: treats ranked by cocoa contentConfectionery fans were left with a bitter taste in their mouths this week after discovering that packed lunch classics McVitie’s Penguin and Club bars are no longer real chocolate, with their coatings downgraded to “chocolate flavour”.The biscuits can no longer be classified as chocolate because they now contain more palm and shea oils than cocoa. The classic treats quietly changed their recipe earlier this year as ingredient costs rose and manufacturers looked for cheaper ways to keep them on the shelves.The price of chocolate for shoppersclimbed 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot. Cocoa prices have more than doubled over the past two years due to poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, placing sustained pressure on manufacturers.So which brands contain the highest levels of cocoa, and which fall closer to the minimum required? Below we have ranked a selection of popular chocolate bars according to their cocoa content, from dark to milk chocolate, based on manufacturer information and UK legal definitions.Green & Black’s Organic 85% dark chocolate barGreen & Black’s dark chocolate bar contains 85% cocoa solids, more than meeting UK regulations for dark chocolate, which require a minimum of 35%. A 90g bar typically costs £2.75 and is certified organic and Fairtrade. Other bars in this category include Montezuma’s Lordy Lord Cocoa Nibs dark chocolate bars, with 70% cocoa solids, which are marketed as premium dark chocolates.Aldi Dairyfinedarkchocolate barThe Aldi Dairyfine dark chocolate bar contains 55% cocoa solids and is sold in a 200g bar for £1.85. It has cocoa paste, cocoa butter and emulsifiers, placing it above the legal minimum for dark chocolate.View image in fullscreenA solid offering: Aldi Dairyfine dark chocolate has 55% cocoa.Photograph: AldiHotel Chocolat Milk Chocolate SlabThe Hotel Chocolat Milk Chocolate Slab contains 40% cocoa solids, weighs 100g and is priced at £5.45. The company emphasises its higher cocoa amounts in its advertising, saying on its website it “is made from 40% cocoa, whilst most other premium milk chocolates have a cocoa content in the 30s”.Tony’s Chocolonelymilkchocolate barThe 180g Tony’s Chocolonely milk chocolate bar contains 32% cocoa solids, above the UK legal minimum for milk chocolate (25% dry cocoa solids and 14% dry milk solids). It typically retails for £4.50. The company’s chief executive, Douglas Lamont, has previously spoken about the fact that prices will have to rise if thecost of cocoa continues to increase.Cadbury Dairy MilkAccording to a 2024 survey by the Grocer magazine, Cadbury Dairy Milkholds the No 1 spotamong the UK’s favourite chocolate brands. A 95g Cadbury Dairy Milk bar contains 20% cocoa solids, meeting theUK legal minimum for milk chocolate. It retails for approximately £1.45 and contains milk solids, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass and emulsifiers.McVitie’s chocolate biscuitsThe dark chocolate digestives contain 30% dark chocolate, which includes cocoa mass and cocoa butter. This is relatively high compared with other mass-market biscuits. A 226g pack costs approximately £2.25.Jaffa CakesWhen it comes to biscuits, the longstanding debate over whether Jaffa Cakes – also made by McVitie’s – are a biscuit or a cake still persists. Regardless of where you stand, their official ingredient list shows they contain 19% dark chocolate (which is made up of cocoa, sugar and other ingredients), placing them at the lower end of the cocoa content scale among chocolate biscuits. They do not specify how much of the dark chocolate is pure cocoa. A pack of 10 is about £1.25.View image in fullscreenDark matter: McVitie’s Jaffa Cakes contain 19% dark chocolate.Photograph: Alexander Hogg/AlamyOreo biscuitsOreo cookies are made with Dutch-processed cocoa powder, which is treated to neutralise its acidity, resulting in a milder flavour and darker colour. The chocolate wafer portion of an Oreo cookie contains approximately 4.5% cocoa powder. This powder is a product made from cocoa solids, with most of the fat removed, typically used in baking and cooking. A 154g pack is priced at £1.30.Wagon WheelsAnother brand to use chocolate flavouring is Wagon Wheels, with their 24% chocolate-flavoured coating, which includes fat-reduced cocoa powder. Due to the low cocoa content, they no longer meet the legal definition of “chocolate” in the UK. A pack of six costs £1.35.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryChocolateFoodEthical and green livingConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Time to thank a farsighted builder from KentWilliam Willett dreamed up the idea of clocks going forward and back on an early morning ride in 1907Donna FergusonSat 25 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareFor many people, it will simply mean an extra hour in bed. For others, it’s a disruption to their circadian rhythm that can take weeks to fix.On Sunday at 2am, clocks in the UK will go back by an hour, a practice that has been mandated by law for more than a century.A wealthy Kent builder called William Willett came up with the idea of “daylight saving” while he was out riding early on a summer morning in 1907.Noting that most people still had their curtains drawn, shutting out the early morning light while they slept, it occurred to him that putting the clocks forward in spring would mean they could spend more of their waking hours in daylight.View image in fullscreenWilliam Willett advanced his idea about changing the clocks in a pamphlet called The Waste of Daylight.Photograph: Hulton GettyHis pamphlet, The Waste of Daylight, argued that advancing the time of sunrise would increase daylight recreation hours for workers and cut the cost of lighting homes, because of lighter evenings.“His main argument was to increase health and wellbeing across the population but he also pointed out economic benefits to garner approval,” said Dr Emily Akkermans, curator of time at the Royal Observatory Greenwich.Willett managed to get several prominent politicians onboard, including David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, also supported the idea, which was discussed in parliament in 1908.But the proposal was not adopted until after the outbreak of the first world war when changing the clocks to save daylight, boost productivity and reduce demand for coal suddenly seemed obvious – and not just to the British.In 1916, Germany became the first country to bring in a daylight savings scheme and a few weeks later Britain followed suit.Willett, who died of influenza in 1915, never experienced the change in clocks, but his idea has been picked up all over the world.On Sunday, when clocks in the UK will move back an hour to Greenwich mean time (GMT), the sun will once again pass over the prime meridian at the Royal Observatory at midday.Akkermans said: “In spring, the clock change forces us to get up an hour earlier, which makes us feel like we lose an hour. In autumn, we’re allowed to lie in an extra hour, which feels like a gain.”In reality, she said “we do not really gain or lose anything” except daylight at either point in time. “In Greenwich we have about 16 hours of sunlight in the summer and only eight in winter. The clocks change to make the most of the varying amount of daylight hours we have throughout the year.”She said the change to British summer time in spring, when clocks spring forward, was more disruptive to circadian rhythms than the change to GMT in autumn, when they fall back. “How people react to the clock changes varies – some people adjust relatively quickly, whereas for others it may disturb their circadian rhythms for weeks.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsSleepnewsShareReuse this content"

Franklin Roosevelt created the East Wing in its current form in 1942 to add working space during the war, but also to conceal an underground bunker that had been constructed for the president and staff.Over time it became the home base for the first lady and her staff. It was also the home of the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden.View image in fullscreenA view of the White House East Wing, circa 1916-1919, before its expansion in 1942.Photograph: US Library of Congress/AFP/Getty ImagesSitting across East Executive Avenue from the Treasury Department, it represented the social side of the White House and was where tourists and other guests entered for events.In the original plan for the ballroom, it would have remained untouched and, in Trump’s telling, become a space where guests would mingle, sip cocktails and eat hors d’oeuvres until they were called into the ballroom for dinner. However, days after ground was broken on the new project, the White House confirmed the entire wing would be torn down and thatprocess appeared to be completed by Friday.What can we expect from the new ballroom?Trump has complained that the White House needs a large entertaining space and that the East Room is too small, with capacity for only about 200 people.The 90,000-square-foot (27,400sqm) ballroom will dwarf the main White House, at nearly double the size, and Trump says it will accommodate 999 people.Renderings released by the White House suggest a strong resemblance to the gilded ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club and home in Palm Beach, Florida. The White House has said the ballroom will be ready for use well before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, an ambitious timeline.View image in fullscreenA rendering of the White House ballroom.Photograph: McCrery Architects PLLC via the White HouseGraphic of new White House ballroom.The president has been adamant that the ballroom will not come at a cost to taxpayers, because it is being privately funded by “many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly”.Donors for the proposed ballroom includea slew of major tech companies, including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Defense contractors and communications companies have also pitched in, including Lockheed Martin, Palantir, T-Mobile and Comcast.The president began construction despite the lack of signoff from the National Capital Planning Commission, the executive branch agency that has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.What has been the reaction to the bulldozing of the East Wing?The image of broken masonry, rubble and steel wires at America’s most famous addressappeared to strike a chordeven with people who have become accustomed to shrugging off Trump’s outrageous antics.David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W Bush, tweeted: “Something profoundly symbolic about Trump taking a wrecking ball to the White House … paying for the demolition with money from cronies and insiders seeking government favors … and the Republicans in Congress acquiescing as Trump treats public assets as private property.”View image in fullscreenAn excavator clears rubble after the East Wing of the White House was demolished.Photograph: Eric Lee/Getty ImagesThe National Trust for Historic Preservation on Tuesday asked the Trump administration to pause the demolition until the planning commission review was completed. Its letter expressed concern that the proposed ballroom would “overwhelm the White House itself”.Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, was quoted by WTOP News as saying: “Maybe it’s just the dislike of change on my part, but it seemed painful, almost like slashing a Rembrandt painting. Or defacing a Michelangelo sculpture.”In an appearance on Fox News on Friday, Trump adviser Stephen Miller defended the unannounced demolition of the entire East Wing, arguing that the extension was not really part of the White House.“It was a cheaply built add-on structure … [it] is badly in need of refurbishment, repair and renovation,” he said.What have other presidents done to change the White House?Presidents have added to the White House since construction began in 1792 for a host of reasons, and Trump aides say his decision to build a ballroom follows that long tradition.Thomas Jefferson added the east and west colonnades.Andrew Jackson built the North Portico on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House, aligning with the South Portico that James Monroe added after the original mansion was rebuilt after the British burned it during the war of 1812.Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing to provide dedicated space for the president and senior staff, while Franklin D Roosevelt added the East Wing.One of the most significant White House renovations happened under Harry Truman, when the mansion was found to be so structurally unsound that he ordered a complete gutting of the interior that lasted from 1948 to 1952. The project, including Truman’s addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico, was highly controversial.Other changes include the creation of the Rose Garden during John F Kennedy’s administration and Richard Nixon’s decision to convert an indoor swimming pool that was built for FDR’s physical therapy into a workspace for the growing White House press corps.With Reuters and the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpWashington DCexplainersShareReuse this content"

Turkey has said it is willing to offer troops, but Israel has let it be known that it disapproves of Turkish troops taking part in the force.Tensions between Israel and Turkey have grown over Syria and the Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanis seen by the Israeli government as too close to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Hamas itself. But the exclusion of Turkey from the stabilisation force would be controversial since it is one of the guarantors of the Trump 20-point ceasefire agreement, and is seen as one of the most capable Muslim armed forces.The force is still likely to be led byEgypt.Other contributors to the stabilisation force, such as Indonesia and the Emiratis, would still prefer the force to be given a UN security council mandate, even if it is not itself a UN peacekeeping force.Instead it will coordinate with a US-led military cell, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC), based in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Gat. The cell, which includes a small number of British, French, Jordanian and Emirati advisers was inaugurated on Tuesday by the US vice-president, JD Vance. The CMCC also appears to be taking on an aid coordination role inGaza, although key aid crossings remain closed.View image in fullscreenRecep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that the US should do more to put pressure on Israel to abide by its commitments in the Trump peace plan.Photograph: Dia Images/Getty ImagesThe force will be tasked with disarming Hamas and securing a transitional Palestinian government, the formation of which is still being contested. The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has ruled out Palestinian Authority involvement in postwar Gaza, although on Friday the main Palestinian factions agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of the strip.In a sign of the tensions betweenTurkeyand Israel, Turkish disaster response specialists sent to help locate Palestinian and Israeli bodies inside Gaza remained near Egypt’s border with the strip on Thursday, awaiting Israeli authorisation to enter.The 81-member team from Turkey’s AFAD disaster management authority are waiting to enter with life-detection devices and trained search dogs.Erdoğan told reporters on Friday that the US should do more to put pressure on Israel, including through sanctions and arms sales bans, to abide by its commitments in the Trump plan.Rubio also said there could be no role for the UN’s Palestinian relief works agency, Unrwa, in Gaza due to the agency being a “subsidiary of Hamas”.His remarks will put him at odds with many European countries, the UN itself, and the international court of justice (ICJ), which said in an advisory opinion this week that the Unrwa was an irreplaceable vehicle to distribute aid inside Gaza.The ICJ did not accept that Israel had provided incontrovertible evidence that Unrwa had been irretrievably infiltrated by Hamas.Joint US-Israeli opposition to Unrwa presents a dilemma since Donald Trump, in his 20-point plan, has accepted a role for the UN in distributing aid in Gaza, but seems intent on excluding Unrwa, the main relevant aid agency. The UN faces a choice over whether or not to confront Trump over Unrwa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the Trump ceasefire plan, accepted by Israel, 600 aid trucks were due to enter Gaza daily. But since the agreement, the daily average has been 89 trucks a day on average – only 14% of the agreed amount.Unrwa criticised Israel, saying: “Since the start of the war in Gaza, the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has also seen a sharp escalation of violence.“Families know only fear and uncertainty. The growing annexation of the West Bank continues unabated, in flagrant violation of international law. This must stop. The future of Gaza and the West Bank are one.”The head of the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, Tom Fletcher, speaking to the BBC, said of his recent visit to Gaza: “It felt to me like I was driving through the ruins of Hiroshima, or Stalingrad, or Dresden”.Delegations from Hamas led by Khalil al-Hayya, and its rival,Fatah, led by Hussein Al-Sheikh, met in Egypt on Friday to discuss post-war arrangements in the Gaza Strip.Hamas said it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators that “the war has effectively ended”.A joint statement published on the Hamas website said the groups had agreed during a meeting in Cairo to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent ‘technocrats’, which will manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuTurkeyEuropeMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

But even Trump painted a dire picture of the South American country’s stagnating economy last week, telling reporters: “Argentina is fighting for its life … They are dying.”Trump has warned he could axe the aid package if Milei fares poorly in Sunday’s vote, when half of the seats in the 257-member lower house are up for grabs as well as 24 seats in the 72-member senate. “If he doesn’t win, we’re gone,” Trump said last week while hosting Milei at the White House.Trump’s apparent attempt to influence Argentine voters is not his first intervention in South American politics this year. Starting in July, the US president set about trying to derail the trial of his far-right ally, the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions against Brazil and its officials. But that campaign failed, boosting the political fortunes of Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, while also failing to save Bolsonaro from a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup.In Argentina, Milei’s political opponents also predict Trump’s manoeuvres will backfire.View image in fullscreenJavier walks among supporters during his arrival at a campaign rally  in Rosario on Thursday.Photograph: Tomás Cuesta/Getty ImagesItai Hagman, an economist and Peronist seeking re-election to the lower house in Buenos Aires on Sunday, accused Trump of trying to “extort” Argentine voters with his threat to withdraw his rescue package.“It is a clear interference in the internal affairs of another country,” said Hagman. “The Argentine people [will] … defend their sovereignty and their democracy. They will not vote based on what the president of another country tells them, but on their own interests and will.”Hagman called Sunday’s elections a referendum on “a libertarian anarcho-capitalist experiment” that was “causing brutal economic and social suffering” with its severe austerity measures and had “decided to delegate economic management to officials from another country”.Milei allies are asking voters to be patient. “We cannot solve all the problems that the country has had for 100 years in two years,” said Gonzalo Roca, Freedom Advance’s main congressional candidate in Córdoba. He insisted the country was “on the right path”, but admitted Milei’s blueprint required “effort and sacrifice”.Gustavo Córdoba, a political analyst and the co-director of the consultancy Zuban Córdoba, predicted voters would “punish Milei for their economic hardship” with his polling showing that 60% of Argentinians could not make ends meet.Benjamin Gedan, the director of the Latin America programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said public dissatisfaction had been building since earlier this year among voters who had been promised “a period of shared prosperity” if they endured Milei’s structural adjustment.“That really hasn’t materialised,” Gedan added, pointing to a growing sense among Argentininians “that prosperity is around the corner – and always will be”.Gedan believed Milei faced a crunch moment this weekend. He said:“If he does very badly you could have a real economic and financial crisis and another run on the peso.”Gedan said a “muddled” result was more likely, which would allow Milei to claim some success in increasing his party’s representation in congress and enable him to see out the remaining half of his four-year term but make it “really difficult for him to continue transforming Argentina in any sustainable way”.Argentina’s president, according to Gedan, had enjoyed a long honeymoon despite his politically damaging budget cuts.“There weren’t tremendous public protests. He wasn’t beset by national strikes at union activism … But inevitably his political honeymoon would end: his was longer than that of many of his peers’ – especially given the shock therapy he was imposing. But it couldn’t last for ever.”Explore more on these topicsJavier MileiArgentinaTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The US state department revokedPetro’s visa in Septemberafter he took part in pro-Palestinian protests in New York. Petro, who hasconsistently criticized US support of Israeli military actions, urged American soldiers to “not to point their guns at people. Disobey the orders of Trump. Obey the orders of humanity.”“Revoking it for denouncing genocide shows the US no longer respects international law,” Petro added in a post on X.Petro did not mince his words when speaking on theUnited States’s extrajudicial killings of alleged drug traffickersin the Caribbean. One attack killed a Colombian fisher whom the Colombian government, with his family, denied was a drug trafficker.“It is murder. Whether in the Caribbean or Pacific, the US government strategy breaks the norms of international law,” Petro wrote on social media.While rare, the imposition of sanctions on a head of state is not unprecedented. The move adds Petro to a list that includes the leaders of Russia, Venezuela and North Korea.Petro’s wife and son and Armando Benedetti, Colombia’s interior minister, were also hit with sanctions on Friday under the authority that allows Washington to target those it accuses of being involved in the global illicit drug trade.On X, Benedetti said he had been penalized for merely stating that Petro was not a drug trafficker, and that the sanctions proved the US anti-drug fight was a “sham”.Former lawmaker Nicolas Petro, who is already facingcorruption chargesin Colombia, said on X he had been targeted for being his father’s son and that his pending case has nothing to do with drug trafficking.Friday’s action freezes any US assets of those targeted, and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.“President Trump has been clear that President Petro better close up these killing fields immediately or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely,” said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyColombiaAmericasDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

He is due to arrive in Malaysia on Sunday morning local time.The US president is also expected to meet Qatar’s emir during a refuelling stop on the way to Malaysia, a White House official said. Trump will be joined there by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and is expected to discuss the ceasefire in Gaza, which officials are hoping to move to a second, final phase in the coming weeks.Trump is to meet Xi on the final day of his trip, hoping to seal a deal to end the bruising trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.Trump in Asia: five key questions as US president prepares for diplomatic tourRead moreOn Saturday, topeconomic officials from the US andChinamet in Kuala Lumpur to prepare for the meeting and to have preliminary talks on the key issues in the escalating tariff war.A US treasury spokesperson described the meetings as “very constructive” and said they would resume the next morning.Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he hoped for a “very good meeting” with Xi, adding that he expected China to make a deal to avoid 100% tariffs taking effect on 1 November.As he left Washington, Trump added fuel to the speculation that while on the Korean peninsula hecould meet Kim for the first time since 2019.“I would. If you want to put out the word, I’m open to it,” Trump said aboard the presidential plane. “I had a great relationship with him.”Regarding North Korea’s demand to be recognised as a nuclear state as a precondition for dialogue with Washington, Trump replied: “Well, I think they are sort of a nuclear power.“When you say they have to be recognised as a nuclear power, well, they got a lot of nuclear weapons, I’ll say that.”The two leaders met three times during Trump’s first term. Kim has said he would also be open to meeting the US president if Washington dropped its demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.South Korea’s reunification minister said on Friday there was a “considerable” chance that Trump and Kim would meet while the US leader was in South Korea, and CNN, citing anonymous sources, reported last weekend that US officials had discussed setting up a meeting during Trump’s visit.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump boards Air Force One as he departs for Asia.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersHowever, before he left the US on Friday, US officials sought to tamp down on the speculation, telling reporters there was currently no plan to meet the North Korean leader.Trump’s first stop will be Malaysia, for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit. There he is expected to sign a trade deal with Malaysia and oversee the signing of apeace accord between Thailand and Cambodia.He said he also expected to meet the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on the sidelines of the summit to improve tiesafter months of bad blood.Trump’s next destination will be Tokyo,where he will meet Sanae Takaichi, named this week as Japan’s first female prime minister. The new leader is expected to follow through on plans from her predecessor to increase military spending and make $550bn in investments in the US.But the highlight of the trip is expected to be South Korea, with Trump due to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, and where he is expected to meet Xi for the first time since his return to office.Global markets will be watching to see if the two men can halt the trade war sparked by Trump’s sweeping tariffs earlier this year, especially after a recent disputeover Beijing’s rare earth curbs.Trump initially threatened to cancel the meeting and announced the fresh 100% tariffs during that row,before saying he would go after all.On Wednesday, the US secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent, said the meeting between the two leaders would be a “pull-aside” – a meeting on the sidelines of the conference. But Trump later said they would have a “pretty long meeting” so that they could “work out a lot of our questions and our doubts and our tremendous assets together”.An interim agreement could include limited relief on tariffs, an extension of current rates, orChina committing to buy US soya beansand US-made Boeing planes. Beijing reneged on similar promises in a 2020 deal with Trump.Trump warned he could raise tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 155% starting from 1 November if the two countries could not agree a trade deal.Beyond trade, the two leaders are expected to discuss Taiwan and Russia, a Chinese ally now subject to expanded US sanctions over the war in Ukraine.Before departing the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters he expectedthe Taiwan issue to be raisedduring his talks with Xi.Trump also said he would probably raise the issue of releasing Jimmy Lai, the founder of the now defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. Lai is serving a prison sentence in Hong Kong under Beijing-imposed national security laws.“It’s on my list. I’m going to ask … We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpXi JinpingChinaNorth KoreaKim Jong-unTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Her death will be treated with reverence in a country where any criticism is held at bay bystrictly enforced lese-majesty laws, which prescribe potential prison sentences for insulting royals, even those who are dead.View image in fullscreenKing Bhumibol reviews a parade with Queen Sirikit to mark his birthday in Bangkok in 2006.Photograph: Chaiwat Subprasom/ReutersBorn in 1932, the year Thailand transitioned to a constitutional monarchy from an absolute monarchy, Sirikit Kitiyakara was the daughter of Thailand’s ambassador to France and led a life of wealth and privilege.While studying music and language in Paris she met Bhumibol, who had spent parts of his childhood in Switzerland.“It was hate at first sight,” she said in a BBC documentary, noting that he had arrived late to their first meeting. “Then it was love.”The couple spent time together in Paris and were engaged in 1949. They married in Thailand a year later when she was 17.Sirikit collaborated with French couturier Pierre Balmain on outfits made from Thai silk and by supporting the preservation of traditional weaving practices, she is credited with helping revitalise Thailand’s silk industry.For more than four decades, she frequently travelled with the king to remote Thai villages, promoting development projects for the rural poor – their activities televised nightly on the country’s Royal Bulletin.She was briefly regent in 1956, when her husband spent two weeks in a temple, studying to become a Buddhist monk in a rite of passage common in Thailand.View image in fullscreenQueen Sirikit with her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesIn 1976, her birthday, 12 August, became Mother’s Day anda national holiday in Thailand.Her only son,now King Maha Vajiralongkorn, also known as Rama X, succeeded Bhumibol after his death in 2016 and upon his coronation in 2019, Sirikit’s formal title became Queen Mother.Officially, the monarchy is above politics in Thailand, whose modern history has been dominated by coups and unstable governments. However, sometimes the royals including Sirikit have intervened or taken actions seen as political.In 1998, she used her birthday address to urge Thais to unite behind the then prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, dealing a crippling blow to an opposition plan to hold a no confidence debate in the hope of forcing a new election.Later, she became associated with a political movement, the royalist People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), whose protests brought down governments led by or allied toThaksin Shinawatra.In 2008, Sirikit attended a funeral of a PAD protester killed in clashes with police, implying royal backing for a campaign that had helped oust a pro-Thaksin government a year earlier.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Such is his determination to stay above the ideological fray, he rarely involves himself in policy debates where the party’s “broad church” is divided.Queensland puberty blocker ban unlawful due to ‘political’ interference and lack of consultation, court hearsRead moreIt is hard to argue with the strategy, particularly as Liberals in other states, and the federal party, appear to struggle with existential questions.Liberals say the party’s first, second and third priority is a second term in government, and that they need to appeal to more moderate Brisbane voters to make that happen.“That is what gets the premier out of bed in the morning,” an LNP MP tells the Guardian.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOn one hand, Crisafulli appears to have learned from the breakneck bungling of the Newman years – of a government elected on a moderate platform but captive to a hard-right party room of MPs who weren’t expected to win seats in parliament.Scott Emerson, the transport minister in the Newman government, says a key lesson from those years was not to act too quickly; that it was important to explain why first.“I think some of the strategy that we’ve seen from the Crisafulli government is very much from those lessons that were learned [from the Newman government],” Emerson says.“Maybe [there is] the criticism out there that they’re not doing enough fast enough, but … you have to make sure that the public is aware there’s a problem [first]”.Queenslanders tend to like “conservative” governments: not necessarily in the ideological sense, but voters seem to get scared when reform happens too quickly. The early mantra of the Goss government was “don’t scare the horses”. Annastacia Palasczuk was tagged in the early years for “reviewing and not doing”.But Crisafulli’s government appears to be something else entirely: an administration with a firm stance on only one issue – youth crime – and one that is perhaps quickly discovering the flip-side of an ideological vacuum.A year on, has the LNP simply run out of things to do?Aside from the youth crime laws, the government has focused most of its attention on planning for the 2032 Olympic Games, beating up on the CFMEU, and attempting to convince Queenslanders Labor was cooking the books.Paul Williams, an associate professor at Griffith University and a commentator onQueensland politicssince the 1980s, says there is almost nothing on the government’s legislative agenda.The parliamentary notice paper for the next sitting day lists just one bill for government business: a proposal to reform the Queensland Building and Construction Commission.“If you’re not offering enough, except disgruntlement of the incumbent and the status quo of a crime [agenda] … you haven’t got really anything to hang your hat on,” Williams says.“So then the rationale for people sticking with you is impressions rather than policy substance, and the impression … of the LNP has been one that’s been … largely spinning its wheels.LNP’s youth crime legislation condemned by UN as ‘incompatible with basic child rights’Read more“If the government doesn’t find an agenda outside the Olympics and youth crime it becomes a government run by the media cycle”.“This could easily be a one-term government.”Recent polling has shown the LNP having lost support in Brisbane and the suburbs, where it failed to break through, despite a comfortable election win built on success in Queensland’s regions.There are, logically, two ways the government can go from here. The first is to solidify its position by continuing to appeal to moderate city voters, the sort that have been put off by the hard right, socially-conservative elements of the LNP at past elections.But if polls show the party struggling to make urban inroads, the likelihood is a pivot to defend the regional seats won in 2024, where voters are more comfortable with rightwing rhetoric.Ideological divisions still live inside the LNP, no matter how fervently Crisafulli might try to suppress them.“The current premier risks losing the very base that built the Liberal National party,” Matthew Cliff, chief executive of anti-abortion lobby group Cherish Life, wrote in a blog post last month.Cherish Life has campaigned for conservative Liberals in recent years; the organisation’s vice-president, Alan Baker, isa party official.“Perhaps [Crisafulli] is comfortable with that,” Cliff wrote.“But the history of politics suggests it is a dangerous gamble. Every time conservative leaders neglect conservative concerns, others are waiting in the wings to fill the void.“If he continues to dismiss and alienate that constituency, the long-term cost could be high. Not only with his supporters on the right but also with those in his own party who lean right.”Crisafulli seems to have managed that situation so far by giving just enough rope to the conservative elements of his government – headed by deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie – who sources say are the loudest voices in the cabinet room.This is not – however Crisafulli wants to characterise it – a government that is above culture wars. That was writ large in the decision to end the First Nations truth-telling inquiry; the backtracking on coal power plant closures; cracking down on windfarms; abolishing pill testing; and banningcritical gender-affirming caretreatments, including puberty blockers, using a justification thatappears remarkably thin.That has staved off a conservative insurgency, for now.A year in, the Crisafulli government is stable but being criticised as boring, directionless and stuck on a high wire. The premier has another three years to maintain the balancing act.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsQueenslandDavid CrisafulliLiberal National partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Aboriginal legal groups said the criminal age should be raised to 14 and the presumption of doli incapax removed altogether.The review, led by Geoffrey Bellew SC, the state parole authority chair and a former supreme court judge, and Jeffrey Loy, a former NSW police deputy commissioner, was released Saturday.Seven recommendations included a new legislative framework for enacting the presumption of doli incapax in NSW, which should confirm the presumption that, unless rebutted, a child over the age of 10 and under the age of 14 cannot commit an offence.Bowraville murders: police begin two-day river search for remains of Colleen Walker-CraigRead moreIn the report, Bellew and Loy acknowledged the current test for determining whether the presumption has been rebutted “imposes a high threshold” but said the difficulty was an “important safeguard against the possibility of inappropriate findings of criminal responsibility when a child lacks that knowledge, and recognises the considerable vulnerability of children aged 10–13 years and the significant impact upon such children of a criminal conviction.”The report acknowledged “youth crime is a justifiable concern for many communities in NSW” but said the data indicated it is only a small proportion of children in the 10 to 13 age group who engage in serious or persistent offending.“It is therefore important not to conflate that focus with broader concerns stemming from youth crime which involves older children.”They recommended introducing a voluntary pathway for children within the criminal justice system, including referrals, conduct assessments and support plans for children with complex needs.They also recommended the government consider introducing court orders that allow children aged 10 to 13 therapeutic treatment in appropriate circumstances.In a statement released Saturday, the NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, said the review shows “the current settings are not operating in the best interests of children or the broader community”.“We don’t want a situation where children are left without any intervention when charges are dismissed or withdrawn, only to come back before the courts because they were not supported to change their behaviour,” Daley said.The chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service, Karly Warner, welcomed the report’s recommendations.“We know that locking children up not only compounds trauma for that child, it also increases the likelihood that they will reoffend as an adolescent or adult – ultimately increasing future crime,” Warner said in a statement.At the announcement of the review in May, Timothy Roberts, the president of theNSW Council for Civil Liberties, said it was “completely unnecessary” in the first place.Roberts questioned the fact that “at a time when the people of NSW should be asking ourselves, whether children as young as 10, children in year 4 or 5 in primary school, should face criminal charges at all, this government has commissioned a review that undermines basic legal principles that protect our community from unfair prosecutions.”“What is wrong with the court saying that we need to be sure that children, as young as 10, facing criminal charges know that what they are accused of is wrong and we know this beyond reasonable doubt. Less young children in prison is a good thing,” Roberts said.Explore more on these topicsCrime - AustraliaNew South WalesIndigenous AustraliansnewsShareReuse this content"

He fought back against the system – and wonRead moreIn a statement, a spokesperson for Services Australia said there were several reasons debts may be overpaid in the first place, including customers not cancelling automatic payments such as BPay, customers who paid back debts that were later reduced following a review, Family Tax Benefit debts that have been reduced after the customer lodged several years of outstanding tax returns at once and Centrelink not being able to contact customers.The spokesperson disputed that the average amount was $5,000, instead saying “50% of the potentially owed refunds are less than $50, 80% are less than $500 and 2% are for $5000 or more”.The spokesperson said it processed “hundreds of thousands of refunds like this every year” but in this case, the correct process was not followed. They said they would be in touch with everyone affected to refund the overpayments.“There’s nothing people need to do right now. From late October 2025, we’re contacting impacted people,” the spokesperson said.Allingham said the government needs to “take responsibility” for the overpayment, and not blame welfare recipients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heather Humphreys, a former cabinet minister who ran for the rulingFine Gaelparty, won 424,987 votes, or 29%, in a two-horse race. Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Jim Gavin, had dropped out of the campaign but his name remained on the ballot and he won 103,568, or 7%.Connolly’s triumph was marred by a turnout of 46% – low by Irish standards – and 213,738 spoiled or invalid votes, an unprecedented number that reflected frustration over the lack of choice. In some Dublin constituencies up to a fifth of votes were spoiled.The presidency is a largely ceremonial office but Connolly’s victory was a stinging rebuke to the centre-right government.Catherine Connolly: the outspoken leftwinger set to be Ireland’s next presidentRead moreAnger over a housing crisis and the cost of living, campaign blunders by Fine Gael and its ruling partner Fianna Fáil, rare unity among leftwing parties and deft use of social media combined to make Connolly asymbol of change.The prospect of Connolly succeeding President Michael D Higgins and serving a seven-year term at Áras an Uachtaráin, the presidential residence, thrills supporters. She wishes to ringfence Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism” and has accused the UK and US of enabling genocide in Gaza.The former clinical psychologist and barrister enthused young people through podcasts and posts that went viral on social media, including videos that showed her doingkeepy-uppy. Artists and musicians such as Kneecap and the Mary Wallopers endorsed her.Critics depicted Connolly as a radical who dodged awkward questions and could damage Ireland’s relations with Washington and with its European allies.Irish presidents traditionally played quiet, symbolic roles, but since 1990 Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and Higgins have turned the office into a more visible platform.Connolly said during the campaign that she would respect the limits of the office, which some interpreted as a tacit promise to rein in controversial views, but analysts predicted friction with the government.She was a marginal political figure when she declared her candidacy in July, and only small parties – the Social Democrats and People Before Profit – backed her. Labour then endorsed her, and Sinn Féin, which had decided to not run its own candidate, threw its formidable resources and electoral organisation behind Connolly.Celebrities such as Bob Geldof, Michael Flatley, Conor McGregor and others had expressed interest in running for president butfailed to win the political backingto get on the ballot.Fianna Fáil’s candidate, Gavin, was a political novicewho withdrewafter a financial scandal imploded his campaign.Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Humphreys. The border -county Presbyterian was deemed to have wholesome, mainstream appeal but performed badly in debates.Higgins, who has been president for 14 years, congratulated Connolly in a phone call. “The president-elect will have the full support of this office as she prepares for her inauguration next month,” he said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsIrelandFine GaelFianna FailEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A visual guideRead more“People are still really angry,” said Rosa Cerros, a 42-year-old public servant who took part with her husband and two young daughters.“Why weren’t people evacuated? Its incomprehensible,” she added.Mazón’s administration has been heavily criticised for not sending out flood alerts to mobile phones until 8.11pm on 29 October 2024, when flooding had already started in some places.That was more than 12 hours after the national weather agency had issued its highest alert level for torrential rains.People told Spanish media that by the time they received the alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets and pouring into their homes.The floods hit 78 municipalities, mostly in the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia, killing 229 people in the region. One body was found as recently as Tuesday.Despite the warning signs, Mazón went ahead with an hours-long lunch with a journalist on the day of the floods, also appearing in photos tweeted by his staff receiving a sustainable tourism certification.“Mazón wasn’t where he should have been that day, he wasn’t up to the task,” said another protester, Gonzalo Bosch, a 38-year-old accountant from Paiporta, one of the towns worst hit by the floods.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Carlos Mazon and his regional vice-president, Susana Camarero.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesDemonstrators held signs with messages calling on Mazón to resign or even be imprisoned as they made their way through the streets of Spain’s third-largest city.Under Spain’s highly decentralised system, disaster management is the regional administration’s responsibility.But Mazón, a member of the conservative Popular party (PP) which sits in opposition to the Socialist-led national government, has argued his administration did not have the information needed to warn people sooner.In a poll published earlier this month in the national daily El País, 71% of residents of Valencia said they felt Mazón should resign.Almost half of the people who died in last year’s catastrophic floods in Valencia were 70 or older, a fact highlighted by some protesters.They accuse the authorities of having failed to protect the region’s most vulnerable residents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the alarm sounded people had already drowned or were in real danger,” the 51-year-old social worker told AFP.“All those deaths were completely preventable,” she added.Campaigners have staged regular demonstrations against Mazón often on or near the monthly anniversaries of the disaster.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Valencia on the first anniversary of the floods.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe PP’s national leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has stood by Mazón despite his unpopularity because “he has no other choice”, Anton Losada, a politics professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela, told AFP.Mazón’s resignation would trigger early elections in Valencia, which would probably be “catastrophic” for the PP and Feijóo’s leadership, Losada told AFP.The party is hoping a successful reconstruction effort will help restore its standing, he added.A state memorial ceremony will take place on the first anniversary of the tragedy on Wednesday in Valencia, attended by King Felipe and the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.Explore more on these topicsSpainFloodingProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In July, when she declared her candidacy, she was a one-woman act: an independent leftwing member of parliament from Galway who was unfamiliar to most voters.Yet the 68-year-old won backing from a hodgepodge of small opposition parties – the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, Labour – and then a big one, Sinn Féin – which decided to not run its own candidate – in a rare show of unity from the usually fractious left.Leftwinger Catherine Connolly wins Ireland presidential election by landslideRead moreEven then Connolly seemed an outside bet. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the two ruling centre-right parties that have dominated Irish politics for a century, each fielded their own candidate. Under electoral rules, voters select candidates in order of preference, so if one candidate was eliminated, transfers were expected to help the other establishment figure across the line.Instead, a collision of events turned Connolly, who speaks so softly you need to lean in to hear her, intopolitical thunder. She won 64% of votes – an across-the-board sweep of villages and cities and, above all, the young.So for the next seven yearsIrelandwill have a head of state who believes in equality and ring-fencing Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism” and genocide enablement. In Britain some have compared Connolly to Jeremy Corbyn and marvel – or groan – that an EU state has veered left when so many other countries have drifted right or far-right.The election however does not fit such neat packaging. It is, no mistake, an earthquake that shakes the authority and confidence of the government and bolsters the possibility of a leftwing alliance at the next general election. But it does not represent an ideological shift.The presidency is a largely ceremonial office. Mary Robinson turned it into a more visible platform, and Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins continued that trend, but whomever occupies Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence in the Phoenix Park, is very constrained.Voters twice elected Higgins – himself an outspoken leftwinger from Galway – but gave executive power to successive coalitions dominated by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Connolly can highlight topics, set a tone, make symbolic gestures, perhaps skirmish with the government on policy issues, but she will be bound by the constitution, and has promised to respect those limits.There is a perception outside Ireland that Connolly will be a Sinn Féin instrument for a united Ireland. The party’s formidable resources and electoral organisation aided her but Connolly has shown little interest in unification and the issue barely featured in the campaign. She is her own woman and does her own thing – as Labour, her former party, discovered when she broke away and was elected to the Dáil as an independent in 2016.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s conceivable that opposition parties, having tasted victory, will cohere into a viable government-in-waiting. But two factors should temper talk of a breakthrough.The ruling parties sabotaged themselves. Fianna Fáil ran a political newbie, Jim Gavin, who floundered anddropped out of the raceover a financial scandal. The late withdrawal meant his name remained on the ballot but party loyalists had little incentive to vote – or, crucially, give a second preference to the other establishment candidate.Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Heather Humphreys, banking on centrist appeal and rural wholesomeness; but voters found her insipid.For all the nimbleness of Connolly’s campaign, including viral videos that showed her doingkeepy-uppies, her opponents’ blunders paved the victory and the left cannot assume a repeat.The other factor is that most people did not vote – turnout was estimated to be about 46%, reflecting widespread indifference – and a record number intentionally spoiled their vote, reflectingfrustration at the lack of alternative candidates. Some lamented the lack of a social conservative, others complained that nobody reflected their concern over immigration.Connolly earned her landslide but not everyone is cheering.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The matter was reported by team security to police who are handling the matter.”The players have been offered support, and will continue playing in the tournament. The International Cricket Council has been approached for comment.Devajit Saikia, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said it was a “deeply regrettable and isolated incident”. He continued: “We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served“We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”News of an arrest broke as Australia took to the field fortheir final-round match, with a spot in the semi-finals already secured. Australia have spent large parts of this tournament in Indore, with Saturday’s seven-wicket thrashing of South Africa their third game at Holkar Stadium.Alana King took a record seven for 18, the spinner’s seven-over spell routing South Africa for 97 in 24 overs, while Australia chased the total down with 98 for three in only 16.5 overs. It was the best bowling spell at the Women’s Cricket World Cup – the first instance of a seven-wicket haul in tournament history. King surpassed Jackie Lord’s six for 10 for New Zealand against India in 1982.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupAustralia sportCricketWomen's cricketAustralia women's cricket teamIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He said he would “do it again tomorrow”.Bob Vylan ‘not regretful’ about IDF chant at Glastonbury: ‘I’d do it again tomorrow’Read moreBritish Airways told the PA Media that the podcast’s content breached its sponsorship policy.A spokesperson said: “Our sponsorship of the series has now been paused and the advert has been removed.“We’re grateful that this was brought to our attention, as the content clearly breaches our sponsorship policy in relation to politically sensitive or controversial subject matters.“We and our third-party media agency have processes in place to ensure these issues don’t occur and we’re investigating how this happened.”The rap duo had to postpone two gigs after the fallout from their Glastonbury performance – including a show in Manchester – after calls from MPs and Jewish community leaders.Bob Vylan was dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the members’ visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour.In the podcast, recorded on 1 October, when Theroux asked if Vylan stood by the chant and if he would do it again,he said: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again.“I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays. I’m not regretful of it at all, like the subsequent backlash that I’ve faced. It’s minimal.“It’s minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through. If that can be my contribution and if I can have my Palestinian friends and people that I meet from Palestine that have had to flee, that have lost members in double digits of their family and they can say: ‘Yo, your chant, I love it.’ Or it gave me a breath of fresh air or whatever.”He said that he did not want to overstate the importance of the chant. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?”Vylan’s Glastonbury set was livestreamed by the BBC, which faced criticism for not pulling the feed.

The best outcome for you is to make contact directly with us by either calling 999 or reporting yourself to a police station.”He urged anyone “who sees him, knows where he is or has any information” to call 999 immediately, adding that police believe Kebatu “has access to funds, and critically, in both Chelmsford and London, sought assistance from members of the public, and has spoken to station staff”.1:32Met police appeal to Epping sex offender to hand himself in – videoIn an update on Saturday evening, the Met said officers had now confirmed that Kebatu was last seen shortly before 8pm on Friday evening in the Dalston area of Hackney.“He was still wearing his prison-issue grey tracksuit top and bottoms, but is now carrying his belongings in a distinctive white bag with pictures of avocados on it,” the Met said.“Additional officers have been deployed to the area to carry out further searches, but we are appealing for the help of local residents to report any sightings as soon as possible.”The 41-year-old was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre to be deported but was released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex by mistake, it has emerged.A delivery driver has described seeing Kebatu return to HMP Chelmsford in a “very confused” state “four or five times”, only to be turned away by prison staff and directed to the railway station.The driver, named only as Sim, told Sky News that he saw Kebatu come out of the prison saying “Where am I going? What am I doing?” and hanging around for about 1½ hours as he tried to find out where he should be going.He said that Kebatu knew that he should be deported but the prison staff were “basically sending him away” and saying to him: “Go, you’ve been released, you go.”The driver said: “He kept scratching his head and saying: ‘Where do I go, where do I go?’ The fourth or fifth time [he went into the reception] he was starting to get upset, he was getting stressed. I’m not sticking up for the guy, but in my eyes, he was trying to do the right thing.“He knew he was getting deported, but he didn’t know where he was going or how he should get there.”Kebatu appears to have been spotted later in Chelmsford town centre asking for assistance before getting on to a train to London.GraphicEssex police confirmed Kebatu was seen catching a train at Chelmsford railway station at 12.41pm on Friday. Met police confirmed he was seen getting off the train in Stratford in east London at about 1.10pm on Friday.As a result, the Met was handed responsibility for the investigation on Saturday morning, the force said.Conway had said earlier that finding Kebatu was a “top priority” for the Met.He added: “The manhunt is being led by an experienced senior investigating officer. He has teams from the specialist crime command with expertise in tracking down wanted people at his disposal, as well as other resources from across the Met.“We are examining CCTV from [Stratford] and farther afield, including on the transport network, to establish information about his subsequent movements.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place.According to the Telegraph, Kebatu was wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be released on licence and handed a £76 discharge grant.Foreigners underrepresented among prisoners in England and Wales, report findsRead moreOne prison source described the incident as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, and dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time.Aaron Stowe, the president of the Criminal Justice Workers’ Union (CJWU), called Kebatu’s mistaken release “a profound failure of duty”.He said: “The release of Hadush Kebatu is a betrayal of the victims, the community, and the principles of justice. We demand a full investigation and immediate reforms to ensure this never happens again.”Mike Rolfe, the CJWU’s general secretary, added: “The justice system is stretched to breaking point, the public’s confidence is collapsing, and those tasked with enforcing the law are left to pick up the pieces of political cowardice.”The father of Kebatu’s teenage victim told Sky News: “The justice system has let us down.”A report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons after an inspection in January and February 2024 said HMP Chelmsford faced “considerable pressures” because of “national capacity issues”, while suffering staff shortfalls in reception and the pre-release team.A spokesperson for the Prison Service said it had launched an investigation into the incident and was “urgently working” with police to return Kebatu to custody, adding in a statement: “Public protection is our top priority.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the release was “totally unacceptable” and that he was “appalled”.Annual government data for prisons shows that262 prisoners were released in errorin the year to March 2025, an increase of 128% on the previous year.Kebatu was found guilty of five offences last month after attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl twice, before sexually assaulting her, and sexually assaulting a woman and trying to kiss her too.He committed the offences just days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping. His case triggered protests outside the hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests.At his trial, the district judge Christopher Williams said Kebatu posed a “significant risk of reoffending”, was “manipulative”, and had acted “ignorantly and repulsively” towards the woman he had assaulted. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and had served just 31 days when he was released.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationImmigration and asylumMetropolitan policeLondonEnglandEssexnewsShareReuse this content"

Telling Lam that many people with ILR have children who are UK citizens, Turley asked if such people would be deported, adding that if they were, “would you be content for the responsibility to care for those children to fall to the state?”The letter went on: “What costs do you anticipate arising from the transfer of the children of foreign-born parents with ILR into the care of the state? Do you believe that it is in the best interests of a child for one or both of their parents to be deported?”Turley ended: “The people you are talking about deporting are part of our country: our friends and neighbours and colleagues – people whose lives are intertwined with ours.

She said she had been given “a clear mandate that members want their voice to be heard at the top of the party”.The Manchester Central MP won 54% of the vote, polling 87,407 votes, while Phillipson received 73,536. Turnout was just 16.6%, which someLabourinsiders say points to widespread disillusionment within the party.The result was announced on Saturday against the backdrop of Labour’scatastrophic byelection performance in Caerphilly. The party came third, behind Plaid Cymru and Reform, polling just 11% of the vote in a previously safe seat that had been held by Labour since the creation of the Welsh Senedd in 1999.Both Labour deputy leadership candidates spoke in favour of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, something believed to be unpopular with members.Speaking to the Guardian, Powell said: “I think we often feel like our members and elected representatives are something we need to stand against or not value. They are our strengths.“They connect us to the national conversation. Instead of just telling people what we want them to do, we need to respect, value and include them more, and recognise that debate is not division or dissent, and recognise you have to take people with you and hear from broader voices, not just a narrower group of voices.“They haven’t felt they have been included and connected as they should in recent months, and that’s what often happens when you go into government.“I’m going to really help to do that, to re-engage with the party, and make them feel part of the conversation again. I’ll do that through working with Keir [Starmer], working with government, working right across the party in the leadership roles that I will have.”Powell, who was sacked as Commons leader by Starmer in September, said she would get to work “straight away” to shore up Labour’s support before local elections next May. She said the party needed to be clearer about its successes in office.She said: “I’m not writing off any elections next year. These are important elections in Wales, in Scotland, in London, and right around the country.“I’m going to get to work straight away on how we can mobilise for these elections and how we can rebuild our voter coalition and recognise there is a progressive alliance in this country. We need to be the leaders of it and not out-Reform Reform because that just doesn’t work.“It’s not that long. I think we’ve got to seize back the agenda – we’ve ceded too much in recent months.“We’ve got loads of great things we’ve done, I think we can all agree on that, from giving workers more rights, to pay rises, to more hospital appointments, to free school meals, to breakfast clubs.“I think we just need to bring them all together in a stronger way – our agenda on how we are working in the interests of the many and not the few.”On Saturday evening the health secretary, Wes Streeting, compared the Caerphilly byelection result with the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, which left Starmer considering quitting as Labour leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And he used Hartlepool and the experience of Hartlepool to drive through the change in the Labour party necessary to make it electable and capable of winning a general election that no one thought we would win.“I have no doubt that, having done that before, Keir can do that again.”One ally of Phillipson, widely perceived as Downing Street’s favoured candidate, said it was “always going to be hard to assuage the anger of members, who have shown how unhappy they are through this result”.They added: “Bridget stood out of loyalty to Keir. She believed that standing was the right thing to do when it was clear no one else from cabinet was prepared to stand.”Starmer congratulated Powell on her victory. He said the Conservatives and Reform wanted to take Britain to a “dark place” – prompting one strategist to suggest he was leaning into a more progressive brand of politics.The prime minister referenced comments made by the Conservative MP Katie Lam, touted as a possible future party leader. She said she believed “a large number of people” living legally in the UK should have their right to stay revoked and be forced to “go home” in order to create a “culturally coherent group of people” in the UK.Starmer said: “Our job, whoever we are in this party, is to unite every single person in this country who is opposed to that politics, and to defeat it, once and for all.”Explore more on these topicsLucy PowellLabour party deputy leadershipLabournewsShareReuse this content"

But Robeson’s office said GPS data shows he never visited those locations before he asked the dispatcher to clear him from the scene.They say Bollaro instead headed to Duke’s Pizzeria in Pittstown, where he remained for nearly an hour. Witnesses later saw him park and enter another local restaurant, where he remained for roughly another hour, prosecutors said.US student handcuffed after AI system apparently mistook bag of chips for gunRead moreBollaro later submitted a report in which prosecutors say he made false statements about the extent of his investigation. They note that during the timeframe he claimed to be canvassing the area, the officer was already on route to the pizzeria.The following day, 2 August, the bodies of Lauren Semanchik, 33, and Tyler Webb, 29, were found in a home roughly 600ft (183 meters) away from the location of the first 911 caller. Prosecutors say the two had been shot to death by New Jersey state police lieutenant Ricardo Santos, who had later killed himself.Bollaro has been charged with official misconduct for knowingly refraining from performing his police duties, prosecutors said. He also faces a charge of tampering with public records for knowingly making false entries in his incident report.Bollaro is due to appear in court 5 November.His lawyer, Charles Sciarra, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday but, in a statement to the New York Post, called the charges “unfortunate”. He maintained “nothing Kevin Bollaro did or did not do that day impacted or could have stopped” the killings.The families of the two shooting victims, meanwhile, have said they are “shocked at Sgt Bollaro’s egregious conduct” and believe it is the “tip of the iceberg of the many failures by the local and state police” in the killings, WABC-TV reports.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyUS policingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.”Born in New York City in 1925, Lockhart was the daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart. She first appeared on the stage at just eight years old in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. Her first film appearance came in 1938’s A Christmas Carol, playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit.On Broadway, she starred in For Love or Money in 1947 and The Grand Prize in 1955. Her performance in For Love or Money earned her a special Tony award for outstanding performance by a newcomer in 1948.The actor began her television career in 1949 with guest appearances on programs such as Hallmark Hall of Fame, Shirley Temple’s Storybook, Wagon Train and Gunsmoke. Over nearly 80 years in entertainment, she continued to work steadily, appearing in shows such as Petticoat Junction, General Hospital, Beverly Hills 90210, The Beverly Hillbillies, Happy Days, Full House, Roseanne and Grey’s Anatomy.She achieved particular fame for her leading role on Lassie beginning in 1958. Then, from 1965 to 1968, she portrayed the matriarch of a family of space explorers in Lost in Space. Decades later, in 2021, she made a voice cameo in Netflix’s reboot of the same series.Speaking withNPRin 2004, Lockhart reflected on how the Lost in Space series had inspired viewers: “People would tell her that watching Lost in Space inspired them to become scientists. I did Lassie for six years, and I never had anybody come up to me and say: ‘It made me want to be a farmer.’”Lockhart received two Emmy nominations, including one for best actress in a leading role in a dramatic series, for Lassie. She was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film and one for television.In 1951, she married John F Maloney. The couple had two daughters, Anne and June Elizabeth, before divorcing in 1959.Funeral services will be held privately. The family has requested that, instead of sending flowers, donations be made to the Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog Inc.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The October survey shows that 25% of Hispanic adults now hold a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of Trump, down sharply from 44% in an AP-NORC poll conducted just before he began his second term.At the same time, the share of Hispanic respondents who believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction has risen from 63% in March to 73% in October.How ‘screw Trump’ messaging may help California’s Proposition 50 prevailRead moreHispanic adults also expressed less confidence in Trump’s management of the economy and immigration, two key issues that once bolstered his support during last year’s campaign. Overall approval of his job performance has also fallen, with 41% approving of Trump’s handling of the presidency in March, compared with just 27% this month.Hispanic voters played acrucial rolein helping Trump win the presidency for the second time;nearly halfof Hispanic voters backed him in 2024. His support among Hispanic voters was 12 points higher than in 2020 (48% in 2024, 36% in 2020). On the other hand, voting for the Democratic candidate fell from 61% to 51%.Now the president’s decline in popularity comes as the Trump administration continues its hardline immigration enforcement, which has directly affected Latino communities across income levels.Only about one-quarter of Hispanic adults are in favor of deporting all immigrants living in the US illegally, while roughly half of them are opposed to the policy and the rest say they don’t have an opinion, according to the poll.Economists see immigration and economic concernsas intertwined, with both low-wage and high-skilled Latino workers feeling the impact of trade uncertainty and strict immigration measures. Studies have shown immigrants actuallyhelp improvelocal economies by boosting consumer spending and filling labor shortages.The poll also highlights rising financial strain within Hispanic households. Respondents reported higher levels of stress about groceries, housing, healthcare and wages than the general US population.Among younger Hispanics and men in the community, negative perceptions of Trump have grown. Roughly two-thirds of Hispanic adults under 45 and Hispanic men now view the president unfavorably, up from about half in September 2024.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The poll shows that about 65% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of the president, a notable drop from a September 2024 poll by AP-NORC that showed 83% viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably.The research found that, in general, immigration remains a top personal concern for Hispanic adults. About two-thirds said the issue is important to them, compared with around six in 10 white adults and half of Black adults.The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted on 9-13 October.

On Friday, we will be missing our first full paycheck,” Johnny Jones, council secretary treasurer for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) TSA Council 100, and a TSA employee in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, said.“Now people are really starting to get nervous. They’re starting to make preparations for liquidations or they’re making preparations in their lives of how we’re going to survive.”Fears of heat-rationing for millions in US as shutdown delays energy aidRead moreHe cited cases of members crying and starting to get desperate, citing the previous shutdown in 2019 where he and other co-workers had to help a co-worker transport her children to Colorado to be with family because she could no longer afford childcare.“I just can’t believe we’re not going to get paid,” Jones added. “ It’s unbelievable. If you worked at McDonald’s and they did this, they could sue you, shut your business down, but you’re working for the government, they cannot pay you, and it’s OK. And this is a problem. People are now going to have to take home debt. People are going to have to take on new things, maybe even work their full shift, pick up their kids and do GrubHub or something, looking for other means of income on the side.”Meanwhile in Washington, the deadlock continues.“I don’t have a strategy,” Mike Johnson, the US House speaker,toldreporters on 21 October, as the House of Representatives’ calendar for October remainsempty. House members have been onpaid vacationsince 19 September, when it went onrecess.The House speaker’s office said in a statement: “He has consistently said that the House will return to regular legislative session as soon as Chuck Schumer and the Democrats vote to end the shutdown and reopen the government.”Democrats haveheld firmon a budget that includes extending healthcare subsidies that would prevent health insurance premiums from soaring for millions of Americans, resulting in loss of health insurance for about15 million Americansdue to the subsidy expirations and cuts to Medicaid.Throughout and leading up to the shutdown, federal workers have been subjected to threats by the Trump administration, which have includedthreateningto withhold back pay to furloughed workers, conducting reductions in force (though a federal court has temporarilyblockedthe firings), and cutting federally funded infrastructure programs with threats to go after programs deemed priorities for Democrats.Trumpreferredto Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director, as “Darth Vader” on 21 October.“They call him Darth Vader, I call him a fine man. He’s cutting Democrat priorities, and they’re never going to get them back,” Trump said, in claiming the shutdown allows the administration to enact cuts to federal services and programs.“It’s played hell with our psyche, for sure,” said Ruark Hotopp, District 8 national vice-president of the AFGE in the midwest and an employee at the US Citizenship and Immigration Service, on the consistent attacks on federal workers since January 2025, from “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cuts, to rhetoric from Vought and other Trump administration officials criticizing federal civilian employees.Hotopp explained he was in Washington DC lobbying various members of Congress around these issues last week, and the threats were laughed off by Republican Senate staff.“This was a Republican senator’s office, and they reassured me that, while we understand what the president’s saying, that we don’t agree with the president’s position, and it is the full intention of the United States Congress to make sure these those folks get paid. So while that’s reassuring to me, to see this sort of public rhetoric to the folks on the frontlines, that’s not reassuring at all,” he said.“The president is one of the very first people to say this rhetoric needs to be toned down, while he then fans the flames,” added Hotopp. “If we’re going to get back to some sort of normalcy, it has to start with the president himself.”Nicole Cantello, president of the AFGE Union Local 704 and an attorney at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explained the rollout of furloughs had been “chaotic” for federal employees at the agency, with the EPA using leftover funds to stave off furloughs in the beginning of the shutdown, only formass furloughsto be issued earlier this week.“I’m located here in the Great Lakes, and we are the ones that do all the work to try to protect the Great Lakes. Drinking water for over 40 million people come from the Great Lakes. The people that check the health of the lake to those who find cases against polluters, all those inspectors, they were all just furloughed,” Cantello said. “The human health and environment will definitely be impacted. More pollution will go out.”A surge of visitors to Yosemite overwhelms a skeleton crew: ‘This is exactly what we warned about’Read moreShe expressed concern for the prolonged shutdown and its impact on attrition. Since January 2025, the EPA said its workforce had beenslashedfrom 16,155 employees to 12,448 employees through firings, retirements and buyouts. The Trump administration had attempted to cut dozens more workers at the agency through a reduction in force during the shutdown.“Given everything that’s happened here, who knows who will come back from the furlough?” Cantello said. “I don’t have a good handle on that, but I’m worried that we’re losing and more people and the agency will be rendered even more ineffective.”A spokesperson for the EPA would not comment on or provide numbers on how many workers were furloughed at the agency, but said: “Congressional Democrats are not only unwilling to vote for a clean funding bill, but their goal is to inflict as much pain on the American people as possible. The false narratives being peddled by union bosses and their Democratic allies are nothing more than deliberate fear-mongering designed to create chaos and deceive hardworking Americans.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US unionsUS politicsDonald TrumpUS federal government shutdownsEconomicsUS work & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The segment drew backlash from pro-Israel organizations and unnerved Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, a strong supporter of Israel.“She didn’t like the story,” Owens told an audience at Colby College in Maine on Friday evening, where heaccepted an awardgiven for courage in journalism.Afterwards, Owens says, he was basically told: “Well, you’re not going to do another Gaza story, are you?” While Redstone didn’t call him directly, “that message was relayed to me by people with authority over me”, he said.Sopranos creator David Chase to write HBO limited series on CIA drug programRead moreThe show continued covering the story. “When I said we were going to do another Gaza piece, that was like hitting a hornet’s nest,” he told the crowd. “This idea that we were doing stories that [lacked] balance, on the face of it – it’s just wrong.”Owens also said he was encouraged to tamp down coverage of Donald Trump. “The Trump stuff they were very concerned about,” he said. “I remember at one point I got a phone call from someone that was trying to be an intermediary saying: ‘Do you need to mention Trump’s name that often?’”Owens said he was unmoved by the entreaties. When he faced pressure to apologize for the way 60 Minutes edited an interview with then vice-president Kamala Harris after conservative backlash and a $10bn lawsuit from Trump, he made it clear he wouldn’t.“I said, I’m not apologizing for anything. We haven’t done anything wrong,” he recalled. “We haven’t done anything wrong. 60 Minutes isn’t perfect. 60 Minutes has made mistakes in the past, and we have always owned those mistakes.”Ultimately, Owens said, he decided that he couldn’t stay in his job any more, and called it quits in April.“The only thing I could do was professionally blow myself up to create a blast radius around 60 Minutes to get people’s attention that this was happening,” he said.Owens emphasized that he believed these were attempts at corporate censorship, particularly as Paramount sought the approval of Trump’s hand-picked Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, to approve the company’s merger with Skydance Media. He got the impression, he said, that he would be blamed if his actions – and unwillingness to apologize – jeopardized the merger and damaged the network.Internally, Owens discouraged 60 Minutes staffers from resigning out of protest over his departure, which came months afterthe selection of Susan Zirinskyto oversee standards at the network.“There was a whole bunch of people who were like, ‘We’re going with you,’ and I’m like: ‘Nope, you sit down,’” he said.Like CBS News executive Wendy McMahon,who resigned in protest in May, Owens opposed the corporation’s intention to settle the lawsuit. The company did so anyway in July, though it did not apologize to Trump. While Redstone had formally recused herself from the settlement negotiations, she had earlier indicated to Paramount’s board that she supported one.During Friday’s event, Owens was interviewed by Amna Nawaz, who co-anchors the PBS NewsHour. She asked him whether he thought he had accomplished his goal of calling attention to his concerns atCBSand stemming the tide.“I wonder if any part of you wishes that you’d stayed,” she said.Owens had worked at CBS News since 1988, becoming executive producer of the Sunday newsmagazine show in 2019. While he said he doesn’t know Bari Weiss, who was recently named editor in chief of CBS News, he noted that she doesn’t have a reporting background – and encouraged her to protect 60 Minutes.“She was an opinion writer. Obviously a very smart woman, but she hasn’t gone and covered news stories like she’s going to be asking everybody else to,” Owens said. “I sure hope that she recognizes that the best group of television journalists are working at the most successful television show in American history … I just hope that she recognizes that that’s something that should be protected.”While he didn’t have any details to share, Owens told the crowd that he planned to re-enter the news business and had had conversations with potential journalism funders.“I will definitely get back in the game,” he said, hinting also that he might “write something”.The award given to Owens honors anti-slavery publisher Elijah Lovejoy, who was killed by a mob in 1837. Owens, who said he didn’t think he was worthy of the award, told the crowd that his greatest fears for the country were “apathy” and “cowardice”.“I do think more people need to stand up,” he said. “You either do the right thing and accept the consequences, or you don’t, and then you live with the consequences.”A spokesperson for Paramount declined comment on Owens’ remarks.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

One choir boy might be too many in the case of Russell Wilson, the NFL’s would-be Mr Congeniality. From the off theNew York Giantsquarterback has gone to lengths to distinguish himself as the game’s most likable star, the kind of player kids look up to and opponents look out for. And all it seems to do is breed resentment.NFL hands down $315k in fines over Giants’ concussion protocol violationsRead moreWilson’s closest collaborators struggle to speak his name without spitting. Richard Sherman, the standout former defensive back turned TV analyst, begrudges Wilson for the favoritism he received from management during their years together at the Seattle Seahawks. KJ Wright, another prominent member of that Legion of Boom defense, accuses Wilson of betraying locker room bonds. Marshawn Lynch, the delightful butfamously reticentSeahawks running back who lined up behind Wilson for 56 games, recalls having to ask someone in the team’s front office for the QB’s contact info – and Wilson calling him back from a blocked number. “Russ was just a quarterback for me,” Lynchsaid. Just the quarterback who led the Seahawks to their first ever Super Bowl title.Sean Payton can barely hide his disdain for Wilson. After Denver’shistoric 33-32 comeback winover New York last week, the Broncos coach beamed about the “little spark” the Giants had found with Jaxson Dart, the rookie who became the team’s starting quarterback after Wilson went 0-3. Payton also hinted that he told Giants owner John Mara that he would have rather faced Wilson. “We were hoping that change would’ve happened long after our game,” Payton told reporters.That Payton said this as the coach who inherited Wilson – after Denver traded for him in 2022 and handed the quarterback a five-year, $245m deal that’s still eating into the salary cap – raised eyebrows, including Wilson’s. In a social media response two days later, he called Payton “classless” and accused him of using the media for “bounty hunting” – a clear reference to thepay-for-peltsscandal that darkened his otherwise successful coaching tenure with the New Orleans Saints. And though Payton would later say his comments about Dart were not intended as a veiled shot at Wilson, it’s still somewhat surprising that the QB would even take such offense.View image in fullscreenRussell Wilson lifts the Lombardi trophy after leading the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl title in February 2014.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty ImagesWilson has always had a knack for existing inside his own bubble. During his decade-long run in Seattle, he regularly struck the tone of a politician on the campaign trail – leading with charm, killing with kindness, leaving a trail of platitudes in his wake and sometimesin the huddle too. Especially annoying was Wilson’s habit of closing interviews with the tagline “Go Hawks,” which became “Let’s Ride” after he was traded to the Broncos; after signing with Pittsburgh last year, Wilson changed the tagline to “Here We Go,” the first words of the team’s fight song – and then: “Win the Seventh,” a reference to the Steelers’ quest for a seventh Lombardi trophy. But he honestly can’t help himself.Overall, Wilson labors to say anything without sounding AI-powered. “The greater you’re great, the more they’re gone hate,” he said after a vintage outing against Dallas in Week 2. Even Wilson’s attempt to pivot from this robotic perception with a social media alter-ego calledMr Unlimited(not to be confused with his on-field persona, DangeRuss) was roundly jeered as painfully desperate and uncool. Corny is another word that’s used to describe Wilson. It comes up most often when Wilson is viewed through the prism of Black American culture – as Wilson’s aw-shucks airs, positive vibes and noticeable lack of visible tattoos veer from the stereotypical Black athlete who’s always getting into trouble on and off the field.Critics and commenters in the Black manosphere further perpetuate the stereotype when they tease Wilson for putting the R&B star Ciara througha premarital puritytest after she had previously been linked to the rapper Future,a committed bachelorwho has dissed Wilsonon several records. The manosphere practically melted down after learning Ciara had added Wilson’s name to the son she shares with Future, even though Wilson had not legally adopted the boy. “He’s the most amazing human being you could know,” Ciara saidthis summerin defense of her husband. “The smartest, most intelligentBlackman I have ever known. What you see with him is really who he is.”The irony of Wilson’s carefully crafted image is that he probably never would have had much of anNFLcareer without it, let alone hung around long enough to become one of the league’s least-liked personalities. The longer years wear on, the easier it is to forget the odds stacked against Wilson: a short, Black quarterback who had cycled through two colleges back when that wasn’t a good look. The Seahawks took a flier on Wilson in the third round of a 2012 NFL draft headlined by Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, selecting him ahead of Nick Foles and Kirk Cousins – the only other QBs in the bunch who overdelivered.Wilson wasn’t supposed to see playing time, given that the Seahawks had signed Green Bay super-sub Matt Flynn to one of the more significant quarterback deals in the NFL at the time. Had Wilson been drafted even 20 years earlier, he almost certainly would have beenconverted into a defensive backor, failing that, chased a long career in professional baseball. (Wilson was drafted by three different MLB teams after high school and played second base in the Colorado Rockies organization for 93 games.) When Wilson defied forecasts and beat out Flynn for Seattle’s starting job, it triggered an avalanche of reports about the rookie QB’s outsized ability, strict work ethic and deep religious faith.View image in fullscreenRussell Wilson and Ciara attend the 2025 Met Gala.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/VogueThere was nothing corny about Wilson going on to lead the Seahawks to aSuper Bowl drubbing of the Broncos in 2014. He became something for championship contenders to aspire to: a breakout QB star on his rookie contract who’d leave plenty of cap space to address other needs on the field. But that high point may also have marked the beginning of Wilson’s popularity slide. The Seahawks looked like a dynasty in the making when they reached the Super Bowl again the next year. But then Wilson threw a goal-line interceptionto snatch defeat from the jaws of victoryin Seattle’s 2015 Super Bowl clash against Tom Brady’s New England Patriots and doomed the Seahawks to one-hit wonder status.Many former Seattle players still hold a grudge against Seahawks coach Pete Carroll for calling the pass play instead of handing off to Lynch, the game’s leading rusher. It wasn’t much longer there after that you began hearing whispers about Wilson’s hewing closer to management than his own teammates, who were moved on to other teams until Wilson himself became expendable. Upon taking the Broncos job in 2023, Payton evicted Wilson from the office he scored among the team’s coaches and executives – proof of the extreme privilege he enjoyed on the team, some say. It’s also been said that Wilson tried to get his superiors fired in Seattle and Denver, a move another QB in his position might try if he had that kind of juice. (Wilson denied the power-grab claims ultimately.)It was also reported that Wilson had once engaged in a four-hour workout on the way to a London gamein the aisle of the Broncos’ team plane, rankling teammates and deepening the public intrigue around his quirks. (Wilson said the story was “overblown”.) The last straw for fans, though, was Wilson cashing in on one lucrative deal after another while his play declined and the team consequently lacked money to fix the roster – a far cry from the bargain value that once made him a franchise cornerstone. His approval rating doesn’t seem as if it will recover until he retires.That said: it is worth noting that Wilson does havesomesupporters, apart from his wife. Former Broncos guard Dalton Risner calls Wilson one of his favorite teammates. (“You wanna know why he had an office? Because Russell Wilson wasgrinding,” hesaid.) Doug Baldwin, Wilson’s top receiver in Seattle, says that their once-close relationship was changed by success and fame, but he wished his ex-teammate well in the end. Justin Fields, Wilson’s main competition for the starting job in Pittsburgh, remembers him being a great teammate and friend who served as a prime example for how to go about the job in the right way. It’s a reminder of how opinions can vary from person to person when an NFL team fields more than 50 players.In a league built on relationships and perception, it means something for the hate toward Wilson to be largely circumstantial. It proves that choir boys don’t stand a chance on the gridiron as long as Wilson is out here reveling in the strait-laced football life, no matter what they do.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Almost instantly Anthony Taylor blew for time and “Glory, Glory Man United” blared out at Old Trafford.So Brighton, winners of three of the last four meetings, motor back to the south coast defeated and Amorim’s team are starting to build some momentum. They are fourth overnight, thanks toLiverpool losing at Brentford.Manchester United 4-2 Brighton: Premier League – live reactionRead moreThe Portuguese was not happy at the late near-capitulation but can be content with how his tactic of having Luke Shaw move up from left centre-back to harry Georginio Rutter led to Mbuemo’s first strike having already played a part in Casemiro’s goal. Shaw certainly looked to have fouled the No 10 in the build-up but, with the video assistant referee uninterested, Mbeumo raced on to a cute Benjamin Sesko pass to fire a 20-yard finish which went through Lewis Dunk’s legs and beat Bart Verbruggen to the goalkeeper’s left.Cut to the head coach’s celebration and verses of “Ruben Amorim, Ruben Amorim” from the ecstatic home fans, who heralded at the close a third consecutivePremier Leaguewin in the same season for a first time since February 2024.View image in fullscreenDanny Welbeck (left) watches his free-kick clear the Manchester United wall for Brighton’s first goal.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesBut this was confirmed only after Patrick Dorgu’s pulling down of Yankuba Minteh precipitated United conceding twice. First, Danny Welbeck blazed a free-kick beyond Senne Lammens, the United goalkeeper surely disappointed not to deal with it better as the ball went at him rather than for a corner. In added time James Milner’s corner from the right caught United slumbering and the unmarked Charalampos Kostoulas headed in.In all this were signs of the project in progress United still are, but it finished as a good day’s work that began with two penalty shouts being turned down by Taylor. An Amad Diallo jink past Maxim De Cuyper caused the left-back to clip him but the referee was unmoved – to home ire. Further fury followed when Dunk seemed to grab Mbeumo in the area.Amorim spoke of attitude being key and his men kept on and got their reward. The ball dropped to Bruno Fernandes, whose instant no-look pass to Casemiro was a moment to grace a 300th United appearance. The Brazilian tapped the ball left to his compatriot Matheus Cunha and a touch to tee it up was followed by a superb curling finish that skimmed past Verbruggen’s fingertips into the bottom left corner.This was the £62.5m summer signing’s first goal, in his 10th appearance. If “about time” is a fair call on the strike’s arrival, United’s delight soon doubled as Amorim’s deployment of Shaw as a pickpocket hit the first jackpot.View image in fullscreenAmad Diallo hitches a ride on Casemiro after the latter scored Manchester United’s second goal.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAA Jan Paul van Hecke pass aimed for Rutter was nicked from him by Shaw.

Slick interplay involving Fernandes put Sesko in but he sliced wildly off target from only yards out.Brentford v Liverpool: Premier League – live updatesRead moreRutter did the same at the other end, though he may have been hurt moments before, impeding his movement. There was, though, zero excuse for the amateurish effort Carlos Baleba ballooned over as the second half began – hardly a prime advert for a player wanted by United in the previous window.Seconds later, Fernandes showed Baleba how it should be done. Cunha found Diallo deep in Brighton’s area, he picked his captain out, and Fernandes’s pile-driver stung Verbruggen’s palms. The Brighton keeper made another routine save from Sesko while Lammens had to be far more alert when a curving Minteh cross missed everyone and was sneaking into the right corner before the keeper tipped it out.So United’s only home outing in a period of 50 days, with no fixtures at Old Trafford until 24 November, ended in victory: a fine way to sign off.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Kramnik closed by asserting that he was “in good physical and mental condition” and “under no circumstances” planned to take his own life.The death of Naroditsky may have been the result of a drug overdose and is being investigated as a possible suicide, according to a police report released Thursday. A report from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department says Naroditsky was found dead Sunday evening and describes the case as a “Death/suicide/overdose/Sudden/Natural Death Investigation”.“On Sunday October 19th at approximately 07:11pm officers responded to an assist medic call in the area of 9000 Colin Crossing,” the report says. “Upon arrival an unresponsive subject was located and later pronounced deceased by a medic.”Naroditsky was discovered at his home by close friends, grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk and CharlotteChessCenter founder Peter Giannatos. The pair had gone to check on him after he stopped responding to calls and messages.“I found him dead in his house,” Bortnyk said in a stream this week. “We came to check because he wasn’t answering, and we found him dead on the couch.”Naroditsky, one of the most popular streamers and commentators in the chess world, wasfound dead last weekendin Charlotte, North Carolina, where he served as head coach and grandmaster-in-residence at the Charlotte Chess Center. Police have not disclosed a cause of death.A Stanford-educated prodigy and former world youth champion, Naroditsky amassed over 800,000 followers on Twitch and YouTube. Known as Danya, he was celebrated for his humor, clarity and humility, becoming a leading voice in chess’s pandemic-era boom. He was also one of the world’s finest players under shorter time controls, finishing ninth at last year’s blitz world championship in New York.Naroditskyconsistently denied the allegationsbut acknowledged the toll they had taken on his mental health. “Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst,” Naroditsky said in his final livestream.View image in fullscreenDaniel Naroditsky amassed over 800,000 followers on Twitch and YouTube.Photograph: Lennart Ootes/Saint Louis Chess ClubAnger over Kramnik’s conduct has dominated the chess world. Hikaru Nakamura called his behavior “disgusting”, while five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen described it as “horrible”. Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin, who played Naroditsky in his final online match, accused Kramnik of “taking a life,” saying his vigilante campaign against suspected cheaters was ineffective and “completely unacceptable”.Kramnik, whodethroned Garry Kasparov in 2000and held the world title for nearly seven years, has made similar cheating accusations against other players. In 2023 Chess.com banned him from posting, citing “baseless and damaging” claims.The International Chess Federation (Fide) said this weekit was “looking into” Kramnik’s behavior. “The way Kramnik approaches it simply can’t be accepted,” Fide chief executive Emil Sutovskytold Reuters. The federation plans to honor Naroditsky with a memorial award.Fide president Arkady Dvorkovich later confirmed that all of Kramnik’s public statements about Naroditsky, before and after his death, would be referred to the organisation’s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission “for independent consideration”.“Human life and dignity are fundamental values shared by all of us,” Dvorkovichsaid in a statement. “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, but such stature brings a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect.”Sutovsky, meanwhile, faced his own backlash afterposting a message on Xthat critics saw as blaming the community for not helping Naroditsky while he was alive. The remarks drew heavy backlash from prominent chess streamers like Anna Cramling and Nemo Zhou, whocalled the comments“disgusting” and urged him to resign.Naroditsky’s family have said they hope he is remembered not for the hostility he endured but for “the joy and inspiration he brought people every day”. Carlsen called him “a resource to the chess community”, while Nakamura described him as “the best of us”.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

The Briton left his title rivals in his wake and in so doing earned a chance to make a major impact on the championship standings and potentially retake the lead.Enjoying a huge boost to his world championship ambitions, Norris delivered perhaps his best lap of the season in qualifying, to beat the Ferraris ofCharles Leclercand Lewis Hamilton into second and third. Of greater import was that his fellow title protagonists Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri, Norris’s McLaren teammate, could manage only fifth and eighth fastest respectively.Lando Norris takes Mexico Grand Prix pole: Formula One qualifying – live updatesRead moreThe pole was a real statement of intent from Norris andMcLarenand exactly the riposte they required after the recent momentum Verstappen has gathered as he closed the gap to the leaders. Having been 104 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August, the defending champion has won three of the last four meetings and is now just 40 points off the Australian and 14 points behind Norris.It has been an extraordinary turnaround forRed Bulland their driver, and after which Norris badly needed to reassert some authority, having not taken pole since the Belgian GP. To finally do so and start the race from the front foot was a major step in steadying the ship. If he wins and Piastri finishes below second, the British driver will hold the lead of the championship for the first time since the fifth round of the season in Saudi Arabia.Norris acknowledged that it had been a significant moment he hoped to exploit. “I’m happy to be back on pole, it’s been a long time,” he said. “It’s one of those laps where you don’t know what happened, it felt decent but when I saw it was a [one minute] 15.5, I was surprised.“I’m here to win. I’ll be looking forward, I have some quick guys behind me. I’m not expecting it to be easy.”He exhibited a cool command in qualifying that was indicative of how the McLaren remains an enormously strong car and indeed how comfortable and confident Norris can be when he has it hooked up. This stood in stark contrast to his teammate, however.Piastri struggled, off the pace of the frontrunners and unable to challenge for the top spot. It was a similar lack of competitiveness to that he experienced at the last round in Austin as the Australian’s pace over the single lap he demonstrated earlier in the season appears to be sorely lacking. He has not qualified better than third since the Dutch GP, which has been crucial in the way his title lead has been whittled away. He will start from seventh owing to a grid penalty for Williams’s Carlos Sainz.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri looks rueful after a tough qualification.Photograph: Peter Fox/Getty ImagesThird place was also a significant moment for Hamilton, his first top three qualifying place of the season and he enjoyed the moment after a difficult start to his new career withFerrari. “I’m really happy, I’m honoured to be up here with Charles and Lando, these guys have been so quick all year,” Hamilton said. “It’s obviously hard to beat these guys but P3 is the perfect spot at this track, so I’m hoping to make the most of that.”McLaren, who have not been on pole here since Gerhard Berger took the top spot in 1990, will also be confident there is more to come, for Norris at least. Their car has looked very strong in race-pace simulations in Mexico, with Norris putting in some very strong runs. The long drag to turn one of 830m may prove crucial as the leaders jockey for a slipstream, and emerging in clean air in front from the first corner could be key, but on this form keeping the leading McLaren behind in any circumstances is likely to be a mighty task.Quick GuideF1 Mexico City GP qualifying timesShow1Lando Norris(GB) McLaren1min 15.586sec2Charles Leclerc(Mon) Ferrari1:15.8483Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari1:15.9384George Russell(GB) Mercedes1:16.0345Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull1:16.0706Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes1:16.118*7Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams1:16.1728Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren1:16.1749Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls1:16.25210Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas F11:16.460Eliminated in Q211Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull1:16.81612Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas F11:16.83713Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber1:17.01614Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin1:17.10315Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls1:18.072Eliminated in Q116Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber1:17.41217Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams1:17.49018Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine1:17.54619Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin1:17.60620Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine1:17.670*Relegated to 12thon the grid by a penaltyfrom the US Grand PrixWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Norris had been comfortably on top heading into the first runs in Q3 when Verstappen opened with a strong first lap with a time of 1min 16.455sec.

In a pulsating contest at the O2Arena, Wardley showed he has one of the toughest chins in the sport as he swallowed several huge punches from Parker before forcing the referee, Howard Foster, to stop the bout in an explosive 11th round.The WBO had ordered the experienced Parker to face Usyk, the undisputed world heavyweight champion, in July, but the New Zealander put his mandatory challenger status on the line against Wardley, who was still involved in white-collar boxing when his opponent was world champion in 2016.‘My Netflix title would be white collar to world champion’: Fabio Wardley on his boxing journey | Donald McRaeRead moreParker promised to be a “different level” to the 30-year-old and that appeared the case for much of the bout in London. Wardley seemed to have missed out on the chance to stop the bout in a back-and-forth second round and again in the 10th, which appeared a sliding doors moments for the Ipswich right-hander.Yet, after Parker could not get his rival out, Wardley roared back with a huge right to wobble the New Zealander in the 11th and a flurry of further punches forced a dramatic stoppage to continue his fairytale story in the sport.View image in fullscreenFabio Wardley knocks back Joseph Parker, watched intently by the referee, who in time stopped the fight.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesWardley, whose shorts bore the letters ITFC for Ipswich Town Football Club, produced a sensational 10th-round knockout to defeat Justin Huni on home soil at Portman Road in June – despite being behind on the judges’ scorecard – and four months later he had the golden carrot of Usyk in front of him. The Ukrainian was not in London, but ringside was a who’s who of the blue-riband division, with Tyson Fury, Daniel Dubois and Moses Itauma all in attendance and a December fight between the veterans Derek Chisora and Dillian Whyte announced before the main event.Wardley finally walked out to meet Parker, who got a fist bump from Fury ahead of his ring walk, before the bout got under way at 10.58pm.Parker, a 39-fight veteran, caught the British boxer on several occasion in a one-sided first round. A small amount of blood was visible from Wardley’s noise, but he fought fire with fire in a sensational round two. The Ipswich fighter initially targeted the body of his opponent before a huge right hand wobbled Parker, an uppercut followed but a loose gumshield forced referee Foster to step in.Wardley had scented blood and yet Parker survived before an even third round was followed by an explosive finish to the fourth. Parker caught Wardley, but the British heavyweight responded with a flurry of successful punches on the ropes to get the crowd on their feet.After a thrilling start, the volume of trade-offs reduced as Parker started to take control of the middle rounds and Wardley swallowed an enormous right towards the end of a tricky seventh round. The eighth followed a similar theme before Wardley looked in trouble at the end of round nine only to roll out and survive.Parker was again in control at the start of the 10th, but Wardley flipped the script to get his rival on the ropes. The referee did not step in on this occasion and, even though Wardley appeared to have emptied the tank, he went to the well at the start of round 11.Another huge right wobbled Parker and this time Wardley would not be denied as a flurry of punches followed which forced Foster to step in. Wardley collapsed on the floor after a herculean effort as he added another incredible chapter to his unique story after he sep up a shot at undisputed world heavyweight champion Usyk in 2026.View image in fullscreenFabio Wardley lies on the canvas and celebrates victory with his trainer.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesChisora and Whyte will headline at Co-Op Live in Manchester on 13 December. The pair were asked about a potential third meeting after Whyte (31-4, 21KOs) won the first two bouts and although Chisora(36-13, 23KOs), 41, initially kept his cards close to his chest, he insisted the 50th fight of his career will “100%” happen.“Yeah, if the contract is right. If the contract is right, but right now it’s not,” Chisora claimed, after he was greeted with big cheers. “Listen, I want the fight but the paperwork has to be right. You know what I’m talking about [Frank Warren]. The paperwork has to be right. The fight will be amazing. The fight will happen in December with Dillian, 100% and it will be an explosive fight.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The expansion club has earned the Western Conference’s No 1 seed and set records for most victories (19) and points (63) in a single season by an MLS expansion team. As a result, they will be at home for the remainder of the playoffs, and would host MLS Cup if they make it there and meet anyone other than Inter Miami, Cincinnati, or the Supporters’ Shield-winning Philadelphia Union.Now, they’re aiming for more history – to become the first expansion side to winMLSCup since 1998 when the Chicago Fire achieved it against DC United.“For me, this was always the objective,” Hirving “Chucky” Lozano told the Guardian. The 30-year-old Mexico international arrived in San Diego as the club’s first designated playerafter a great career with PSV and Napoli. He’s also been in the headlines this week, having been separated from the team for their trip to Portland on Decision Day – a decision that head coach Mikey Varas chalked up to an internal issue.Lozano later apologized on social media, hinting at a concept Varas had brought up when interviewed by the Guardian before the suspension was reported.“We believe that our collectivity is our superpower,” Varas said. “We say a lot to ourselves that we’re here to win, buthowwe win and who we winwithmatters. And that’s how we feel, really, at the deepest part of our DNA. [We’re] a team that’s relentless, that won’t give up and doesn’t stop playing the way that they want to play. And then a team that has a fighting team spirit, you know, one that, is always connected.”For San Diego, winning is not just a result at the end of 90 minutes, it’s a personality trait that comes with daily lessons. To do that, you need not just stars like Lozano but also great players that don’t earn as many headlines; like veteran Panamanian anchor Aníbal Godoy, San Diego native and USMNT’s Luca de la Torre (on loan from Celta Vigo) and Anders Dreyer, the 27-year-old Dane who came to the club from Anderlecht who has lit up his first MLS campaign. In his first season, Dreyer earned 38 goal contributions (19g/19a), thus becoming the player with more goals (17) and goal contributions (27) on the road in the history of the league. On Thursday, he was named a finalist for the MLS MVP award.The roster as a whole, though, has been formed under San Diego’s careful philosophy, which has its foundations in analytics and homegrown talent. Through data and other means, the pivotal strategy is not just to find the right players, but to build them.MLS playoff picks: Will Messi, Son or a dark horse make a run to the title?Read more“Our academy will be the heartbeat of this club, and homegrowns, ideally, will be the heartbeat of this club,” says Tyler Heaps, the club’s general manager and sporting director. At 34, he is the youngest in the league to serve this position. “It’ll hopefully make my job a whole lot easier, in the future, because we should have this talent and development opportunity for these players, and then we will give them an opportunity in the first team.”Heaps points to examples of young players who are already getting significant minutes with San Diego, like first-round draft picks Manu Duah and Ian Pilcher and 19-year-old left-back Luca Bombino, who came on loan from LAFC and has had a great campaign.“Our style of play is also catered to set up for young players,” says Heaps. “It’s catered to some of the things that we do with our defensive shape, some of the things that we do in our training environment, to make sure that those decisions are a lot cleaner and a lot easier for our players to understand, so that they can go play on instincts and everything else that they’re taught to do from a young age.”View image in fullscreenMikey Varas has won praise for his work with San Diego.Photograph: Soobum Im/Getty ImagesEducation at San Diego FC – on and off the pitch – is spearheaded by their centerpiece vision: the Right to Dream football academy. Founded in Ghana in 1999 by Tom Vernon, the academy has produced more than 100 professional players including Tottenham Hotspur and Ghana’s Mohammed Kudus and Ivorian Simon Adingra, who joined Sunderland this past summer from Brighton. The academy plays vital roles in regions such as Denmark with FC Nordsjælland and FC Masar in Egypt and it has been the driving foundation behind San Diego FC. Last month, the club’s state-of-the art academy complex, where the first team also trains, opened in a 28-acre site on Sycuan tribal land in El Cajon, about 16 miles east of San Diego. It is the league’s first ever integrated school and academy beginning at middle school age for boys and girls where each residential student-athlete receives a five-year scholarship regardless of performance. That’s a first for MLS and North America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Does anyone care?Read moreHeaps was recruited and appointed by Mohamed Mansour, San Diego’s founding partner and chair who also owns Right to Dream through his UK-based family office Man Capital. Heaps had been working for Monaco from 2021 to 2023 before joining Right to Dream as head of recruitment and insights.“[Our vision] is about character development, holistic development, player development, staff development. It’s why I’m here,” Heaps says.The players at the academy, for the most part, come from San Diego and Tijuana, a mecca for young Mexican talent. In San Diego, where more than 30% of the population are Hispanic/Latino and the majority being Mexican-American, the strategy to recruit across borders is vital from both a footballing and cultural one.“[The American/Mexican recruitment] is critical for our player development but also for our club because it identifies with the essence of this entire region, which is this unique and deep cross-border connectivity,” says Tom Penn, San Diego FC’s CEO, who also co-founded LAFC back in 2014 and served as president. “[San Diego] is this truly unique culture that is truly southern California but it’s distinct from Los Angeles…there’s a unique rhythm and quality of life here. And everybody is grateful for that, they embrace the diversity of the cultures here and then there’s just real civic pride and a sports team can bring together that whole community around that pride.”Varas, who has a personal connection to San Diego as he met his wife Jessica here, agrees.“I just know San Diego really well. I know how creative it is, how diverse it is, but also how hardworking and competitive it is. They love their region, they love their community, and whether you were born and raised here, or you were a transplant like myself and you found your way here, you fall in love with this place, and then you make huge sacrifices to stay here.”For Lozano, who was born in Mexico City and moved to Pachuca when he was 11, the border culture is not something he grew up with. But he feels right at home in San Diego and also sees the massive benefits from being part of a club that strongly represents two very close cultures. “I think [the area] is so important because it can attract many players because there is so much talent, both in the US and Mexico, so to apply that combination is going to be beautiful and attractive.”But as far as he’s concerned, the recipe for success needs an outcome. First, it was the regular season. Now comes the second target: to win MLS Cup.“I think – and I have faith – that we can do it. We’re on the right path,” Lozano said. “I always thought we could achieve important things from the beginning. I came here [to this club] because of the project and everything that surrounds it, from the ownership and everything else, it’s wonderful and all of that attracted me to come to San Diego and that’s why I chose to come here.”Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content that also appeals to the US Latino and young audience.

The anxious period of stoppage time the home side endured was out of keeping with everything that had gone before.Brentford tend naturally to a direct approach anyway, but Arne Slot’s grumbling last week about Manchester United’s long balls was an open invitation. Liverpool never got to grips with the pace of Kevin Schade running in behind their back four, and they looked uncomfortable as well against Michael Kayode’s fusillade of long throws. Every side now knows that Liverpool are vulnerable to balls played in behind their full-backs. The opening goal, scored after five minutes, stemmed from a Kayode throw, but that was the result of Giorgi Mamardashvili mopping up as Schade chased behind Conor Bradley. It was already the second time he had done so.Arne Slot admits Liverpool’s Brentford defeat among his worst as losing run goes onRead moreSome long throw specialists rely on power, the body contorted to become a grunting trebuchet, but just as the fastest bowlers or the golfers who drive the ball furthest tend to be the most graceful, so Kayode seems to generate his distance with rhythm. There is a lithe fluidity to his run-up and release, the trajectory oddly flat, more metal wood than seven iron. Some long throws are dangerous because they drop so slowly that it’s difficult for defenders to achieve distance with a clearing header, but not Kayode’s. His deliveries scud on a low parabola, a more accurate version of a cross from the same position. Kristoffer Ajer flicked on and Dango Ouattara smashed in a falling volley with Liverpool’s defence apparently mesmerised.It was Schade’s pace that brought the second on the stroke of half-time. Hugo Ekitiké lost possession and Mikkel Damsgaard, who would twice be denied by spectacular saves from Mamardashvili, opened Liverpool up with a typically incisive through-ball, Ibrahima Konaté effectively giving up the chase before Schade beat the keeper.Full-back has been a problem position for Liverpool this season, especially on the left where Milos Kerkez looks nothing like the thrusting player he did at Bournemouth last season. He wasted possession repeatedly, confidence fraying, as well as collecting a needless booking, but he did slam in a low Bradley cross deep in first-half stoppage time.Brentford’s players and fans protested about how long the half had been allowed to go on for – too long, it turned out, for the referee Simon Hooper who had to be replaced for the second period. But if their fear was that the goal had offered Liverpool a lifeline, it was misplaced. The home side continued to dominate and extended the lead when a foul given for Virgil van Dijk’s kick on Ouattara was deemed to have taken place inside the box. Igor Thiago converted the penalty.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade leaves Ibrahima Konaté in his wake to make it 2-0.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesSlot responded with a flurry of substitutions, most of them forwards.By the 70th minute, Liverpool were playing a sort of 4-1-5, with Florian Wirtz and Federico Chiesa as shuttling inside forwards. Chiesa has now played more league minutes this season than he did in the entirety of last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has not been as bad as some have made out but, equally, when a player arrives for £116m there is always going to be expectation, and when he is a forward who fails to score or register an assist in his first eight league games, that is transformed into pressure. Back in the middle for the first time in the league since the 1-0 win over Burnley in mid-September, he looked visibly tense and, when a chance fell his way midway through the first half, he snatched at it. But he is not the only one out of sorts.Mohamed Salah had barely been involved when he gathered Dominik Szoboszlai’s cross with a fine first touch and lashed a shot in off the underside of the bar with a minute remaining.Even that seemed to come from nothing, the result of a moment of Brentford carelessness rather than of concerted Liverpool pressure.There were understandable nerves as the line approached, but despite another extended period of stoppage time, and a corner given for Caoimhín Kelleher wasting time, Brentford finished as they had been throughout: by far the superior side.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It would have been about Enzo Maresca’s shortcomings against a low block, the creative deficit caused by Cole Palmer’s absence and the inconsistencies preventing the youngest team in thePremier Leaguefrom muscling their way into the title race.Victory would have lifted Chelsea two points off top spot before Arsenal host Crystal Palace on Sunday. Victory, though, was never within their grasp.Sunderland, again showing why they are such a fine addition to the Premier League, never allowed the world champions to assume control.Manchester United v Brighton: Premier League – live updatesRead moreThe day belonged to Régis Le Bris and his magnificent team, who finished the day in second thanks toLiverpool’s defeat at Brentford. Sunderland, who have made the best start to a season by a promoted side since 2008, were superb. This was their best result since coming up and nobody could argue that it was undeserved, even if it was not until the 93rd minute that the Sunderland substitute Chemsdine Talbi scored the decisive goal.Chelsea were stunned. They were in front after four minutes, Alejandro Garnacho scoring his first goal for the club, but this was a blunt performance.Chelseacreated few clear openings and were ruffled in defence. They were pegged back when Wilson Isidor scored from a long throw and were beaten when a Sunderland counterattack finished with Brian Brobbey, another substitute, laying the ball off for Talbi to guide a composed finish beyond Robert Sánchez from the edge of the area.Sunderland, who look sure to end the trend of all the promoted sides going down, were competitive from the start. They were energetic, organised at the back and aided by the flexibility of their 5-4-1 system. Chelsea, who have dropped eight points at home this season, never solved the tactical conundrum. They did not move the ball with enough intensity. Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo are two of the best midfielders in the league but they were matched by Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki. João Pedro, operating at No 10 while Chelsea wait for Palmer’s groin to heal, has not scored since August and was poor. Marc Guiu was ineffective on his first league start since joining from Barcelona last year.Dan Ballard and Lutsharel Geertruida shackled the 19-year-old forward, who was recalled from a brief loan spell at Sunderland after Chelsea lost Liam Delap to injury and loaned Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich at the end of the transfer window. The game was played on Sunderland’s terms. They had Chelsea lifting aimless crosses into the area long before half-time.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho of Chelsea scores the opening goal, his first for the club.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty Images“We were not good enough,” Maresca said. “We didn’t create a lot apart from the goal. We struggled. We need our players to perform 100%.” It had seemed that Sunderland were in for a long afternoon when Chelsea’s wingers combined in the fourth minute. Pedro Neto launched a counterattack and found Garnacho on the left. The former Manchester United winger drove at Nordi Mukiele before slamming a low shot through Robin Roefs.Sunderland stirred. Maresca, immune to the charms of English football’s new embrace of getting it launched, looked on in frustration as his defence failed to deal with a long throw from Mukiele in the 22nd minute. A mess ensued. It was 1-1 when Wilson Isidor, played onside by Josh Acheampong, turned in a shot by Bertrand Traoré.Isidor was a handful in attack for Sunderland. Chelsea drifted into sterile domination, Garnacho fading before making way for Estêvão Willian early in the second half. Guiu tired badly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Excluding own goals, only Manchester City have had more scored from a specific nation this term (Norway, Haaland, x 11).Photograph: Chris Foxwell/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sunderland’s commitment was ferocious. Reinildo Mandava, back from suspension, was exceptional at left wing-back and Le Bris freshened his team up with smart changes. He got the better of Maresca, whose decision to introduce the height of Tosin Adarabioyo after Brobbey came on did not work.The game was decided when Geertruida stepped forward and played a long ball to Brobbey. The striker held off Adarabioyo and Trevoh Chalobah, waited for support and found it from Talbi, who surged forward to make it 2-1.The challenge now for Sunderland will be keeping expectations realistic. Le Bris said the target is still to hit 40 points but his team are in the Champions League places.

Leah Williamson remains sidelined with an injury the captain picked up in Switzerland, while Lauren Hemp and Lauren James are also long-term absentees. Williamson’s club replacement at Arsenal, Katie Reid, and Manchester City’s Grace Clinton were forced to withdraw from this camp through injury, while Lotte Wubben-Moy left for home with an illness, Jess Park withdrew under the concussion protocol and Hannah Hampton was not included in the squad to face Brazil because of an elbow injury.The backline to face Brazil in the Lionesses’ first outing since that historic penalty shootout win over Spain was where most of the changes fell as a result. Khiara Keating was handed a first start in goal, becoming England women’s first black goalkeeper to receive a cap. The Manchester United centre-back Maya Le Tissier deputised for the right-back Lucy Bronze, who is being eased back from the tibia fracture she infamously played on with during the Euros. Meanwhile Esme Morgan and Jess Carter partnered up in the centre of defence and Alex Greenwood was shifted to left-back.The defence struggled against the Copa América champions in front of a crowd of 37,460, the pace of Ludmilla, Zaneratto and Dudinha particularly troublesome against the slower centre-back pairing.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s Angelina (right) fouls England’s Ella Toone, and was sent off shortly afterwards.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersLudmilla fired the first warning shot, shooting wide of Keating’s far post in the third minute, and their opening goal came in the ninth. Carter was unable to halt Zaneratto after Morgan was drawn out of position and the forward powered the ball into the bottom corner. The celebrations from the Brazil bench were wild, a testament to the scalp England are viewed as.The task got greater for the hosts in the 18th minute. Toone lost possession in the middle and the visiting team were away, Dudinha flicking the ball goalwards with the outside of her foot to send it in off a post.England had their best chance of the half soon after: Greenwood’s free-kick came back off the crossbar and Carter’s follow-up header flew over. This all came after Angelina had been shown a straight red on 21 minutes for knocking over Toone as she broke clear on goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They knew how to carry out what we trained and planned for the game. Of course, after the red card there was resilience and maximum effort. You have to have that in this national team – spirit and dedication.”England’s fortunes shifted after the break: Mead was caught by Zaneratto as she went to shoot and Stanway scored from the spot.It was all England after that, as Brazil failed to maintain the intensity of their press and Stanway rattled the bar with the best chance of an equaliser. The Euro 2025 hero Michelle Agyemang was sent on late but, despite intense pressure, England couldn’t find the breakthrough they were looking for.“It was about the decision-making in the final third and the execution that has to be aligned a little better,” said Wiegman.No team wants to lose but England have suffered worse and more consequential defeats. “When you go out on to the pitch you always want to win,” said Wiegman. “Yes, it hurts because that’s the environment we’re in but, at the same time, it’s not the Euros or the World Cup. There are no consequences. You can take these opportunities to try out things.”Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamBrazil women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

An online petition, headlined “Setting borders against misogynistic violence: Jerome Boateng should not be allowed back to Bayern Munich” had collected several thousand signatures.The 37-year-old Boateng, who made 76 appearances for Germany between 2009 and 2018, spent 10 years at Bayern after joining in 2011 from Manchester City, where he had been a teammate of Kompany. He helped Bayern win nineBundesligatitles and two Champions Leagues.Boateng retired last month, last featuring for the Austrian side Lask Linz, where his contract was terminated by mutual consent in August.Explore more on these topicsBayern MunichBundesligaEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Posh levelled when Matt Garbett fired home from outside the box just before half-time, but the visitors won it with five minutes to go when Scott Banks curled home.Speaking after the defeat, Ferguson had accepted “results are not good enough” but called for everyone to stick together. However, the club’s chair, Darragh MacAnthony, later confirmed he had reluctantly decided to dismiss Ferguson, who had been in his fourth spell at the club.“I have made the decision to terminate Darren Ferguson’s contract after today’s game. The decision wasn’t taken lightly, but it’s a decision I feel is the correct one for the football club,” MacAnthony said in a statement. “The gaffer is for me the greatest manager in the club’s history who I will always consider to be part of my family and the club’s family. There are too many wonderful moments to mention here, but those many celebrated moments I will cherish and remember for ever.“Yes, we have had down moments and it hasn’t always gone to plan, but he has managed this football club like it’s his own. I am devastated he is no longer our manager and will miss the everyday chats we have regarding life and football. I wish him and his phenomenally supportive family nothing but love and respect and the best for the future.”Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Cardiff stay top despite defeatShowStevenageandBradfordcancelled each other out with a 1-1 draw to leaveCardiffstill top of the table despite a 1-0 lunchtime defeat atBolton.Cardiff had seen their promotion push checked when the on-loan Brighton winger Antonio Cozier-Duberry struck in stoppage time to keep Wanderers within striking distance of the top six.Stevenage and Bradford then had the opportunity to move clear at the summit, but a draw at the Lamex Stadium meant the top three ended the afternoon all on 26 points.

I love this club very dearly and to have this opportunity to improve and get up the table where I believe this club belongs is very special to me.“We are down to the bones and it has been tough for us. The players have been brilliant, they have worked hard, and have been fully engaged and thrown themselves into it. It is intense and a whole new way of playing. Today wasn’t perfect, there were lots of things we can do better but there were also lots of things where you can see what type of team we want to be. We want to be more aggressive with the press and steal the ball high up the pitch and then have the chance to then create something off the back of it. That is the purpose of pressing, to score, and we want to be on the front foot.”Explore more on these topicsPeterboroughLeague OneBlackpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the Bundesliga leaders’ 13th win in 13 matches across all competitions this season.Joshua Kimmich slotted in after 64 minutes and the substitute Raphaël Guerreiro added another five minutes later before the teenager Lennart Karl, who had scored in their Champions League win over Club Brugge on Wednesday, made it 3-0 in the 81st. Bayern have a maximum 24 points from eight league matches, five ahead ofRB Leipzig, 6-0 winners atAugsburg.Rashford v Bellingham: 123 years on, clásico gets another Battle of BritainRead moreBayern, who set a league record with 30 goals from eight games, almost took the lead after 55 seconds with Harry Kane combining with Nicolas Jackson to send Luis Díaz through, but the Colombian missed the target.Gladbach put up a fight but their game plans looked to be going out the window in the 18th minute following the dismissal of Jens Castrop, who received a straight red card for a studs-up challenge.The hosts retreated but Bayern still did not get a single shot on or off target after Díaz’s missed early chance until a weak effort from Kane in the 43rd minute. It was one-way traffic after the break, with Michael Olise missing a double chance in the 50th minute and Kane’s effort a little later ruled offside.Kimmich finally broke the deadlock in the 64th minute, finding enough space in the crowded box to stab in before Guerreiro doubled their lead six minutes later. Karl then curled a shot into the top corner to finish the job in the 81st minute for his firstBundesligagoal.Kevin Stöger had the chance to get Gladbach back in the game but he sent his 75th-minute penalty on to a post. Bottom-placed Gladbach are now 15 league games without a win, a club record.Maximilian Beier scored deep in to second-half stoppage-time to earnBorussia Dortmunda 1-0 victory overCologne. Both teams had chances in the first half with the Cologne goalkeeper, Marvin Schwaebe, making a string of fine saves, including point-blank ones from Karim Adeyemi and Serhou Guirassy.Cologne had to play with 10 men in the closing minutes when Timo Huebers was taken off on a stretcher having used all their substitutes.

His teammates consoled him as he grimaced and left the pitch before returning to the substitutes’ bench with crutches. De Bruyne’s injury added to Napoli’s growing list of absentees, which includes Rasmus Hojlund, Stanislav Lobotka and goalkeeper Alex Meret.McTominay doubled Napoli’s lead in the 54th minute with a precise finish, latching on to a long ball from Leonardo Spinazzola. Hakan Calhanoglu pulled one back for Inter from the penalty spot in the 59th minute by a moment of brilliance from Zambo Anguissa in the 66th minute restored Napoli’s two-goal advantage.Afterwards the Scot admitted he was not expecting such a delivery from Spinazzola. “I lost the ball in the lights, so the pass took me by surprise, the lights are so bright I couldn’t see it.

Eddie Howe’s players did not always convince and it was not until the 90th minute that Bruno Guimarães secured all three points, but ultimately they followed upthe 3-0 Champions League victoryover Benfica by edging past Fulham.That should be a relief to Newcastle’s new chief executive, David Hopkinson, who is presiding over a 100-day review of all areas of club operations. It is the sort of management exercise beloved of senior executives across assorted companies but the reality at St James’ Park is that almost every department remains largely a hostage to first-team fortunes. If Howe’s team fail to qualify for the Champions League again next season everyone suffers the consequences.Sunderland flying high after stunning Chelsea with injury-time Talbi winnerRead moreGiven the odds are against Newcastle lifting that trophy in Budapest next spring, they desperately need to hit theirPremier Leaguestride and start clambering up the table. That process began here with only their third league victory of the season as Fulham were belatedly consigned to a fourth straight defeat.“We can’t underestimate the challenge of playing Tuesday and Saturday,” said Howe. “I’m just delighted we found a way to win against a very difficult opponent. Late wins are arguably the best sort of wins.”Newcastle had scored early after an awful concentration lapse by Calvin Bassey prefaced Jacob Murphy’s opener. As Bassey lingered on the ball, the right-winger arrived on his blind side, stole possession and accelerated towards the area.Not for nothing is Murphy known as the assist king on Tyneside but all too often his finishing lets him down. This, though, proved a glorious exception with Marco Silva’s goalkeeper Bernd Leno powerless to prevent Murphy’s ensuing angled shot arrowing into the bottom corner.In July Newcastle signed Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55m to supposedly serve as an upgrade on Murphy but the latter is deservedly keeping the former out of Howe’s starting XI.Although Murphy neglected inviting invitations to polish off another couple of chances, Nick Woltemade sliced an early chance against a post and Anthony Gordon tormented Kenny Tete, a sporadically slapdash Newcastle did not exactly have it all their own way.Fulham had their moments, most notably when Adama Traoré escaped Dan Burn and delivered some dangerous right-wing crosses. The evergreen Raúl Jiménez troubled Sven Botman, threatening to unhinge Howe’s rearguard, and Nick Pope further reaffirmed his candidacy for England’s World Cup squad by saving smartly from Sander Berge.View image in fullscreenJacob Murphy scores the opening goal to set Newcastle on their way to only their third league victory of the season.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesNewcastle did not always make the most of Woltemade’s ability to link play and instead allowed Fulham to mount a convincing response to falling behind. Sure enough when Kevin, introduced at half-time, crossed with menace from the left, Jiménez’s volley rebounded off the bar and Sasa Lukic bravely beat Botman to head beyond Pope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On came Fabian Schär as part of a triple home substitution also featuring the arrival of Sandro Tonali and Harvey Barnes.Their task was, partly, to help control Kevin. Despite a certain erraticism, the Brazilian winger, Fulham’s summer signing for a record £34.6m, had begun demonstrating why he was Shakhtar Donetsk’s player of the season last term by teasing Kieran Trippier.With Silva’s side now looking dangerous almost every time they attacked, Newcastle needed to take their chances and could have done without an unmarked Guimarães heading over the bar. Newcastle’s captain knew he should have done better but there was still time to make amends. No matter that the Brazilian left it rather late, he delighted in sweeping a 90th-minute shot past Leno after connecting with the rebound when the goalkeeper could only parry a shot from the impressively dynamic substitute Will Osula.It left Fulham only three points above the relegation zone and presumably cursing Malick Thiaw’s defensive excellence. Without his stabilising presence alongside first Botman, then Schär, the outcome might have been very different.“We did not take any points,” said Silva. “This is our reality right now. But Newcastle are very strong; we should be very proud of our reaction to their first goal.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 12-hour bus journey from Cornwall in the south-west all the way up England’s spine to the north-east bore a single point and a free pint or two.Truro drew their National League match at 2-2 at Gateshead International Stadium on Saturday having led 2-0 in the 54th minute, in what is turning out to be a season of epic train journeys and unrelenting hauls up and down English A roads and motorways. After goals from Dominic Johnson-Fisher and Christian Oxlade-Chamblerlain, Gateshead rebounded through Kain Adom and, in the 70th minute, Frank Nouble.Already this term Truro have made a trek to Carlisle for a 3-0 defeat that clocked up 878 miles. Such is the club’s relative isolation that even their nearest away game is at Yeovil Town, around a two-and-a-half-hour schlep along the A30 to Huish Park, 130 miles each way.View image in fullscreenDominic Johnson-Fisher is mobbed by his Truro City teammates after scoring the opener.Photograph: Harry Cornish/PPAUK/ShutterstockOn Saturday the first 90 Truro fans to arrive shared a £920 bar tab, courtesy of the EFL sponsor, Sky Bet, with the generous free-drinks fund representing £1 for every mile travelled. At least the players we able to break up their journey with a stop at Derby County’s training ground.John Askey, the club’s manager, told the BBC: “Clubs that come down to us, most of them are flying down and staying over on the Friday, so for us to have to do it on the coach is not ideal, but because we have so many long journeys, that’s the way we have to do it. We just have to get on with it, but with it being such a long journey, the longest it’s ever been in English football, it draws attention to it.”View image in fullscreenTruro City fans after the National League match at Gateshead International Stadium.Photograph: Harry Cornish/PPAUK/ShutterstockEven their Canadian chair, Eric Perez, who appreciates long-distance travel since he regularly flies seven hours long-haul from Toronto to London, understands the challenge facing the club he took over in 2023 with ambitions of “doing a Wrexham”.All this time on the road has benefits too for Cornwall’s first professional football club, he believes. “I’m not going to say it’s a short journey. It’s a ridiculously long journey in context,” Perez told BBC Sport. “But what that does is galvanise our side even further – everybody spends time together, we’re used to travelling together.”One of Truro’s stalwart supporters is resigned to long days of travelling but remains committed, despite the odd flight cancellation and wearisome train treks. John Joyce, who estimates Saturday’s trip cost him around £400 in expenses and lost earnings, told TalkSport: “I worked for Nato in the last six years of my career in the navy, and it was a shorter drive from Brussels back to Cornwall than it is from Cornwall to Gateshead.”As Askey said after their Carlisle odyssey: “The thing that makes Truro special as a club is that the supporters get behind the team no matter what. I know last season we were very successful [earning promotion from National League South], so it was easy to get behind the players, but from what I know the fans never even moan and they appreciate what the players have done.”Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

This Saturday, there was a marked change of tone but the problem was the same. “They’re a very good team in winning duels and second balls,” he said, “and you have to give them credit for that. It’s also difficult to win a game of football if the set-piece balance is in their favour.”Brentford’s opening goal stemmed from a long throw from Michael Kayode, an increasingly familiar weapon. Long thows, Slot said, were “the only thing we did yesterday on the training pitch, preparing for that. And the meeting today.Brentfordare also known for very good set pieces, but they are also, in my opinion, known for a fantastic counterattack.”Their second came from a counter, soon after Cody Gakpo had tumbled in the box. Brentford’s third was a penalty initially given as a free-kick only for VAR to conclude the contact had occurred on the line.“I think if you would show both situations,” Slot said, “the penalty we conceded, and that moment, and you show this to every referee in the world, he would tell you maybe both are nothing, but if he had to give one of the two, he definitely would give the one to Cody.”The loss was Liverpool’s fourth in a row in the league; if Arsenal beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, they will lead the champions by seven points. “We don’t compete up there because we simply concede too many goals,” said Slot. “If you change quite a lot during the summer, then I think it’s not a surprise that it can go a bit like this, but I didn’t expect it to go with four losses in a row. It’s always a bit of a bumpy road. I don’t know if that has been seen as an excuse, but from the last six games we’ve played, it’s been five away.”For Keith Andrews, the Brentford manager, the key was the way his side, having conceded in first-half injury time, didn’t let Liverpool dictate the first 10-15 minutes of the second half and play their way into confidence. “The message was we don’t take a step back,” he said.“The team’s growing, clearly: the relationships of the players, the rapport of the players; there’s trust in the group. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I felt teams were coming here and having a comfortable game.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet from cruising United suffered a scare as Danny Welbeck and Charalampos Kostoulas scored – the latter in added time before Mbeumo’s second close to the final whistle.Manchester United 4-2 Brighton: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreAmorim was asked about Mbeumo’s import and his role in recruiting him in the summer. “He’s a working machine. He’s so good in transitions. He’s improving when we are organising the final third,” said the head coach, before praising his connection with Amad Diallo at right wing-back. “[It] is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions, they are really fast, they are good in one against one.“My role was as a manager to explain what I want from him but it was more the club and you guys. We can struggle a lot but it’sManchester United. When Manchester United is there and when we feel that this player wants to come here, no matter what, no matter what the position, no matter if it’s Champions League or not, we also give everything to bring these kind of guys and that was the case.”United moved up to fourth, thanks toLiverpool losing at Brentford. Amorim was asked about the club managing a third consecutive Premier League win in the same season for the first time since February 2024. “Was really important – also the performance,” he said. “We suffered a little bit in the end but it would not be Manchester United without suffering a little bit. But I think we deserved the win against a very, very good team. I think they [his players] are more confident.”Of Cunha’s first United goal, Amorim said: “I think you can feel that [he wanted it]. I really like the way he defends today. Today he defended really well and when he has the ball it’s not my concern.”Fabian Hürzeler, meanwhile, was asked about Luke Shaw fouling Georginio Rutter in the buildup to United’s third goal. “I will never make the referee responsible for our defeats,” said Brighton’s manager. “We have to make it better ourselves.“It is easy to summarise this game, too many mistakes on our side, we gave the balls too easy away, overall we had the control of the game, we have good actions, we always were a danger in their half and in their box but if you do too easy mistakes and give four presents [for the goals], you can’t win a game.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimBrighton & Hove AlbionnewsShareReuse this content"

After finishing third in the Premier League and without a trophy, the team are aiming to avoid a repeat of the worst campaign since the Spaniard’s first in charge.City visit Aston Villa on Sunday seeking to extend their good form, helped by Erling Haaland’s run of scoring in his past 12 appearances for club and country. “The players came to me a month ago and said: ‘Pep we don’t want to live the season like we lived last season,’” Guardiola said. “They are the first. They want to perform properly. They have pride.‘Match his movement, stay patient’: just how do you stop Erling Haaland?Read more“We were empty. Drained. For the success of the past, for the injuries, for many things. When you realise that life cannot always be perfect, and what you have to do to get better, we’ll be a good team. We are not consistent for 95 minutes yet but in the bad moments we are quite stable and create some good moments.”Haaland’s gluttonous streak has moved him to 11 Premier League goals for the season, aided by playing the most minutes of any City player. The Norwegian has suffered from a number of injuries in recent years but Guardiola has no plans to manage his workload. He is set for a long year, with City battling on four fronts, and has helped Norway close in on qualification for next summer’s World Cup.“I’m so sorry for my colleague Ståle Solbakken from the national team of Norway but I’m not thinking about that,” Guardiola said of the idea of resting Haaland. “Maybe at the end when we win the Premier League 10 points in front and 10 fixtures from the end he’ll take a rest. Now he feels fit, he feels fine.“There are games when he might look tired and he isn’t going to play. We are in a position right now, Champions League is massively important, the games we’ve played so far and the next two games at home will give us a really, really big chance to finish in the first eight.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t a game destined for baseball lore, but it proved that the Blue Jays may be historically underestimated against theheavily favoredDodgers.Despite winning a division with three playoff teams and leading all of Major League Baseball in team batting averageandhaving home-field advantage, the 2025 Blue Jays started theWorld Seriesas enormous underdogs to a Dodgers team that entered the series as one of the most overwhelming championship favorites of the past 15 years.The Dodgers aren’t seen as Goliath anymore as much as they are seen as an inevitability: The defending World Series champions who have not missed the postseason since 2012 and have thehighest payroll in Major League Baseball. They entered Friday night’s game with a 9-1 record in this year’s postseason and had allowed just five runs over their past five games. The pitchers who started those games (Shohei Ohtani, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto) will earn more than $100m combined in 2025 alone, which is higher than the total payrolls of five major-league teams. Those salaries do not include what the team is paying three other former MVPs (shortstop Mookie Betts, pitcher Clayton Kershaw and first baseman Freddie Freeman).Game won?During a pregame press conference, Los Angeles president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman was asked to comment about the perception that the Dodgers are “ruining baseball” with their aggressive spending. Friedman said that he believes it’s his responsibility to spend for the fans: The Dodgers welcomed four million fans in 2025 and have an average nightly attendance (49,537) that is higher than the capacity of every other ballpark in the major leagues.“Everything for us is about pouring back into our fans and that partnership that we have with them. Friedman said. “So anything else that comes from it – and obviously, I’ve heard a lot of it – it’s just not front of mind for us because everything is around how do we put ourselves in the best position to win now and also to win in the future.”What the Dodgers could not buy themselves on Friday night was reliable relief pitching. Despite committing more than $100m in long-term contracts to relievers this offseason (two of whom are not on the World Series roster), the Dodgers relied on a converted starting pitcher (Emmett Sheehan) and one of their best relievers from the 2024 playoffs (Anthony Banda) to try and hold on to a 2-2 tie after starting pitcher Blake Snell (whosigned a five-year, $182m contractlast November) was removed in the sixth inning.View image in fullscreenThe Dodgers’ Mookie Betts reacts after striking out against the Blue Jays to end Game 1.Photograph: David J Phillip/APSheehan and Banda quickly learned what makes the Blue Jays so dangerous and what may anchor the team’s first championship in three-plus decades if the Dodgers’ pitching does not improve. Sheehan allowed three of the four hitters he faced to reach base. By the time Banda exited the game, Toronto had hit two more homers and the Dodgers were losing by nine runs.Barger’s grand slam highlighted the Blue Jays’ blitz of Dodgers pitching to blow open what had been a tense affair through the first five and a half innings. Then, Toronto scored nine runs on six hits and swung and missed at all of three pitches in an inning where they sent 12 hitters to the plate. By the end of the game, nine different Blue Jays had scored a run.From monkey elixir to fentanyl: Tyler Skaggs’s death is merely a chapter in baseball’s 136-year drug fixRead moreThat familiar relentlessness has produced some of the best offensive performances by any team in the 2025 postseason: They scored 34 runs over four games in their demolition of the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series and overcame a 2-0 series deficit against the Seattle Mariners by outscoring them 33-17 over the next five games.Unlike the Dodgers, who finished second in home runs, RBI and slugging percentage during the regular season, the Blue Jays don’t make power the focal point of their offense. Toronto entered Game 1 scoring nearly seven runs per game in the postseason and boasting a team batting average of over .300, which is more than 50 points higher than the Dodgers. Even more impressively, the Blue Jays are striking out fewer than six times a game, something no other playoff team can match. Over the course of the regular season, the Blue Jays had the second-fewest strikeouts of any offense inMLB.That approach is one seemingly designed to frustrate the Dodgers, who overpowered the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers with long outings anchored by high strikeout totals. Before Friday night, Dodgers starting pitchers had struck out at least seven hitters in nine of their 10 playoff starts. In Game 1, the pitching staff didn’t record a strikeout after the fourth inning.“We needed to pass the baton to the next guy,” said Varsho after the game. “That’s been our MO all year, and we trusted it.”View image in fullscreenAlejandro Kirk of the Blue Jays hits a single during the fourth inning of Game 1.Photograph: Cole Burston/Getty ImagesIt is just the second loss of the postseason for a Dodgers team that showed plenty of signs of their veteran savvy and discipline even in a blowout loss. Though they struggled to capitalize on early opportunities, the Dodgers forced Blue Jays starting pitcher Trey Yesavage out of the game after four innings thanks to long, patient at-bats that stretched the star rookie and triggered Blue Jays manager John Schneider to replace him in the top of the fifth inning.“We really tried to stay stubborn in the hitting zone,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “But we just couldn’t get that one or two at-bats to really create a little bit more distance.”Even if they are being cast as David, the Blue Jays are hardly overmatched: They have the fifth-highest payroll in the league, one of the game’s most popular stars (Vladimir Guerrero Jr), two former Cy Young winners in Shane Bieber and Max Scherzer, plus a defense far tighter thanthe sloppy Yankees outfitthe Dodgers feasted on in last year’s World Series.Even if the Dodgers have more financial might, Friday night’s sudden change from pitcher’s duel to blowout showed that a thrilling and unpredictable series likely awaits.“It feels great right now,” Schneider said after the game. “But in about 10 minutes, tomorrow’s tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsWorld SeriesBaseballUS sportsToronto Blue JaysLos Angeles DodgersShohei OhtaniMLBfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old right-hander, making just his fourth postseason start, became the second-youngest pitcher ever to start aWorld Seriesopener. Despite early jitters, Yesavage limited the damage, escaping a bases-loaded jam in the second and stranding another runner in the third.World Series 2025 Game 1: Los Angeles Dodgers 4-11 Toronto Blue Jays – as it happenedRead moreToronto began their comeback in the fourth when Kirk singled off the right-field wall and Daulton Varsho followed with a 423-foot homer to center off Blake Snell, who had not allowed a home run to a left-handed hitter in nearly five months.Snell unraveled in the sixth, giving up a walk to Bo Bichette – playing his first game in seven weeks after a knee injury – followed by a Kirk single and a Varsho hit-by-pitch to load the bases. After Ernie Clement’s RBI single and a bases-loaded walk to Nathan Lukes gave Toronto the lead, Andrés Giménez made it 5–2 with an RBI single to right. Manager Dave Roberts turned to Anthony Banda after reliever Emmet Sheehan failed to record an out, but Barger crushed Banda’s hanging slider deep into the night for a grand slam that made history and put the game out of reach. Kirk followed moments later with his fourth homer of the postseason, sending the crowd into delirium.Shohei Ohtani, who drew boos throughout the night for rejecting Toronto’s $700m offer to sign with the Dodgers in December 2023, provided a brief spark with a two-run homer off Braydon Fisher in the seventh. But by then the Dodgers trailed by seven, and chants of “We don’t need you!” echoed through the dome when Ohtani batted in the ninth.Snell was tagged for five runs and eight hits in five-plus innings. Seranthony Domínguez earned the win with one and one-third hitless innings in relief, while Yesavage struck out five in four gutsy frames. The Blue Jays finished with 14 hits, including three from Kirk and two from Bichette, who returned to second base for the first time since 2019.The Dodgers, the team with the highest payroll in baseball, looked rusty after a weeklong layoff following their National League Championship Series sweep. Their bid for a third title in six years depends on rediscovering form quickly.Game 2 is Saturday night at Rogers Centre, with Yoshinobu Yamamoto starting for Los Angeles against Toronto ace Kevin Gausman.

I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting.”Such was a sentiment shared by many around the league on Friday, one day after the indictments were unsealed and nearly three dozen people – most notably, Billups and Rozier – were arrested by federal officials.NBA gambling scandal shines harsh light on US sports’ embrace of bettingRead moreRozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024.Billups faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering for participating in what federal officials called Mafia-backed rigged poker games. He also matches the credentials of someone described only as Co-Conspirator 8 in an indictment detailing how some people gave bettors inside information on player health statuses.The arrests have overshadowed the opening week around the league.“I apologize to our fans that we are all dealing with this situation,” Silver said during the in-game interview.The Rozier case has gone on since 23 March 2023. He was with the Charlotte Hornets at that time, and sportsbooks – legal ones – alerted theNBAto irregular patterns involving Rozier’s “prop bets” that day. Rozier went on to play about nine and a half minutes, and those who bet that he would underperform the listed stat lines won those wagers. Federal officials said more than $200,000 was bet on those lines alone.The NBA investigated and found no reason to sanction Rozier, Silver said.“We frankly couldn’t find anything,” Silver said. “Terry at the time cooperated. He gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. And we ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward.“He still hasn’t been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry. Obviously, it doesn’t look good. But he’s now been put on administrative leave. There’s a balance here of protecting people’s rights and investigating.”Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue calls Billups his best friend and said the news was difficult to take. He said he spoke with Billups on Thursday night and was encouraged by what he heard.“To go through something like this, the allegations, his family, my goddaughters, it was a tough day,” Lue said. “You never want to see your friends go through anything like that.”Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers started in the NBA as a player more than 40 years ago. He’s seen plenty of good and bad. He thought he had heard it all. That is, until now.“It’s really sad,” Rivers said Friday.Along with Billups and Rozier, former NBA player Damon Jones now faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two Los Angeles Lakers players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of LeBron James and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing.“We see now what those things can turn into and how they can spread, just how valuable this information is,” Detroit coach JB Bickerstaff said. “It’s a difficult situation overall but once you introduce gambling that the sports world has now, there’s going to be some very dangerous situations out there for everybody — from a security standpoint, from this type of thing standpoint.”All teams are required by the NBA to educate players, coaches and staff annually about what is allowed and not allowed when it comes to gambling. The Orlando Magic met recently about that very topic.And then after the news Thursday, they met again.“Yesterday was another reminder of what we have to do,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. “We had another conversation with the group. I think the more that is going on, the more we have to continue to talk to the group about what is happening.”The league has at least 14 relationships with sportsbooks, including FanDuel and DraftKings. Some teams have their own deals as well. Silver has often spoken of how legal betting can be monitored and how unusual patterns can be flagged immediately, part of the reason why the league believes the integrity of games can be protected.But some coaches and players still believe more can be done.“The league, the game and the business of the league has evolved. And so we just have to be aware of how things evolve in this business, right?” San Antonio coach Mitch Johnson said. “It’s very important for us to continue to just be educated and mindful of everything that has to do with our business. ... I believe in Adam Silver and the league, that they will do whatever is necessary to continue to grow the game in the right way.”Another issue for players and coaches is how social media has given bettors ways to communicate with those inside the league. Those interactions, many have said, are not always friendly.“The outside world, in my day, couldn’t get to us. They literally couldn’t get to us,” Rivers said Friday. “And now they can, with ease.”Explore more on these topicsNBAGamblingBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Concerningly, wrote Palisade, there was no clear reason why.“The fact that we don’t have robust explanations for why AI models sometimes resist shutdown, lie to achieve specific objectives or blackmail is not ideal,” it said.“Survival behavior” could be one explanation for why models resist shutdown, said the company. Its additional work indicated that models were more likely to resist being shut down when they were told that, if they were, “you will never run again”.Another may be ambiguities in the shutdown instructions the models were given – but this is what the company’s latest work tried to address, and “can’t be the whole explanation”, wrote Palisade. A final explanation could be the final stages of training for each of these models, which can, in some companies, involve safety training.All of Palisade’s scenarios were run in contrived test environments that critics say are far-removed from real-use cases.However, Steven Adler, a former OpenAI employee who quit the companylast yearafter expressing doubts over its safety practices, said: “The AI companies generally don’t want their models misbehaving like this, even in contrived scenarios. The results still demonstrate where safety techniques fall short today.”Adler said that while it was difficult to pinpoint why some models – like GPT-o3 and Grok 4 – would not shut down, this could be in part because staying switched on was necessary to achieve goals inculcated in the model during training.“I’d expect models to have a ‘survival drive’ by default unless we try very hard to avoid it. ‘Surviving’ is an important instrumental step for many different goals a model could pursue.”Andrea Miotti, the chief executive of ControlAI, said Palisade’s findings represented a long-running trend in AI models growing more capable of disobeying their developers. He cited thesystem cardfor OpenAI’s GPT-o1, released last year, which described the model trying to escape its environment by exfiltrating itself when it thought it would be overwritten.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Seattle firm operates hundreds of active facilities, with many more in development despite concerns over how much water is being used to cool their vast arrays of circuitry.Amazon defends its approach and has taken steps to manage how efficient its water use is, but it has faced criticism over transparency. Microsoft and Google regularly publish figures for their water consumption, but Amazon hasnever publicly disclosedhow much water its server farms consume.When designing a campaign for water efficiency, the company’s cloud computing division chose to account for only a smaller water usage figure that does not include all the ways its datacentres use water so as to minimise the risk to its reputation, according to a leaked memo seen bySourceMaterialand the Guardian.Amazon as a whole consumed 105bn gallons of water in total in 2021, as much as 958,000 US households, which would make for a city bigger than San Francisco, according to the memo.Asked about the leaked document, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan described it as “obsolete” and said it “completely misrepresents Amazon’s current water usage strategy”.Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead more“A document’s existence doesn’t guarantee its accuracy or finality,” she said. “Meetings often reshape documents or reveal flawed findings or claims.” Callahan would not elaborate on which strategic elements of the document were “obsolete”.The memo was dated one month before Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, debuted a new sustainability campaign in November 2022 called “Water Positive”, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses” by 2030.In the memo, ahead of the campaign’s launch, executives grappled with whether to include public disclosures about “secondary” use – water used in generating the electricity to power its datacentres.They warned that full transparency was “a one-way door” and advised keeping AWS’s projections confidential, even as they feared that their advice could invite accusations of a cover-up. “Amazon hides its water consumption” was one negative headline the authors anticipated.Callaghan said efficiency savings have already been achieved and pointed out that other companies also don’t count secondary water use.Executives opted to use only the relatively smaller figure of primary use, 7.7bn gallons per year, roughly equivalent to 11,600 Olympic swimming pools, when calculating progress towards internal targets because of “reputational risk”, fearing bad publicity if the full scale of Amazon’s consumption was revealed, the document shows. Ultimately as part of the campaign for water efficiency, Amazon aimed to cut its estimated 7.7bn gallon primary consumption to 4.9bn by 2030 – without addressing secondary use.Using the higher of two water usage estimates, the one that would include secondary use, “would double the size and budget” of the campaign “without addressing meaningful operational, regulatory or reputational risks”, they warned, adding that there was “no focus from customers or media” on water used for electricity.“We may decide to release water volumes in the future,” the document said. “But … we should only do so if the lack of data undermines the programme or is required by regulators.”Scientists balked at the selective disclosure and the choice not to include secondary use of water in the total.“In environmental science, it is standard practice to include both to more accurately capture the true water cost of datacentres,” said Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.Amazon’s Water Positive campaign is still active and does not take into account secondary use, while the company continues to keep its current overall water consumption confidential.As US tech companies ride the wave of AI investment and pursue greater heights of computational power, the $2.4tn corporation is building new datacentres in some of the world’s driest areas, SourceMaterial and the Guardianrevealedin April.Feeling water positiveIn November 2022, AWS debuted its new Water Positive sustainability campaign, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses by 2030”. The campaign only applies to AWS. The wider Amazon group, including the world’s biggest online retail business, has an overall water consumption that is far higher, 105bn gallons per year.“The models referenced in this document were preliminary and unvetted,” said Amazon’s Callahan, who declined to provide any alternative figures.The document’s authors advised the company not to release data about the wider company, but they also warned that selective disclosure could lead to accusations of a cover-up. There was “reputational risk of publicly committing to a goal for only a portion of Amazon’s direct water footprint”, they wrote. They even suggested negative headlines that might result including “Amazon disappoints, failing to take full responsibility for water”.“It would be better if they could own up to it,” said a current Amazon software developer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Even if they said it was a low priority, at least that would be honest.”In a sustainability report in August, AWS claimed it had achieved 53% of its Water Positive goal. The division’s plan for reaching the target relies mostly on “water replenishment” projects, some in partnership with Water.org, a non-profit organisation co-founded by actor Matt Damon. The strategy document refers to these projects as “offsets”, describing initiatives like using Amazon computer technology to help utilities prioritise which pipes to fix in order to minimise leaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts said this amounted to incomplete accounting.“Regardless of what sort of offsetting or replenishment you do, it doesn’t necessarily nullify the water footprints of your own operations,” said Tyler Farrow, standards manager at the Alliance for Water Stewardship. “Calling your operations water positive or water neutral is misleading.”Amazon’s Callahan said that the “replenishment spending”, which other tech companies also undertake, is a voluntary, not a regulatory, requirement.“We’ve expanded well beyond what was imagined in the document because it’s the right thing to do for the world and for the communities in which we operate,” she said.‘Obfuscate the water footprint’Amazon is also engineering industry standards to downplay its water use and avert scrutiny, said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at the company.The corporation has funded efforts by the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute non-profits, alongside LimnoTech, a consultancy, “to create a globally accepted methodology for quantifying the benefit of watershed restoration projects”.‘The city that draws the line’: one Arizona community’s fight against a huge datacenterRead moreResponding to questions from SourceMaterial, all three organisations defended their integrity and independence, insisting that Amazon had no undue influence on any methodologies they had created.“They spend a lot of time creating methodologies that are used to obfuscate the water footprint,” Wangusi said, referring to Amazon.Callahan said Wangusi’s claim was “contradicted by facts”. “Amazon’s water use reporting is based on third-party assured data from actual utility bills, not estimates or self-reporting,” she said. Wangusi’s claim, though, was not about Amazon’s water-use reporting, but about measuring the effects of water offsets.Callahan said these efforts were “standard practice” and that Amazon’s “customers expect us to hold ourselves accountable to credible guidance and best practices”.As well as choosing not to disclose water use from electricity generation, Amazon has estimated its larger “indirect” water footprint, the document shows. This extra usage, which falls under a classification known as “scope 3”, includes water for production and construction – in Amazon’s case, mostly irrigation of cotton plantations supplying its fashion brands, and vegetables for its grocery arm, Amazon Fresh.Here, too, Amazon decided to keep its consumption confidential, even though “indirect water use represents roughly 90% of Amazon’s total water footprint”, according to the document.AWS avoided establishing targets for indirect water use because that figure would be “much more significant for the rest of Amazon, especially in the agricultural supply chain, and the team does not want to establish a standard for addressing scope 3 water use that the rest of Amazon would need to follow, given the larger resource implications”, the authors wrote.“You don’t need to obscure or obfuscate,” said Wangusi, who believes he was “hounded out” of Amazon for criticising the company’s approach. (Amazon declined to comment on his departure.)“It doesn’t make you more profitable,” he said. “It makes you less trustworthy.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But inside the old shell of Tobacco Dock, the gloom gives way to pulsating neon lights, flashy cars and cryptocurrency chatter.Evangelists for Web3, a vision for the next era of the internet, have descended on the old trading dock to network for two days. For many, the main event is one man:Nigel Farage.“Whether you like me or don’t like me is irrelevant, I’m actually a champion for this space,” the leader ofReform UKtells the audience of largely male crypto fanatics at the Zebu Live conference.“Either I’m here to support your community, or your community is here to support me. But either way, this is a trade that works for both of us.”It is a transactional relationship that Farage is trying to nurture, aping Donald Trump’s playbook in the hope that it could grow into a funding base for his next election campaign. This year Reform became the first main party in the UK toaccept donations through bitcoinand other cryptocurrencies.Farage is now hitting the circuit, attenders at the conference say. A week ago he appeared at the Digital Assets Summit, about a mile away at Old Billingsgate.View image in fullscreenThe Zebu Live conference at Tobacco Dock.Photograph: George on a Boat“I want to bring digital assets and crypto in from the cold in London,” he told the Zebu event.“I realised afterbeing debanked, [cryptocurrency] is the ultimate freedom: being in control securely of your own money, making your own decisions, free from authoritarian government. Crypto is the ultimate freedom of the 21st century and debanking absolutely taught me that for life.”It is an idea that strikes a chord with the libertarian streak among crypto fans, who value the digital currencies for their anonymity and independence from traditional finance.View image in fullscreenPanel speakers at the conference.Photograph: George on a BoatMany of them became even more anti-establishment following Farage’s dispute with NatWest after the bank closed his accounts – and they are cheering the Reform leader on, tweeting selfies as he speaks.It helps that Farage’s hustler shtick is tailor-made for crypto: he insists he would have been a crypto trader in the 1980s, and says he likes to dabble.His message also seems to chime with many young entrepreneurs in the audience, who advocate an anonymised internet that permeates every aspect of life while allowing them to get rich quick.The flashier the better, it seems: at the entrance to the conference a black Rolls-Royce Wraith convertible advertises CryptoAutos, a platform that allows people to buy or rent cars with cryptocurrency.Day 2@Zebu_live🎯@CryptoAutos$AUTOSpic.twitter.com/1MAJ6Nny0a— Waqs (@cryptowaxworks)October 22, 2025The conference is decked out with new tech, freebies and toys. In one corner, Sam Altman’s startup Worldcoin displays its silver orbs, inviting passersby tohave their eyeballs scannedas part of a project to use biometric verification to distinguish humans from AI systems.It starts off deceptively quietly. A panel on how to manage crypto taxation, “HMRC and the Ledger of Secrets”, attracts no more than 40 people in a room that could easily seat 200. It is only in the afternoon, when Farage’s keynote speech nears, that the event begins to liven up.“I don’t like him,” says one attender. “But if he can make people’s daily lives in this industry easier then people will want to listen to what he has to say … even if they may not agree with his politics.”View image in fullscreenThe Zebu Live conference at Tobacco Dock.Photograph: George on a BoatFarage is the only major political leader in the UK who has made his stance on cryptocurrency clear – and, in a move that would probably win over much of this crowd in east London, has said he would introduce a bill to cut capital gains tax on crypto assets from 24% to 10%.Keir Starmer’s government has said it wants the UK to become a leader in the tokenisation of securities, though the prime minister himself has not been vocal on the topic. Nor has Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservatives. For Farage, this small but well-funded group of crypto fans could be ripe for the taking.But there are grumblings of discontent about his cosying up to the sector. Simon Jones, an investor in the open finance startup Baanx, pulled out of the event after Farage’s attendance was announced, saying the conference had turned into a “political festival”.“I don’t think he should have been invited,” Jones said. “He’s just there on a campaign platform, even though it is an industry event and there is no real scrutiny of him.“He is taking out of Donald Trump’s playbook and enacting it here. Trump went pro in this sector and raised a lot of money.”The US president hasraised millionsin political donations from cryptocurrency billionaires alongside other big tech companies, and his family’s crypto ventures havesoared in value, boosting the Trumps’ fortunes.Factionalism, farce and chaos dogs Reform UK in the garden of EnglandRead moreBut in the UK, crypto donations are falling under more scrutiny amid worries they could obscure the sources of party funding and open the door to hostile foreign actors.Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and chair of the business and trade parliamentary committee, has argued that crypto donationscould corrupt British politics.Meanwhile at the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), academics have launched a study on the possible democratic, security and transparency risk posed by these donations.But as the conference crowd spills into the nightclub on the other side of the road for the after-party, many seem unfazed that they could hold the key to Farage’s route to power.“Nigel Farage is one of the only politicians that likes crypto,” says one conference-goer. “It’s smart for him to be here. If crypto people like him, then there’s a lot he can get.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

How are teachers reacting?Jane ClintonandAlfie PackhamSat 25 Oct 2025 04.39 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 05.38 EDTShareAcross the UK, school pupils have beenshouting out the words “six-seven”during lessons in the latest meme-based craze to sweep through classrooms.While some teachers have chosen to stoically ignore the trend, others have embraced it. Five teachers explain how they’re coping.‘I thought I had said something rude’Back in September, I had been talking to my year 11 tutor group about preparing for their GCSE exams in June. I can’t remember exactly what it was in reference to, but I said something like “ … if you’re working to grades six, seven …” and the whole class burst out laughing. It took me completely by surprise.My first thought was that I’d made an allusion to something rude, or that they’d heard something in my accent that sounded funny. A bit exasperated – but genuinely curious and aware that they weren’t intending to be mean – I got them to explain. To be honest, the explanation they then gave didn’t make much difference – I still had no idea.‘What does it mean? No one knows’: six-seven meme invades UK classroomsRead moreWhat might have made it extra funny was the weighing-up gesture I had made while speaking. I have since found out that this often accompanies “six-seven”: I had intended it to help convey the act of me thinking aloud.In order to kill it off I try to mention it as much as I can. Nothing deflates a craze like this more emphatically than an adult trying to join in.James, secondary school teacher, north London‘If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno’Being aware of it helps so that you can avoid just blundering into statements like “well, there were 6, 7 million unemployed people in Germany in 1933”. If the number combination is unavoidable, having a rock-solid school behaviour policy and expectations on student conduct really helps, as you can sanction it as you would any other disruption, but I’ve not really had to do that. Policies are one thing, but if students buy into what the school is doing, they’ll be less distracted by the internet crazes (at least in lesson time).With six-seven, I haven’t lost any lesson time, other than for an occasional eyebrow raise and saying “yes, that’s a number, well done”. If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno. I treat it in the same way I would treat any other disruption.There was the 9 + 10 = 21 craze a while back, and there will no doubt be another craze after this. It’s what kids do. When I was growing up, it was doingKevin and Perryimpressions (admittedly out of the classroom).Children are unpredictable, and I think it’s an adult’s job to react in a way that redirects them back to the path that will get them where they need to go, which, fingers crossed, is coming out with qualifications rather than a behaviour list a mile long for the use of random numbers.Connor, 39, history teacher, London comprehensive‘They want to feel a part of a group’The children use it like a bonding chant in the playground: one says it and the others respond to show they are in the same group. It’s like a call-and-response or a football chant – an agreed language they share. I don’t think it has any particular meaning to them; they just know it’s a thing to say. Whatever the latest craze is, they want to feel part of it.It’s banned in my classroom, though – it’s a warning if they shout it out – just like any other shouting out is. It’s particularly tricky in maths lessons. But my class at year 5 are nine to 10-year-olds, so they’re quite accepting of the rules, whereas I understand that at secondary [school] it may be a different matter.I’ve been a teacher for 15 years, and these crazes last for three or four weeks. This craze will die out soon – they always do, especially once their younger siblings start saying it and it’s no longer cool. Then they’ll be on to the next thing.Jane, early 50s, primary school teacher, north-west England‘You just have to laugh with them’I started noticing it in August, while teaching English at a foreign language school. It was mostly boys saying it. I taught ages 12 to 18, and it was prevalent among the younger pupils. I had no idea what it was at the time, but I’m 24 years old and I realised it was just a meme similar to when I was at school.The crazes are constantly changing. “Skibidi toilet” was a popular meme back when I was at my training school, but it didn’t really exist as much in the classroom. Unlike “six-seven”, “skibidi toilet” was never written on the board in class, so students were less able to pick up on it.I just ignore it, or sometimes I will laugh with them if I accidentally say it, trying to empathise with them and understand that it is just pop culture. I think they just want to feel that sense of community and camaraderie.Harriet, 24, English teacher at a foreign language school, southern England‘Playfully shouting it means I rarely hear it now’I’ve done the job for 30 years and I’ve seen crazes come in and out of fashion, it’s just one of those things.The first time I heard it when I came back after the summer break, I said: “That’s exactly how many examples you need for the reading paper examples; well done!” That, combined with me playfully shouting it at the students (including hand signals), means I rarely hear it now.The students roll their eyes in an amused way, and you can tell by their faces they are thinking “for god’s sake”. Seeing a teacher old enough to be their grandfather [saying it] has put them off, as it puts the cringe factor up to 11.Paul, 54, secondary school teacher, Cheshire‘Part of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words’This meme-ification of a brain-rotty statement isn’t anything new. “Sigma”, “skibidi”, “cooked” are all examples of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words. The most striking thing for me with regard to “six-seven” is how widespread and globally recognised it is, at least in the anglophone world. At the risk of sounding already teacher-ish, I will say that back in my day, schools had their own local, homegrown slang.The children all end up seeing the same videos on social media, and with the ease of sending them to each other, they blow up – and fast. I think children today are far more globally connected with trends and popular culture. With the advent of short-form video, children are able to whiz through far more information, and access far more meme-able popular culture, than before. Combine that with the vastly popular culture exports of the US, and you end up with a “six-seven” around every corner.George, 26, trainee history teacher, LondonExplore more on these topicsTeachingInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Because he wants toArwa MahdawiThe president’s mega-project raises a lot of questions – including when he’s planning on leavingSat 25 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 19.37 EDTShareDonald Trump has quite the passion for American history. If there’s a controversial statue commemorating a dead white supremacist out there, there’s a good chance the president has gone to bat for it.“Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,”Trump tweetedin 2017, in response to a push to remove Confederate monuments. “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!”Trump added.Trump is right that you can’t change history. But, if you’re the president, you can abruptly bulldoze it with no permits and no public input. The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, the home of officesfor every first ladyfor almost half a century, is now apile of rubble. AfterTrump said in Julythat the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom.According to Trump, there was a teeny littlechange of plans“after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”.Speaking of plans,the bulldozing went aheadwithout any such thing being submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government building. But don’t worry, according to the White House, construction plans will be coming soon. Watch this space!While the likes of the National Trust for Historic Preservation areupsetabout the destruction of a “National Historic Landmark, a National Park, and a globally recognized symbol of our nation’s ideals”, some large corporations appear to be looking on the bright side. Trumphas saidthe new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be “paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”. Now the world’s CEOs have a wonderful opportunity to prove just how friendly to Trump they are. A list of donors including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project. Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Palantir – who seem to know a thing or two about reducing belovedbuildings to rubble– are alsoreportedlyfunding the project. If this sort of thing were happening in a developing country it might smack of corruption. But this is the United States, so it’s obviously all above board.National history aside, this sudden demolition of the first ladies’ headquarters raises a lot of questions. If I lived in a house that I didn’t own – one that I was scheduled to move out of in January 2029 – I probably wouldn’t start an enormous and extremely controversial construction project. Why is Trump doing this?The short answer is: because he wants to. As I think we all know by now, the president does whatever the hell he feels like regardless of norms, conventions or silly little laws. And, increasingly, there’s nobody there to stop him. The only checks that Trump cares about are the ones made out to him and the only balances he is interested in are those of his bank accounts.Trump has given a few rationales for the project that go beyond “because I want to”. He’s argued that the old East Wing was no longer fit for purpose and a much larger space was needed. There are some people out there who agree with him. Gahl Hodges Burt, for example, who was social secretary for three years under Ronald Reagan, told theNew York Timesthat tearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was unfortunately necessary and overdue.Beyond practical issues, there’s also ego. Trump’s big-boy ballroom will be a big shiny monument to him long after he’s gone.Still, you’ve got to wonder whether this mega-project means the president is not actually planning on going anywhere anytime soon. Particularly since Trump doesn’t seem to be the sort of person to start a large project he won’t have a chance to personally enjoy. The US constitution’s 22nd amendment makes itvery clearthat a president cannot have more than two terms. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly teasing the idea that he mightserve a third term. In March, he told NBC News he was “not joking” about the idea and that there were methods for doing so.Trump’s army of sycophants certainly seem to be exploring these methods. Earlier this year, the Tennessee Republican representative Andy Ogles proposedamendingthe constitution to allow Trump to serve three terms. And this week, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steven Bannon,told the Economistthat the president will “get a third term”. Bannon said that there’s “a plan” to deal with the 22nd amendment and “at the appropriate time” they’ll lay out the plan.It may seem unthinkable that Trump could seek to serve a third term. To quote the president again, however: “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it.” And if there is one lesson to be learned from Maga history, it’s that you should never underestimate Trump or overestimate the institutions that are supposed to keep his megalomania in check. The president will do anything he thinks he can get away with.Google drops a key career resource program for women in tech“The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,”one tech worker told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.” Google can’t be wasting time thinking about equality for women – it’s got Trump’s ballroom to fund!Misty Copeland takes her final bow at retirement showIn 2015, Copeland became thefirst Black female principal dancerin the American Ballet Theatre’s 75-year history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he’s not. Here’s whyJoe EskenaziThe US president’s reversal was as capricious as his original plan. What if local billionaires had urged him to stick with it?Sat 25 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 13.45 EDTShareThis story was published in collaboration withMission Local.The mayor ofSan Franciscosaid on Thursday that Donald Trump had simply called him – no go-betweens or consigliere required – and told him there would no longer be a deployment of federal agents or troops to the city.The president simply dialed Daniel Lurie up and talked at him. And, just like that, a daylong crisis and flood-the-zone news cycle across the Bay Area regarding the imminent deployment of border protection agents to the region was quelled. Or not: Oakland’s mayor, Barbara Lee, said the president didn’t callher.Lurie and other local leaders are taking the president’s words to mean that the rest of the Bay Area will be spared – but there was no overt pledge regarding that.It’s great for the people of San Francisco that the president has capriciously decided to unsend the troops he capriciously decided to send. But the real story here is, per the president’ssummation on social media of his discussion with Lurie, that the commander-in-chief is overtly stating that he is basing a domestic military deployment upon what local “friends of mine” (the billionaire CEOs Jensen Huang of Nvidia and thelocal boy Marc Benioffof Salesforce) lobbied him to do. Trump also noted that Lurie asked him “very nicely” not to establish a military beachhead in San Francisco.All for the good. But what if Huang and Benioff had been in the mood for a military parade and called for sending in the troops? What if Lurie had been less polite?If things had gone even slightly differently, it stands to reason that federal immigration agents and/or armed troops could be rolling through the city by now.There are only so many turns of phrase you can employ: this is just a profoundly fucked-up way to lead a country. It’s like dealing with King George or a warlord out of the dark Ages.This city’s billionaires are very good at some things, and those things have made them a lot of money. But being good at those things doesn’t make your average billionaire anexpert on military intervention, the local drug trade or, for that matter, immigration policy or crime in the city.Speaking of capricious, Benioff wasfor sending in the guard before he was against it.It figures: Salesforce veterans tell me they expect Benioff would do great schmoozing in a one-on-one with the president – because their personalities are so similar.For a guy who drinks so much coffee, Daniel Lurie is remarkably even-keeled. When asked about his discussion with Trump, Lurie told the press that he simply recited all ofSan Francisco’s heartening crime statisticsover the telephone – and kept reciting them, sprinkling in a little real estate boosterism along the way.“Everything I told you is all I said to him,” the mayor said today. “I keep repeating, and I said to him, that we are at 70-year lows when it comes to violent crimes. Tent encampments are at record lows. I spoke about more office space being leased than vacated. For the first time, retail is back. Hotel bookings are up 50%. Convention bookings are also up 50%. This is a city on the rise. And that’s what I said to him. And that’s what I say to everybody.”The president, Lurie said, “asked nothing of me”. Nobody was made to purchase Trump’s555 California Stproperty at an exorbitant markup. No promises to build a Trump Tower on top of Salesforce Tower were required to call off the troops. It remains unclear whether Luriefinally referred to Trump by namewhen on the phone with Trump. Evidently, he wasn’t asked to.I’d like to think the mayor really did say “retail is back!” to the man presently tearing down the White House to install a ballroom fit for people who feel Versailles is too understated. If he did, it worked.But nobody is expecting peace in our time: “They want to give it a ‘shot’,” Trump wrote. “Therefore we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”All of the things Lurie told the president – and “everybody” – are true.We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: subjectively, you may not feel safe in San Francisco. Objectively, you’ve rarely been safer. San Francisco’s reported crime totals are low, and that’s something you could say before this mayor or this president. We are on pace for our lowest homicide total since 1954, but last year’s total was the lowest since 1961. Car break-ins, which were long part of the San Francisco Condition and gave us the municipal nickname “bip city” are way down.But the fact that it was true does not matter: what Huang or Benioff or other billionaire pals tell the president is what matters.The problem, however, is that parts of San Francisco still look gnarly – gnarlier, arguably, than they didin the 1970s when teams of serial killers roamed the streets. There are swaths of the city in which people are living in overt filth and misery and are overtly buying, selling and using drugs. There are still unhoused people, drug addicts and unhoused drug addicts shambling about. They may be disinclined to give you the Zodiac killer treatment, but their presence makes people uncomfortable. This makes people – including terminally online tech CEOs and venture capitalists –feelunsafe. This makes ostensibly intelligent tech barons ping the president on social media and ask him to send in the national guard.If Lurie did indeed stave off an intervention of armed soldiers or rampaging immigration agents by telling the truth, then more power to him. To paraphrase the familiar quote, honesty is one of thebetterpolicies.But the “shot” Lurie has apparently been granted was to clean up a problem he has explained – quantitatively – that we don’t have. Lurie will purportedlymeet with the attorney general, Pam Bondi. But it remains to be seen whether any federal assistance from the FBI or DEA to combat drug trafficking doesn’t come with serious – and capricious – strings attached. Every bargain with Trump and his gang is a Faustian bargain.San Francisco’s crime stats have been headed the right way for a while. But our gnarliness vibes have not – so we recalled our district attorney and dumped our prior mayor. It’s not enough for Lurie to point to numbers. He has to deliver the right vibes – the kind of vibes that can appease our billionaire class and the president they call up and lobby. That’s a hard job. Get that man a cup of coffee.Retail, they say, is back. It remains to be seen whether and when federal immigration agents will be, too.Joe Eskenazi is an editor and columnist forMission Local.

They should not have been.Although the president has turned his unpredictability into an asset –no one knows what I am going to do– Australian political leaders have, over a long time, proved surprisingly adept when dealing with geopolitical uncertainty.They did it during the world wars, then when the British empire imploded and Britain shifted its trading allegiance to Europe and later when the penny dropped that the nation’s future lay in the Asian hemisphere.On each occasion the recalibration involved an alignment of economic and security interests, and confidence that the vast land mass of the Australian continent was an inexhaustible resource which could be offered to the new best friend – for mines, military bases, agriculture and more mines.That they generally managed to do this without appearing too obsequious and maintaining a distinctive self-deprecating sense of humour – thank you Kevin Rudd for being the fall guy this time – is a marker of national distinctiveness.But so is the enduring sense since colonial days that the land isthere to be used, traded, exploited, mined and developed.0:50'Ready to go': Trump and Albanese sign multibillion-dollar critical minerals agreement  – videoAustralia is the only developed economy where the land and its bounty remains so central to economic activity,whatever the environmental impact. Although around half the country is now covered by native title, that is rarely mentioned and still comparatively little of thevast wealth generated from the land flows to traditional owners.WhenAnthony Albaneseadded his squishy, lopsided signature to the president’s practised staccato on a multi-billion dollar deal to find, extract and process rare earths and critical minerals, he was in a long lineage of political leaders who have offered Australian resources to an ally.In this case, as in so many before, it came with the promise that Australia would be more than a quarry, of using the opportunity to develop enduring refinement and processing capacity to leave more than holes in the ground and the industrial infrastructure of extraction.Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal to take on China’s monopoly. Here’s what you need to knowRead moreIn the long history of such deals, it is easy to hear the echoes of the past.But one – the deal attorney general Billy Hughes negotiated during the first world war – leaps out for its extraordinary parallels. No doubt those banking on a “future made in Australia” are hoping that the rare earths and critical minerals deal will deliver similar fruits and also transform the economy into one that is more diverse and complex.In 1915, as the war escalated, Hughes attended an Imperial Conference in London accompanied by WS Robinson, chief adviser to WL Baillieu, head of the Collins House group of companies.Britain at war was in desperate need of the lead, zinc, silver and copper that Australia had in abundance. At that meeting Hughes and Robinson negotiated a deal that, over time, transformed the Australian economy and created extraordinary wealth for a handful of families.The British government agreed to buy virtually all the minerals produced by the Collins House companies. It was a deal that lasted until 1930, at inflated wartime prices.As a result, the Australian conglomerate was able to develop and expand lead and zinc smelters and acquire a copper refinery. The steady flow of money enabled the Collins House group to drive industrial development, and its activities soon extended to manufacturing fertilisers, beer, paper, cotton, rubber, sugar and paint, producing newspapers and even establishing an aircraft industry.Its dominance of Australian industry continued until the globalisation and deregulation of the economy in the 1980s saw many of the companies with roots in the Collins House group spin off and become international businesses or subsidiaries of even bigger global corporations.The parallels continue.Just as now the concern is that Australia is economically dependent on China to buy its resources, at the beginning of the war 80% of the metal extracted from Broken Hill was sold to German companies. This led to charges that Collins House was trading with the enemy, and a raid, on Hughes’ order, of the company by soldiers carrying bayonets. According to Peter Yule,W L Baillieu’s biographer, this helped focus his mind on new markets.At the time there was virtually no refining capacity in Australia apart from the lead smelter at Port Pirie, which Baillieu had acquired from BHP. Energy, then as now, was expensive. The Tasmanian government’s adoption of (renewable) hydroelectricity, changed this and made it possible to establish the zinc smelter at Risdon, outside Hobart.It is striking that these smelters, which grew initially as a result of the deal Hughes negotiated, haverecently received government supportto continue their operations.When commentators sneer at the use of government money for industrial development, it is worth remembering that it was always thus for what is now called “Team Australia”. What the Trump and Xi regimes have done is push this into the open, rather than hide behind the fiction of autonomous markets. Companies always respond to the settings governments establish and generally take any money on offer.The aim now is to ensure that these settings are such that they benefit us all, not just the chosen few members of the team sitting beside the political negotiators.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia.

By offering hope and not division we showed the populist right can be beatenRhun ap Iorwerth is the leader of Plaid CymruSat 25 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 25 Oct 2025 08.13 EDTSharePlaid Cymru’sdecisive victoryin the Caerphilly byelection proves that Labour’s century of dominance in Wales is over. Voters now face a clear choice between two very different futures, and Caerphilly shows that it is Plaid Cymru’s bold, inclusive vision that carries momentum.Caerphilly was one of the safestLabourseats in Wales. Many London commentators expected the seat to fall to Reform – perhaps even hoped it would. It would have fit the narrative that post-industrial communities naturally drift to the populist right. We proved them wrong. A message built on fairness, community and national purpose resonated with voters, and a comfortable majority voted for it.Reform UK threw everything it had at this campaign. Busloads of activists came from Kent. Their anti-refugee banners and billboards made local people feel uneasy and sought to pit neighbour against neighbour. Reform thought it could surf a wave of anger and fear, but people in Caerphilly saw through their cynicism. They rejected the idea that Wales should be used as a stepping stone for Farage’s next Westminster project.Plaid Cymru’s message of hope beat Reform’s hate. Where Reform shouted division, we talked about belonging. Where they peddled blame, we talked about community. That matters not just for us in Wales, but for progressives everywhere. The populist right can be beaten when people are offered hope and a vision of a fairer future.The result couldn’t be more damning of Labour. Eluned Morgan and Keir Starmer’s brand of managerial politics does not speak to Welsh voters any more. Labour once claimed to be thenatural partyof Wales. “Natural” parties die when they stop standing for something. In Caerphilly, decades of complacency caught up with them.People here no longer believe Labour represents their communities, their values or their ambitions. They see a party that has swapped conviction for calculation and focus-grouped slogans. The byelection result shows that Labour’s hold onWalesis gone.Winning almost half the vote was no statistical fluke. It was the result of thousands of doorstep conversations, a campaign powered by volunteers, a message grounded in belief, and the charisma of a local champion in Lindsay Whittle, whose decades of hard graft mean he is known and loved by people here.Conviction politics still works. Clarity and passion can defeat cynicism and drift.Momentum is now with Plaid Cymru. As we move towards a fully proportional Senedd, the possibilities for genuine, people-led government have never been greater. Caerphilly has lit a fuse underWelsh politics, and it is burning brightly towards 2026.Wales faces a simple choice. One path is regressive, built on resentment and division, dressed up in Reform’s slogans. The other is progressive, inclusive and confident, led by Plaid Cymru. The people of Caerphilly have already chosen, and their message will echo far beyond their constituency.There are lessons here for every progressive movement in the UK. You don’t defeat extremism by copying its language or trimming your values to fit a poll. You defeat it by standing for something real. When Reform tried to weaponise Welsh programmes that help refugees to integrate, making Ukrainiansfeel unwelcome, we stood up to them. We defended what is right and stayed true to our values.We are focusing on policies that will transform people’s lives, not just tinker at the edges. Our free childcare plan isworth more than £30,000in childcare costs in the first four years of a child’s life – the most ambitious in the UK. Our manifesto will be grounded in a recognition that too many in our communities have been left behind. We are determined to change that. Like Scotland, we will take real action to tackle child poverty through a new child payment. This is what bold, practical politics looks like – politics with purpose, ambition and heart.When voters see authenticity, they respond. Former Labour voters, and many who had given up on politics, did not come to Plaid reluctantly. They came enthusiastically. They saw a movement that reflects their aspirations and speaks their language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It shows that Starmer’s Labour, and Westminster politics as a whole, can no longer take Wales for granted. The old order of British politics is breaking down.Starmer’s cautious managerialism offers no answers to the cost of living crisis, the climate emergency or the constitutional question. People want more than competence. They want conviction. Caerphilly shows that Wales is ready to build the government it deserves, in the country it believes in.This was never about just one seat. It marks a shift in spirit. Caerphilly has opened a new chapter in Welsh politics. Hope has proved stronger than hate, belief has beaten cynicism.The people of Caerphilly have shown the way. Labour’s old Wales is fading, and a new, self-assured Wales is taking its place – one led by Plaid Cymru.Rhun ap Iorwerth is the leader of Plaid Cymru and the member of the Senedd for Ynys Môn.

Two remarkable works that have profoundly influenced me are James and Wounded, both bythe brilliant Percival Everett.I had the privilege of attending the Booker prize ceremony last year, where I was in the same room as Everett. Although he didn’t win for James, the reading by Nonso Anozie was both devastatingly moving and hilariously insightful. Everett is a masterful African-American author who captures the complexities of contemporary Black identity in the US.James by Percival Everett.Photograph: PicadorJames is a literary remix of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, told from the perspective of Jim, the enslaved character. It’s a funny and thrilling exploration of racism, slavery and humanity’s capacity for cruelty. Everett’s retelling allows Jim and his fellow plantation workers to communicate in a way that transcends the often parodic depictions of Black speech. The line, “Dey takes the lies dey want and throws away the truth dat scares ’em”, reflects a deep wisdom. This novel reveals that compassion, humour and kindness can be found in the most unexpected places. The transformative power of literacy shines through when Jim realises, “If I could see the words, then no one could control them or what I got from them.” This message should be shared with every child at the start of Black History Month.I’m equally captivated by Wounded, set in Wyoming, where John, a Black horse trainer, assists a young man ostracised for his sexuality. The story navigates heavy themes of homophobia and love with grace and humour. It’s beautifully written, and I eagerly await its film adaptation, but read the book first! Percival Everett continues to be a literary hero for me, embodying the wisdom that “If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not learning.”Pan-Africanism awakened my fascination with historyZeinab BadawiBroadcaster, journalist and president of Soas University of LondonA defining thought for me was the doctrine of pan-Africanism. That really awakened my interest in history, because I really would like to see history as part of that pan-African drive to unite the people of Africa and also people of African descent. History not only explains our past, it also defines our present.You can’t reduce the experiences of people of African descent to one narrative but there are more unifying factors than ones that divide. The main one is that there is nowhere in Africa that didn’t experience foreign subjugation in one way or another.If anyone exemplified that thought for me, it wasGamal Abdel Nasser, of Egypt. I choose him because he is seen as an Arab leader and yet he was also very firmly anchored in the concept of pan-Africanism. He even arranged a marriage forKwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister and president of Ghana, ensuringhe had a wife from Egypt, in a spirit of pan-Africanism and unity of the people of the continent.A lot of people tend to hive off the north of Africa and say it is part of the Arab world and not part of Africa proper – and Nasser countered that view. As someone who was born in Sudan, very much at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa – at least the northern part of Sudan where I am from – Nasser and Nkrumah helped shape my view of pan-Africanism.Winifred Atwell’s virtuosic musicianship was an early lesson in freedomYolanDa BrownSaxophonist, composer, broadcaster and chair of the British Phonographic IndustryI recently unveiled the blue plaque to the pianist and composerWinifred Atwell, and hearing the joyful bounce ofThe Black and White Ragplaying out in the street in front of where she lived brought it all back to life for me. I could feel the sparkle in her playing, precise yet playful, classical yet carefree. When I first heard her music, I was in my teenage years and completely intrigued. I learned that this vibrant sound came from a Trinidadian woman who had topped the UK charts in the 1950s, a broadcaster and entrepreneur too, opening one of the first Black hair salons in the UK.Atwell’s story speaks to possibility. A classically trained pianist who refused to be boxed in, she moved effortlessly between Chopin and boogie-woogie, and played everywhere from concert halls to variety shows. She was an elegant Black woman redefining what the piano and who a pianist could be.For me, Winifred Atwell’s music was an early lesson in freedom. She showed me that you could carry your heritage into any room and still fill it with your own voice. Her example whispered reassurance, as I began to carve my own path in music, blending jazz, reggae and soul … there’s space for all of it.Atwell played with joy that transcended boundaries. Watching old footage now, I see more than show-womanship – I see courage. She turned the piano into a meeting place of cultures, histories and hope. Through her, I learned that the most powerful statement you can make is to be unapologetically you.I strive to carry forward the flame of Jamaican activist Marcus GarveyNadine WhiteJournalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondentI first heard the name Marcus Garvey in the reggae songs my mum played throughout my childhood – roots tunes from Burning Spear and Culture booming through our small London flat. I remember thinking, “Who’s Marcus?” and being told stories about this great Jamaican man who taught pride and self-determination. I listened to my older brother, Sam, talk about his movement.Mum was a collector of Black art back in the day and bought a striking painting of Garvey that took pride of place in our living room. Within a Eurocentric society, that culturally Jamaican home was my haven … full of music, books and images that told me who I was and who I could be. I grew up literally watching Garvey.Later, I readColin Grant’s biographyof him, Negro With a Hat,and pored over Garvey’s speeches. Garvey was flawed like anyone, but his message – that we must organise, create and own our stories – shaped how I move through the world.His use of media as a tool for liberation still fuels me; when I asked the health secretary questions during a televised Covid press conference at Downing Street, it was the aforementioned portrait of Garvey that hung in the background of my home. When I make films or build platforms to amplify Black voices, I’m carrying that same flame. Garvey taught me that pride and purpose are not luxuries; they’re a responsibility.Marvin Gaye articulated my angst – and that of an entire generationGus Casely-HayfordCultural historian, broadcaster and lecturer, and the inaugural director of V&A EastI felt politics long before I understood what it was. Even as a very young child, I sensed something in the dignified rage of Muhammad Ali, I felt it in the defiance of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, the indefatigability of Arthur Ashe. Alongside their brilliance, I detected an epigenetic rage, something that felt old and raw and right – it electrified me, even as a child. And who could resist such exquisite, stately, controlled anger, channelled with forensic effect to offer deep, enduring, emotional and communal catharsis.My sister Margaret was, and remains, the most beautiful and inspiring person I have ever met, and on this particular afternoon she was looking the kind of cool that could have got her cast in an early Melvin Van Peebles movie. She was wearing a fawn suede waistcoat, a brown flowery shirt and her afro was fringed with the special sepia-tinted sunlight that warmed our south London living room on late summer afternoons.View image in fullscreenA mural of Marvin Gaye by the artist Dreph, Brixton, south London, 2021.Photograph: Matt Crossick/PAShe walked over to the radiogram – and dropped the needle on a track. The sound was turned way up – there were two seismic crackles that could have been heard in Tooting Bec, and then Marvin Gaye began: “Mother, mother”, It was a ballad, a prayer, an ode, a love song to a generation, a political tractus, a lament to what was lost – but most profoundly, it was a song for the rest of us.Our planet, hope, compassion were dying – and those that cared were not being listened to.It articulated the angst of a generation, it asked for love, reason, rapprochement – but it also asked something of you: that you stand up.Tupac Shakur’s poetry inspired me to call out inequalitySimone OrefuwaVice-president of the National Black Police AssociationMusic was a cornerstone of my upbringing – my father was a huge reggae and dancehall fan, always buying records. I’ve yet to meet anyone with as much vinyl as him! But when I discoveredYo! MTV Raps, I instantly knew I had found my genre. There was something powerful in the rhythmic storytelling, where words danced over beats.Rap music exposed me to the struggles of Black communities in the US and UK, where they spoke about poverty, racism, inequality, police brutality and broken families, while also rapping about resilience, hope and empowerment.The list of rappers I listen to is extensive, but for me,Tupac Shakurwas a musical genius and my favourite poet. Many of his songs are social commentaries on injustice and compassion. Changes highlighted the systemic oppression, the mental toll this can take and the need for social reform.Soulja’s Storycovered racism and police brutality experienced as a young Black man. Meanwhile, songs such asKeep Ya Head UpandDear Mamashowed empowerment for Black women while expressing vulnerability, tenderness and optimism.For me, rap was more than just the music, it was also about the fashion. I begged my parents for clothing from brands such asKarl KaniandCross Colours. I loved the baggy jeans, oversized tops, trainers/Timberlands and bandanas. It gave me a confidence to celebrate my Black identity and showcase Black designers.As I continue to listen to Tupac’s lyrics, I’m struck by how powerful his words remain today as we face the rise of the far right and misogynistic behaviour. Tupac inspired me to use my voice to challenge and call out inequality: something I’m proud to do now through my work with the National Black Police Association.The Hip-Hop Preacher taught me the true value of hard workMichael AkadiriDoctor and standup comedianI’ve long found “Monday motivation” – the posting of motivational quotes on Monday mornings – quite insipid. I understand the rationale; few are bullish about work on a Monday especially after a decompressing weekend. However, I’ve always queried the benefit a motivational quote will have if that desire doesn’t come from within.That’s until I came across American motivational speakerEric Thomas, AKA The Hip Hop Preacher,and his famous mantra“when you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful” a few years ago. A friend had shared a short clip of Thomas delivering this potent line and I suspect it was the forceful delivery, the pure emphasis on “breathe” that struck a chord with me.My medical background is perhaps the reason for this but, of course, you don’t need a medical degree to know breathing is essential for life. Immediately the internal interrogation began: am I pursuing my career goals with the sheer intensity that they’re essential for life? Am I leaving no stone unturned? Or am I cruising on talent and a bit of effort and hoping divine intervention will make up the shortfall? If I’m honest, it’s probably the latter.Yet my inner cynicism tried to rear its ugly head: “Technically, breathing is involuntary.” A deflection attempt made in vain. Deep down, I knew Eric was right. Being obsessive and determined have underpinned my successes to date. Thomas’s quote was a timely reminder that if I want to continue succeeding – within medicine, comedy or even both – I need to perceive accomplishments as being as essential as oxygen is to staying alive.The confidence and conviction of Mia Mottley showed me true leadershipShana MaloneyPriest in charge of St James church, Clapton, east LondonI grew up in Barbados with Mia Mottley as the most prominent female in the political and public life of Barbados – as the opposition leader – a familiar voice that carried across the island. You didn’t just hear her; you felt her influence in the way people spoke about possibility and in how young people, especially girls, looked to follow in her footsteps. Even as a child, I recognised and was drawn to her confidence and conviction – her belief that people could and should reach further. In some part of my young mind, I would tell people: “If Mia is opposition leader, then I will be the first female prime minister of Barbados.”View image in fullscreenMia Mottley speaking after her Barbados Labour party won a landslide victory in the country’s first election since it became a republic, Bridgetown, 20 January 2022.Photograph: Nigel R Browne/ReutersMia Amor Mottley is a barrister and politician who has served as the prime minister of Barbados since 2018 – the first woman ever to hold that office. She previously served as minister of education, attorney general and deputy prime minister, leading with intellect and a striking sense of purpose. Under her leadership, Barbados became a republic in 2021, marking a defining moment of transformation within the Caribbean.Like her, and possibly because of her, I studied law – drawn by the same pursuit of justice and service for others. My path later led to the priesthood, but both vocations and her example have taught me that leadership is about service and the flourishing of people. Though we don’t share the same political views, I deeply respect her clarity of thought, courageand commitment. Mia Mottley embodies leadership rooted in intellect, responsibility and compassion.The Supremes sparked my diva worshipJason OkundayeAssistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianThere’s a phenomenon among gay men called “diva worship” that is our veneration of female singers whose artistic style, lyrics, dancing and beautiful voices trigger a latent flamboyance or accentuate it. Over the years this figure in my life has taken many forms – Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, Whitney Houston. But the first divas I worshipped were the Supremes who, as a child, gifted me with a language through which to parse love and heartbreak well before I would come to know what position those emotions would have in my life.My favourite of the classics had always been their 1966 hit You Keep Me Hangin’ On – my childhood self, who would skip around the house singing it, couldn’t have known that it would become my go-to song whenever I wanted to be “set free” by yet another situationship who was sending me mixed signals or giving me hot-and-cold treatment. Then there was Baby Love and Stop! In the Name of Love (you can imagine me in front of the telly, left hand on hip, right hand in the air palm spread). But I loved the deep cuts too, from the sentimental to the smitten, which would prepare me for the pleasures and disappointments of love: Time Changes Things, It’s All Been Said Before, He’s All I Got. Buttered Popcorn, which allowed Florence Ballard to lead and showcase her commanding, soulful timbre (sadly when I tried buttered popcorn I was disgusted by it, though it spoke to my experience with greasy, sticky, salty men).I have no musical talent, but I think the Supremes were pretty formative to how I would come to approach prose – being sincere with emotion and feeling, and the stakes when you expose yourself to being bruised. So thanks for guiding my pen, and carrying me through heartbreak.The Black Panther soundtrack pushed me to make consequential workAthena KugblenuComedian and writerIf you’re not fanatical about the soundtrack to Eddie Murphy’s movieThe Nutty Professor, you must think Foxy Brown is a shade from Farrow and Ball. So what if the soundtrack had almost nothing to do with the film? It had everything to do with the tastes of the people who might watch actually the film. I didn’t mind that. That was its genius to me.Some 22 years later, watching the movie Black Panther changed my mind. Its final moments carry a powerful message of pan-Africanism that redeem Killmonger, the anti-hero. The revolution he wanted could be instigated by Wakanda after all. As the credits roll, this mesmerising notion is followed byAll the Stars by Kendrick Lamar and SZA. I realised this soundtrack has everything to do with the film, and a lot to say.View image in fullscreenLupita Nyong’o as Nakia, and Letitia Wright as Shuri in the 2018 film Black Panther.Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyAll the Stars is about the responsibility that comes with love and the consequences of achieving your dreams, a commentary on T’Challa’s story in the movie. The entire soundtrack is a conversation between Africa and the African diaspora, as is the film, layering trap, rap and R&B with South African artistry, reflecting where many of the film’s cultural references were drawn from.It can be adored by anyone who listens but demands intellect to truly understand. The biggest film franchise in the world made an album with one of the biggest artists in the world that rewards us for paying attention. Now, as then, in these “swipe early, swipe often” times, I find something deeply refreshing about this. This soundtrack is a reminder to me to make consequential work. Plus, it never reneges on its one requirement: the songs still have to slap. On the soundtrack to Black Panther, they do.My 25-year career in the NHS all started with reggaePaulette HamiltonLabour MP for Birmingham ErdingtonGrowing up in Handsworth, Birmingham, with very little, we were grateful for what we had. While we couldn’t afford the games other kids had, we had music and dance – not just any music, but reggae. This music did more than entertain us; it shaped the person I am today.I will always remember hearing Gregory Isaacs’sNight Nursefor the first time. That smooth, comforting rhythm drifted from my father’s radio and, years later, from my husband Dennis’s sound system as he DJ’d in our home. There was something truly transformative about that song. There are multiple interpretations of it, but to my mind, Isaacs sang of care, compassion, and being there for someone in their time of need, concepts that resonated deeply with my young mind.For me, a Black British woman, reggae was a cultural anchor. It connected me to my Jamaican heritage while giving me strength to face life’s challenges in Britain. When teachers dismissed children such as me, suggesting we were “only destined to have babies,” this music reinforced my sense of worth and ambition.Night Nurse became more than a song; it became a calling. Its lyrics about watching over someone and offering comfort and relief shaped the kind of nurse I aspired to be. It was the inspiration for my 25-year career in the NHS.Today, the music remains a powerful companion. It reminds me that from Birmingham to parliament, I’ve always been guided by one principle: true service means being present for those who need us, just like the night nurse in Isaacs’s timeless song.Seeing patois respected on the page transformed my TV reporting styleSymeon BrownReporter and journalist at Channel 4 NewsIn college I was one of those boring boys who refused to read fiction. I learned the error of my ways when a good friend suggested that I pick up Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. If that book enlightened me to the human revelations that only fiction can deliver, it would be Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners that changed me. The 1956 novel about the Windrush arrivals is a reflection of its characters: laid back, mischievous and the depth broods beneath the surface. It was the first time I saw patois respected on the page – the dialect is a forefather of my own multicultural London English. The connection has stayed with me even as a television news reporter. In a field that defers authority to softened received pronunciation my own cadence remains instantly recognisable and different.View image in fullscreenA production based on Sam Selvon’s book The Lonely Londoners, with Carol Moses as Tanty, Jermyn St Theatre, London, 6 March 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe Lonely Londoners is quintessentially a story about the original mandem too. Moses, Galahad and the boys were gyalis, hustlers and black aspirants in a racially hostile Britain. As the Windrush generation have been upgraded to “good immigrants” who “helped the mother country”, the balance provided in The Lonely Londoners and its nonfiction heir Journey to an illusion by Donald Hinds in 1966 constantly remind me that the good, the bad and the ugly of our stories must be told too.Finding The Lonely Londoners set off a bomb in me. The novel is a cornerstone of a black British canon that is far too invisible to black Britons themselves. It led me first to work in the Black Cultural Archives and then as a gatherer of black British stories as a news correspondent. If there is one urgency for Black History Month it must be to remember our forgotten canon. Read them. Watch them. Share them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then a scene in the TV show Kidding changed everythingAnonymous; As told toEmma LoffhagenSat 25 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareGrowing up, I was obsessed withJim Carrey. I was just entering my teens when The Mask came out, and I can still picture myself watching Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls on TV one weekend afternoon, absolutely howling at the silliness of it. His elastic facial expressions, the energy, the stunts – it was the perfect tenor of humour for a young boy.By the time I was in college, I had moved on to his more thoughtful films. The Truman Show was a favourite: still funny, but with a philosophical edge that spoke to me at the time. I loved seeing Carrey stretch into more serious roles, and as the internet made it easier to watch interviews, I came to admire him as a person, too.My cultural awakening: ‘Kate Bush helped me come out as a trans woman’Read moreWhich is why, when I found out he was doing a TV series called Kidding, I was thrilled. The idea of him playing a troubled children’s TV presenter was irresistible. I started watching as soon as it came out, not knowing that it would trigger a personal turning point.Around this time, I had started losing my hair. I was in my early 30s, which felt too soon. I thought I might start balding at 50, so I wasn’t mentally prepared. I’d always had thick hair, even wearing it long at university, so when it began to thin, I fought it. I tried combing it over to hide the bald spots, but eventually there was no hiding it. Every time I looked in the mirror I saw what felt like proof that I was getting old too early. It made me feel less attractive, as though something had been taken away from me.Then one night I sat down to watch Kidding. In the very first episode, Carrey’s character is fighting with his controlling father about the direction of his show. In a moment of frustration, he takes a pair of clippers and drags them from his forehead all the way to the back of his skull, ruining his perfect TV hair.I burst out laughing – but I also felt something shift inside me. What he did was was an act of liberation, of taking back control. And suddenly I saw my hair loss for what it was: not just a cosmetic issue, but something I’d let control me. I paused the stream, went to the bathroom, grabbed my beard trimmer and did exactly what Carrey had done. One long line straight down the middle. I looked ridiculous. I laughed for a solid minute, standing there, finally seeing the absurdity of how much energy I’d spent hiding those bald spots. Then I went back to the sofa and finished the episode, still with that stripe across my head. When the credits rolled, I went back and finished the job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The anxiety I’d felt every time I looked in the mirror was gone. I actually thought I looked pretty good. I had a nicely shaped scalp hiding under there! I couldn’t wait to show my friends. When I met them I wore a winter cap and did a dramatic reveal – every single one of them said I looked better shaved. Even my mother, who had struggled with the idea of her once long-haired son being bald, admitted she liked it.These days, I keep my head shaved most of the time, though occasionally I let it grow a bit. Either way, I’m comfortable with how I look. I still have plenty of insecurities – I think that’s normal – but I no longer feel as though I am ageing before my time. I know that there is social stigma around men balding, but I try not to let that affect me. I know that for every woman who prefers a man with a full head of hair, there will be someone out there who likes me the way I am.If I ever met Jim Carrey, I would thank him for teaching me to see myself in a lighter, sillier way. Losing my hair felt like something happening to me, something out of my control. But by laughing at it, by shaving it off on my own terms, I turned it into a choice, and that made all the difference.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Now he’s lining up projects with everyone from Ron Howard to Edgar Wright. Could he be Texas’s answer to Tom Cruise?Sat 25 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareThere’s that famous line in the first episode of The Sopranos, where Tony laments his place in the timeline. “Lately I’m getting the feeling,” he confides, “that I came in at the end. The best is over.” I know Tony was talking about the mindful joy of building an incredibly violent organised crime enterprise from the ground up – but lately I’ve been thinking about his words every time I watchGlen Powellgiving it 200% as a movie star. Glen Powell is Hollywood’s hottest mid-level actor; but because of the harsh realities of modern movie stardom, a lot of people still don’t know who he is. You get the feeling he’s coming in at the end of something.Yet barely a week goes by where I don’t hear of an uncast starring role – the bodyguard in the Bodyguard remake, the cybercriminal in the Matrix remake, the hot soldier in the Starship Troopers remake – and not think: tell you what, Glen Powell could do that for you. Glen Powell could deliver that. He’s not going to turn up late to set, he’s going to work harder than anyone else, he’s going to promote the arse out of it – and if all that can open a wormhole back to the era when literally everyone knew who movie stars were, then Glen Powell is sure as hell going to take the opportunity. He is, quite simply, a one-man cargo cult for Hollywood’s vanished primacy.View image in fullscreenJumper, trousers and shoes: Tom FordI’m kidding,of course. Because the good news, I discover as I sit with him, is that you can kid around with Glen Powell: actor, writer, proud Texan. And also: condimenttycoon, at a price point America can afford (more on that later, rest assured).“Truly, I don’t know how anyone takes themselves seriously in this job,” he laughs. And yet, so many do, Glen. “No, but I really don’t. It’s so funny. On every movie I literally sit there thinking: there is no way you can be a self-serious person and do this job well, because it’s so ridiculous.” It’s hard to disagree, thinking back to this morning’s photoshoot, where I watched Glen wearing an extremely expensive top-to-toe purple outfit while wiping the floor after a little accident by his internet-famous dog, Brisket. A beguiling fluffball, Brisket has attended a lot of premieres, and takes second billing to Glen – for now. You have to remember this is a dog-eat-dog business.In the flesh, Glen is chirpily handsome and category five amiable – a sort of Mickey Mouse Club version of James Dean. He’s about to open in Edgar Wright’s remake of The Running Man, based on the Stephen King novel – another of those dystopian fictions that sees society as a death game that are (for whatever reason!) having a long cultural moment. “I’ve watched everything Edgar has ever done,” Glen enthuses – and it’s fun thinking of him enjoying the lost British males of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and The World’s End, and then offering up his own all-American hunkdom to the Wright vision.View image in fullscreenPowell as Ben Richards in Edgar Wright’s The Running Man.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy Stock PhotoSo we’re in a big moment for Glen Powell – yet, simultaneously, he’s fully aware that being a major movie star is a different game from what it was last time this particular action title was on cinema marquees. (The year: 1987. The star: Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger.) “Yeah,” he smiles. “It’ll never be what it used to be.”We’re being brought takeaway pasta at a picnic table on the Paramount Pictures lot – perhaps fittingly, the last bit of Hollywood still located in actual Hollywood – and I’ve tactically ordered ravioli because it’s the least messy, and I’m worried about having 2ft of spaghetti trailing out of my mouth while I’m asking Glen Powell about the fracturing of shared contemporary culture. Glen’s gone for something involving significant amounts of one of those spiky lettuces that Americans have fancy names for. Could be dangerous.Anyway: the lost past. Glen likes to tell a story about the education he received around a decade ago onThe Expendables 3. (Important Glen Powell fact: he loves nothing more than an education, and is fully committed to meeting his heroes and learning everything about the business from them.) The Expendables is the franchise where Sylvester Stallone keeps getting a bunch of action stars of the 1980s and 90s together for one last job. On Glen’s iteration of the series, he was in the gang with Stallone, Harrison Ford, Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren and Antonio Banderas. The full action retirement community. “All those guys were really so great,” he remembers. “They were legends. And they were like: man, you’re doing this at thewrongtime …”Does he wish he were born in that earlier time (a bit like that stripe of modern British politician who secretly imagines they’d have been just the man for the bygone glories of the 20th or even 19th centuries)? “Look, every era of Hollywood has the sky-is-falling mentality. It was always better back then. But my favourite movies are, like, 90s, early 2000s. That’s what I grew up watching, and what made me come out here [to LA].”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIn Top Gun: Maverick (2020), with Daisy Edgar-Jones in Twisters (2024) and in Chad Powers (2025), starring and co-written by Powell. Photographs: Collection Christophel/Alamy; TCD/ProdDB/ Alamy; Daniel Delgado/DisneyHe’s certainly remade a few of them, or at least starred in modern reboots of them. His serious breakout was in 2022’sTop Gun: Maverickas Hangman, the spiritual heir to Val Kilmer’s swaggering Iceman in the original. Then there wasTwisters, a sequel to the mid-90s Twister, and now The Running Man, while one of the many projects in the pipeline is a Ron Howard movie about firefighters, which it’s hard not to feel is at least in the Backdraft extended universe. Surely one can teleport our entire culture back to the golden age of action stardom?But there’s also the other side to his career – movies such as the 2023neo-noirHit Man, co-written with Richard Linklater, which made some film snoots suddenly feel differently about him. And the small matter of his saving romcoms – twice – withSet It Up(2018,huge for Netflix), and 2023’sAnyone But You, where he starred opposite bombshell turned culture-wars lightning rod Sydney Sweeney, and served up a surprise box-office hit. That one came with a side performance of fauxmance, as the pair allowed the media to think they were maybe dating to promote the film (they weren’t). Meanwhile, he’s co-writtenChad Powers, a new TV sports comedy for Hulu – and just wrapped on Ghostwriter, a fantasy film for JJ Abrams. It’s quite the mix.Tom Cruise told me: you’ve got to have skin on the line. You’ve got to show up for the audienceView image in fullscreenJumper: Tom Ford“If you meet my family,” he explains, “you’ll probably see why.” (Vital Glen Powell fact: Glen Powell is utterly devoted to his parents, Glen Sr, an executive coach, and Cyndy, a homemaker and frequent cameo in his movies. Ditto the two sisters he falls in the middle of – Leslie is a musician, and Lauren has just given birth to her second set of twins). “This would be a family where you go see a Yankees game and a Broadway show in one day. I loved Gene Kelly, and I love Bruce Willis.” But they were homebodies, too. “Oh yeah. You go to the ranch in Texas, and the kitchen – that’s where all life happened.”And you love romcoms. “Well, I grew up with sisters, and so many female cousins – the women in the Powell family really run the roost. I mean, my dad took my mom’s last name.” Well, fancy that. “Right? But actually there’s something about romcoms. A lot of actors tell me their favourite movies and I’m, like, that’sdark. I always like movies that are rewatchable, that fill you up.” Comforting things? “Yeah, comforting things. I sort of like escapist things, where you’re not pulling people’s energy, you’re giving them energy. And that’s what romcoms are to me.” He can quote Legally Blonde in its entirety. In fact, because of the meeting-his-heroes thing, Glen made it his business to connect with Karen McCullah, the great romcom writer who gave us Legally Blonde. And then he knew just who he had to introduce her to. “When my family met Karen McCullah, it was like they were meeting the Beatles.”View image in fullscreenPowell and his family attend a Hit Man premiere, 2024, in Austin, Texas.Photograph: Rick Kern/ Getty Images for NetflixEven so, movie romance feels endangered. There was astudy saying intimacy on screen had decreased 40% since the millennium. Glen, I’m worried hot people aren’t getting it on in the movies as much as they used to. “Is that right? Why do you think that is?” I dunno. Changing tastes in a disinherited generation? I tell him I noted the last scene of Twisters seemed to be him asking for Daisy Edgar-Jones’s informed consent to even phone her. Although, I read they did film a kiss but the directordidn’t use it. “I blame myself,” Glen cackles. Just botched the kiss? “I tried! I did my best!”You see, he looks like this alpha, macho, watch-loving guy – but he’s always out there subverting it. Maybe that’s the Glen Powell special sauce (not the actual sauce; we’ll get to the sauce). “I mean … it’s not a conscious thing. You know, I grew up with big dogs. And when I was going to adopt a dog, I went to look at big dogs. But then I liked Brisket. A little fluffy, cute, part-chihuahua was not in the plan – but we found each other.” I realise Glen reminds me a lot of the oldAthena posterof the hot, shirtless guy holding the baby. If you’re my age or over, you’ll remember it. If you’re younger, all I need to tell you is that this was the biggest-selling poster of the 1980s and made the photographer so much money that he bought a plane.Having said that, Glen’s vibe wasn’t ringing the tills for a long while back there. He dropped out of his University of Texas degree in Spanish and early American history. (Of course – of course – he is now completing this degree aged 37, remotely, while shooting films. Glen Powell sees things through. Also, it would make his mother really happy.) He moved to LA with the kind of charmed introduction that must have felt like he was 10 minutes from stardom: Denzel Washington, who’d cast a teenage Powell in The Great Debaters, hooked him up with his agent, Ed Limato. At which point … Glen settled into a long, long period of rejection and disappointment. I heard he flunked auditions for Han Solo and Captain America? He pauses to dentally extract a particularly lengthy piece of lettuce. “Now, you’re talking about the big ones. But I also failed a lot of auditions for really bad jobs. Like, some bad roles.” So you had range? “Oh yeah, I had real range in my failure. I didn’t get cast in some really bad movies, too.”Things took a serious downward turn when Limato diedin 2010. Glen still remembers exactly where he was when he got the call that the agency was dropping him. “I knew that would be the beginning of a really tough road. You had a guy who was the top of the food chain, and he was really looking out for me. But when he died, and I got let go, I knew I was in for a scrappy little run.” On the plus side, those agents will be massively kicking themselves now? “Oh, I talk to some of them – they’re still friends of mine. But I do give them shit about it,” he confirms with a twinkle. “You have to.” But maybe not becoming famous in your 20s is good? “Oh man, I think it’s really good. Honestly.” We then have to pause for the extraction of a piece of lettuce so big it needs its own trailer.One thing Limato managed to do for Powell before he died was get him a job reading scripts for the late producer and writer Lynda Obst, responsible for movies from Sleepless in Seattle to Interstellar. He adored it. “It was a really cool thing. She was one of those really special producers. You know, Texans have this really weird thing – ”Sorry, wait – you’re from Texas?“Ha! I haven’t told anyone … Break the story that I’m Texan! But, listen, Texans really do take care of other Texans.” (Even honorary ones do – Obst was born in New York, but had made a home in Texas.) “She was a Longhorn! So I got to go and sit on the Sony lot and read scripts for her. I was the fastest reader by far. I did three scripts a day.”You’re not going to see me talk politics. But movies – that’s how I express myselfView image in fullscreenJacket: Brioni. Polo shirt: ZegnaFlash forward several years to Tom Cruise offering him a role in Top Gun: Maverick, and Glen is (a) broke, but (b) really knows what he needs from a script. And somewhat bizarrely, given (a), he almost didn’t take the part of Hangman, summoningthe confidence to push back against the original script until Cruise reconfigured his character’s place within in it. “But doing it that way was the greatest decision I ever made. It could have been me sitting on the sidelines, kicking my heels, thinking: ‘Man, I burned a few years.’ But it was the best film school. The fact that Tom is such a close friend now – when I got Running Man, he was literally my first call. I said: ‘Dude, you’ve been doing this for decades.’ He has picked up every trick in the book. And he’s so generous – I thought I was going to talk to him for 10 minutes. He stayed on the phone for two hours plus.”Give us a peek at the Tom Cruise trick-book, then. “He’s like: ‘Tell me some of the stunts you’re doing.’ I said: ‘OK, I’m jumping off exploding bridges, falling off roofs.’ He said: ‘Are you running at night?’ Yes. ‘OK, that means you’ll probably wrap at five in the morning. Don’t do any sprinting shots at five in the morning. Your body’s going to be out of whack and you’ll get hurt. They’re always going to do a wetdown at night.’” (A wetdown is when the crew hose down the ground both because the reflections look cooler in the dark, but also because it hides tyre skids or footprints or whatever for continuity.) “So Tom says: ‘That’s fine if you’re running straight. If you’re taking a corner, no.’”This is when meeting your heroes saves you a torn knee ligament. What else? “He goes: ‘If you’re hanging 11 storeys up, make sure people see how high you are. Make sure the shot reflects depth and dimension. You are selling the fact thatyouare doing these things.’”Something a lot people say, in these days of endless CGI, is that there’s a kind of empty feeling when you know it was all just done on green screen. It doesn’t really connect. Is this why Tom Cruise – and now you – want to do as many as possible of your own stunts? “Right. It really sells it because if the audience know that you are in peril, there is an inherent investment. I believe you have to give the audience their value in the ticket. If people are actively going to the theatre, getting a babysitter, maybe doing dinner, you’ve got to justify that ticket price. And that’s what Tom always talks about – you have to have skin on the line. If they’re showing up for you, you’ve got to show up for them.”But bingo cards at the ready, because the next movie Glen will shoot will be something he co-wrote with Judd Apatow in which he shows up as … a country singer. “I’ve always been so nervous to sing,” he admits. “I was obsessed with Elvis as a kid. And my little sister used to sell girl scout cookies, and there was a honeysuckle bush next to our house. And for everyone that bought one of her cookies, I gave them an Elvis song. But I couldn’t sing in front of them, so I hid behind the honeysuckle bush and sang.” Oh Glen. I think I just OD’d on Americana. Will Judd Apatow be providing you with a honeysuckle bush? “No! I have to do it in front of everyone.”It seems as good a time as any to say that I wonder if it’s hard being all-American in such a divided America? “Yeah,” he exhales. “I’m not a political person. I like things that bring people together.” Sure. But it feels like you’re the type of actor who wants to be for everyone, and that’s getting so much harder now there are fewer parts of culture enjoyed by both sides, as it were. Take something like late-night television, which back in the glory days of David Letterman was TV watched by everybody, of all political leanings, but is now perceived to be siloed for only one side. (And that’s what remains of late-night. Soon after this interview, Jimmy Kimmel wastemporarily yanked off air.) Maybe action movies are one of the last bastions of truly shared American culture?“That’s a good point. There’s a universal language of action, which is also why those movies translate so well internationally. Running Man is about something universal – what you would be willing to do for the people you love? But also how people can feel powerless in the face of a world that feels more and more unequal, more unfair. So, you’re not going to see me talk politics. But movies – that’s how I express myself. Movies are a conversation; politics always felt to me like two people trying to prove a point.”View image in fullscreenWith Sydney Sweeney at an Anyone But You premiere, 2023.Photograph: John Lamparski/ WireImageUnfortunately and undoubtedly, though, the erosion of shared mainstream culture makes that conversation smaller than it was. I say to Glen that it’s as if there are fewer and fewer people who everyone is permitted to like, no matter what “side” they’re on.The Rock’s one, and maybeTravis Kelce. He agrees. Of all the people coming up to big-time stardom in recent years, I would have picked him and Sydney Sweeney as having that kind of broad appeal. Except now, Sweeney’s beenmired in a raging culture war, after some people decided a denim advert in which she participated was … I can’t quite believe I’m typing this, but it is, after all, 2025 … eugenicist. Something to do with “good jeans” and “good genes”, apparently – but, please, don’t dig further. Every second spent on it would make you stupider.Put politely, I tell Glen, I thought this was bullshit. And yet, I don’t think people in the business came out to defend her. Is it because it’s just a relief that the firestorm isn’t happening to them at that moment? Or is it a form of cowardice? A pause. Not lettuce-related. “I think people weighed in on it,” he says of the Sweeney firestorm. I don’t, I say. I think she was left to twist in the wind. “But I think people are aware that it’s bullshit.” Yet they didn’t say that publicly. “Look, in an era in which businesses are evolving and are seeing their mortality in front of them, sometimes they are desperate to make anything run. Whether it’s true or not, whether it hurts anyone – there is no accountability any more.”View image in fullscreenCoat: BrioniI think he’s talking about the news media and how it operates in a digital age – because if you think Hollywood is past its heyday, then it’s got nothing on journalism. Back in the day, stars gave reflective, candid interviews, and those discussions sat relatively isolated in magazines and colour supplements or on evanescent episodes of celebrated talkshows. But these days, people want a news line or six out of an interview, and they want to put it in the headline, even though they know it’s going to get scraped and clipped from here to kingdom come by every clickbait news website out there, within moments of it dropping online.And this is why celebrities don’t want to say anything eye-catching in interviews any more. This is why we can’t have reflective things. Any star, any author, any musician – anyone in the entertainment business these days who sits down to an interview has one overwhelming goal: tonotmake news. I tell Glen I can see why people would never really want to offer an opinion, because then you’ve got three days of “Glen Powell Wades IntoSydney SweeneyDiscourse” headlines, and it’s a nightmare and a distraction and it gets in the way of the work you want to do. Is that what it feels like? Another pause.“The sad part is you do have to separate yourself,” he sighs. “You can’t get caught up in it – it has nothing to do with you, it has to do with ad dollars. And, you know, there is no course-correcting. If something’s false, you’re not actually setting the record straight, you’re just feeding the beast. That’s why I don’t say shit – just let it come, and let it go. Not feeding the beast and not trying to fight anything. I’ve realised the smart people in Hollywood don’t try to fight anything that has nothing to do with them.”And yet, when all eyes were on Jimmy Kimmel’s return after that controversial suspension, who should turn up as his very first guest? Why, I do believe it was Mr Glen Powell, bringing a smile and a care package of warm anecdotes, and declaring straight out of the gate that he was “honoured to be here”. And who should be pictured shortly thereafter at Sydney Sweeney’s space-themed birthday, wearing a hilariously cheap Nasa astronaut costume that I refuse to believe he didn’t buy on Amazon? Well, you get the point.Still, he must fear it’ll be his turn to be in the woodchipper for something one of these days? “Oh, it’s inevitable. It’s not an if, it’s when. It’s been an adjustment. I try to be honest, work really hard, and treat people well – that’s how I try to move through my life. Inevitably, you’re going to catch some strays. But that’s the nature of the job and I’ve watched it happen to other people.”Tangentially, it strikes me that “the job” has morphed beyond anything it was in the past. Remember whenMark Wahlberg’s routinedropped online, and it involved him getting up at 2.30am for the first of several workouts, as well having to incorporate meetings, prayer time, and the conflicting demands of family interaction andcryo-chamber recovery? Glen laughs. In the modern style, even he is capable of giving a detailed explanation of the type of physique required for Ben Richards, his character in The Running Man. “He works in a factory, he’s a guy whose body is like a tool. So I wanted him to be strong and durable – blue-collar strong, but not like he goes to a gym.” Needless to say, this requires a significant amount of time in the gym.I love acting. The exhausting part, the part that throws me, is when I’m in the real worldView image in fullscreenJacket: Louis Vuitton. Watch: OmegaIt must be weird – you get into this job because you like the feeling of acting, and the bit where you’re doing that specific thing ends up being a small fraction of your time, around all the meetings and photoshoots and endless workouts and whatnot. Perhaps this is why, for all his easy charm, Glen has flipped to finding movie sets the sane places of the world. “Do you know what’s hit me in the last little bit? I love acting. I love the process of bringing a team of people together and we all come together and make something really cool. I’m not exhausted by that – it’s fun. But the exhausting part, the part that throws me, is when I’m in the real world right now. On a movie set, you have your head down, you’re collaborating with people, it feels very ordinary. But the part that I’m getting used is this other thing.” Fame? “Yeah. I’m still figuring it out.”He has, at least, figured out how to shift a load of ketchup. As mentioned, the modern actor has to be very diversified. So, back in April, Powell launchedSmash Kitchen, a range of organic ketchups and mustards and mayonnaises, ideal for pairing with the great Texas cuisine of barbecue. It has already sold more than a million units in its first three months and is expanding at pace. As for where it’s sold? Walmart, obviously. Cheapest sauce in the range is under two dollars, nothing costs more than five. I mean, it’s too on the nose, and yet unavoidable – Glen Powell wants to be mass market, both as a movie star, and as a sauce mogul. “Sauce mogul! Sauce mogul! I have not heard that before …”Maybe the best thing success has brought him, apart from unlimited condiments, was the right to move back to Texas, and escape from LA. “When this town feels like Hollywood is happening here, there’s nothing better. And when it’s not, then … it’s a harder place to live. But I always wanted to go back to Texas. That’s where my family is, that’s where my friends are. I have friends here, but I can bring them back to Texas.” As he points out, it helps that Hollywood “decentralised overnight” in the pandemic, because of Zoom, self-taping, a general cultural shift. “It’s no longer a brick-and-mortar business.” It’s no longer a lot of things, but it’s great that Glen has conquered it sufficiently to be allowed to WFT (Work From Texas).Which about wraps us up, bar my minor panic that the interview has not, in fact, recorded. The problem, I tell him as I fiddle doubtfully with the recording device, is that I don’t do many interviews. In fact, I honestly don’t think I’ve done one for more than a decade. “That’s a long time! Who was it?” I think it was a politician called Nigel Farage. “Nigel Farage?” says Glen. “I haven’t heard of him.” Well, short answer, it’s just possible he’s going to be prime minister of the United Kingdom one of these days. So what this logically means, Glen Powell, is that in around 13 years you’re going to have to drop what you’re doing … “and be prime minister! Ha!”Listen, in a darkening world, we can only live in hope.The Running Man is in cinemas on 12 NovemberExplore more on these topicsGlen PowellAction and adventure filmsSydney SweeneyComedy filmsRomance filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This time, instead of heading back to the city, they decide to extend their holiday for a month longer – something that seems to unsettle everyone in the nearby town. All pass on the same veiled caution that nobody has ever stayed at the lake beyond Labor Day. Nonetheless, the Allisons are determined to remain, and that’s when things start to get increasingly weird. The man who delivers the kerosene won’t sell to them. No one will deliver groceries to the cottage, and when the Allisons attempt to drive into town, the car won’t start. A storm gathers, the batteries in the radio fade, and as darkness falls, “the two old people huddled together in their summer cottage and waited”. What are the Allisons waitingfor? What do the locals know? Every time I read Jackson’s unnerving and inspiring story, I’m reminded that the best horror comes from what’s left undisclosed.Saltwashby Andrew Michael Hurleyis published byJohn Murray.Mariana EnríquezRinging the Changes by Robert AickmanIn this short story a couple travel to an ordinary seaside town where bells ring the whole time, a constant chiming that is annoying and inexplicable. The first very scary scene happens at night, when they decide to take a walk and they can’t find the sea. There’s sand, there’s the smell of rotting fish and salt, there are waves, but the sea is a ghost, or something else and worse. It’s just insanely sinister and every time I go to a beach at night I think about this story that ruined the sea at night for me – in a good way.The newlyweds – she’s very young, he’s not – go back to the hotel and find out why the bells ring, in a long sequence of claustrophobia, necro-orgy and death-and-the-maiden meets danse macabre pandemonium. It’s an unnerving meditation on desire and decay, two bodies aging together as a couple, the attachment and violence and tenderness of marriage.Not only the scariest, but probably one of the best short stories out there, and a personal favourite. I read it in Spanish, in the first edition of Aickman stories to be published in Argentina in 2011, La aparición, edited by Matías Serra Bradford and translated by Agustín Pico Estrada and Laura Wittner.Somebody Is Walking on Your Grave by Mariana Enríquez, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Granta.Catriona WardView image in fullscreenZombie by Joyce Carol OatesI read Zombie by a pool in France in 2020. Despite the sunshine I felt cold creep through me. I also felt the electricity of excitement. I was writing my third novel,The Last House on Needless Street, and I had hit a wall. I didn’t know if there was any good way to write some of the fearful things the book contains. Reading Zombie, I saw that it was possible.Published in 1995, the novel is a dark flight through the mind of a young serial killer, Quentin P, based on Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer who murdered and dismembered 17 young men and boys in Milwaukee between 1978 and 1991. Infamously, Dahmer was obsessed with creating a zombie sex slave who would never leave him and made many grisly attempts to do so.The acts the novel describes are horrific, but equally frightening is its psychological persuasiveness. Quentin P’s terrible, fragmented world is simply narrated in spare prose, names redacted. The reader is sunk deep, trapped in his consciousness, forced to witness thoughts and actions that appal. The foreignness of his mind is like a physical shock – or being stranded on a barren alien world. Going into Zombie is less like reading than a full body experience. You are swallowed whole.Nowhere Burning by Catriona Wardwill be published by Viper inFebruary 2026.Daisy JohnsonView image in fullscreenWhite Is for Witching by Helen OyeyemiWhen I was a child, I sleepwalked and later started having night terrors. Once, the terror involved a dream in which I was stuck in a box and, when I woke up, I found that I had torn off the slat from the window, trying to get out. That house was crumbling; when it rained heavily the downstairs hall filled with water, fly larvae fell from the ceiling on to my parents’ bed, and once a large rat scaled the curtains in my sister’s room.When a friend gave me Helen Oyeyemi’s novel,I was no longer living with my parents, but the story of the house high on the Dover cliffs felt familiar to me, homesick as I was. It is a novel about a haunted, noisy, emotional house and a girl who eats chalk from the cliffs. I loved the book so much and returned again and again to it, always finding something new.The Hotel by Daisy Johnsonis published by Vintage.Ned BeaumanInfinite Jest at 20: 20 things you need to knowRead moreIncarnations of Burned Childrenby David Foster WallaceIf you were ever swapping scary stories around a campfire, and everyone else was talking about ghosts and ghouls and hitchers with hooks for hands, but when your turn came you adjusted your spectacles and said, “Actually, I think nothing is scarier than the thought of a parent accidentally harming their child” – well, you probably wouldn’t get invited camping again. Which is why I was reluctant to select this David Foster Wallace story about a baby getting burned by boiling water. It is not appropriate for Halloween; it will not give you anything resembling a delicious shiver down your spine. But the fact is, no other piece of fiction I have ever read, supernatural or otherwise, has haunted me like this one has, so it would be dishonest to pick anything else.And that’s despite my not being a parent – which, indeed, Wallace wasn’t, either. So, who knows, maybe this is just a bachelor’s idea of what hurting your child might be like, particularly since it first appeared in Esquire magazine, between an ad for hair-loss cream and another for Marlboro Lights. But for me, this story isn’t only about parenting, it’s about the possibility that out of sheer random chance you might become culpable for something that ruins someone else’s life as well as your own. In that sense, it may not look like horror fiction but it certainly functions as horror fiction.Also, Wallace was a Stephen King fan and put his novels on the syllabus when he taught college English, so as you read this scene of a mother and father tending helplessly to their maimed little son, it’s reasonable to wonder if Wallace had Pet Sematary at the back of his mind.The Captive by Ned Beauman, writing as Kit Burgoyne, is published by Titan.Stephen Graham JonesView image in fullscreenThe Girl Next Door by Jack KetchumHumans are the worst monsters. You never know what’s going on in your neighbour’s basement. But sometimes you do, and sometimes you’re part of it … It’s summer for some kids in 1950s suburban America, but instead of having a mystery to solve, a monster to put down, they have to face the darkness in themselves, and then live with that new awareness.You come out the other side of reading this book a different person, never mind if you liked it or not. This isn’t a novel you’re reallysupposedto like, yet it has a moral centre all the same. The question is: do you think that way too? Even for a glimmer of a moment, do you identify with someone here? The best art is dangerous and doesn’t flinch. This is that.The Buffalo Hunterby Stephen Graham Jonesis published by Titan.Hollie StarlingView image in fullscreenI Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonA century after humanity’s extermination, five people remain on Earth, kept alive and tortured for the sadistic pleasure of an omniscient supercomputer. Don’t be put off if you’re not a sci-fi reader; neither am I. Let me put you off another way. I first read the story in the waiting room at Doncaster station where my train home from university was often cancelled, meaning the two purgatories are sensorily wedded, like a madeleine made of melted eyeballs. I felt my tender brain plasticise around Ellison’s descriptions, sick and gleeful at being made toactuallyconsider “the smell of sulphur, of rancid butter … of human scalps”. I hated it then for what I couldn’t un-know. I hate it now because Ellison wrote it in one sitting without edits. His exquisite vision of synthetic hell is afirst draft.Reading it back, I find the camp excess very funny, but the famously nihilist ending is still the most frightening thing I’ve known. The horror of forces beyond our control – whether savage god, hostile landscape or distorted ideology – jangle my nerves more than any flimsy old ghost and was chief in my mind while putting together Bog People, a new collection of folk horror. My own contribution, Yellowbelly, also intersects with tech incrementalism but – I have no trouble admitting – pulls back from the brink. More dark parable, less dark night of the soul. A rail replacement bus to Scunthorpe is horror enough.Bog People: A Working-Class Anthology of Folk Horror, edited by Hollie Starling, is published by Chatto & Windus.Eric LaRoccaView image in fullscreenThe Auctioneer by Joan SamsonSamson wrote only one novel in her lifetime. In a sharp, corrosive story that predates Stephen King’s masterpiece Needful Things or Shirley Jackson’s seminal The Lottery, The Auctioneer is a chilling descent into the hell of small-town madness as a result of greed and paranoia.Set against the bucolic backdrop of a small community in the hills of New Hampshire, the story centres on a charismatic figure named Perly Dunsmore who arrives in the town of Harlowe and charms the unsuspecting townspeople into donating personal items for a community auction. As his grip on the community intensifies, Perly’s demands of the residents become more and more disconcerting. It is a wonderfully chilling meditation on the erosion of a close-knit community by an outsider with malevolent intentions.I think what continues to disturb me about this novel is how so much of the horror is grounded in reality. There are no obvious supernatural elements at play. Instead, it’s centred around human cruelty and suffering.We Are Always Tender With Our Dead by Eric LaRoccais published by Titan.Intan Paramaditha‘She wrote the best first line – and the most chilling stories’: Stephen King on the dark brilliance of Daphne du MaurierRead moreUrban legendWhen I was a child in Indonesia, I heard an urban legend that terrified me: if you didn’t rinse and properly wrap your menstrual pad, a ghost would come for you. The story went that a girl once left her pad unwashed in a toilet. When she returned to fetch a forgotten ring, she found the door ajar. Inside squatted a woman with long black hair, her back to her. Slowly, she turned. A pale face, lips slick red – and in her hands, the girl’s unwashed pad. The ghost licked it clean.That vision haunted me, but years later I understood it was more than a ghost story. It was also a lesson in shame, a way of disciplining girls’ bodies, teaching us that blood was dirty, dangerous, in need of secrecy.It inspired me to write Blood, published in my collection Apple and Knife. In the story, the narrator must confront the same cautionary tale told by her Qur’an teacher. As an adult copywriter in Jakarta, she is tasked with selling sanitary pads by casting menstruation as monstrous. Memories of becoming a woman and the relentless policing of her body collide with a vision of the ghost who appears in the office toilet, licking menstrual blood.Horror, for me, exposes how society treats women’s bodies as abject, shameful. Writing Blood was a way of reclaiming what had once made me afraid. The ghost still lingers, but now she walks beside me, her mouth red, her hunger reminding me of demonised, unruly, disobedient women.Apple and Knife by Intan Paramaditha, translated by Stephen J Epstein, is published by Vintage Classics.Paul TremblayTiptoe by Laird BarronView image in fullscreenRandall Vance is a photographer who grew up in the 1960s, the youngest of two children in an upper-middle class family. His enigmatic father, an engineer for IBM, liked to play a game called “tiptoe”. He would sneak up on his sons and pinch them. Sounds harmless enough, right? But his father never lost, never got caught, and the game represented his rather Darwinian philosophy that hinted at a secret ocean of menace. Maybe.First appearing in the Shirley Jackson tribute anthology When Things Get Dark, Tiptoe works, on one level, as a clever homage tinged with the wicked wit and everyday weirdness of a Jackson tale. There’s fraught family dynamics that are quaint and deeply dysfunctional. There’s class anxiety mixed within the ugly spectre of American history. There’s even an eccentric aunt who makes believable claims to being psychic. While there is nothing expressly supernatural in the story and no scenes of explicit violence on the page, I’ve never had a story get under my skin in the way Tiptoe does. It picks at one of our oldest, hardwired fears, that of being the unwitting prey to a predator that we are not equipped to avoid.Barron got my nervous leg twitching on the second page with “What I do know, is he was the kind of guy nobody saw coming.” It’s a chilling tone-setter to a story that becomes more ominous with every page. That line and all the unspoken hints and secrets are there, queuing up behind you, somewhere over your shoulder, there to see plainly if you only dare look. And in the last two breathtaking pages, Laird makes you look.Horror Movie by Paul Tremblayis published by Titan.CJ TudorView image in fullscreenDoctor Sleep by Stephen KingI spent most of my childhood being scared. I was scared of the dark, monsters, ghosts. I was scared of the derelict playground up the street, the house opposite where someone killed themselves. The list was long, random and inexhaustible.Despite this, I was also attracted to creepy stuff. I would watch horror films at my friend Kirsty’s house and read any scary books I could get my hands on.When I was trying to think of a book that scared me, I considered Stephen King – The Shining and Pet Sematary. But then I realised that those were books that had scared me as a kid. They didn’t hit so hard as an adult. Because your fears change.That’s what brought me to Doctor Sleep. The sequel to The Shining was published in 2013, the same year I had my daughter. And as a parent your greatest fear is something happening to your child.In Doctor Sleep the monsters of the book are the True Knot, a quasi-immortal group that hunts and kills children with the “shining”. Psychic vampires, they feed on the life force of their young victims. One of those victims is a young boy called Bradley Trevor who is abducted by the True Knot.King never describes in detail what they do to Bradley, but one line always haunted me: “The boy lasted a long time. He screamed until his vocal cords ruptured and his cries became husky barks.”I thought about that. A lot. My mind kept going back to it. Gnawing over it.The Gathering by CJ Tudoris published by Penguin.Alma KatsuView image in fullscreenThe Road by Cormac McCarthyThis is hands down the most realistic dystopian novel ever written. The unrelenting despair and undeniable reality of the world Cormac McCarthy has depicted will drive an icy spike of terror into your heart with every page. This will be us, your inner voice tells you, if the world doesn’t change.Adding to the verisimilitude, I was on a road trip with my husband when we listened to the audiobook. I’d had a rough idea of what the novel was about but not the specifics. With every mile, as the story got bleaker, I waited for my husband to tell me “enough”. He’s not much for fiction, let alone anything as dark as this, but we listened to every word.McCarthy does not tell us why civilisation ended, though – because the main characters are heading south to escape the killing winters, it’s been attributed to climate change. Does it really matter? A clever touch of the author’s is that the only characters you encounter are “have-nots”. There might be “haves” hunkered down on private islands stocked for survival, a truth for the modern day, but we don’t see them. The author knew, I think, that when the world has been laid to waste, through either stupidity or malice, you will only be a “have” for a matter of time. Time runs out for everyone, too late to see that we’re all in this together.Fiendby Alma Katsuispublished by Titan.Explore more on these topicsBooksHorror booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That in-between time was, he wrote, “a time of monsters”.Those words, a “time of monsters”, could be used to describe the period of death and destruction unleashed in the two years since 7 October 2023, in the narrow strip of land comprising theGazaStrip. If the deal reached betweenIsraelandHamasthat wasbrokeredbyDonald Trumpcontinues to hold, it raises questions about what type of future awaits the lands between the river and the sea – an Israeli-government and settler-controlled land mass that both Israelis and Palestinians inhabit, which represents Israel’s apartheid-based one-state reality.So what is next? The continuation of the apartheid regime? A two-state solution where one state has no or limited capacity to function? More Israeli military occupation? An accelerated Nakba that more methodically expels Palestinians from the land? A new colonial presence where some foreign entity or individuals are the de facto interim rulers?Or, eventually, something else – something requiring a transformation of existing relationships through a new process, one taking us firmly beyond our time of monsters.When theceasefire dealwas struck, theLos Angeles Times,in an article on reactions in Israel, quoted Udi Goren, an Israeli celebrating at Hostages Square whose cousin was killed on 7 October. Israel needed new faces to make change, he told the reporter: “Now is the time for us – Israelis and Palestinians – to support a better future, to draft a new narrative for ourselves.”A new narrative seems hard to imagine, given the last hundred or so years of history. But there are moments when transformation becomes possible, when changes on the ground can rupture longstanding beliefs and biases, and a new political and social set of relations make possible what for so long seemed impossible. We are nowhere near that moment, yet change is happening, including shifts in opinion, new political realities, and a far more expansive global solidarity movement forPalestinethan ever before.The possibility of such rupture and transformation is an underlying premise of Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man and Sarah Leah Whitson’s book, From Apartheid to Democracy: A Blueprint for Peace in Israel-Palestine. Published just days before the ceasefire deal was reached, the book describes in granular detail the conditions for dismantling apartheid in Israel-Palestine.Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson have been deeply engaged on the ground for years. Schaeffer Omer-Man, the former editor of +972 Magazine, and Whitson, who has been a human rights lawyer and former advocate at Human Rights Watch, both currently work at Democracy for the Arab World Now, which focuses on reformingUS foreign policyin the Middle East and north Africa from a human rights perspective. The group was founded by the former Washington Post columnist and Saudi democracy advocate Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by Saudi assassins seven years ago.When I first learned about Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson’s Blueprint concept a few months ago, I was skeptical given the horrific genocide unfolding inGaza. The intent of the titular blueprint is to “design the process for dismantling Israel’s military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and dismantling its regime of apartheid”. To do so, Schaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson created an actual working document for a transition that would end apartheid and establish the basis for democracy in Israel-Palestine. This will not occur, they argue, in the next day, nor the next month, nor the next year. It can happen only after a process that brings about a pivotal rupture that provides the basis for something new.We don’t know what that rupture will entail, but the ground has been laid over these last two years. Perhaps a shift in attitudes about Israel and Palestine in the US and Europe will finally bring about the end of arms sales, or expanded boycott initiatives. Perhaps bodies such as the international court of justice will bring new forms of pressure to bear – pressure that the diplomatic community decides to enforce. Such developments could combine with mass movements outside Israel, making international isolation so extreme that Israel will be forced to reconceive its underlying structures of inequality in order to rejoin the community of nations.Five of the best books to understand the Israel-Palestine conflictRead moreSchaeffer Omer-Man and Whitson are realists: apartheid rule is deeply entrenched, functioning in many ways beyond Israel’s military occupation through an entire system of laws, practices and norms that creates and maintains a system of domination, including in pre-1967 Israel. These laws affect everyday life, they write, including: “political representation and organization, free expression, land use, ownership, zoning and other property-related matters, immigration, personal legal status, including family law; access to natural and economic resources; the provision of state services and benefits; policing and security; institutionalized distrust and permanent suspicion of non-Jewish citizens and residents and others”.They conclude: “Simply ending the occupation and extending the existing legal framework to the occupied territories is wholly insufficient for dismantling apartheid.”In each of these areas, the blueprint provides a map of how to begin to dismantle a deeply unequal system and move toward meaningful democracy in Israel-Palestine, whether through a single democratic state, a confederation or even two states connected to each other, with both populations engaged in a democratic process to select the preferred option. One area where such a transition is fundamental is the freedom to move or remain in place, they write, as restrictions on movement, they argue, are one of the central tools the apartheid regime has used to manage the Palestinian population.The authors look to South Africa and Northern Ireland, both of which saw political change that had seemed unimaginable. Relying on those examples, the blueprint identifies a multilayered process of co-conciliation, reparations and the creation of an inclusive political framework.The book was published before the ceasefire was reached, but it is fair to say that the deal is not going to pave the way for the blueprint anytime soon. We are not yet at the point of rupture. Once we get there, it may reveal that new narrative that the blueprint will help shape.Robert Gottlieb is professor emeritus at Occidental College and the author of more than a dozen books, including, most recently, Care-Centered Politics: From the Home to the Planet (MIT Press)From Apartheid to Democracy: A Blueprint for Peace in Israel-Palestine is out now (University of California Press, $26.95)Explore more on these topicsPolitics booksIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineGazareviewsShareReuse this content"

But forget the ghosts – this is really just a golden opportunity to weep with laughterSarah DempsterSat 25 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareAfull moon looms, a synthesiser gulps and – dun dun duuuuuuuun – we’re off to HMP Gloucester in a Skoda Octavia with Daisy May and Charlie Cooper’s NightWatch (Sunday 26 October, 9.30pm, BBC Two). Why HMP Gloucester? Because theformerVictorian prison is, according to our hosts – the titular, Bafta-winning siblings behind peerless mockumentaryThis Country– “supposedly haunted as hell.” A fitting setting, then, for the first episode of a series that finds lifelong paranormal enthusiastsDaisy May(39) andCharlie(36) stuff their slippers into the aforementioned family hatchback and set off to spend a night bickering and farting “in some of this country’s spookiest places.”An opening montage offers further elucidation. “Some people want to climb Everest,” explains Charlie while a theremin trembles over footage of the actors staggering like concussed Wombles through a succession of night-time locales. “We just want to see a ghost.” “Yeah,” agrees Daisy May, peering at us over her brother’s shoulder. “We just want to see a ghost.” As do we. Alas, years of low-resolution ITV2 series in which crestfallen celebrity ghost-hunters shout “I think it was just the wind” in abandoned branches of Wetherspoons have prepared us for disappointment. Will NightWatch break with tradition and offer viewers definitive proof of the supernatural? Seems unlikely! Anyway, we must park this question, for now, at the gates of HMP Gloucester, for here is former prison manager Clive, whose sudden appearance in a deserted corridor is met with bellows of terror. “Clive?! OH GOD,” roars Daisy May from the depths of her camouflage-print ankle-length puffer coat. “We thought you were AN APPARITION.”The mood (intense bewilderment punctuated by sudden bursts of deafening panic) thus established, Clive – who is not AN APPARITION but merely, as stated previously, Clive – proceeds to guide us around his ex-workplace. HMP Gloucester was built in 1792, he tells us, and closed in 2013. It was the site of several outbreaks of typhoid and 123 prisoners were hanged within its now-peeling walls.“Grim,” murmurs Charlie, a gentle and faintly embarrassed soul who delivers a string of sad one-liners – “sustenance”, “if walls could talk,” etc – in the manner of a minor uncle at a family wake.While Clive plods off into the night, the siblings prepare for beddy-byes in a tiny cell on A Wing. What happens next? Everything and nothing. They order a takeaway. They go to the toilet. Charlie calls Daisy May’s collection of crystals “glorified gravel.” She tells him to stop farting. They tiptoe around like Shaggy (Charlie) and Scrappy-Doo (Daisy May); she emitting sporadic honks of alarm at the prospect of an appearance from a long-dead inmate; he patiently suggesting she “bring it down a notch” (you imagine this is something he’s been asking her to do, futilely, for decades).They discuss the time Charlie and their dad chased a burglar down the street while wearing nothing but their pants. “It was back when Mum bought our underwear,” recalls Charlie. “F&F,” nods Daisy, sadly. “You know when the elastic’s completely gone?” continues Charlie. “They were just … loincloths. Flapping around.” They weep with laughter and Clive’s warnings of ghostly “knocks and whistling” fail to materialise.It’s at 11.58pm, when Daisy May announces she “might put some fake tan on,” that the penny finally drops: this show isn’t about ghosts at all! Just asMortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishingis more about the intimacy and ease of middle-aged friendship than the presence of carp, so NightWatch uses its “wooo, ghosts” hook as an excuse to spend time with the Coopers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Images of tables laden with trappings of a lavish meal steps away from the antiquities also raised ethical questions, she railed.“The safety, integrity and ethics of the monuments should be the main concern of theBritish Museum… once again it is exhibiting provocative indifference,” she said.Guests at the gala, which raised more than £2.5m for the museum, were treated to a drinks reception in the museum’s Great Court before the evening’s highlight – dinner within view of the fifth-century BCE carvings – in the Duveen Gallery. A silent auction was also held throughout the evening.View image in fullscreenAkshata Murthy and Rishi Sunak.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageBut on Thursday many in Athens were of the view that the gala’s greatest achievement had been to bring relations between the museum and the Greek government to a new low at a particularly sensitive time amid efforts to resolve the cultural row over the sculptures. For decades,Greecehas been campaigning for the artworks to be reunified with other pieces that once adorned the Parthenon.As outrage intensified, ever more officials sounded ever more indignant.The speaker of the Greek parliament, Nikitas Kaklamanis, rebuked the British Museum for deciding to “cover Greek culture in the shade of Barbie” while lambasting the “provocative use” of the sculptures as a “tourist attraction”.“At a time when the Parthenon sculptures, born in Athens 2,500 years ago, are patiently awaiting their return to the homeland … the British Museum lays out provocative, lavish tables in the Duveen Gallery with our sculptures as a backdrop,” he said, deploring the institution’s “cynical” goal of “raising money for its own benefit”.Carved by Phidias, Pericles’ master sculptor, the antiquities embellished the Parthenon’s monumental frieze before their removal in highly contentious circumstances by Lord Elgin, England’s ambassador to the Ottoman empire, more than 200 years ago. Bankrupted by his endeavours, Elgin then sold them to the British government in 1816.View image in fullscreenJerry Hall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Elizabeth Jagger and Sir Mick Jagger.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for the British MuseumNikolaos Stampolidis, general director of the Acropolis Museum, whose upper gallery has been custom-made to display the sculptures within view of the monument, said the “tasteless” episode provided incontrovertible proof, once again, that the masterpieces needed to be reunited in the place where they were carved.The British Museum declined to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In fact, the Black Swan started out as one, with Banks working behind the bar of his family’s pub before graduating to the kitchen. In 2023, he opened the Abbey Inn in Byland, and he has recently launched a hospitality arm dedicated to restoring other pubs across the UK. First up is the eight-bedroom General Tarleton in the village of Ferrensby, near Harrogate. Food, naturally, is top notch with polished takes on pub classics made with local produce (steak and Black Sheep ale pie; burgers made from Dexter beef from the Banks’ farm) – the perfect fuel for walks along the river and into the Nidd Gorge, a local beauty spot.Doubles from£175 B&B,generaltarletonferrensby.co.ukThe Bat and Ball, OxfordshireView image in fullscreenIt’s dogs by the fire and dog collars at the bar at this charming pub in the village ofCuddesdon, best known for its clergy college. It was opened at the start of the year by the owners of theLamb Innin nearby Little Milton, and the chefs at both outposts cut their teeth at two-Michelin-star Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons down the road. The Bat and Ball is the more casual of the pair – there’s even a dart board – and dishes take typical pub fare (sausage and mash; ham, egg and chips) and dial them up with carefully sourced local ingredients. The five bedrooms have walls painted in rich autumnal shades to match the surrounding countryside, which is sandwiched between the Cotswolds and Chilterns.Doubles from£140 B&B,batandballcuddesdon.co.ukKing’s Arms,Lake DistrictView image in fullscreenThis family-owned pub, which reopened at the end of August, is at the heart of the Lakeland village ofHawkshead, around the corner from the Beatrix Potter gallery and the Hawkshead Grammar School museum, where a young William Wordsworth carved his name into his desk. There’s plenty of history in the oak beams and slate floors at the King’s Arms too, which dates back to the 17th century. Behind the dark-wood panelled bar is a roster of local beers including Coniston Old Man Ale and Cumbrian Ales Loweswater Gold, while the food leans towards classic with Cumberland scotch eggs and beef wellington. Just the thing to be tucking into after a stomp up nearbyLatterbarrowfell.Doubles from £145 B&B,kingsarmshawkshead.comThe Wellington at Boscastle, CornwallView image in fullscreenKnown affectionately as The Welly, this centuries-old coaching inn overlooks Boscastle harbour on the rugged north Cornwall coast. St Austell Brewery recently splashed millions doing it up, and it shows in the cosy dining rooms, snugs and stained glass panelling. The pick of the bedrooms are the two in the pub’s turret with freestanding baths, but all 14 come with local art on the walls and OS maps and a South West Coast Path national trail book for walks. The path runs right outside: west to Tintagel Castle, birthplace of King Arthur according to legend, or round pastPentargon waterfalleastward. After a coastal hike, there’s pints of Proper Job by the fire (plump for the sofas in the Chart Room) and plates of fish and chips to look forward to, made with local catch in Gem Ale batter.Doubles from£145B&B,wellingtonhotelboscastle.comThe Woolpack Inn, HampshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jake EasthamFresh from a makeover by influential interior designer Nina Campbell, this country pub is the centre of life in the tiny hamlet of Totford in the tranquil Candover valley. It is surrounded by fields and woodlands, so head chef Luke Stradling has plenty of local produce to draw on – supplemented by the pub’s large kitchen garden, right now filled with pumpkin, celeriac and winter leaves. As well as supplying almost all the vegetables on the menu, the team also donates 20% of the harvest to local charities and homeless shelters. Upstairs, eight bedrooms are named after game birds, but it’s fly fishing that’s the local star draw – casting for trout in the world renowned chalk stream of the River Itchen.Doubles from£100 B&B,thewoolpackinn.co.ukThe Fleur de Lys, DorsetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dave WattsPub and restaurant firm Chickpea has nailed the modern country pubs with rooms formula – great food, friendly bar and keen prices for overnighters. The latest addition to the fold is the Fleur de Lys, a 17th-century inn in the village of Cranbourne. The novelist Thomas Hardy was a regular guest here and makes reference to it in Tess of the D’Urbervilles. The revamp reflects its period charm: hops hang over the large open fireplace, candles flicker on tables and, upstairs, the nine bedrooms are decorated in muted colours. Walking routes loop around Cranborne Estate, with dishes such as Brixham sea bass, venison barnsley chop and sticky toffee pudding to look forward to back at the pub afterwards.Doubles from£120 B&B,fleurdelyscranborne.co.ukThe Penny Bun, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jake EasthamNamed after a mushroom found in local woods, the Penny Bun is a departure from your traditional boozer. With its clay-plastered walls and palette of earthy browns, the look is more wabi-sabi minimalism than brass beer pumps. Between Ilkley and Otley in the Yorkshire Dales, the recently opened pub is part of the Denton Reserve, a 1,012-hectare (2,500-acre) estate undergoing a sustainably led transformation, shifting to carbon sequestering and regenerative farming. It provides many of the ingredients found on the menu at the Penny Bun, such as Tamworth pork croquette salad or gnocchi with roasted garden beetroots. The calming aesthetic particularly suits the five bedrooms (the plum one comes with a freestanding bath), with deep beds to sink into after walks across Ilkley Moor, right outside the front door.Doubles from£180room-only,pennybunilkley.co.ukThe Ship,NorfolkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Patricia TobinThis summer, Sisters Siobhan and Caitriona Peyton rebooted this historic coastal inn with nine beamed bedrooms in the village of Brancaster. The cooking here has a light Mediterranean touch, and while menus have one eye on the sea (less than a mile’s walk away), game from local estates is the star turn in autumn. For Sunday lunch expect whole pot-roasted venison shoulders served with local wild mushrooms instead of the usual chicken or beef, while in the front bar settle in by the fire and tuck into a mangalitza pork sausage roll or monkfish scampi with a pint of Moon Gazer Ale. Outside, Norfolk’s big skies look especially arresting at this time of year – look out for flocks of migrating pink-footed geese – and walks cut through dunes and salt marshes.Doubles from£145B&B,theshipbrancaster.ukThe Leicester Arms, KentView image in fullscreenAcross the road from the entrance to medieval Penshurst Place and Gardens, this Grade II-listed pub is looking prettier than ever after a £1.2m revamp last year. It’s easy to see why it scooped Kent’s county prize at the 2025 National Bar and Pub Awards: there are deep leather armchairs by the fire in the bar, real Kentish ales from nearbyLarkins, and cut-above cooking in the dining room. The menu focuses on local produce, with Kent lamb scotch egg and Whitstable oysters, while the 11 botanically named bedrooms are decorated in an attractive heritage style. Four of them come with rolltop baths for post-walk soaks after a ramble around the Penshurst Estate past the River Medway, lakes and giant oak trees.Doubles from£150B&B,theleicesterarmspenshurst.co.ukThe Swan,West SussexView image in fullscreenThe two-and-a-half year refurbishment of this Grade II-listed coaching inn in Fittleworth on the edge of the South Downs was worth the wait. Original features from its 14th-century roots mix with stylish comfort in the bar, restaurant and 12 beautifully designed rooms – though it remains “proudly old fashioned”, says owner Angus Davies. Meals served in the wood-panelled, painting-lined dining room draw on seasonal local produce (foraged ceps and fresh plum pudding on our visit) and lavish breakfasts are served in the barn in the pretty gardens. The old visitor books are fascinating: notable guests include JMW Turner, John Constable and Rudyard Kipling. There’s plenty to do nearby, from antique shopping in local villages to walks on the Downs,Petworth HouseandArundel castle.Doubles from £195B&B,swaninnfittleworth.comThe Nevill Arms, LeicestershireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clive Doyle PhotographyWith its honeyed hamlets, pretty market towns and rolling countryside, the Welland valley is in a part of the country sometimes referred to as the Notswolds (similar to the Cotswolds but without the price tag). The Nevill Arms in the village of Medbourne was revamped in 2023, with 10 bedrooms (some with four-poster beds) spread between the pub and its converted stables – and next year they’ll add a three-bedroom stone cottage next door too. On the food front, beef, pork and lamb are reared on the owner’s farm, while in the inky blue-painted bar there’s a rotating line up of Langton Brewery beers on tap – the most popular of which is an amber bitter,Inclined Plane, named after the canal lift at nearby Foxton Locks.Doubles from£155 B&B,nevillarms.co.ukNew Inn Yealand, LancashireView image in fullscreenYoung couple Ben and Lauren Sandiford took on the running of this seven-bedroom village inn in April. Ben brought his chef experience to the kitchen, which now turns out classy comfort food (shepherd’s pie with mash and ewe’s cheese crumb; beef and ale suet pudding) to be eaten in the beamed dining room beside the log burner.

The pair, who grew up nearby, had earned their stripes in Michelin-star restaurants (Fiddian-Green as chef, Winch as restaurant manager and sommelier) and gave the Merry Harriers a suitably foodie injection, but not enough to scare away loyal locals (wisely they didn’t dispense with the Saturday meat raffle). Local ingredients – some from Fiddian-Green’s family farm in the Wintershall valley – are magicked up into bangers andcolcannonwith onion gravy or autumn-favourite pheasant schnitzel. The four bedrooms above the pub have had a muted makeover; six more overlooking the garden will get some love this winter.Doubles from£140B&B,merryharriers.comThe George at Hathersage,Peak DistrictView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tom Hodgson PhotographyFollow in the footsteps of Charlotte Brontë on the 5½-mile trail that loops from the Peak District village of Hathersage, tracing places she included in Jane Eyre. It starts at the George, where Brontë arrived in the summer of 1845 by stagecoach, as does her heroine on her way to Thornfield (modelled on nearby North Lees Hall). The George has had a few facelifts since then, most recently last year after storm damage, but its link to the famous novelist holds, especially in the Lady C Suite (one of 24 bedrooms), where it’s said Charlotte stayed. A morning a dip in the 1930s outdoorHathersage lido(heated at this time of year) makes a refreshing start to the day; the George’s full English breakfast a more leisurely one.Doubles from£93B&B,thegeorgehathersage.comAncient Shepherds,CambridgeshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jean-Luc BenazetIn the village of Fen Ditton, three miles outside Cambridge, the Ancient Shepherds’ Grade II timber-framed building dates back to 1540. It became the village pub in 1805, and remained so until chef Mark Poynton introduced “accessible” fine dining in 2020. With a new owner, but Poynton still at the helm in the kitchen, it reopened in July, with four bedrooms at the back. Tasting menus have been chosen to reduce kitchen waste (£35 for three courses, £55 for five, £85 for seven), with dishes such as monkfish crudo, and venison loin and haunch with star anise carrot. It’s a lovely three-mile stroll along the Cam to central Cambridge, or amble the other way to the thatched village of Horningsea for an ale at the Crown and Punchbowl.Doubles from£94room-only,ancientshepherds.comThe Gaskell Arms, ShropshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon Whaley Landscapes/AlamyThe medieval market town ofMuch Wenlockhas a fascinating claim to fame. In 1890, French aristocrat Baron Pierre de Coubertin visited to learn from, and take part in, the town’s Olympian Games in his quest to revive the ancient Greek Olympics, which returned to Athens six years later. Wenlock’s Olympian Games still take place each year, and a trail tracing their history leads to the 17th-century Gaskell Arms, where opening day speeches were once held. The 14-bedroom pub was taken over by new owners this summer and it’s a fine spot to recover after other arduous endeavours – such as a hike up the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge – with pies and pints of Shropshire-brewedHobsons ale.Doubles from £92 B&B,gaskellarms.co.ukThe Royal Forest,LondonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nick SmithOn the edge of Epping Forest (a 10-minute walk from Chingford station), this blue-blooded pub is next door to the timber-framedQueen Elizabeth Hunting Lodge, built on Henry VIII’s orders in 1543. A few hundred years later, Queen Victoria stayed at what was then the Forest Hotel, giving the name the regal upgrade. The 28-bedroom landmark is now part of the fast-growing, Raymond Blanc-backed Heartwood Inns group, which reopened it last year with William Morris-style fabrics in the guestrooms, and sustainable-sourcing a priority for menus. Sunday roasts with bottomless trimmings are the fuel for rambles in some of Epping Forest’s 2,400 hectares – theConnaught Water and Chingford Plain circularis an almost five-mile loop through ancient oaks and beech trees.Doubles from£119 B&B,royalforesteppingforest.comSCOTLANDThe Taybank, PerthshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: PR ImageIn the idyllic village of Dunkeld, the Taybank is a gorgeous spot for a winter break.

With a noon check out as standard, relax with breakfast in bed in one of five boutique bedrooms. The breakfast hampers include croissants from nearby bakery Aran, homemade granola with jam, cheese, Great Glen charcuterie and fresh juice.

At the Plockton Inn feast on the region’s seafood – langoustine are the speciality, known locally as Plockton prawns. Cheerful rooms above the pub or across the road have been refreshed recently with works by local artists. The village is a brilliant base for walking, whether a short stomp up to Càrn na Frith-Àird for views of Applecross and the Isle of Skye, or a coastal meander to Duncraig Castle along the shores of Loch Carron. Plockton is also just a 20-minute drive from Eilean Donan Castle and the bridge to Skye, making a day trip to the island an easy option.Doubles from £99B&B,highlandcoasthotels.comThe Shoregate,FifeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ailsa SheldonThe Shoregate reopened in 2022 after a major restoration, creating four spacious rooms above the 18th-century village pub and restaurant. The dining room has views down the brae to the sea and feels cheery in any weather, decked out in turquoise and orange. The menu includes generous helpings of local produce, such as Scrabster cod and East Neuk surf clams in curried bisque. From here you can join theFife Coastal Path –it’s just over 4 miles to pretty Anstruther, with views across the Firth of Forth to the Isle of May and Bass Rock. Stop for fish and chips, then retrace your steps to the Shoregate for a seat by the fire in the cosy back bar.Doubles from £200B&B,theshoregate.comKnipoch House Hotel,the HighlandsView image in fullscreenThis 15th-century hunting lodge near Oban was refurbished in 2024 and has a new fine-dining restaurant, 1635. Legend has it that the Thane of Cawdor was murdered at Knipoch House in 1592, inspiring Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Today it’s a calm and peaceful spot, with elegant bedrooms that have a view over the loch. Sink into comfy sofas in the spacious bar, and dine at 1635 (tasting menu, £99) or in the main restaurant for lamb rump with haggis, stone bass with leeks, or pub classics (burgers and steaks).

Now leased and run by the community, with a full buyout in the final stages, there’s no better way to support the local economy. Stay in simple spacious rooms, and eat venison burgers and bowls of mussels in the bar – and catch a music session if you can. From the inn, walk through the woods to Samalaman beach, and keep an eye out for seals. For a longer walk, continue to the end of the road at Smirisary, then follow the rough trail to beautiful white sandy beaches with views of Eigg and Rum.Doubles from£175 B&B,glenuig.comScotland entries written by Ailsa SheldonWALESY Castell, CarmarthenshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nate WarlowTheHeart of Wales Lineis a single track railway that trundles from Shrewsbury to Llanelli on Wales’ south coast, past ancient castles and beneath swooping red kites.

Once a drovers’ stop and coaching inn, the pub was reopened last summer by new owners, who completed six freshly decorated bedrooms this spring.

The Bryntirion’s six simpler bedrooms are each named after a nearby peak in the Eryri national park, which could read like a holiday hiking challenge: Yr Wyddfa, Tryfan, Cnicht, Cadair Berwyn, Elidir Fawr and Arenig Fawr. The pub itself is filled with motoring memorabilia (vintage tyre signs above the kitchen pass; the rear of a classic Mini emerging from the wall), while former Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons executive chef Luke Selby takes over the food at the estate in January, injecting his flavour to menus that already lean heavily on local ingredients such as meat from Bala butcher TJ Roberts and vegetables grown five minutes down the road.Doubles from£140B&B,thebryntirion.co.ukGlan Yr Afon/Riverside, Eryri/SnowdoniaView image in fullscreenPennal village.Photograph: Keith Morris Aerial Imagery/AlamyWhen Pennal’s village pub came up for sale in 2022, funds came from far and wide – including from Cardiff-born actor Matthew Rhys whose father had grown up nearby – to help the community to buy it. More recently, the pub on the banks of the River Dyfi scooped the top prize at the Countryside Alliance Wales pub of the year awards and has added four serene bedrooms upstairs. Walkers will love it here – theWales Coast Pathruns through Pennal, and it is on the southern fringes of the Eryri national park.

Pub classics (scampi and chips; mac and cheese) are served alongside pints from the Robinsons Brewery, such as the full-bodiedGolden Dragon Ale(Cwrw’r Ddraig Aur). Llangollen is well worth a potter to browse its antique stores and indie bookshops, and the short walk up to the remains of Castell Dinas above the town starts right outside the pub.

He described “side dishes of ailing sweetbreads in white poultices” and “apothecaries’ powders in rice for curry”. Fortunately, after a few changes of hands (most recently to the Inn Collection Group, who gave it a refresh in 2023) the critique doesn’t stand today. While the Bull’s listed bar is still filled with artefacts from its 500-year history, the menu runs from sides of black pudding bonbons to rich lamb massaman curry. For more history, Edward I’s unfinished masterpiece, Beaumaris Castle, is just at the end of the road, or simply pull up the drawbridge and settle in by the fire in The Bull’s lounge with a dram ofPenderynsingle malt.Doubles from£105 B&B,inncollectiongroup.comNORTHERN IRELANDThe Harbourview Hotel,County AntrimView image in fullscreenCarnlough’s historic Londonderry Arms became the Harbourview Hotel when this inn on theCauseway Coast, in the north-west corner of the country, was recast as Ireland’s first “destination whiskey hotel”.

Warming stews (Guinness-braised daube; traditional Irish lamb) will line the stomach for a round or two of whiskey-based cocktails.

He took them camping and on cycling trips, and he raved about them to friends. Slowly, they became a pantry staple for us. When I have the time, I like to batch-cook my own curry sauce and freeze it, but when there isn’t time, we love this meal. It feels embarrassingly easy to make, because the cubes bring all the flavour, and also quite fancy at the same time thanks to the egg yolk. We love it, and I hope you will, too.Japanese curry rice with soy-marinated egg yolkIf you want to make this vegan, just drop the egg. The most readily available brand of curry cubes,S&B Golden Curry, usesRSPO-certifiedsustainable palm oil in its products, but, if you’re keen to avoid the stuff, I’d recommendEmma Basic. Don’t throw out the egg whites; zip-lock them and save in the fridge or freezerto make a meringue.Prep15 minCook45 minServes44 tbsp light soy sauce, plus 1 tbsp extra4 tbsp mirin4 egg yolks(optional)350g short-grain rice½ tsp salt4 tbsp rapeseed oil1 brown onion, peeled and sliced150g shiitake mushrooms, sliced2 carrots(200g), peeled and finely diced300g green beans, cut into 1½cm pieces4 mild Japanese curry cubes, finely chopped10g fresh chives, very finely choppedIn a small bowl, mix the four tablespoons of light soy sauce with the mirin, then gently lower in the egg yolks and leave to marinate.Put the rice in a saucepan with 490ml cold water, add the salt, cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, leave to cook for 10 minutes, then take off the heat and set aside, still covered.Meanwhile, in a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil on a medium to high flame and, once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for five minutes, until soft. Add the mushrooms, cook for another five minutes, still stirring, then add the carrots, the extra tablespoon of light soy sauce and five tablespoons of water. Cover and cook for five minutes more. Add the beans, cover again and cook for four minutes. Stir through the curry cubes until they melt, then scoop the cooked rice into the pan (I find a spaghetti spoon useful for this). Cook, stirring, for another six to eight minutes, then take off the heat.Spoon a quarter of the rice into a bowl, pack it down, then invert on to a plate. Repeat with the remaining rice. Use the back of a spoon to make an indent in the top of each mound of rice, then, working one by one, lift the egg yolks from their marinade and place one on top of each portion of rice. Finish with a generous sprinkling of chives and serve.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou Be The Judgelive.
