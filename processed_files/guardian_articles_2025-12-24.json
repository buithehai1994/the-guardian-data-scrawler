Be warned, though: it verges on horror – young kids may well be terrifiedLucy ManganWed 24 Dec 2025 17.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 17.32 ESTShareIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a family gathered around a roaring yuletide screen must be in want of a ghost story. Since 1968, therefore (or a couple of years earlier, depending on whether you count the precursor Whistle and I’ll Come to You, directed by Jonathan Miller – and who am I to tell you nay?), the BBC has sporadically provided one in the form of the Ghost Story for Christmas series. These days, it is an annual event, delivered as a half-hour adaptation by Mark Gatiss of a spooky short story from the Victorian or Edwardian archives, which gives us some shivery distraction and provides some lovely actors with gainful employment of a not too onerous kind in the lead-up to Christmas.To begin, the recent reboot of the series comprised mostly adaptations of Gatiss’s greatest love, MR James, but there has also, as befits the co-creator of Sherlock, been one by Arthur Conan Doyle (Lot No 249). Then, last year, it was derived from a tale by E Nesbit-yes-that-E-Nesbit from the days before she was pulling in royalties from The Railway Children, and the Psammead wasn’t even a glint in Edith’s eye.This year it is the turn of EF Benson. A prolific writer, Benson is best known as the author of the Mapp & Lucia books, but he often wrote what he called “spook stories” for magazines. Gatiss has chosen The Room in the Tower, written and published in 1912, and reset it (partly at least) during the second world war.Roger Winstanley (Tobias Menzies, an understated actor who always makes you lean in and is perfectly cast in a part made up largely of whispered dread) is making stoic small talk with a stranger, Verity (Nancy Carroll), as they shelter in a tube station during an air raid. Does she dream, he suddenly asks her. She does. “Have they ever come true?” And we slip back to his childhood as he begins the story for which “I can find no explanation at all”.View image in fullscreenNice to see it again … The Room in the Tower: A Ghost Story for Christmas.Photograph: BBC/Adorable Media/Joe DugganSince he was a schoolboy, we hear, Winstanley has had the recurrent dream/nightmare that he arrives at the house of a schoolfellow, Jack Stone, and is ushered into the garden for tea with Jack’s black-gowned mother Julia (Joanna Lumley), his father and a couple of other relatives. There is utter silence until he is told by Julia: “Jack will show you to your room. I’ve given you the room in the tower.” Young Roger is filled with inexplicable terror but there is no escape. Jack shows him to the room, leaves him there – and he would always wake up just before he discovered what awful fate awaits him.Eventually, Roger tells Verity, it was succeeded by a slightly different version: Julia was no longer there in body. Her voice, and the same feared instruction, however, remained and the rest of the hated dream continued to its usual end.In the most recent dream, Roger has joined his jolly friend John Clinton (Ben Mansfield) for a game of tennis and John invited him back to his house for tea. Guess what? Yes indeed – they drive up to the house of Roger’s nightmares. He rallies when he sees that the family assembled on the lawn for tea is not Jack Stone’s but a far more cheerful and rambunctious group, surrounded by welcoming guests. All is well until the matriarch (this time played by Polly Walker) announces that – guess what again! Those of you who have already remembered that “Jack” is a nickname for “John” will be ahead of the pack (I had to look it up, and if you wish to escape the festivities at any point in this exhausting season, do Google it and give yourself 10 minutes of etymological satisfaction). But, yes, indeed comes the line. Jack will show him to his room. She has put him in the room in the tower.Benson’s twist, plus Gatiss’s further turn of the screw (although we should save that description until he gets to Henry James), round off the atmospheric half-hour nicely – although you could argue that we are now entering horror rather than ghost story territory; if you are gathered for a family viewing, it may cause the youngest members to recoil. Once again, like an inoffensive second cousin round the Christmas table, you wouldn’t miss the Gatiss ghost story if it wasn’t there, but it’s always nice to see it again.The Room in the Tower: A Ghost Story for Christmas aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJoanna LumleyTobias MenziesHorror (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The metallic smog of backlogged traffic. The aching heat of sun-dried neighbourhoods baking in an oven of concrete and asphalt.For most people, the mundane threats that plague our environments are likely to annoy more than they spark dread. But for scientists who know just how dangerous our surroundings can be, the burden of knowledge weighs heavy each day. AcrossEurope, environmental risks cause 18% of deaths from cardiovascular disease and 10% of deaths from cancer. Traffic crashes in the EU kill five times more people than murders.Are safe and healthy cities just a distant fantasy? Here are four environmental health experts on life in some of Europe’s greenest capitals.Copenhagen, Denmark“Copenhagen is for sure one of the best cities to live in,” says Zorana Jovanovic Andersen during her morning walk-and-metro to work at the University of Copenhagen’s public health department.The environmental epidemiologist is astonished that 30-40% of the Danish capital gets to work or school on their bikes each day, keeping their bodies moving while avoiding the deadly fumes that cars spew. “Those are amazing statistics,” says Andersen. “It’s because of very conscious investment in bike lanes and infrastructure – and taking away some road space from cars.”‘It’s the best feeling’: how Copenhagen gave cyclists a green waveRead moreExcellent public transport and walkable neighbourhoods add to the feeling of freedom for Andersen, who moved to Copenhagen from the US midwest in 2001 and feels liberated from the car dependence she saw there. “Freedom is having a choice of different things, not just having one really bad choice,” she says. “Freedom is living in a city like here, where you can breathe clean air and choose your lifestyle.”Andersen’s research into air pollution still preys on her mind – friends recently bought a wood-burning stove,a potent source of toxic particles, and cars still flood the city at rush hour – but she is reluctant to shame people in the absence of good regulations. She wishes Copenhagen would introduce congestion pricing and ultra low-emissions zones, like in London.Copenhagen has a positive story to tell on any metric, says Andersen, but its air is still dirty enough to make people sick and worsen their lives. “Even with the low levels inDenmark, we see the contrast in air pollution explain some kids getting poorer grades.”Vienna, Austria“The quality of life is out-of-this-world positive,” says Mathew White, an environmental psychologist at the University of Vienna. “It’s an absolutely wonderful place to live.”View image in fullscreenVienna is characterised by an abundance of green spacePhotograph: rusm/Getty ImagesWidespread social housing, an abundance of green space and a well-integrated public transport network contribute to the Austrian capital regularly being ranked the most livable city in the world. White, who specialises in ecological public health, says access to parks inAustriais better shared out between rich and poor neighbourhoods than in countries such as the UK. “When we look at Vienna, in particular, we notice that the use of these green spaces is good at reducing related health inequalities.”Spending time in nature is thought to build resilience to the stresses of daily life, and White’s research has shown that the wellbeing of poorer people in Vienna is higher than otherwise be expected, due to time spent in nature. Parks and cheap flats are spread out around the city, and public transport costs just €1 a day, encouraging even marginalised communities to get together outside.What Vienna lacks are the cycle lanes of Copenhagen, says White. There is also a looming political threat to its green ideals. The far-right Freedom party won national elections in September, and while centrist parties formed a coalition without it, White fears the shift may undermine the city’s progressive policies. “It’s not an environmental threat per se, but it’s the threat of the kind of politics that wants to disregard environmental issues.”Barcelona, SpainView image in fullscreenA ‘superilla’ (superblock) promoting cycling and car-free zones in Barcelona.Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen Mark Nieuwenhuijsen moved toBarcelona20 years ago, there were two weeks each summer that he found too hot. Nowadays, there are two months. “It’s unbearable to a lot of people,” said Nieuwenhuijsen, director of urban planning, environment and health at the research institute ISGlobal.Heat worsens the air quality in Barcelona, which is scarred by urban motorways and suffers from high traffic density, but its fightback has inspired cities around the world. The introduction of several superblocks – lively, walkable neighbourhoods that prioritise people over cars – and “green axes” since 2016 has improved health and livebility. If the city were to fulfil its original plan to create 503 superblocks, it would save far more lives and money, Nieuwenhuijsen’sresearchhas found.“We would see a quite different, much greener Barcelona: more livable, less air pollution, less noise,” he says. “Unfortunately, it has not been implemented.”Political enthusiasm for the project has dwindled, leaving Nieuwenhuijsen wishing that the city’s leadership would be brave enough to follow the example of Dutch cities and take more space away from cars. Pushing more vehicles out of the city would clean up the air and avoid heat from engines and infrastructure.“People don’t realise how quickly we’re heating up in the Mediterranean,” he says. “We need to adapt the city much faster.”London, UKView image in fullscreenCyclists meet car traffic at Clapham Common in south London.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock“By far the best thing aboutLondonis the green space,” says Audrey de Nazelle, a scientist at Imperial College London who co-chairs the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology’s policy committee. “The amount of parks really makes it the green capital of Europe.”Safety and space at risk as SUVs reach 30% of car market in English cities, researchers warnRead moreThe challenge, she says, is getting to them. The large parks near her home are “extremely dangerous” to access, with a lack of pedestrian crossings and vehicles that speed through without looking. An increase in car width of 2cm a year due tothe SUV boom– “absolutely mind-boggling” – adds to the risk that people face when they walk or bike.“It should not be like this in a civilised country like the UK,” says de Nazelle, adding that her husband hates to see her or their children get on their bikes. “I have cycled all my life and will cycle no matter what. But now that I have children, I am acutely aware of the hazards and dangers.”De Nazelle moved to London 13 years ago from Barcelona having previously lived in Paris. Those two cities have made“major efforts”to reduce car dependencesince she left, but she finds London to be “not sufficiently visionary” in its approach.The city’s introduction of an ultra-low emissions zone has been relatively effective “but it’s a missed opportunity to get people out of cars”, says de Nazelle.Explore more on these topicsCitiesLondonBarcelonaSpainEuropeAustriaDenmarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A look back at the president’s unusual behavior in 2025Adam GabbattTrump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuityWed 24 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 09.08 ESTShareIn an address from the White House in December, Donald Trumpclaimedthat, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.It’s true that his second term has been unusual, including in some ways which the president might not appreciate. That’s because Trump, 79, has shown erratic and at times confused behavior throughout 2025, leading to questions about his mental and physical performance.Trump has appeared to fall asleep during some meetings; amid others, he has drifted off-topic, launching into bizarre segues on interior decor or about whales and birds. His public appearances have lacked focus, and he has used speeches to ramble about how Barack Obama walks down stairs, or to invent stories about the Unabomber.The unpredictable behavior has forced the White House to repeatedly defend Trump’s mental acuity, often in hyperbolic terms. Trump himself has bragged that he “aced” an assessment which tests for early signs of dementia, but over the course of his 11 months in office, examples of unusual behavior have piled up.There was the case in mid-July, whenTrump told a detailed storyabout how his uncle, the late professor John Trump, had taught Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Trump recalled: “I said: ‘What kind of a student was he, Uncle John? Dr John Trump.’ I said: ‘What kind of a student?’ And then he said: ‘Seriously, good.’ He said: ‘He’d correct – he’d go around correcting everybody.’ But it didn’t work out too well for him.”The problem is: that cannot possibly be true. First, Trump’s uncle died in 1985, and Kaczynski was only publicly identified as the Unabomber in 1996. Second, Kaczynskidid not study at MIT.Later that month, during a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Trump abruptly switched from discussing immigration to ranting about “windmills”. Speaking, non-stop and unprompted,for two minutes, Trump claimed without evidence that they drive whales “loco” and that wind energy “kills the birds” (the proportion of birds killed by turbinesis tinycompared with the number killed by domestic cats and from them flying into power lines).Another incident that raised questions about Trump’s state of mind came in September. Trump summoned the country’s top military commanders to a meeting in Virginia, and treated them to a speech touting his alleged successes before saying this:America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”Trump continued:I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”The White House has repeatedly batted away questions about Trump’s mental acuity, a spokesperson told the Guardian earlier this year that his “mental sharpness is second to none”, while Ronny Jackson, a Republican congressman who previously served as Trump’s doctor, claimed he was the “healthiest president this nation has ever seen”.Still, the speculation over Trump’s health is unlikely to go away, with the Daily Beastreportingthat Democrats are planning to make his mental acuity and fitness a key issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections.They will have a fair amount of ammunition. In November, Trump, the oldest person to be inaugurated as president, said he had undergone an MRI, but couldn’t remember which body part received the scan. That month he also appeared to fall asleepduring a meetingin the Oval Office – the same thing happenedduring a cabinet meetingin early December, and again two weeks later,at a press conferenceannouncing cannabis reforms.Earlier this year, Trumpmixed up Albania with Armeniawhen discussing a peace deal involving the latter;discussing autismin a speech at the White House, he mused about “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby”. Announcing that 13 grants would be awarded to investigate autism, Trump added: “Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”Among these moments of confusion have been incidents of Trump lashing out without inhibition. In December alone, he declaredSomali immigrants to be “garbage”and, in a move that shockedeven some Republicans, essentiallyblamedRob Reiner for his own death.Trump finds time to say and do these things despite a reduced schedule. On average, Trump’s scheduled events only start at about noon, and usually end at 5pm, a shorter workday compared to his first term, the New York Timesfound, while the number of his official appearances has decreased by 39%.A White House official told the Guardian: “Not all of the president’s meetings are listed on the daily guidance that is distributed to the press.”Liz Huston, the White House assistant press secretary, said in an emailed statement: “The Guardian is a left-wing mouthpiece that should be deeply embarrassed to publish this garbage. As the President’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again – and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day – President Trump remains in excellent overall health.“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people. Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”A Pew Research Centersurveyin November found that 56% of US adults “say they have a lot of or some trust in the information they get from national news organizations”, which is 11 points lower than in March 2025, and 20 points lower than it was in 2016.That same month, apollby Gallup found 36% of American adults approve of Trump’s performance, the lowest rating of his second term. Earlier this year YouGovfoundthat half of Americans think Trump is too old to be president.Throughout the year, the White House has ferociously defended Trump against accusations he is in decline. Yet the questions about Trump, who will turn 80 in June, are unlikely to go away.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsMental healthHealthanalysisShareReuse this content"

Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.Over the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardiangames of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!‘I absolutely devoured this gem of a game’“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured thisgemof a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!”Jen Baker“Death Stranding 2is a truemasterpieceof a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.”Simon White“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. ButAvowedgot its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.”Matt Froggatt“Split Fictionis themost funco-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!”Simon Watson“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to theLiesof Puniverse and the DLC,Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.”Tara CooperView image in fullscreen‘It has been my favourite game for years’ … Ghost of Yōtei released in October 2025.Photograph: Sony Interactive Entertainment“Myfavouritegame of the year has been my favourite for years:Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.”Gareth Jones“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).”Thomas Jones“The top VR game of 2025 has to beGhost Townby FireproofGames. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.”Martina Stender“For me, it has to beMonsterTrain 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!”Nell Guy“Maybe it’s recency bias, butArc Raidershas come out of nowhere and completelytaken overmy gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.”Brett BatesView image in fullscreen‘A well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way’ … Silvano Cardin on Chicory: A Colorful Tale.Photograph: Chicory“One game I played this year will stay with me for life:Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.”Silvano Cardin“Absolum.I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!”Asher Alexander“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had meobsessedlikeBlue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.”Marie-Jill Landry“Kaizen Game Works’Promise Mascot Agencyis a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.”Paul Jones“My favourite game of the year is, very much,Dispatch– and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!”Chris Cunliffe“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2isoutstandingin all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.”Bob WatkinsWhat to clickKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this ChristmasTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆Call of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memoriesQuestion BlockView image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?You know what to do: email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others had not even noticed thename above the doorhad changed – such was the similarity of the signage, which sticks to a similar blue.However, shoppers are not really feeling the same vibe as under the233-year-old WH Smithbrand. “I loved Smiths. I used to say to my husband: ‘I’m just popping down to Smiths’ but I’ll never be able to say: ‘I’m popping to Jones’s,’” says Parsons, who admits she is not so regular a visitor as she used to be, picking up books elsewhere and getting her newspapers delivered.View image in fullscreenSome shoppers had not realised the name of the store had changed because of the similarities.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianThe private equity company Modella Capital, the owner of Hobbycraft, the UK arm of Claire’s and The Original Factory Shop, bought WH Smith’s high street arm in June for up to £40m, half of which is dependent on trading up until August next year. The price was cut by £12m at the last moment after “a period of softer trading”.The business is now totally separate from the travel retail arm, which retained the WH Smith name, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and continues to trade in airports, stations and hospitals. Itsshare price recently divedafter accounting problems at its US operation.View image in fullscreenGillian Parsons says of TG Jones: ‘The layout is the same and what they are selling is the same.’Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianIn a recent presentation to landlords seen by the Guardian, Modella promised to invest in expanding TG Jones to be the “hub of the high street” with 500 outlets that would combine post office and banking services with learning, play and reading products.The plan appears to be to expand into new locations, with some parts of the UK, such as north-east England and the East Midlands sparsely covered with stores compared with the south.Visitors are to be tempted in with refits. However, only 14 of the group’s 456 stores so far have been revamped, with 10 more definitely planned, according to the presentation.Store updates are also set to include more post offices, on top of four added since the deal, and branded sections from Modella’s other businesses Claire’s and Hobbycraft, and its partner Toys R Us.Toys R Us, for example, is in 115 TG Jones stores, according to the presentation, and it expects to increase that to more than 250 – the same number of stores set to host a Hobbycraft section by 2027.It may have gone unnoticed in Hitchin, but there are small changes creeping into the former WH Smith outlets, including a small new section dedicated to goods from Hobbycraft and Toys R Us and a section for “DIY essentials”.However, since the deal was first announced in March, 24 stores have closed – including nine since the deal was completed in June – as TG Jones has continued a programme of closures already under way by WH Smith.View image in fullscreenTG Jones’s plan appears to be to expand into new locations.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianShoppers say they will need more changes if they are to be tempted to spend more and keep TG Jones afloat amid rising costs on the high street.“It’s not what it was when you could buy records and toys and it was slick. It doesn’t really know what it is. I’d like to see more arts stuff and stationery. Books and toys everyone can get cheaper elsewhere,” Jon Wright says.Shoppers admit they are more likely to buy many of the items sold in TG Jones online or at rivals including The Range, Poundland, Waterstones or big supermarkets – where they can get cheaper prices or more choice.“It’s more convenient to shop at the supermarket,” say sisters Tracy Ward and Lisa Bierton.“I tend to go to cheaper shops for cards,” Ward says. “People don’t tend to get cards as often, as a stamp costs more than the card these days.”Trading on UK high streets has been tough in the run-up to Christmas, when WH Smith used to make the majority of its profits, with shoppers reining in the present buying and sending fewer cards as the energy and grocery bills remain high and fears about tax rises and other factors such as the war in Ukraine and the economic outlook prompt households to hold on to spare cash.View image in fullscreenSisters Tracy Ward (left) and Lisa Bierton outside TG Jones in Hitchin.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianEarlier this month, Card Factory delivered an unwelcome early Christmas surprise for investors by issuing ashock profit warningduring the cut-price greetings card retailer’s peak trading period, which sent shares plunging by more than a fifth.One retail property expert said he believed Modella would radically restructure TG Jones in July next year once a 12-month prohibition on such steps agreed as part of the deal with WH Smith comes to an end.He said such a move would be necessary because a large estate, with many sites on the borderline of profitability, risked “being eaten from the tail” as investments in key stores were offset by problems in the wider estate.“They can dominate the market in some smaller areas but in bigger malls they are up against the likes of Miniso [on toys] and The Works on stationery and books.”Another retail insider who knows the business well said TG Jones might well have been helped by changes to business rates in the budget that helped keep a lid on costs for many high street outlets but said store closures were likely, with as many as 100 at risk.View image in fullscreenMarion and Craig Herbert do quite a bit of shopping online.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian“It’s inevitable that the shape of that business will change,” the source said, as retail profits are under pressure and the cost of refurbishing ageing outlets is high and without a guaranteed payback.TG Jones and Modella were contacted for comment.The chain’s previous owner, WH Smith, may have responded to heavy criticism about its flooring and tatty shelves with a round of investment in recent years but many outlets still look out of date after a long period of cost-cutting.TG Jones in Stevenage, for example, appears almost identical to its WH Smith days, suggesting it is among a list of sites under threat.“Back in the day I used to shop in WH Smith,” says Wayne Garland, 49, standing outside the store, which sits in a struggling outdoor mall where there are a number of empty units. “But now it’s too expensive when I can go to Poundland and buy 10 pens for £1. With the cost of living crisis, I’m looking for bargains bottom line.”Marion and Craig Herbert agree there are now cheaper and handier alternatives. “We do quite a bit online now.

He also does not mention storage costs or flag that gold does not bring in a regular income in interest or dividends.One pensions expert, Tom McPhail, a governor of thePensionsPolicy Institute, described the idea that people should be converting some of their pension into physical gold as “niche” and suggested it was appropriate only for sophisticated investors.“There is nothing inherently wrong with holding actual gold,” he said. “But you have got to look at the transaction and storage costs and the whole thing in the round. It is pretty niche stuff.“For 90% or more of the population, join your workplace pension, go into the default fund, have a mixture of bonds and equities, plus property and cash. Just do that. The people who could be looking at [buying physical gold] should be reasonably sophisticated investors. It’s definitely not for most people and should only be done by someone who understands how physical gold fits into a diverse portfolio.”He added: “You can make the argument that he’s just acting as a billboard, saying, ‘how about investing in gold? Talk to these guys, who will tell you about the details.’ But it does feel quite irresponsible. Farage has a strong brand. Not everybody likes him, but some people really like him. So when Nigel tells you to invest in gold, you might just dutifully do what he tells you. If I were to put all my money in gold, that would be a really high-risk thing to do.”View image in fullscreenFarage said: ‘Since I began my relationship with Direct Bullion, people that took my advice will have seen returns of over 100% on their money.’Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesTom Brake, the chief executive of Unlock Democracy, said he had raised the Direct Bullion videos promoted by Farage with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), asking them to look into whether the online material met its standards and whether it fell under its regulatory orbit.He highlightedtwo videoswherethere were no disclaimers, and pointed to another where he said the disclaimer at the end was in such a tiny font and appeared so fleetingly there was a dangerthe viewer may not see it.A spokesperson for Reform UK, asked whether it was appropriate for an MP and political leader to suggest people used their pension pots to buy gold without disclaimers that the value could go up and down, or explaining that gold did not bring in regular income or making clear any storage costs, said the party “took pity on the Guardian for not having better things to do with their time than measure font sizes”.Farage said: “For five years I have publicly recommended that people invest a decent chunk of money into gold. Since I began my relationship with Direct Bullion, people that took my advice will have seen returns of over 100% on their money.”Direct Bullion did not respond to requests for comment. Reform UK sources said Farage had a working relationship with Direct Bullion that preceded his time as an MP.Promoting the company’s physical gold bars and coins is one of many jobs Farage has had at the same time as being the MP for Clacton.The Reform leader is a presenter for GB News, and has been paid about £450,000 from that role since entering parliament. He is also a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, bringing £48,000 a year, and a commentator for Sky News Australia, which pays him more than £50,000 a year.Other pensions experts said putting gold into pensions could be part of a diversified portfolio. Kate Marshall, a lead investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Gold can play a useful role in a diversified pension portfolio, but it’s important to keep it in proportion.“We favour gaining exposure through exchange traded commodities (ETCs), such as the iShares Physical Gold ETC, which aims to provide exposure to physical gold. ETCs are one of the simplest ways to invest and can be a low-cost way to add exposure to gold to an investment portfolio.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content, and he was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability.“Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.”Her comments came after Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The CCDH has previously incurred the wrath of Musk over its reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took over the platform. Musktried unsuccessfullyto sue the organisation last year, before calling it a “criminal organisation”.Visa ban for European critics of online harm is first shot in US free speech warRead moreThe X owner has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation. And he has railed against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which Breton helped spearhead, and under which Xwas hitwith a €120m (£105m) fine for what the EU called the deceptive design of its blue tick system for verifying users.Melford is UK-based, while Ahmed, whose organisation once employed Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a director, lives in Washington DC with his family.A spokesperson for GDI called the sanctions “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. They added: “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.”Ahmed has been approached for comment.A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”That response contrasted, however, with the more combative stance taken by the French government and the European Commission.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the measures “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. The commission said in a statement it “strongly condemns” the actions of the Trump administration.Jonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Times Radio: “[This] will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject [internet regulation] at the moment.”Campaigners in the UK warned the British government was likely to be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.Ava Lee, the executive director of People Vs Big Tech, said: “The Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Europeans trying to uphold the rule of law when it comes to big tech. With the Online Safety Act (OSA), the UK is likely to be next in the firing line.”The Trump administration has previously flagged its concerns about the OSA. This year a group of officials from the state department metOfcom, the regulator charged with overseeing the act, and are understood to have raised concerns that the act will risk infringing free speech.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK’s House of Lords and a prominent online safety campaigner, said Rubio’s comments on the visa bans were an “outrage”.“The US tech sector, backed by the US administration, is attempting to undermine European laws and values,” she said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, there were 141 settlements in the West Bank. After the latest approval there are 210, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group.Settlements are considered illegal under international law.The 14 countries’ statement added: “We are resolute in our support of Palestinians’ right of self-determination. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution in accordance with relevant UN security council resolutions where two democratic states, Israel andPalestine, live side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders. We reaffirm that there is no alternative to a negotiated two-state solution.”Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, rejected the statement, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats the country faced.He wrote on X: “Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineWest BankInternational lawMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The decision was criticised by defeated candidates andlamented by the Organization of American States, which sent an observation mission to the election held on 30 November but whose vote counthad remained unresolved since then.Asfura has already declared himself president-elect. “Honduras, we now have the official declaration from the CNE [electoral council]. I recognise the great work carried out by the councillors and the entire team that ran the election. Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down. God bless Honduras,” hewrote.Nasralla refused to concede andposted a series of statementsalleging fraud in the counting process, including “forgery of public documents”, claiming that “the data from the original tally sheets were altered”.Nasralla urged his supporters to remain calm and refrain from any acts of disruption or violence, adding this was “the saddest Christmas for the Honduran people.”The head of the Honduran Congress also rejected the results. “This is completely outside the law. It has no value,” Congress president Luis Redondo, of the ruling Libre party, wrote on X.The electoral council is made up of three councillors: one aligned with Asfura’s party, one with Nasralla’s, and one with the party of the leftist president, Xiomara Castro, whose candidate finished third. Asfura’s victory was declared only by the first two councillors.The representative linked to the president’s party refused to recognise the result, alleged that an “electoral coup” was under way and filed a complaint with the public prosecutor’s office, raising the prospect that the outcome will be challenged in court.In its statement, the council said: “By the majority will of the Honduran people, expressed sovereignly at the ballot box, the full council of the CNE declares Nasry Juan Asfura Zablah constitutional president of the Republic ofHondurasfor the four-year term beginning on 27 January 2026 and ending on 27 January 2030.”The declaration before the end of the recount was the latest in a string of controversies that marked the Central American country’s presidential race, starting with what many saw as open interference by the US president.Days before the vote, Trump publicly backed Asfura, said the US would support the next government only if he won, and attacked the other leading candidates, calling them communists or allies of Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro.On the eve of the election, the US president alsoannounced a pardonfor the former Honduran president and Asfura ally Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,congratulated Asfura on social media. “The people of Honduras have spoken: Nasry Asfura is Honduras’ next president,” said Rubio. “The United States congratulates president-elect Asfura and looks forward to working with his administration to advance prosperity and security in our hemisphere.”Explore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

For her advice alone, she subsequently invoiced £22,669.50 for March 2024, £20,626.67 for April, £22,329.50 for May, £20,034.60 for June and £26,069.50 for July.Operating through a UK limited company can offer tax advantages through structuring income through a combination of salary and dividends to minimise tax and national insurance (NIC) costs.Ockenden said: “The payment details you have are correct. I am working long hours on the review. I anticipate devoting the vast majority of my time to the review up to the point of publication in June 2026.“The current contractual arrangement provides value to the taxpayer, and involves my running every aspect of the review including coordination of a large team of clinical reviewers.”Of her tax arrangements, she added: “I was retained in a personal capacity by NHSE along with all those individuals working on the review because at its outset, the review was administered by NHSE. When responsibility for managing and delivering the review was contracted to DO Limited those arrangements naturally ceased.”Ockenden’s daily fees exceed the UK’s weekly median wage of £766.60 and highlight the high costs of a series of reviews of maternity and neonatal services in NHS trusts undertaken in recent years.In an interim report published in early December, Baroness Amos, who is conducting aninvestigationinto NHS maternity services in England, noted that despite a significant number of independent investigations and reviews of maternity and neonatal services in NHS trusts since 2015, England was “still struggling to provide safe, reliable maternity and neonatal care everywhere in the country”.Ockenden has been praised for her work, including aprevious review in Shrewsbury and Telford.In October she said she had the backing from affected families to take on a similar role investigating Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust.She said she would be willing to chair the inquiry in Leeds as well as a further maternity review at UniversityHospitalsSussex NHS trust, describing it as an “honour” to be considered.Soon after, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, told Woman’s Hour on BBC Radio 4 that Ockenden would not be leading the Leeds review owing to her existing commitments.“She won’t be leading the Leeds inquiry, not least because she’s leading the work inNottingham, Shrewsbury and Telford,” he said. “If I could clone her, I would, but because Donna has earned the trust of the families she is working with, everyone wants Donna, I understand that and I have huge respect for her.“But I’ve got to make sure to protect the work Donna is already doing but I’ve also got to build a wider team of people who can support the government, support the NHS when trouble arises.”An NHS spokesperson said: “Following the then secretary of state’s appointment of the independent review’s chair in spring 2022, NHS England has worked to ensure the review meets its terms of reference for families, initiating a new contractual agreement in January 2024.“Women and families deserve answers and improved maternity services in Nottingham, and the publication of the review’s final report no later than June 2026 will be a critical step to achieving this.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsNottinghamshireEnglandMidwiferyNottinghamHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

To refuse one is to refuse the other,” said the pope during the solemn service, attended by about 6,000 people inside the basilica.Leo, the first US-born pope, is celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world’s cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis. The pope,who has criticised Donald Trump’s divisive immigration crackdown, quoted a line from Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the world does not care for children, the poor or foreigners.“While a distorted economy leads us to treat human beings as mere merchandise, God becomes like us, revealing the infinite dignity of every person,” said Leo. “Where there is room for the human person, there is room for God. Even a stable can become more sacred than a temple.“Outside the basilica, about 5,000 people watched the service on screens from St Peter’s Square, holding umbrellas and wearing ponchos under a hard rain in Rome.Leo, 70, came outside to greet them before the start of the mass. “I admire and respect and thank you for your courage and your wanting to be here this evening, even in this weather.”On Thursday, the pope will celebrate a Christmas Day mass and deliver a twice-yearlyUrbi et Orbi(to the city and the world) message and blessing.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyVaticanCatholicismChristianityReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Maddie was a bubbly, loving character, she made everything into a joke and she lit up every room that she was in.“Maddie had a laugh that everyone will remember her for! Maddie filled every room with her presence, she was fun to be around and always made us laugh. Maddie had a real passion for art, she was so talented and we are so unbelievably proud of her creativity.“Maddie truly was one of a kind, she had a heart of gold and was fiercely protective of those she loved especially her siblings, who will miss her deeply. There is a void in our lives and we will miss Maddie sorely.”Madison’s parents added that they would also like to mention the mental health charityYoungMinds.James Docherty, the executive headteacher ofTeenage Kicks school in Failsworth, also paid tribute to the teenager, saying she had a “remarkable” talent.He said: “Maddie was a wonderfully creative young girl, someone who saw the world through colours, ideas, and imagination. Whether she was sketching, painting or transforming herself with her incredible face-painting skills, Maddie had a gift for turning ordinary moments into something magical.“Maddie didn’t just make beautiful art – she made people feel special. Even when she was having a rant, you knew deep down she didn’t mean it and she was soon back at the office door asking for something. There was a gentleness in her, a kindness that flowed naturally, and it touched pupils and staff alike.“Maddie will forever be part of our school family, and she will be carried in our memories with love, pride, and endless appreciation for the light she brought into our lives.”DI Andrew Day said Madison’s death was “utterly heartbreaking” for her friends and family, facing the first Christmas without her.He added: “An arrest has been made in relation to allegations of harassment in the days leading up to her death, and while that boy has since been bailed, inquiries are very much ongoing.“We are continuing to investigate the full circumstances of Madison’s death, which includes if the actions of anyone else contributed to it, and ultimately, to try and get much-needed answers for her family.”Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the trailer, a voiceover says: “Whatever happened to Tommy Shelby? The famous gypsy gangster.”Peaky Blinders: The Immortal ManShelby says “I’m not that man any more”, and a separate clip shows him walking with his head held down while wearing his distinctive bakerboy cap after a female voice says: “Tommy, you’ve got to come back.”Viewers are also offered a glimpse of Keoghan’s character, who wears a white vest top with tattoos on his arms.The forthcoming movie serves as a continuation of the hit BBC drama series, which followed the rise of the Birmingham crime family the Shelbys.The show’s six seasons spanned the end of the first world war through the end of prohibition in the US.Returning cast members include Sophie Rundle as Ada Shelby, Stephen Graham as union convener Hayden Stagg, and Packy Lee as Tommy’s friend Johnny Dogs.Saltburn actor Keoghan, Dune actor Rebecca Ferguson and Reservoir Dogs star Tim Roth are among the new additions.The film has been directed by Tom Harper and written by creator Steven Knight, who is to write the next James Bond film.Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man premieres in cinemas on 6 March next year and will be available on Netflix from 20 March.In October, the BBC announcedPeaky Blinders would return with two new seriesfocusing on a “new generation of Shelbys”.The spin-off series is set in 1953, years after the events of the forthcoming feature film, and is to be filmed at Digbeth Loc Studios in Birmingham.Murphy, 49, will return to executive produce but it has not been disclosed if he will reprise his role as the protagonist.The spin-off is the latest incarnation in the Peaky Blinders universe after Rambert Studios’ ballet about Tommy.The sixth series, which was broadcast in 2022 and was billed as the final series, saw Tommy almost shoot himself after being given false information that he had a brain tumour.Peaky Blinders first aired on BBC Two in 2013, before getting picked up by Netflix in 2014, where it gained a global following and launched Murphy to international fame along with co-stars Tom Hardy, Anya Taylor-Joy and the late Helen McCrory.The drama, which also triggered a surge in popularity of the flat cap, moved to BBC One in 2019 after a Bafta win for best drama series for its fourth season.Explore more on these topicsPeaky BlindersNetflixCillian MurphyBarry KeoghannewsShareReuse this content"

Their defiance comes more than three years after the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman taken into custody by the “morality police” for allegedly breaching the dress code rules. Her death led to thelargest wave of popular unrestfor years in Iran and a crackdown by security services in response, withhundreds of protesters killedand thousands injured.Under Iran’s“hijab and chastity” law, which came into force in 2024, women caught “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing” face severe penalties, including fines of up to £12,500, flogging and prison sentences ranging from five to 15 years for repeat offenders.The authorities have also encouraged members of the public to become “hijab monitors” through a state-backed reporting platform that allows them to report women for alleged violations.View image in fullscreenTwo young female friends meet up in Laleh park to rest and drink tea together after a long working day. They used to be classmates studying EnglishIn December, the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said the hijab was crucial “to preserve the dignity of women and to restrain very strong anddangerous sexual urges”, heralding the start of a new push to enforce the dress code laws.Within days, the security forces intensified their hijab enforcement. The organisers of a popular marathon race in Kish Island, off the southern coast of Iran,were arrested and accusedof “violating public decency” for allowing women to run unveiled.But speaking to the Guardian, women inIransay public opinion has shifted and even more women are open to flouting the dress code rules despite the increase in arrests and penalties.“We never needed Khamenei’s permission, nor do we need it now. The scenes you are witnessing are because we do not care what he has to say,” says Hoda*, a Tehran-based journalist.View image in fullscreenA young couple share a kiss while picnicking in Tehran’s Laleh Park“We are running out of water [referring to Iran’s water shortage crisis], there are growing labour protests and the war with Israel has left the administration weak. Hijab is an easy distraction while they deal with all these serious issues.”If I wear a hijab now, I feel I’m undoing all the sacrifices so many Iranians have madeShaghayegh, 22Although Hoda accepts that more women will be arrested, she says the Iranian authorities would avoid mass arrests because “last time they did it, they looked like fools across the world”.In Tehran, Golnar*, a visual artist, believes young Iranians will not return to previous norms. She recently filmed a police officer warning teenagers who were playing music; the group ignored him. She says the regime, weakened by war and sanctions, “needs good PR” and cannot risk viral images of hijab arrests.“Do I have it in the back of my head that I will be at any time dragged into a van? Yes, I am not going to lie. But the plan is to push the boundaries collectively, so they can’t break a few of us,” says Golnar.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop left: Two friends talking outside a cultural centre in Tehran; top right: A woman stands on a table in a café in Tehran to remove her headscarf in a symboilc gesture; bottom left: A woman looks towards a building opposite her house that was demolisehd by Israeli missile strikes in June 2025; bottom right: A woman strolls with her child around the Tehran Museum of Contemporary ArtElsewhere in Tehran, Shaghayegh*, 22, pushes boundaries through an all-women motorcycle club. Women cannot obtain bike licences in Iran, yet her group rides weekly. “They have become very lax and don’t stop us any more,” she says.Shaghayegh says she no longer wears a headscarf off the bike. “If I wear a hijab now, I feel I’m undoing all the sacrifices so many Iranians have made. There’s no going back.”While most viral videos come from Tehran, women in other provinces also report a shift in attitudes.Leyla*, a business owner in the central Iranian city of Shiraz, says she has never seen the city so energised. “Honestly, it’s really hopeful to see. The fact that more and more women choose how they dress is exactly what makes them braver. These visuals are a proof of our bravery and not the reform that many pro-regime folks are pointing to.”View image in fullscreenTwo girls view Picasso’s Guernica at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, where a large number of the artist’s original works are on display.

They deserve a whole new episode togetherFrances RyanWed 24 Dec 2025 16.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 16.01 ESTShareIn an era in which it is now an annual tradition for the US streaming giants to put out bland paint-by-algorithm holiday movies, there is something rather satisfying about the oddball BritishChristmasstand-alone special. The ingredients tend to be as follows: appearances by the year’s favourite comic actors; niche cultural references, with or without cameos; a wittily biting but heartwarming script that preferably leaves the viewer weeping into their Baileys.In many ways, Finding Father Christmas hits all those notes, if never quite fulfilling its potential. It follows 16-year-old Chris (Bafta-winner and total delight Lenny Rush), who still believes in Santa despite being in the middle of his GCSEs. Three years after the death of his mother and with Chris still writing letters to the north pole, his concerned dad and depressed postman Nicholas (The Inbetweeners’ James Buckley) decides it’s finally time to have “the talk”.View image in fullscreenCrunching the numbers … Stephen Fry in Finding Father Christmas.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Nicholas lays it bare. Santa’s sipped whisky. The snow on the roof. The reindeer tracks. All done by him. But the show would be very short if Chris believed his dad, and so he embarks on a mission to prove him wrong and discover the science behind the magic, aided by his lovably eccentric cousin, Holly (Ele Mckenzie), and a range of experts.The USP is that said experts are real-life scientists and thinkers playing themselves: Prof Hannah Fry, Dame Maggie Aderin-Pocock, and, for reasons I don’t quite understand, Jason Fox from SAS: Who Dares Wins. Everyone involved is a good sport as they use physics to explain how Father Christmas does the seemingly impossible in just one night. But it is national treasure andmediocre faithfulStephen Fry who steals the show.Having stalked him via a tipoff by the local Santa (a guest appearance by People Just Do Nothing’s Asim Chaudhry), Chris, Holly and super fan Nicholas find themselves in Fry’s front room being given a full-blown presentation weighing up the logistics of Christmas Eve, complete with a chalkboard and equations. (Look out for the press clippings framed above Fry’s downstairs toilet.)There is a sweet side plot in which Nicholas tentatively takes a step back into dating with Miss Bailey (Rochenda Sandall), Chris’s science teacher who lives across the road. But there would surely have been more depth to the characterisation if Chris had gone on the journey of discovery with his dad rather than his cousin. Buckley and Rush are a wonderful pairing who clearly could have carried it off, with Rush showing the same easy chemistry that saw him shine with co-star Daisy May Cooper in Am I Being Unreasonable? I find myself wishing the script had been returned around February with a note from Channel 4 bosses asking to turn it into a two-hander, in a similar vein to 2018’s pathos-filled Click & Collect.View image in fullscreenThe TV equivalent of a Christmas buffet … Asim Chaudhry as Santa with Ele McKenzie as and Lenny Rush as Chris.Photograph: Big TalkInstead, we’re given multiple characters we never really get enough time with. There’s a fun scene reminiscent of Paddington where Chris and Holly break into a warehouse to discover the truth about Father Christmas, but Taskmaster’s Greg Davies is criminally underused as the big man himself, other than a quick joke about air fryers as dated presents. Similarly, there’s a nice running gag about Royal Mail (you can imagine legal action starting over the claim that they shred children’s letters to Santa), but Nicholas’s unhappiness at work doesn’t get the chance to be properly explored. We do, however, get some time with Holly and her podcast without any explanation of her role in Chris’s life or why she is keen to commit crimes for him. It is the TV equivalent of a Christmas buffet. A nice sausage roll there, a pot of Pringles here. But you can’t help wishing you were sitting down to a full roast dinner.By the end, I simultaneously have the feeling it is going on too long (call me anti-expert but after physics has been explained in terms of Santa’s movements once, do we need it again and again?) and also could do with an extra 15 minutes. The loss of Chris’s mum is covered briefly in the first and last five minutes, but some exploration in the middle would have given the whole thing more emotional punch. As the credits roll, I am not crying into my Baileys. Perhaps I’m dead inside. Perhaps I started drinking this morning and fell asleep in the third ad break facedown in a panettone. Perhaps – and I’m going with this option – there needs to be a part two next year to fill in some of the blanks.I vote Chris and his dad spend Christmas Eve with Davies’s Santa, ideally with a post-watershed liberalism to expletives. The physicists can come along for the ride (if they must).Finding Father Christmas is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

But she struck gold with Owen Cooper for Adolescence – and won an Emmy. How does she spot such game-changing talent?Wed 24 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareAt the Emmys in September,Adolescenceall but swept the board. It won best limited series. It won awards for writing, for directing, for cinematography. Three of its actors – Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty and Owen Cooper – all took home awards. But Adolescence also earned another Emmy for a craft that often goes overlooked: best casting.Shaheen Baig was the woman responsible for casting Adolescence, and her Emmy is tucked away in the top right corner of the screen as we chat about her year over Zoom. She is mortified as soon as she realises this, immediately re-angling her webcam to keep it out of sight, lest anyone mistakes it for a boast.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve always been a workaholic, but Adolescence has made me more visible’ … Shaheen Baig with her Emmy award.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesStill, there’s no question that the award was deserved. As the woman who populated Adolescence with actors, Baig is ultimately the woman who discovered Owen Cooper. Despite its incendiary subject matter and technical wizardry, Cooper was the beating heart of the series. So revelatory was his performance – in turn heartbreakingly vulnerable and incandescently vicious – that it was hard to believe he was just 14 years old at time of filming, let alone that this was his first ever role.Baig nods. “He did exceptionally. He had this wonderful quality on screen. There was a real innocence to him visually, and a clarity which I thought was just wonderful.”Cooper’s discovery came as the result of a highly targeted six-month search for someone to fill the role. Baig knew that the show would be filmed in the north of England, so that was where she and her team set to work.“I chose five cities,” she says. “We then thoroughly researched those cities. We created databases. We looked at schools, youth groups, art groups, music groups. We talked to people that ran the clubs.”View image in fullscreenOwen Cooper as Jamie Miller in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixOnce she was convinced that she had a good grasp of the cities, she put a flyer together. “We sent it out on social media, and all the places that we had spoken to, and then we essentially street cast,” she says. “We go, we talk to people, we hand out flyers, we engage with people. It’s a lot of work, and it takes time, but that’s how you get the best results.”After this phase, Baig and her team received 600 audition tapes to sift through, and gradually went about whittling them down. “In the first rounds, we got people to do little improvs, and then every subsequent stage became a little bit more sophisticated. We would see people in the room, do a bit of improvisation with them. Then we’d recall, get them to work from script, until we got down to five.”Baig is keen to stress that every one of the final five candidates was “brilliant”, and they all ended up with roles on the show. Nevertheless, Cooper stood out. “Owen had this ability to really listen and connect with Stephen,” she says. “But also he wasn’t scared of repetition. We went over scenes time after time, trying different things. We wanted to push him to see where he could go, and he had this extraordinary focus for somebody so young. I mean, that’s a rare find.”This year has been a banner year for Baig. In the past, she has cast everything from Black Mirror to Giri/Haji to Peaky Blinders to Sherwood. But in 2025, in addition to Adolescence, she was responsible forA Thousand Blows,Toxic Town, Man Like Mobeen,The Death of Bunny Munroand BBC Three’s beautiful and underappreciatedJust Act Normal. As soon as you notice her name in the credits of a film or TV show, you can immediately be assured of its quality.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham (centre) in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Dan Smith/Disney+“I’m always working,” she says with a smile. “I’ve always been a bit of a workaholic, but I think Adolescence has made me more visible. I’d normally run a mile from doing anything like this interview. I’m quite shy, and I find these things quite difficult. But actually it’s really good to talk about casting, because it makes the profession more visible.”One of the issues with making filmed entertainment, be it movies or TV, is that people often assume that a director or showrunner controls everything from the top down. Is there a sense that this is changing, at least when it comes to casting?“It’s a collaboration, but like every other department – like a cinematographer, an editor, a costume designer – a huge amount of work and skill goes into creating a cast,” she says. “I think it’s really great that it’s suddenly being recognised.” This is certainly true when it comes to awards. Bafta recently started recognising casting on awards night, and the Oscars will feature it as a category from next year.“It’s great that the craft is being finally recognised as an essential element of film-making,” she continues. “Because it really is. If you don’t have the actors, you can’t make the thing.”Part of the job, she says, is being able to intuit the vision of the person in charge. “It’s my job to find the tone of a project,” she explains. “Some directors are more visual than others. Some are very focused on the script. Directors have all got different strengths. I like to work really closely with the director. Sometimes you don’t always agree with one another, but I have to find a way to make it work, because I’m not the director of the film. I want my directors to have the best experience they can with the cast that we’ve put in front of them. So I will always find a way to make it work, because I think I want to do what’s best for the film.”After starting her career as a production assistant in the 1990s, Baig found herself being drawn more and more towards actors. She eventually became an assistant to Debbie McWilliams, the James Bond casting director , before setting up shop on her own at the start of the century.View image in fullscreenSam Buchanan and Chenée Taylor in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeHowever, during this time she noticed an imbalance in the industry. “There weren’t really many other people like me,” she says. “Working-class, from Birmingham, mixed race. Even now, it’s not really a very representative industry, and that has to change.” And so she began to work with Open Door, an organisation that seeks to help young actors who lack the resources and financial means to attend drama school.“Being able to go to drama school is a privilege, and it can feel quite a long way away for many, many people,” she says. “Applying for drama school is expensive. Travel to your auditions is expensive. Open Door has worked really hard to break down some of those barriers. We work with people on movement, on voice, on auditions. We pair people with buddies, so they have somebody to connect to who has got a career. It’s all about making sure there are people in our industry that are recognisable to you.”Happily, it’s paying off. “I’ve really noticed a difference,” she says. “Open Door has been going for nearly 10 years, and I’ve seen a real change in intake at drama schools. So many of our students have been successful and are working and have got really good careers.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreBaig’s 2026 looks set to be just as busy as this year. Already on the slate is Daisy Haggard’s Scottish-set thriller Maya. “The scripts are stunning,” she says. “Beautiful. She’s such a gifted writer.” Then there’s Riz Ahmed’s Bait, about a struggling actor who lands a big role, and the upcoming Peaky Blinders film. But, still, surely there’s still time to luxuriate a little in the success of Adolescence.“I’m so happy that Warp Films are getting their flowers,” she says, deflecting. “They have been doing brilliant work for a really long time. They’re great people. They care about people. They’ve got a proper moral code. They’re great role models. Stephen Graham’s a great role model, too. It has all just been a really positive experience.”More than anything, though, you sense that Shaheen Baig is really just thrilled for Owen Cooper, and all the things he’s bound to achieve in his career.“He’s looking fantastic,” she says, like a proud mum. “There are a lot of very fancy photoshoots with him at the moment.” She pauses for a second, then adds. “He’s still got to do his GCSEs, though. That’ll bring him down to earth.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescenceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

For decades, Ken Bonham, a retired teacher, has made memory boxes of places he has visited with his dressmaker wife of 54 years, Maggie, each made up of items they have collected on their travels or Bonham has made.Models of barns, castles and churches are also crammed into the property – made from cork, balsa wood, styrofoam – or 3D card elevations from Bonham’s photos. Each Christmas, Bonham delights his neighbours by crafting nativity scenes from items he has collected and crafted.Celebrating architecture, geography, history of art with a touch of satire, Bonham’s creations are in part inspired by his years teaching integrated studies to schoolchildren.“It’s the story of my life,” Bonham said, of the collection of dioramas that fills the couple’s home. “There’s card models that I make from my photographs, which I’ve written abookabout, and then there’s my model barns, and the life boxes and the memory boxes that I make of our travels.”View image in fullscreenKen Bonham, a retired teacher, surrounded by his memory boxes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianExplaining how he started making the memory boxes, Bonham said: “When it was my wife’s 60th birthday I asked her if she’d like a diamond ring and she said she’d sooner go to Italy. So we went to Italy and fell in love with Rome and all things Italia. So when I came back I made a display of them.“Now, we’ll go on holiday, collect postcards, tickets to museums, miniatures of various things, figures and things that are, I don’t like the word, but iconic. And then, when I get home I arrange them all in a order of some sort and then make a box. Some of them will hang on the wall, some of them are freestanding on a shelf.“I’ve done one of our visits to Paris and another one of our train trip down through the south of France when we went to Avignon.View image in fullscreenKen Bonham with his wife, Maggie.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian‘The Irish trip has got Celtic crosses, card models that I made from my photographs of some of the Celtic monasteries, some model stones of the Celtic stones, a small souvenir of Georgian doorways in Dublin, a model of Trinity College Dublin and a mini bottle of Guinness.“The British box has got my model toy soldiers from when I was a kid, some of my toy cars, sand from various beaches, England’s Glory matchboxes, a telephone box and a London transport bus, a lighthouse, a Royal Lifeboat man and various animals – and the whole thing hangs on the wall and it’s 4ft high and 3ft wide.“And then on another Italian trip, we went to Naples, which is where the Nativity scenes started.”View image in fullscreenA 3D model of a nativity scene made by Ken for the foyer of the block of flats where he lives.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianKen, a lifelong modelmaker, traces his interest back to childhood, when his grandfather “used to come and have Friday tea – and always bought me a bag of wood offcuts and half a pound of mixed nails”. His father was “a metal polisher at Daimler … so I sort of inherited the gene”, he adds.Now 79, Bonham’s creations and outlook on life have built a loyal following onFacebook. “I’m not interested in arguing politics,” he said. “I’m not interested in criticising other people’s photographs.

Happy holidays!Jack SealeWed 24 Dec 2025 17.35 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 17.37 ESTShareSitcoms aren’t meant to go anywhere: the default setting is one location full of characters who keep resetting to zero. Few have followed that rule as faithfully as Two Doors Down, a low-key comedy set on a middle-class close on the outskirts of Glasgow and focusing on retirement-age couple Eric and Beth Baird (Alex Norton and Arabella Weir), whose quiet life is forever interrupted by their eccentric neighbours inviting themselves in. That might be why it’s stayed on air for more than a decade: it’s never essential but always entertaining enough. You know what you’re getting.The show prefers to stay put in the Bairds’ lounge, and if it does venture elsewhere it will usually just be to someone else’s house – nothing flashy. Domestic trivia takes precedence over big events; laughs are more often from what’s said than big visual gags. Emotions are kept in check, too. Wry British comedy that plonks itself down on suburban sofas – Abigail’s Party, The Royle Family, Mum – tends to have wrenching pathos lurking, with the characters harbouring either desperate sadness or reserves of affection for each other that they ultimately can’t keep hidden. Two Doors Down doesn’t bother with all that. After years of getting to know them, Beth would still rather her neighbours didn’t pop in.But pop in they will. After the death of co-creator Simon Carlyle, Two Doors Down ended in 2023 after seven seasons, but is now back for a festive episode that’s solely the work of Carlyle’s writing partner, Gregor Sharp. He keeps it simple by returning to the Baird house, with Beth once again answering the door and being disappointed to find chief gatecrasher Christine (Elaine C Smith) on the step. It’s late November, and yet the Bairds have their Christmas tree up! What are they playing at?View image in fullscreenThe gang’s all here … Two Doors Down Christmas Special.Photograph: BBC Studios Scotland/Graeme HunterHaving explained to Christine that they were in the loft having a clear out, saw the tree and thought why not, and they didn’t see why it would cause any fuss – they’re sitcom characters, so they never learn – Eric and Beth then have to go over the same ground with yuppie poser Colin (Jonathan Watson) and his rude, dipsomaniac other half Cathy (Doon Mackichan), sweet young Michelle (Joy McAvoy) and her blithe lunk of a hubby Alan (Graeme Stevely), and the Bairds’ son Ian (Jamie Quinn) and his boyfriend Gordon (Kieran Hodgson).The first topic of conversation is, because she will not shut up about it, Christine’s imminent odyssey to Ireland to meet her long-lost family. She is across the key details: “Apparently, the cooked breakfasts on board the Stena Line are excellent. Irene up the high flats told me they serve a black pudding that is technically illegal on dry land.”‘People were in tears on set’: the emotional return of word-of-mouth sensation Two Doors DownRead moreTwo Doors Down has a lot of lines in that vein – reports of outlandish things said and done off-screen rather than dialogue flowing from the characters’ present situation. If you wanted to cry humbug you could say the former is a writer’s cheap shortcut, although Victoria Wood used to get away with it pretty well. The show’s other stock in trade is giving Cathy, Colin, Christine or Alan something baffling or insensitive to say, then showing us Eric, Beth or Michelle’s reaction face. There’s plenty of that as the talk moves on to Michelle’s pregnancy (Christine agrees that baby clothes are cute “until they soil them”), the refusal of charity shops to accept donations of secondhand pants, and how Gordon is getting on with his new life as a mature student, majoring in sociology and literature. “You’re no bothered about getting a job after, are you?” observes Colin.The gang’s all here, and it’s reassuring to know that the gathering will follow a familiar pattern. Just as the mundane chat threatens to drag, a big faux pas looms, this time when woke brainbox Gordon – who’s already caused an amusing stir with his use of the word “ubiquitous” – weighs in on a debate about which seasonal pop song is best. His opinions on Band Aid and particularly the Pogues do not go down well: “You cannae even have a bit of homophobic swearing in a Christmas song any more!” blasts Colin. With the hilariously monstrous Cathy losing her thin veneer of civility – her calling Eric a “big stupid donkey” for no reason is a highlight, as is her inexplicable habit of subjecting Gordon to aggressive physical flirtation – a hysterical momentum starts to build.A Christmas special might be the time to let this develop fully into farcical chaos – but no, it’s still a 30-minute run time, and so Two Doors Down retains its normal policy of cutting to the end credits just as it looks like exploding. It’s safely back where it started.Two Doors Down Christmas Special aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to create meaning beyond the festive seasonElle HuntWed 24 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 12.02 ESTShareHow do you celebrate the end of the year?Office parties can be a drag, but if you’re self-employed, it can be easy to roll without ceremony from one year into the next. Three years ago, two friends and I were bemoaning the lack of festivities and decided to make up for it by organising our own end-of-year lunch.It has become a beacon in my calendar: we find a restaurant we’ve been wanting to try, book the afternoon off and count down to the date. It always feels special and memorable.That’s the power of ritual, says Erin Coupe, a transformation coach and author of I Can Fit That In: How Rituals Transform Your Life. She defines rituals as “intentional, rhythmic choices” that bring us energy, presence and meaning.At this time of year, it’s traditional to take stock and set intentions for the next. But rituals aren’t just for special occasions, Coupe argues – they can elevate everyday life. Here are her tips for creating more meaning during the festive season and beyond.Instead of spending money, look for meaningAs well as repetition, structure and action, rituals are defined by intention and meaning, says Coupe. By contrast, routines often carry obligation or duty, and can be carried out mindlessly.A ritual “fills you up”, Coupe says: “You are purposely choosing to do it because you want to, and you know that it’s going to stir something within you.” This also distinguishes rituals from superficial versions of “self-care” that require you to spend money.Use ritual throughout the yearThere’s scope to create your own traditions. “Some rituals might be annual, or seasonal,” Coupe says. Instead of exchanging holiday gifts, Coupe’s family takes a holiday in early January: “That experience is the ritual, being together.”The same could apply to something like my freelance festive lunch. Enshrining amonthly meal or weekly callas a ritual makes it more meaningful and more likely to be prioritised, Coupe says: “There’s a cadence to it. It’s something you look forward to.”Think beyond resolutionsInstead of setting resolutions, Coupe chooses a single word to guide her year, based on what she wants to cultivate: for example, abundance, clarity or peace. She displays her chosen word prominently in her home. It’s “less daunting” than a resolution, she says, focusing on smaller and more immediate opportunities for change.Coupe also conducts an annual review of her work, looking at what went well, what she could do without and what she wants to pursue more of. Without such check-ins, she says, it’s easy to spend the year “just going through the motions”.More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?Check in with yourselfIt’s hard to bring more meaning to life if you don’t know what’s meaningful to you. “You have to be clear on what fills you up and what drains you,” Coupe says. She recommends making self-reflection a ritual – through journaling, meditation, yoga or a regular walk without headphones.Self-awareness is not the same as self-analysis or self-criticism. Coupe thinks of it as gaining understanding of your thoughts, and limiting beliefs and ways in which “you are working against yourself”.“If you’re not actually aware of what is moving within you, it can’t change,” Coupe says. “You’ve got to look at what’s going on inside and understand that, then start to shift.”When Coupe was working a stressful corporate job while raising two young children, she used to get up at 5.15am just to enjoy 45 minutes alone.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'“That was my time,” she says. It helped her cope better with work pressures, and gradually improved her mood and resilience. “I was more grounded, peaceful and becoming more patient, all because I was fueling something within myself,” she says.Be deliberate about where you spend energy“You can’t say yes to everything,” Coupe says, “so how do you intentionally choose?”This year, I turned down some festive invitations so I could be present at others. In the past, I’d have tried to make them all, stretching myself mentally and financially. Unexpectedly, being selective increased my anticipation and enjoyment.Removing activities we only do out of obligation or habit creates space for more restorative ones. For years, Coupe had a glass of wine after work to “take the edge off”. She eventually stopped after realising it was more of a drain than a boost: “There was no intention – it was just something I did.”Elevate your everydayA ritual should feel special, even in a small way, and connect you to the present moment, says Coupe, “but it doesn’t have to be a grandiose thing”. Small actions can create space and improve our sense of control.Coupe suggests setting an intention while making your morning tea or coffee, saying: “You’re allowing your mind to just be present, and not automatically jump into having your energy and attention taken away from you.”Try reframing routines as rituals. I’ve long been haphazard about making my bed each morning; now, noticing how much calmer I feel afterward makes it seem less like a chore.One of Coupe’s friends realised her 6am yoga class was actually a private ritual. The mindset shift enhances our appreciation of such activities, Coupe says: “You’re viewing it from a place of growth and intention, instead of monotony and obligation.”Make the most of transitionsRituals can help mark transitions, such as the end of the working day. For those working from home, that might mean closing your laptop, clearing your desk or shutting the door to your workspace, if you have one, Coupe suggests.Listening to upbeat music on your commute or changing out of work clothes can also signal that it’s time to switch off.A few nights a week, Coupe takes a bath as part of her wind-down ritual, reading a book in the tub before bed. She also recommends spending 15 minutes on Sundays planning for the week ahead, noting potential stressors and ways to ease them where possible.For Coupe, embracing rituals was key to easing the daily grind and centering meaning and connection. If you create moments that feel special, that can help you to see life differently, she says.I’ve been surprised by how easy and effective it’s been to introduce new rituals. Things I once avoided, like chores or taking breaks, became more appealing when I focused on what they meant and reframed them as a deliberate choice.It’s inspired me to look for more opportunities to create rituals, especially those that connect me with others. Rituals aren’t just for Christmas. In fact, at the end of my festive lunch, we agreed to do it again sooner.I Can Fit That In: How Rituals Transform Your Life by Erin Coupe is out nowExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?Mental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his two trilogies – which came to a close this year – were a celebration of humanity and imaginationMatthew CantorWed 24 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 13.31 ESTShareTwenty years ago, I visited the Botanic Garden in Oxford for the first time. Among the winding pathways lined with flowers, about halfway back, stood a bench under a tree, largely identical to the others throughout the park.Was this the one?I wondered.I didn’t have to question it for long. A closer look revealed words and images etched along its wooden slats, all along similar lines: “Lyra + Will”, they said. Or: “Pantalaimon” and “Kirjava”. Tucked between the bench’s arm and seat was a folded-up scrap of paper with a handwritten message of thanks.That was five years after The Amber Spyglass, the final novel in Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy, was published; this was the bench at the center of the book’s heart-wrenching conclusion. Visit it today and there’s no doubt about its literary significance: a statue of two of those characters, the animal-shaped Pantalaimon and Kirjava, wasplaced behind the benchin 2019.25 years of His Dark Materials: Philip Pullman on the journey of a lifetimeRead moreAfter His Dark Materials, Pullman wrote The Book of Dust, a second trilogy set in the same world(s). In October, the final book in that trilogy, The Rose Field, was published, bringing readers’ time with Lyra Silvertongue, the fantasy series’ protagonist, to a close. It marks the end of one of the great literary accomplishments of recent decades: theGuardian listedThe Amber Spyglass among its top 10 books of the 21st century, andthe BBC,Newsweekand other prominent publications have made similar assessments. The original trilogy has inspired a film, a BBC/HBO series, a National Theatre production and aKate Bush song. The two trilogies and companion books havesold more than 49m copies; the original has beentranslated into 40 languages. Many children arenow named Lyra(not least Ed Sheeran’s kid).If the first trilogy’s success – and its critical portrayal of organized religion – marked Pullman,in the wordsof the British columnist Peter Hitchens, as “the anti-[CS] Lewis, the one atheists would have been praying for, if atheists prayed”, the second warns against excessive rationality – or “what happens if you go too far the other way”, as another fantasy author,Lev Grossman, put it. Thirty years after the publication of Northern Lights (The Golden Compass in the US), the second trilogy has expanded our understanding of Lyra’s world, and in turn helps us process our own.His Dark Materials tells the story of a (roughly) 12-year-old girl’s journey between worlds, initially to rescue a friend but ultimately to confront the mysteries of the universe – and save it. In the process, she grapples with threats from a powerful religious organization as well as her own parents, and falls in love with Will, a boy from our own world. She encounters witches, talking bears and scientists studying dark matter, as well as perhaps the series’ two most memorable conjurings: daemons and Dust. Each person has a daemon, an animal companion that is physically separate but fundamentally a part of them, representing a portion of their identity. Dust is the stuff of consciousness: largely invisible particles that accumulate around people as they grow up and become aware of themselves, and which guides Lyra as she reads her truth-telling device, the alethiometer, or titular golden compass.View image in fullscreenPhilip Pullman before speaking at the 2018 Edinburgh International Book Festival, in Edinburgh, Scotland.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianHis Dark Materials was originally marketed as a children’s series, though Pullman isskeptical of the ideathat a book’s audience should be so clearly designated. I first read His Dark Materials as a teenager and found the books thrilling and deeply moving; I remember stumbling around in an emotional haze, to the detriment of my summer job, in the 24 hours after finishing them. In rereadings over the years – and especially after being forced, as a student, to read the epic 17th-century poem Paradise Lost, one of the series’ key inspirations – I have been in awe at their stunning scope. They investigate the most fundamental questions of what it means to be human – about growing up, consciousness, imagination, religion, science, morality, sexuality and the importance of storytelling – without ever losing their enormous sense of adventure.The books understand that children crave stories on the epic scale, that infinity is not too large for themKatherine RundellThe first trilogy is primarily about the transition between youth and adulthood, or, as the 18-19th century poet William Blake – another major influence on the series – would put it, innocence and experience, and what we gain and lose in the process. In a rebuttal to traditional narratives that understand Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden as a total disaster, His Dark Materials celebrates the acquisition of knowledge and the development of sexuality. In the books, the powerful church, known as the Magisterium, seeks in effect to prevent children from growing up; Lyra and Will are central to the fight against the organization.In this, the books can be read as a rebuttal to another Oxford-based children’s writer, CS Lewis, whose Narnia series reflects his devotion to Christianity. Pullman called the Narnia books “nauseating drivel” in the Guardian in 1998, condemning their religious allegory and Lewis’s views on women. The character Susan, for instance, is (69-year-old spoiler alert) barred from heaven because she is too interested in “nylons and lipstick” and growing up. Pullman developed a reputation as Lewis’s atheist opposite.And indeed, the books have faced extensive religious backlash: a 2008 list by the American Library Association found Pullman’s novels were thesecond-most-targeted for censorshipin the US that year. The biggest driver, the ALA believed, was the film version of the first book, The Golden Compass , whichfaced a boycott campaignby the Catholic League.Pullman has made no secret of his antipathy for much of organized religion. “If there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against,” he toldthe Telegraphin 2002, in remarks that echo what happens in the novels. “As you look back over the history of the Christian church, it’s a record of terrible infamy and cruelty and persecution and tyranny.”View image in fullscreenDavid Harewood and Lesley Manville in a 2004 stage production of His Dark Materials at the National Theatre in London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut to suggest that Pullman, now 79, is out to undermine religion itself would be a vast oversimplification. In the same interview, he called himself an agnostic: “Atheism suggests a degree of certainty that I’m not quite willing to accede to.” He valued his experience growing up in the Church of England: “The beauty of the liturgy, the hymns, the psalms, the Bible and so on – this is something that’s very deeply part of me,” he told theBBCin 2004. And in a 2014 interview withAeon, he reflected further: “I’m religious, but I’m an atheist. I think religious questions are the big questions. Where did we come from? What is life about? What is evil?” And he has celebrated much of religion’s intent, if not its execution. “The original impulses of the great religious geniuses – with whom I include Jesus – were, as often as not, something that all of us would benefit from studying and living by,” hetold the Guardianin 2002. “The churches and priesthoods would benefit more than most.”The Book of Dust, the second trilogy set in Lyra’s world – and one which, Laura Millerwrites at Slate, is “manifestly for adults” – adds more nuance to these questions: a sisterhood of nuns, for instance, plays a heroic role, and the books make it clear that Pullman’s assessment of organized religion does not equate to an embrace of ruthless rationality. He is critical of Richard Dawkins’ skepticism of fairytales, which the biologist hascalled“very unscientific”. In The Book of Dust, a 20-year-old Lyra falls victim to the writings of two popular authors who are determined to see the world as a collection of meaningless facts and circumstances: “It was nothing more than what it was,” one writes. The authors are so enamored of doubt that they question the very existence of daemons in a world full of them.Her interest in these writers drives a wedge between her and her own daemon, the strong-willed pine marten Pantalaimon, leading him to leave her side – an extraordinary separation in Lyra’s world – in an attempt to restore her imagination, a faculty that daemons themselves may represent. As she pursues him, and becomes entangled in a far-reaching conflict involving roses with mystical properties, she is often reminded, by other characters and her own experiences, of the potency of an unseen world of fairies, ghosts and other fantastical creatures that operates just out of our sight. As Lev Grossmanwrites in the Atlantic, Pullman is “adding to his religious skepticism a skepticism about skepticism itself”. In one of the more recent novels’ many parallels with our own universe, a leading figure in the Magisterium suggests that “we should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.”View image in fullscreenDafne Keen and Ruth Wilson in a scene in the BBC/HBO TV series, His Dark Materials (2022).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAnd while the Magisterium retains its stranglehold on Lyra’s world, others compete or join with it for the title of Most Evil. They include familiar figures such as a self-serving polemicist, and shadowy alliances between governments and corporations seeking to take advantage of a precious resource. A company boss manipulates the media, touting his ability to “curate” the news. Those few dedicated to justice are driven out of government, and the public is fed false explanations for political acts. As a wise character points out, nefarious forces always have an advantage because “evil can be unscrupulous, and good can’t.”In reading the six books, along with the short companion stories Pullman has written, it becomes clear that the antagonist is not spirituality – or even organized religion per se. The chief threat is something closer to dogma or absolutist thinking, and the authoritarian mindset that often accompanies it. There’s no question that His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust criticize certain worldviews – but they are less an attack on specific factions or sects than they are a testament to “the spirit of free inquiry”, as Sophia Nguyen puts it in theWashington Post.And perhaps more than religion, more than investigations of consciousness or authority, Pullman’s greatest commitment may be to storytelling itself –an essential, “nourishing” human function that helps us to grow. “I think we can learn what’s good and what’s bad, what’s generous and unselfish, what’s cruel and mean, from fiction,” the author said in a2005 lectureat the University of East Anglia. He has discussed at length a sense of responsibility to the stories he tells; 30 years spent shaping Lyra’s world is a testament to this ethic.View image in fullscreenPhilip Pullman’s The Book of Dust books on display at Waterstones in London.Photograph: Kathy deWitt/AlamyIt is also a testament to the vividness of his writing that, unlike other wildly successful fantasy series – Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games – and in spite of several attempts, his stories have never felt like a multimedia franchise. Lyra’s adventures are most potent when rooted to the page, perhaps because no one else has quite figured out how to convey Pullman’s themes so convincingly.Lyra’s last story – exclusive extract from Philip Pullman’s final instalment in The Book of Dust trilogyRead morePullman’s stories, for me, have provided a framework for understanding the world. For instance, visible or not, we all have something like daemons: sides of ourselvesthat can offer clarity, act as a check on our behaviors, or reinforce our worst impulses.Dust, particles akin to dark matter, suggests a self-awareness in the universe, a celebration of consciousness, and is probably the most appealing depiction of a force outside ourselves I have ever encountered, as a committed agnostic. The flow state Lyra achieves when studying the alethiometer offers anaspirational concept of creativity.“The books understand that children crave stories on the epic scale, that infinity is not too large for them,” the children’s author Katherine Rundell recently told theNew York Times. And child or no, when I read these novels, their boundlessness, their wrestling with the most profound questions we face, makes me feel somehow more alive and grateful to be part of a brilliant, unique, altruistic and infuriatingly selfish species.Pullman has spoken at length about his trepidation about the fantasy genre; he never wanted to be a JRR Tolkien type, inventing a world for its own sake. Instead, “I had to try to use all my various invented creatures – the daemons, the armored bears, the angels – to say something I thought was true and important about us, about being human, about growing up and living and dying,” he said in a 2002 speech. “This, finally, is what I think the value of fantasy is: that it’s a great vehicle when it serves the purposes of realism, and alot of old cobblerswhen it doesn’t.” Two trilogies have shown us Lyra’s world is very real. A much-graffitied bench in the Oxford Botanic Garden is proof.Explore more on these topicsPhilip PullmanFictionFantasy booksReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And there’s the issue that things may get worse before they get betterWed 24 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 08.52 ESTShareAll governments go through bad patches, when nothing seems to go right and voters turn against them. Often they bounce back from the midterm blues and go on to be comfortably re-elected. That said, Labour’s current unpopularity is in a class of its own. It is not just the scale of its problem, with opinion polls suggesting support for the partyhas almost halved, from 34% to 18% since the 2024 general election. Nor is it simply the speed at which disillusionment with the government has set in, though that too is unprecedented.What’s really remarkable is that the public is not normally this negative about a government unless the economy is in the deepest of slumps. If the UK had double-digit unemployment and house prices were crashing, Labour’s political predicament would be a lot easier to explain.Clearly, 2025 has been a far from vintage year for the economy, but it hasn’t been that bad either. Britain has trundled on in much the same way it has since the global financial crisis of 2008. Economic performance has been mediocre but not disastrous.True, growth has slowed since a strong start to 2025 and unemployment has edged up. At 5.1%,the jobless rateis a full percentage point higher than when Labour came to power in July 2024, but still a long way short of the levels seen in the deep recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. What’s more, for those in work, living standards have been rising, because wage growth has outpaced inflation. Governments normally benefit when voters are better off, but this one hasn’t.Past Labour governments have been through much worse years without suffering such a marked drop in public support. In 1947, Clement Attlee’s administration was buffeted by a series of adverse shocks, with fuel shortages during a brutally cold winter followed by a sterling crisis in the summer. Rationing imposed during the second world war was still in force.In 1975, inflation hit a postwar peak of 25%, eventually leading to a run on the pound and spending cuts imposed on Jim Callaghan’s government by the International Monetary Fund in late 1976 as the price of securing a loan. It took many years for Labour to recover from that humiliation.More recently, in 2008, the near-collapse of the banks during the global financial crisis led to the economy shrinking for more than a year. From peak to trough,the economy shrankby more than 6%. In the past year ithas grownby slightly more than 1%.Labour is confident that its political fortunes will improve, as voters start to feel the benefits of rising incomes and lower interest rates. That certainly happened in the past, although the impact has not always been enough to save the party from defeat at the subsequent election.Attlee narrowly won in 1950 and secured Labour’s highest-ever vote share, despite losing the 1951 election. The economy grew strongly in the two years after the IMF loan, and by 1978, Callaghantoyed with the ideaof holding an autumn election. He eventually lost in May 1979, as did Brownin May 2010.Starmer is the most unpopular prime ministeron record. His approval ratings are worse than those of Callaghan – who, even after the strikes in the 1978-79 winter of discontent,remained a more popularchoice for prime minister than Margaret Thatcher – and of Gordon Brown, who ran out of time in 2010 but still did well enough to deprive David Cameron of an overall majority.It is far from clear why the present Labour government has lost public support more extensively and more rapidly than those of the 1940s, 1970s and 2000s, even though economic conditions have been more benign. Almost certainly it is a combination of factors: life isgenuinely tough for many people, especially for the young; the public’s patience has worn thin after a decade-and-a-half of flatlining living standards; Labour’s lack of a real plan has been exposed; issues other than the economy –such as immigration and asylum– may now influence voters more than they once did.One thing seems obvious. There is no guarantee that voters will reassess their view of Labour even if – and this seems unlikely – the economy really starts to motor in 2026. On the contrary, things are likely to get worse before they get better, partly as the result of policy errors by the Bank of England and the Treasury. The Bank has been too slow in cutting interest rates, andlast week’s downward movefrom 4% to 3.75% was a classic case of too little, too late. Rachel Reeves, for her part,made it more expensiveto hire workers by raising employers’ national insurance contributions in her 2024 budget.All governments make mistakes, and they need not be fatal. But Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time on its hands to turn things around, even though the next election could be as far away as the summer of 2029 and much can happen in that time.Yet, the economy ends 2025 with precious little forward momentum. Business confidenceis weak, and high street spending by consumersfell in both October and November. The rate cut from the Bank of England was a response to an economy that is not simply sluggish, but in real distress.So here’s the rub: the government is already phenomenally unpopular. There would be no coming back from a recession – even a relatively short-lived and shallow one.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)OpinionEconomicsLabourEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Indeed, this new cultural ritual is now a social media staple that sweeps across our feeds over the festive period. We post about intergenerational debates on politics; stomaching “wokeness” jokes; and the now near-mythical “uncle” character – the older male holding court at the table – exemplified by tweets that go something like: “My uncle just went on a 10-minute rant about [insert topic]. The turkey is dry and so is his take.”In these situations, many of us are torn between the impulse to call out harmful speech and our (or more often, our mother’s) longing for family harmony. These micro-yuletide tensions are played out at dinner tables across the country and are indicative of broader cultural and political polarisation. Polarisation is amplified by the social media-driven information silos in which we all now live.This year, rather than suggesting ways to deal with whatever echo chamber your in-laws have found themselves in, I am advocating for a new approach. That is, instead of trying to debate loved ones on the details of their own personal “filter bubble” or “you loop”, it might be better for us to step back from the minutiae and together discuss the technological processes pushing us all down more and more segregated and specific pathways.For context, a “filter bubble” is a concept proposed by the digital activistEli Pariser. He argues that there is no longer a singular internet but rather as many internets as there are users, as algorithms continue their ever-increasing attempt to personalise our online experience and feed us more “relevant” content. This means you could be seeing completely different news, ideas, culture and – arguably – facts from someone sitting next to you on a bus or on your own sofa.Let’s take a minute to reflect on the financial structures at play here: on social media, our time, and our attention, is a product that is sold to advertisers. This process has been labelled the “attention economy” or the “algorithmic economy”. My research has looked at the way in which, through the attention economy, algorithms can allow harm and misinformation to flourish. Because misinformation is often more attention-grabbing than the truth. And harm – or things that hook into our insecurities – might hold us there just that little bit longer. That extra attention, that engagement, is what advertisers are paying for. I’m nowhere near the only one who has researched this. Other researchers have looked at this same phenomenon around a variety of topics:self-harm,violence,pornographyandpolitical radicalisation, to name a few.Even if you are getting your news from reputable mainstream sources, by way of news apps (eg Apple News or Google News), the articles you are fed will probably be on specific topics algorithmically tailored for you. Pariser uses the term “you loop” here, which researchers broadly apply to any algorithmic feed that shapes and ultimately limits the culture and information that we receive. Increasingly, new generations are consuming much less radio or terrestrial TV (which selects a variety of content, arguably, with a relatively balanced view). Instead, with the promise of immediacy, choice and personalisation, we turn to Instagram or TikTok, andOfcomreports that 88% of three– to 17-year-olds use YouTube. But now – even with all of the world’s content at our fingertips – do we actually see much less? Less difference of opinion? Less diverse content?The fear is that this process begins to shape who we are; not just kids, but all of us so-called “grownups”. “You loops” and “filter bubbles” can give way to echo chambers, which function by feeding each person a high dosage of information that confirms a very narrow worldview.There are, of course, many, many different echo chambers peddling different beliefs but employing the same digital processes. It might be your neighbour, who has done away with mainstream news, and is now only receiving information on Telegram; or your cousin, who’s now convinced that the moon landing was faked; or that nice mum at the school gates, who after being diagnosed with breast cancer began to follow a course of natural treatments pushed to her on Instagram instead of chemotherapy – she was a mum of two. And, if you’re willing to open your mind and look at this honestly, you might find that it’s you.There are ways to talk to people, to adults in your life, about these issues. We can step away from the minutiae of the arguments and speak about the broader structures that are facilitating these information pathways. It doesn’t matter if it’s your neighbour, cousin, the mum at school drop, or you (in whatever echo chamber you may have found yourself). What is important is to recognise these structures. And if someone in your life is in an echo chamber, rather than trying to debate them around the actual topic, try to help them step away and see the broader processes at play. In doing so, you can acknowledge your own “you loops”, “filter bubbles” and echo chambers. You can think critically about what you are consuming and encourage those you love to do the same. Together, we can question these technological processes. Together we can game our algorithms. Together we can take back control. Happy holidays.How to recognise an echo chamber, and what you can do about it.A: If everyone and everything that you are interacting with online has the same opinion as you and you only see content that confirms your point of view – and if certain news stories, people and themes come up over and over again – you are probably stuck in an echo chamber.B: If you think you might be in an echo chamber, look for alternative sources of information and other points of view. You don’t necessarily have to agree with them, but it is important to understand that they are there.How to talk to someone in your life who might be in an echo chamberTo recap, disinformation or things that elicit an emotive response are often algorithmically prioritised in the digital space. You can use this information when embarking on such conversations, and then:Be proactive, not reactive.Start conversations organically, rather than in reaction to a comment or event. This will set an objective tone. Make conversations short and often, rather than one big event.Think “big picture”.Focus the conversation on the overarching structures at play,perpetuated by the attention economy. Where possible, inspire agency around these topics by offering information about online processes and then let them do the critical thinking.Focus on the positive.For young people in particular, focus on positive examples, role models and narratives. This is often much more powerful than talking about the negative examples. Talk to older children and teens about what they can be rather than what they can’t.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

Would that happen now?Nell FrizzellI’ve taken in refugees from time to time, and formed ties that have lasted to this day. Instead of demonising people, we could try sharing our lives with themWed 24 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 09.07 ESTShareThere is one Christmas story from when my father first arrived in the UK, 43 years ago, that can still make me howl with laughter. It was a cold winter and my dad had been gripped by the idea of roasting chestnuts. He had grown up in the southern hemisphere, in a former British colony, so despite the fact that his Christmases were hot – spent in shorts and flip-flops – he had been surrounded by images of snowy churches, robin redbreasts, holly, ivy and, yes, chestnuts roasting on an open fire.And so, he headed out to Clapham Common in south London to collect conkers. They were chestnuts, after all. Horse chestnuts but hey, that’s still a chestnut. Or so he thought. And so, that evening when his British friends arrived at the house where he was staying, they were greeted by the suspiciously acrid smell of about 30 conkers, baking away in the little gas oven, plus a wild-haired man in his 20s primed to chomp into his tray of baked poison.View image in fullscreenBill Frizzell in 1981. He was a builder’s labourer at the time.Photograph: Bill FrizzellHopefully you all know already that unlike sweet chestnuts, horse chestnuts are, in fact, incredibly poisonous. Conkers are great for hitting against each other on bits of string. But roast them and eat them, and you could be looking at least a couple of nights in hospital. This story reminds me of two things. First, to never trust anything my father produces for dinner, and second, that everyone arriving in a new country needs friends. They need a home and they need a community. For company, for shelter, for a sense of belonging. But also, apparently, to stop them eating spiky-shelled poisonous nuts gathered from Clapham Common.I wonder what Shabana Mahmood would make of this idea. The home secretary seems to have a brutal, if not poisonous attitude to those reaching Britain seeking education, seeking the opportunity to work, and build a community and, in the case of many refugees, seeking to literally save their own lives. I am not traditionally a Labour voter and I am ashamed to have lent my vote to a government that could even countenance these ideas:seizing the jewelleryof desperate asylum seekers;refusing people citizenshipfor 20 years; continuing to deny refugees the right to paid work.Like many across the UK, I have hosted several asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants, through the brilliant Refugees at Home organisation. While my son was between the ages of three and seven, we offered our home as emergency accommodation to young men from Sudan and Afghanistan. Because we have a small house and no actual spare room, we are only allowed to host for up to two weeks at a time, but when the alternative may be sleeping on the street, a sofa bed in the front room will do.The young men who have stayed with us have played football with my son, watched soap operas with us on the sofa, walked in the park and texted their friends and drunk a glass of milk with us at breakfast. They have often needed no more than a bed to sleep in, perhaps a meal or occasional cups of coffee, and the chance to do a single load of washing. The sort of things you would offer to anyone staying for a few nights at your house. Our first guest, who I will call G, still sends his love to my mother every time we speak. Once he passed his exams, he bought my baby a soft white babygrow to sleep in. He texts me to wish me a happy Eid and talks to my husband about Arsenal. He was a guest at my wedding and helped me weed my allotment and waves from his bike whenever I see him cycling through town.Children are taught from the first moment they pick up a wooden block at a playgroup that we are supposed to share. Sharing is what makes us successful as a species. Sharing is what makes us survive. Sharing is as innate to the human condition as singing and walking and eating. So I am grateful that my children are growing up seeing how easy, how important and how nice it is to share. I am glad that they have learned, at my knee, that if you have food in your fridge and a washing machine and radiators, you can share them with people who do not.When my baby no longer cries in the night, I will open my home to refugees again. It might mean cooking an extra potato or buying a few more tins of beans; but that is a very small sacrifice in the scheme of things. If these guests come to us in winter, they may well be forced to sit at the table and admire my children’s collection of sticks, and precious rocks and shining conkers. And I will think of my father, sun-baked, scruffy and far from home, stalking the wilds of Clapham Common, saved from a dinner of roasted aesculin by people who knew the importance of making someone feel at home.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

I am here to tell you this is totally wrong. There are situations when, yes, it is rude. There are situations when it basically doesn’t matter. But there are also situations when being late is actually the height of good manners and decorum.If you are invited to dinner, especially by a person who you can sense is an inexperienced cook or host, you should endeavour to be late. By at least 10 minutes I would say. But, honestly, if your host is a 25-year-old who has sent you a message saying, “I’m going to try making this :)” and then attached a picture of an elaborate recipe with two separate kinds of molasses, then I would say half an hour is probably best.Their oven gloves will have caught fire and they’ll have had to sort that out. They’ll forget to give themselves time to shower. They will have started a step and realised they’re missing key equipment and then they’ll have directed a piercing scream at the recipe book, and so forth. When you arrive half an hour late they will be so frantically grateful they’ll try to lick you. Just say, “Oh no, that’s fine, no need” if they do.There are other situations too. If you are going on a date with someone who has a huge crush on you, you should arrive 10 minutes late to give them time to calm down and sort themselves out. If you’re meeting a new mum with no baby attached you should be 15 minutes late to give her a rare window of time with her own thoughts or her book. If you’re meeting someone who is too rule abiding at the cinema you should disobey them and arrive after the adverts, to teach them that the meaning of life is to break the rules. Likewise, if you’re taking them to the airport, don’t let them get there three hours early.If you are going to break up with someone who is still in love with you, you should be half an hour late so they remember you as squalid and disorganised instead of perfect. If you are going to collect a beloved pet to rehome, you should be 20 minutes late to give everyone extra time to say goodbye or change their mind.There are many other such instances. You must use your own judgment. But instead of seeing good manners as a set of catch-all rules, my feeling is we should treat them instead as the answer to the question: what does this person truly need from me in this situation?Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsTime managementThe hill I will die onFriendshipDatingcommentShareReuse this content"

By 1945, after fleeing the Nazis first to Czechoslovakia, then Palestine, then Britain, Tergit had finished her novel, but it took until 1951 for The Effingers to be published. Even then, only a few German booksellers wanted it in their shops. It was too strange a piece of work for a German public that had watched, if not participated, in the Holocaust.Though overlooked at the time, it has been rediscovered as a classic in Germany, and has now beenpublished in English for the first time. It is a chronicle of three affluent Jewish families in Berlin between 1878 and 1942, with an epilogue set in 1948, based on Tergit’s return visit to her destroyed city. Tergit understood how dangerous the Nazis were. She was a court reporter and covered Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels on trial in the 1920s – this also made her a target, and she fled Berlin after narrowly escaping an SA (“Brownshirts”) raid in March 1933.It is eerie, reading The Effingers in 2025, that the Nazis’ rise to power is something that happens largely on the periphery of the protagonists’ lives. There is a sense that while they recognise them as bad actors, they nevertheless feel themselves insulated from the Nazis in their extravagant villas in Tiergarten, with their good dresses and connections.A similar atmosphere of overhanging political danger is apparent inCabaret, the 1972 film based on the Berlin novels of Christopher Isherwood. The Weimar republic is portrayed as a hedonistic time, and the Nazis only emerge slowly from the background. One character even says: “The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans – but they do serve a purpose: let them get rid of the communists and later we’ll be able to control them.” The sense of looming but underappreciated danger struck me as something contemporary.The Effingers by Gabriele Tergit review – a vivid portrait of Berlin before the NazisRead moreDiscourse on fascism is ubiquitous at the moment. Here in Germany it is being debated inarticles,books,exhibitionsand publiclecture series. There are arguments about whether the politics of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) can be called fascism, or whether this 21st-century form of rightwing authoritarianism is qualitatively different.In an attempt to better understand these historical precedents and our own times, I enrolled in an evening seminar on fascism entitled “Monsters” of Fascism Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, at the leftwing Berthold Brecht Literary Forum in Berlin. The central idea was, the lecturer explained, that being able to define fascism is the first step in increasing our resilience to it. Despite some challenges in determining a definition, we arrived at a few markers we could agree on: some attempt to create an ethnically “pure” nation, the engagement of a paramilitary force and use of excessive violence, anti-liberal and anti-democratic sentiments, and the involvement of wealthy backers from the economic elite.When the discussion turned to the AfD, and where we might position them on the spectrum, a depressing air hung over the seminar room. We were moving from the theoretical realm to the political reality of Germany in 2025, and, while the AfD does not have its own paramilitary force or use excessive violence, there are reasonable concerns about the other criteria. This is a party for whomwell over 30%of blue-collar workers and unemployed Germans voted in February’s federal elections. The AfD came in second overall nationally, winning 20.8% of the vote, with the CDU taking 28.5%. Thelatest pollinghas the AfD leading by 26% to the CDU’s 24%. The AfD is a party that has been deemed “rightwing extremist” by our ownFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.One delusion from history that Germany’s establishment is in danger of repeating is the idea that the old elites can maintain control over newly emerging powers on the extreme right. A few weeks before the 2025 election, the Christian Democrat (CDU) chancellor, Friedrich Merz,broke the so-called firewall– the agreement among all democratic parties not to partner with the AfD in parliamentary votes. Merz got a proposal to crack down on illegal migration through parliament with the support of the AfD. Since then, several CDU members have called on Merz to end the firewall altogether.When Germany commemorated the victims of the Nazi pogroms of November 1938 last month, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, our symbolic head of state, gavea speechin which he warned about the AfD in all but name. He called on Merz’s government to maintain the firewall, and even urged that legal options to ban anti-democratic political parties be considered. The prospect of banning the AfD has been debated extensively, but seems unlikely to happen; it also sidesteps tackling the roots of its support.For people wanting to resist rightwing extremism, one of the first priorities is to show solidarity with those who are under threat. InGermanyin 2025, this means mostly asylum seekers, specifically Syrians, Afghans and Ukrainians, but generally young men with migration histories. And there have been some public displays of such solidarity.In January 2024, millions of people went out into the freezing streets across Germany to protest against the notorioussecret “remigration” conference in Potsdam, attended by neo-Nazis and AfD members, and exposed by the investigative platform Correctiv. But neither this outrage nor concerns about the weakening parliamentary firewall seem to have made a lasting impact on Merz’s government.The bitter moral lesson of Tergit’s novel comes in the final letter, written by the elder Effinger on the way to the concentration camp: “I believed in the good in people – that was the gravest error of my misguided life.” We shouldn’t stop believing in the good in people, but we should also heed the warnings of history. What The Effingers teaches us is not to underestimate the danger of the fascist menace, and to fight on all fronts against it, before it is no longer possible.Tania Roettger is a journalist based in BerlinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whatever!The bigwigs in the top of the equator might have convinced the world of such, but that’s only because they lack the innate knowledge that us southern hemisphere folk know all too well: a warm Christmas is simply superior. This time of year is stressful enough – regardless of temperature – but hey, at least we don’t have to deal with seasonal depression on top of it all.And I’m not just speaking from the orifice that doesn’t have teeth, I spent my entire childhood in the cold during the festive season.BoM reveals Christmas Day forecast as nation sweats through extreme heatwaveRead moreDespite my entire family hailing from New Zealand, Dad’s job meant that big international moves were inevitable. I spent most of my younger years scattered across the UK (plus a quick stint in North Carolina), meaning that every time December rolled in I could expect a dark sky by 4pm and a crisp sting on my cheeks. The only upside was the fashion choices; layering is just so effortlessly chic.In fairness, a cold Christmas does have a lot else going for itself. It’s traditional, classic and I’d be lying if I said that the possibility of seeing snow isn’t enchanting. The cosy charm of a chilly celebration is pretty hard to dismiss as anything other than magical but, since my extended family was stuck on the other side of the world, I always felt like I was missing out on authentic merrymaking that not even the most decadent hot chocolate could make up for.Growing up so far from every cousin, uncle, aunt and grandparent meant that big reunions were things I only saw in movies, and I was green with envy over those that got to see extended family without having to endure a 30-hour flight. There was still something to love about sharing the holiday with just immediate family – plus hopping over to the local pub – it was just that it was so different to the Christmases that everyone else around me seemed to have.It was only when Dad’s job prompted another international move to Australia that I finally got to experience a proper festive family affair; joined by my uncle, aunt and grandma for the first time. Because there was a bigger crowd to entertain, Dad got especially experimental in the kitchen and created a heavily marinated vodka jelly, knocking everyone on their arse after two bites. We all slept pretty well that night.This was our Christmas routine for years – sharing the day with family, friends or a mix of both and water gun fights across the table – up until Dad once again answered the siren call of a new job opportunity from across the pond. Mum and Dad moved to the north of England, to one of the coldest parts of the entire country, right before the 2020 pandemic.When my brother and I visited for the first time in almost two years for Christmas, I expected a wave of nostalgic longing to hit me in full force. But instead of being paralysed by the overwhelming sensation of long-forgotten childhood memories, I found myself missing everything that made a summer Christmas so special. Sipping sangria in the sun. Noshing on piles of fresh fruit. Family and friends being just a phone call away. Hot-pink sunsets stretched across the sky.Suddenly, I was a hot-Christmas convert.This Christmas, let’s ban the world’s most miserable gift-giving game | Dave SchillingRead moreThen, when Dad died in 2024, Mum made the decision to permanently plant her roots back on this side of the world and return home to Aotearoa. The first Christmas without him was tough, his absence felt in every corner, but being once again surrounded by family (this time including my sister-in-law, her brothers and mum) plus the soft warmth of the sun helped ease the grief in monumental ways.All that to say, I am a massive hypocrite.I will be spending this Christmas during winter in South Korea; and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t excited to wander around Seoul in my fluffiest coat, holding out hope for the chance to catch a glimpse of snow. Cold Christmas propaganda still has a little hold on me – sue me!Still, I’m keen to return back home and experience another New Year’s Day under the light of the Australian summer sun. Knowing that my family – including my newborn nephew – will be close by as we enter 2026 gives me so much joy that little me was always yearning for.

Trump doesn’t have the right answerSusi Geiger and Théo BourgeronAmericans are not paying high prices because of other western countries. Pharmaceutical companies are to blameWed 24 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 13.26 ESTShareWhenDonald Trumpspoke about drug prices on 19 December, he struck a familiar note. Americans, he said, were paying far too much for medicines – and it was everyone else’s fault.There would be no talk of reining in private insurers or pharmaceutical profits. Instead, Trump blamed foreign governments for getting a better deal. Countries like France, Germany and Japan, he argued, were piggybacking on the United States by keeping their drug prices low.Later that day, at a rally in North Carolina, he performed an imaginary showdown with Emmanuel Macron. Trump claimed he had told the French president that France would have to double or triple its drug prices – and that France would ultimately give in. Thanks to this tough approach, Trump promised to cut US drug prices “by 700%”, a figure so nonsensical it barely merits scrutiny.Trump is right about one thing: the US system is a public health failure. Drug prices are eye-wateringly high. Millions of Americans struggle to afford essential medicines such as insulin. Private insurers add costs without improving access. The result is a country that spends more on healthcare than anyone else, yet has lower life expectancy than many poorer nations.But Trump’s explanation is wrong. Americans are not paying high prices so that European, Canadian, South Korean and Japanese citizens can enjoy cheap medicines. They are paying high prices because pharmaceutical companies charge what they can get away with.Other countries’ patients and their governments do pay less than Americans, but they hardly get medicines for free. Prices for new drugs are high and rising everywhere. The real winners are the shareholders of multinational pharmaceutical companies who have enjoyed extraordinary profits, dividends and share buybacks over the past two decades –more than $1,500bn between 2000 and 2018. A majority of them are US-owned. In 2024, US corporations made49% of the top 20 big pharma revenue.This matters because Trump’s outburst points to something bigger than campaign rhetoric. The United States is now turning against a global pharmaceutical system it helped to create.That system took shape in the 1990s, when rich countries pushed tough intellectual property rules through global trade agreements, especially the infamous 1994 Trips agreement. Patent rules were strengthened and harmonized worldwide, with devastating effects on many patients in countries dependent on generic manufacturing. The new patent rules overwhelmingly benefited large pharmaceutical firms based in the US, Europe and Japan.In return, through parallel trade agreements, poorer countries were offered access to rich markets for their manufactured goods and were drawn into global supply chains. The system delivered huge profits for pharmaceutical investors – but also restricted access to medicines and pushed prices ever higher.Today, that model is under strain. Pharmaceutical companies are spending a smaller share of their revenues on research, for innovations that are often judged less innovative by experts, while paying more out to investors. In 2024, the US pharma giant Pfizerspent just 18% of its revenue on internal research and development– while 27% went to shareholders through dividends and debt repayment. Innovation has slowed. Breakthroughs that transform public health are rarer, while ultra-expensive treatments for small groups of patients are becoming the norm.At the same time, countries outside the old system are catching up. China, for example, has built a large state-backed pharmaceutical industry and now produces vaccines and medicines without relying on western patents. Between 2021 and 2022, Chinese corporations alone were able to produce3.4bn Covid-19 vaccine doses, 28% of all doses produced at the time. Even countries such as Cuba were quick to develop their own vaccines through a state-controlled biotech ecosystem.From Washington’s point of view, the problem is that profits may have peaked. When US industries face that kind of pressure, they tend to look for someone else to pay. Trump’s answer is to target allies rather than companies.Instead of challenging pharmaceutical power at home, he wants to force European and Asian allies to pay more for US drugs, while pushing down prices for US citizens. It is a familiar strategy: use economic pressure on partners who depend on US military protection and have limited room to resist.This could leave governments in Europe and Japan in an awkward position. Their domestic pharmaceutical firms have long argued for higher domestic prices, closer to US levels. Private insurers would probably not object. But voters would – as public healthcare systems would quickly be unable to handle even more elevated price levels.Trump presents his plan as standing up for American patients. In reality, it protects the same corporate interests that made medicines unaffordable in the first place – while exporting the damage to others.Susi Geiger and Théo Bourgeron are the authors ofPeak Pharma: Toward a New Political Economy of Health(Oxford University Press)Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryOpinionUS healthcareDonald TrumpTrump administrationMedical researchHealthHealth insurancecommentShareReuse this content"

Warner would go on to notch his 21st Test century, but not without a spot of drama when one run shy. Pity poor Tom Curran, who thought he had claimed Warner on 99 after the batter had spooned to mid-on and the eager hands of Stuart Broad. However, a replay revealed the England bowler had overstepped and his maiden Test wicket was snatched from his grasp.That moment of torment typified England’s sorry Ashes campaign, though this fourth Test would end in a draw thanks to Alastair Cook’s stalwart 244. On day one, Warner’s relief was short-lived as three runs later he was caught behind off Jimmy Anderson.

Holding his ground for five minutes more than four hours stood Kevin Pietersen, unbeaten on 67, as England reached 226 for six. The rest of the tourists’ top six – bar Ben Stokes, snared by Mitchell Johnson’s third delivery with the second new ball – batted for an hour or more.Ryan Harris set the tone for Australia’s attack, although there were blips as Steve Smith missed a catch off Michael Carberry at third slip with the England batter on two, and a reprieve for Pietersen, on six. England’s totem was caught on the long-leg boundary by Nathan Coulter-Nile, only for the fielder to stumble over the boundary rope.Generosity to Pietersen continued as he was dropped on 41 by George Bailey at midwicket, though the loss of Joe Root’s wicket early in the afternoon session, caught off Harris, had England wobbling on 106 for three. Pietersen’s day-one resolve provided some cheer for Alastair Cook’s tourists, but Australia would go on to win by eight wickets.2010: Tremlett’s tremblersView image in fullscreenRicky Ponting edges a delivery and is caught by Graeme Swann in the slips off Chris Tremlett at Melbourne, 2010.Photograph: Mark Dadswell/Getty ImagesWith the series level after England, led by Andrew Strauss, had won in Adelaide, drawn at the Gabba and lost in Perth, Chris Tremlett – in the absence of an injured Stuart Broad – stole the show on a grey Melbourne morning. The quick ensured England established their grip on the Test and, like a terrier with a butcher’s bone, would not let it drop.The early signs were not promising as his first four balls went for 10 runs against Phillip Hughes and Shane Watson. Undaunted and launching turbo-charged deliveries that hit 86mph, his next sizzling 67 balls conceded only 16 runs while picking up four wickets as Watson, Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus succumbed. Then came the prized wicket of Ricky Ponting, who edged to Graeme Swann at second slip.By stumps on day one, Australia had been skittled for 98 and England were steaming ahead, 157 for nought in reply. They would go on to make 513, a daunting first-innings lead of 415 and a victory that spurred England to their first series triumph in Australia for 24 years.2006: Warne’s home town high fiveView image in fullscreenShane Warne celebrates his 700th wicket after bowling Andrew Strauss during day one of the fourth Test at Melbourne, 2006.Photograph: Kristian Dowling/Getty ImagesOn his final home town Test before retirement, Shane Warne laid waste to England’s batters, scratching out five for 159 on the opening day. Needing one more wicket to reach the milestone of his 700th wicket, he claimed it with his 20th delivery after England had won the toss and opted to bat, only to collapse, their last eight wickets tumbling for 58 runs. The victim? Andrew Strauss, as Warne’s leg-break spun into the stumps. His second scalp soon followed as Chris Read drove straight to short extra cover seven overs later.Glenn McGrath then claimed Sajid Mahmood, edging behind and Warne took his tally to 702 when Steve Harmison drove him straight to mid-on to delight most of the 89,155 MCG crowd. Stuart Clark claimed Andrew Flintoff’s wicket shortly after tea, edging to Warne at first slip. Kevin Pietersen mounted a rearguard, standing firm for more than 100 minutes, but only reaching 21 before holing out to Andrew Symonds at long-on. Symonds was also the catcher, this time at mid-on, to finish off the innings when Monty Panesar drove straight to him off Warne again.1986: Botham’s blitzView image in fullscreenIan Botham and Jack Richards celebrate as England retain the Ashes, beating Australia by an innings and 14 runs, in 1986.Photograph: Getty ImagesAfter a win and two draws, Mike Gatting’s tourists abiding unity prevailed in the fourth Test as they clinched the series at a gallop. The pressure was on Australia that Boxing Day morning in Melbourne, but it was Ian Botham, who had rarely been out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons that summer, who was in full carpe diem mode: England’s blunderbuss claiming five for 41 in 16 overs as well as pouching three catches at second slip. With Gladstone Small taking five for 48 in a man-of-the-match stint, Australia were all out by tea for 141.At stumps, England were a confident 95 for one. Then on to victory and raucous celebrations led by their cheerleader in chief, Elton John. Little wonder, then, that Botham would say this Ashes had been his favourite tour as an England cricketer.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamAustralia sportCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United host Newcastle in Boxing Day’s only Premier League fixture and Amorim was asked how he couldcompensate for Fernandes’s absencewhen the 31-year-old’s deputy, Kobbie Mainoo, is also injured.Amorim warns against panic buying after Fernandes joins Manchester United injury listRead more“It is impossible to replace Bruno but I said that this morning to the team – [that] we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, which is a lot of people need to step up,” the head coach said. “It is not just the creation. Every set piece he is the guy who is organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and understand we cannot rely on one player for everything.”Amorim also pointed to Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away with Cameroon and Ivory Coast respectively at the Africa Cup of Nations. “Sometimes we rely on Bruno for organisation and the creation. We have lost Bruno on set pieces, Bryan and Amad on set pieces, so this is massive for the team. He understands every position on the field, he pays attention to every detail. Every set piece when you have a substitution he is always the guy telling the other guys where they should be.“But that is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], Luke Shaw, all these guys. We need to step up to have more leaders in the group because this can happen to Bruno. It is not usual but this can happen so it is a big opportunity for the other guys. It is an opportunity for other players to step up and to show the leadership that we need.”Amorim was asked when Fernandes and Mainoo, who has a calf problem, may be available. He said: “Not for this game. They are recovering. I don’t think that is going to take a lot of time. I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno. I don’t want to say [how long for Fernandes]. I have an idea but let’s see.”At Villa Park Jack Fletcher – son of the former United midfielder Darren – made his debut on 73 minutes. Amorim suggested the 18-year-old midfielder was an option to cover for Fernandes and Mainoo. He said: “We have other players, we need to maybe try to see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that is why when we have this opportunity we have to give space to Jack and the other ones. We will find solutions.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

He then saved from Awad again before Abdel Raouf fired over with Sudan pushing for a way back into the game.However, their hopes suffered a significant blow six minutes before the break when the midfielder Salah Adel was dismissed for a second bookable offence after a challenge on Manchester City’s Rayan Aït-Nouri.Monged was beaten for a second time with 61 minutes gone when Mahrez accepted Mohamed Amoura’s fine pass and stepped inside the defender Mustafa Karshoum before finding the back of the net. The substitute Ibrahim Maza completed the scoring with his first senior international goal from Baghdad Bounedjah’s knock-down five minutes from time.Earlier in the day, Edmond Tapsoba headedBurkina Fasotoa dramatic 2-1 victoryagainst 10-manEquatorial Guineaas they struck twice in stoppage time to snatch the points.The Stallions dominated the first half of the opening Group E encounter at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, with Sunderland’s Bertrand Traoré and Brentford’s Dango Ouattara causing problems down the flanks, but ultimately had nothing to show for their efforts at the break.Equatorial Guinea’s problems mounted within five minutes of the restart when the defender Basilio Ndong was dismissed after a review of his clumsy challenge on Bertrand Traoré. Jesús Owono, theEquatorial Guineagoalkeeper, had to save from Ouattara after he had been played in by Gustavo Sangaré.Lassina Traoré, on as a substitute, had a 71st-minute strike ruled out for offside asBurkina Fasopiled on the pressure, but Marvin Anieboh put their opponents ahead against the run of play with a firm header from Carlos Akapo’s 85th-minute corner.However, there was a sting in the tail when Georgi Minoungou, who had also come off the bench, levelled five minutes into added time after Ouattara had carved his way into the box. Tapsoba then headed home the winner three minutes later after Owono had palmed away Cyriaque Irié’s cross.Côte d’Ivoire, the holders, squandered a number of chances but Amad Diallo’s goal early in the second half was enough to beatMozambique1-0. In the opening Group F game in Morocco, the Ivorians battled to break down their opponents in a competitive first half but took firm control after the break without converting the many chances they created.Diallo side-footed the ball into the net in the 49th minute to ensure the three-point haul in rainy conditions but the scoreline would have been a lot more emphatic had the Ivorians been sharper in front of goal.View image in fullscreenAmad Diallo scores for Côte d’Ivoire against Mozambique.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesWilfried Zaha, playing his first international in more than two years after his surprise recall for the Cup of Nations finals, wasted several chances and Franck Kessie had two-point-blank efforts saved by the Mozambique goalkeeper Ernan.The Ivorian substitute Vakoun Bayo also had an opportunity with an easy header in front of goal but somehow put it wide and in the 89th minute Bayo had an effort cleared off the line with Ernan caught well out of his goal. Mozambique brought on the winger Dominguez as a second-half substitute at the age of 42 years, one month and six days, becoming the oldest outfield player in tournament history, behind only the former Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary, who was 44 when he played in the 2017 final.Mozambique are still to win a match at the finals, stretching back to their tournament debut in 1986.

A Saudi Pro League (SPL) that had been moving away from signing big-name veterans is tempted by a player who will be 34 just as this season ends.Although playerssuch as Cristiano Ronaldoand Karim Benzema have been successes on and off the pitch, albeit incredibly expensive ones, the powers that be don’t want the SPL to be regarded as a retirement league in the sun for stars whose powers are waning. But Salah is different, the attraction intensified by the fact that he is the biggest-name player in the Arab world.Mohamed Salah hits late Afcon winner for Egypt to break brave Zimbabwe at the lastRead moreThis is a direction that many in the league want to move towards as it searches for an enduring identity on the global stage. Is the goal to become a rival to the Premier League, or perhaps to try to take second place behind England’s top tier in the marketplace? Or is there a different direction, now the initial wave of excitement and interest has tailed off?China found a decade ago that suddenly signing famous players guarantees short-term headlines butBeijing’s boom didn’t last long enoughto think about what would come next. Players such as Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba were back in Europe within months.Yet in Saudi Arabia, despite the headlines of impending doomwhen Jordan Henderson left earlyinto his Al-Ettifaq stint and Neymar’s injury-hit spell at Al-Hilal, the stars have largely stayed. Benzema, N’Golo Kanté, Sadio Mané, Riyad Mahrez and others are in their third seasons – Ronaldo, the face of it all, is in his fourth. Time is ticking for many of these in terms of contracts, and, well, time.View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson in action for Brentford. The midfielder left Liverpool for Saudi Arabia but stayed only six months.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesThere has been a noticeable move away from signing the veterans, with clubs still shopping in Europe but usually for those in their prime, such as last summer’s signings of Mateo Retegui, Darwin Núñez and Theo Hernández. There have also been many younger additions, such as Nathan Zézé and Enzo Millot. If these can be developed and sold on for profit, so much the better. Being regarded as a decent alternative to Europe for young global talent may not sound especially glamorous or exciting, but it is something no other league has managed.Salah would, however, be a big boost. The SPL is popular in the Arab world but the Liverpool forward’s arrival would take it to a new level. Players such as Mahrez and Yassine Bounou are there and the recent Fifa Arab Cup (the 16-team tournament in Qatar went almost unnoticed internationally but attracted an impressive average attendance of more than 38,000), showed there is plenty of passion and no small amount of talent. There will be at least seven Arab teams – eight if Iraq win their playoff – at the 2026 World Cup. Becoming a go-to league for Africa, which has happened to an extent, and Asia, which hasn’t, is also an obvious step. Signing an Indonesian player, for example, adds millions to social media accounts, and there is always the tantalising prospect of finding the first Indian or Chinese breakout star.Brendan Rodgers confirmed as head coach of Saudi Pro League club Al-QadsiahRead moreThat would be welcomed in Riyadh. Maintaining the early international interest was always going to be a challenge but this season has been especially tough. Despite the 2025-26 season kicking off in August, teams have played nine league games, compared with 17 by English teams. The international windows were bigger deals for Saudi Arabia because the national team had playoffs to qualify for the World Cup, which were won, just. Then came a longer stop for the Arab Cup. The league restarts on Thursday, the first action for more than a month.Global broadcasters – the league said it had 37 media rights deals in place for this season, with matches available in more than 180 markets – have become increasingly frustrated, trying to build a loyal audience for a product that comes in fits and bursts, trying to build a narrative for clubs and players that have barely appeared. One told the Guardian that this season was almost a write-off with viewers having so many other options available.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema joins Al-Ittihad in June 2023. He is one of the top-name recruits from Europe who is now in his third season in Saudi Arabia.Photograph: APLeague officials in Riyadh are going to have to find a way to ensure that the domestic competition does not play such a clear second fiddle to the national team. Otherwise, becoming a competition of global stature is going to be next to impossible whatever Gianni Infantino says. The Fifa president told Saudi media this week that he believes the league is on track to become one of the top three in the world.Salah would add some immediate sparkle, but his greater value comes in what he could bring to the Arab world in the longer term. This is assuming, of course,that he wants to leave Liverpool, the club want to sell and that he wants to go to Saudi Arabia – all sizeable “ifs”. If it does happen, it will be more important as a capture of a still-glittering Arab legend than of an ageing English Premier League one.Explore more on these topicsSaudi Pro LeagueAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Africa Cup of NationsMohamed SalahSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

News that Brooks Koepkawill step away from LIV Golfin 2026 comes as no shock. This never felt a particularly sensible alliance; an individual who craves glory at the top level and a disruption regime that has grasped for relevance with only varying degrees of success.Koepka has looked unhappy in his professional domain for some time. He has all but admitted he would never have joined LIV but for fears over a potentially career-threatening injury. Golf’s ultimate alpha male was the captain of LIV’s Smash GC team. The whole thing always seemed preposterous.Koepka’s exit is a blow to LIV, however it is spun. Two years ago, the Saudi Arabian-backed tour spent the festive seasonpurring after Jon Rahm signed up. Golf’s existing ecosystem remained in a state of panic. LIV’s Koepka was the reigning US PGA champion. Amalgamation, surely, was necessary.Brooks Koepka quits LIV Golf after three years but PGA Tour return uncertainRead moreBut as we prepare to bring in 2026, LIV rumbles along somewhere in the loose consciousness of even dedicated golf followers. That combining of tours no longer feels particularly likely nor needed. In one sense, that is sad; a lot of people made a lot of money out of fracturing an industry as the watching public suffered.Koepka’s case is interesting, primarily because it has to accelerate discussions in the environment he once left behind. As word of the 35-year-old’s LIV departure broke, the PGA Tour could not resist an immediate dig. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best competitive golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness,” read a statement. Receipts have been kept since the 2022 moment in which LIV started coaxing at least some of the PGA Tour’s hottest properties. More recent times have seen the PGA Tour noticeably emboldened, hence the untypical swipe at LIV.As they chuckle in Ponte Vedra, the PGA Tour hierarchy should also be reminding Tiger Woods of the role of his future competition committee, a body formed in slightly vague circumstances this year. Consensus is that Woods will assess how the PGA Tour season flows, how many events take place, field sizes and the dishing out of exemptions. All worthy enough stuff within the golf world but not on a par with: how does the PGA Tour handle any player, such as Koepka, who may want to return from LIV?Future competition means future participants. Woods and his colleagues have to deliver advice to the PGA Tour’s full board on how to handle what has loosely been labelled returning player protocol. Woods, a PGA Tour man to the core, knew this was coming. A test of his big-picture credentials are about to come sharply into view. Woods’s committee is expected to make recommendations before the 2026 Masters.View image in fullscreenBrooks Koepka will be welcomed with open arms at any DP World Tour event next year.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty Images“Not a single player on LIV wants to play on the PGA Tour,” insisted Phil Mickelson in 2023. A bold statement then and a nonsensical one now. Yet there is strong feeling within both sides of this scenario. Some on the PGA Tour, including those who knocked back exorbitant LIV approaches, will feel sore if a golfer is reintroduced without at least the perception of penalty. It would feel wrong if Koepka can have tens of millions of dollars worth of Saudi cake and eat it. What sanction is that?At base level, like all individual sportspeople, golfers are conditioned to be selfish; the PGA Tour’s membership will accept old friends and brief adversaries if they are convinced there is something in it for them. The level-headed people in the PGA Tour will view an opportunity here that exists beyond moving above the acrimony which engulfed this sport for too long. Bringing a Koepka – or a Bryson DeChambeau – back into the fold would be an undoubted win for the old boys. A salient lesson in biding one’s time. LIV might continue but if the talent drain starts to flow the other way,as an entity propped up by Saudi generosityit has very limited scope.In a basic, commercial and competitive sense the PGA Tour would benefit from adding certain names to fields. The rank and file may well complain but Koepka attracts more eyeballs than Sam Burns. Sponsors and investors have a say here too. It is also worth noting that no two cases are identical. Koepka’s is not the same as umpteen others – Mickelson included – who leapt to the LIV side while flinging verbal grenades or legal cases back at whence they came.Koepka has major status until 2028. His LIV deal does not expire until the end of the 2026 season. The tone of his own statement suggested nothing is imminent in respect of a concrete career plan. He will also be welcomed with open arms at any DP World, formerly European, Tour events where he wishes to mark some time. It is just that this five-time major winner suddenly looks poised to become a fascinating test case for golf’s future. The most iconic player of its recent past is front and centre of the conversation.Explore more on these topicsBrooks KoepkaLIV Golf SeriesGolfSaudi Arabia and sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Smriti’s response, three days later at Trent Bridge, was to nail down thethree-figure milestonein 51 balls. She celebrated by pointing up at Radha on the balcony.It was all presumably a bit tongue-in-cheek, given that Smriti was enjoying the most prolific year of any female cricketer in history. She scored 1,362 ODI runs in 2025 – the previous record was Belinda Clark’s 970 from 1997 – and now has 17 international hundreds across all formats, more than anyone bar Meg Lanning. RCB recently retained her for the 2026 Women’s Premier League for 3.5 crore – the maximum price, but still somehow a bargain when it buys you the services of a player this classy.2.Laura Wolvaardt(South Africa) – captainDuring South Africa’s recent T20 against Ireland, an awestruck fan was interviewed after watching Wolvaardt strike her fourth international century of the year. “She’s Miss 360,” he said. “That’s the best hundred I’ve seen at Newlands.”For the second year in succession, Wolvaardt captains the Spin’s XI, and for good reason. If everyone could have played like Wolvaardt, South Africa would have won a World Cup this year. First, she had to pick up her team from the doldrums of69 all out against Englandand convince them they were potential tournament winners. Then she batted her heart out withback-to-back hundredsin the semi-final and final. It wasn’t to be this time, but on the day it does happen you can bet that Wolvaardt (and her cover drive) will be at the heart of the action.3.Jemimah Rodrigues(India)Rodrigues bookended 2025 with two hundreds – against Ireland in January and Australia in October – but the real story is what happened in between. She had to battle the uncertainty of the selectors – she was dropped midway through the World Cup – and her own crippling self-doubt. All the more remarkable, then, that she managed to play one of theall-time great inningsin the tournament semi-final, shepherding an exhausting run chase against the defending champions while reciting psalms to herself between overs. Three days later, India won a World Cup final – but it was Rodrigues who landed the killer blow.4. Beth Mooney (Australia) – wicketkeeperA day after Jon Lewis sidestepped questions about the unfit nature of his team and pontificated about the nice weather in Bondi, a ruddy-cheeked, sweaty Mooney showed him exactly what the difference was between the two teams. First, she scored anunbeaten 94in the Adelaide T20 – mostly in sprinted singles. Then she kept wicket, seamlessly stepping in for a creaking Alyssa Healy (as she did numerous times across the year). Mooney’s eventual series run tally was a phenomenal 409.5. Nat Sciver-Brunt (England)What did you do in those heady newborn days, when life was a haze of nappy changes, milky feeds and snatched bursts of sleep? Sciver-Brunt decided that she would take on one of the hardest jobs in cricket:the England captaincy. As well as attempting to pick up the pieces of the Ashes debacle, she somehow also continued to be England’s best batter, bailing them out of trouble more than once during the World Cup as they staggered through to the knockout phase.View image in fullscreenNat Sciver-Brunt continued to be England’s best batter after taking on the role of captain.Photograph: Sameera Peiris/Getty Images6. Ash Gardner (Australia)At the start of 2025, Gardner hadn’t struck a hundred in 175 internationals for Australia. Batting at No 6, her task had generally been big-hitting cameos, after those above her scored the bulk of the runs. Over the past 12 months, though, Australia’s top order floundered enough times that Gardner had to find a different role: she still smashes sixes, but she bats long, too. Twice in the World Cup, against New Zealand andEngland, she dug her side out of a substantial hole, scoring crucial hundreds which turned wobbles into winning situations. She has maintained her ICC No 1 all-rounder ranking, finishing the year with 19 wickets – and if you haven’t watched her “mayo on it” juggle-parry catch at Hobart,go and take a look: you’re in for a treat.7. Deepti Sharma (India)Sometimes the cricketing gods write a fitting ending to a World Cup. So it was in 2025, when the last South Africa wicket to fall in the final was claimed by thetournament MVP and leading wicket-taker (22 scalps), Sharma. India’s death-overs hero also stepped up her batting a notch this year, scoring three half-centuries in the World Cup – including a crucial one in the final – and considerably upping her strike-rate.8. Annabel Sutherland (Australia)In the year’s single Test at the G, Sutherland’s 163 runs earned her the player of the match award. During the World Cup, her main contribution was with ball in hand, taking 17 wickets and dazzling opponents with her variations. England are struggling with a dearth of all-rounders; meanwhile, Australia possess two of the world’s best: Sutherland is currently locked in a battle with her teammate Gardner over who should be considered the world’s leading jill-of-all-trades. File that one under “nice problem to have”.9. Sophie Ecclestone (England)It hasn’t been the easiest of years for Ecclestone. During the Ashes she was thrust into the limelight when Alex Hartley revealed Ecclestone had refused to do a pre-match interview with her former teammate. The social media backlash was so intense that Ecclestone considered quitting cricket altogether. She had to sit out the early English summer due to a dual battle with physical injury and mental health. And yet when she was bowling, all of that baggage fell away, as the wickets continued to fall: 42 of them for England in 2025, including 16 in the World Cup. The key for those around her is to make sure she continues to enjoy her cricket – which might mean staying away from social media the next time something goes wrong.10. Alana King (Australia)King started the year tormenting England in the Women’s Ashes and ended it by unleashing one of the best spells of bowling ever seen in a World Cup, finishing withseven for 18 against South Africa. The 30-year-old leg-spinner has honed her craft over many years, and now at last has mastery of the trickiest art in the game: Australia continue to reap the rewards.View image in fullscreenAlana King took superb figures of seven for 18 in the World Cup against South Africa.Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/Shutterstock11.Marufa Akter(Bangladesh)Akter hasn’t had the opportunities that others have had – she played just 14 ODIs in 2025, and no T20 Internationals – but this was a breakthrough year for the 20-year-old fast bowler. She was the poster girl of Bangladesh’s World Cup campaign, during which they beat Pakistan and almost toppled the heavyweights of England and South Africa. Her hooping in-swing has to be seen to be believed –her dismissal of Omaima Sohail was, frankly, laws-of-physics-defying– but now she’s showcased it on the global stage, let’s hope some franchise gigs might be in the pipeline.This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketThe Spin newsletterCricketnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The announcement was made in a post on the club’s website by two of its owners, Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. The post did not disclose the size of the investment.The move underlines the increasing influence in British football of US owners, who appear to be drawn by the strong heritage and potential financial returns, at least for clubs below the Premier League.The retired American football starTom Brady is a minority owner at Birmingham City, while Stewart attended last week’slast-gasp 2-1 comebackagainst Wrexham AFC, a north Wales club that has secured three successive promotions thanks to the heavy financial backing of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, who has changed his name from Rob McElhenney.Reynolds and Mac have created a Disney television show tracking their fortunes with Wrexham. The Guardian has revealed that Wrexhamreceived an unusual grant of £18mfrom the local council to help build a new stand in its stadium.View image in fullscreenRyan Reynolds (centre, left) and Rob Mac (centre, right) have become frequent visitors to Wrexham’s Racecourse ground since their investment in the club.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PASwansea City are also looking to buy its council-owned stadium, the club’s chief executive told a podcast last month.Stewart is often credited as the first self-made billionaire in the US, after building a huge retail and lifestyle brand around her catering company. She has written 99 books, according to her website.The “Martha Stewart” brand has been sold several times and remains well known, particularly in the US despite her 2004 conviction for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and other charges in the relation to her sale of shares in the company ImClone Systems.Stewart served five months in prison.In recent years she has struck up a perhaps unlikely friendship withSnoop Dogg, appearing with him at the 2024 Paris Olympics.The size of the celebrities’ minority investments has not been disclosed. However, neither Snoop Dogg nor Modric, whojoined AC Milan this year from Real Madrid, are listed as persons with significant control of the club on the UK companies register.David Beckham made $23.6m in dividends from business empire last yearRead moreCravatt and Cohen, who together co-founded Los Angeles marketing company Centerfield, pointed to the “increased exposure and increased visibility we have as a club following the additions of Snoop and Luka to our ownership group”.The addition of Stewart does not appear to have added significant resources for transfers. Cravatt and Cohen said that “we do not expect the January window to be a particularly busy one for Swansea City” undernew head coach Vítor Matos. They pointed to Matos’s experience in developing young players.Cravatt and Cohen wrote: “We are very excited to welcome Martha onboard, and we know experiencing Friday night’s game in-person has only increased her own enthusiasm and anticipation for being part of Swansea City.”Swansea City have been owned by an American consortium since 2016, although Cravatt and Cohen took control last year.Explore more on these topicsSwansea CityMartha StewartSnoop DoggLuka ModricShareReuse this content"

Cyril the paperboy, he wasn’t a boy, he was about 70, but everyone still called him the paperboy. He was the bookmaker, my nan would take the bets and Cyril would take them and pay out the next day.“Three tuppenny doubles and a tuppenny treble, that was the standard bet, and the only way you got the results was sitting round the radio at six o’clock at night. They’d call the results out and she’d scribble them down so she knew who’d won and who’d lost.”There is a distinct sense that Redknapp still can’t quite believe it himself. He is not a celebrity racehorse owner, dabbling in the game until something else takes their fancy. He is a racehorse owner who happens to be a celebrity, a lifelong fan who has done the hard yards in ownership for the past 40 years, swallowed the disappointments and bounced back for more.He now has a horse that is good enough to line up for one of the most famous steeplechases in the calendar. Arkle, Wayward Lad, Desert Orchid and Kauto Star are among the chasing legends on the King George’s roll of honour and even in what is being seen as the strongest field for years The Jukebox Man is a live 6-1 shot.“I’ve loved the racing all my life, really,” Redknapp says, “but [in the 50s and 60s] going racing wasn’t something we ever did. As a player at West Ham, we were full of punters, all boys out of the same area from within six or seven miles of the ground probably, and most of us loved a bet, but it was dog racing.“We’d go to Walthamstow on a Friday night and Hackney Wick. We’d all be into it, but horse racing was another world away from us in east London. It was only when I went to Bournemouth [in the late 1980s] that I got involved in my first horse. There were seven of us, I think, in the syndicate, a couple of vice-presidents and one of the directors. We all put in a grand each and bought a horse with David Elsworth, Slick Cherry.”Desert Orchid, perhaps the greatest King George legend of all, was among Slick Cherry’s stable companions. While her 6-1 success – after plenty of support – in a Windsor maiden in July 1990 went unnoticed at the time, Redknapp’s ownership career was off and running. There have been dozens of runners in his colours since then, on the Flat and over jumps, and enough good days among the let-downs to keep Redknapp firmly on the hook.The best moment – so far – wasa win for Shakem Up’Arryatlast year’s Cheltenham festival, which made The Jukebox Man’s narrow defeat at the meeting 24 hours later after leading over the final flight a little easier to bear.“I do lay in bed dreaming about him jumping the last atKempton, taking it up and going clear,” Redknapp says, “but not the day he jumped the last at Cheltenham five lengths clear and the horse he’d gone away from suddenly started to close the gap.View image in fullscreenThe Jukebox Man is fancied in a fascinating renewal of the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.Photograph: Danny Lawson for The Jockey Club/PA“I don’t know how I’d have felt if Shakem Up’Arry hadn’t won the day before. It was like being two up going into extra time, the fourth official’s put up three minutes and suddenly, bang, bang, the dream’s gone.”Sandra, Redknapp’s wife, who joined him on the visit to Pauling’s west-country yard, has long since learned to live with her husband’s hobby. “I think sometimes he doesn’t tell me [when he buys another horse]. I’ll say, ‘when did you buy that one, then?’ and he’ll say ‘oooh, ages ago …”Harry recalls her reaction to a recent report on The Jukebox Man. “A guy on the TV said, ‘Harry Redknapp, he keeps buying horses and he never buys a bad one’, and Sandra fell off the settee laughing. We’ve got a list as long as your arm so when you get a good one you’ve got to enjoy it.”Sandra will make a rare trip to the races on Friday to watch The Jukebox Man attempt to repeat his Grade One win over the King George distance in a novice chase on Boxing Day 12 months ago. “It’s like going into the Champions League,” Redknapp says. “You look at the teams that are still in it and you think, my God, but you still think you’ve got a chance and you’re dreaming that you could go all the way and win it.“He’s not favourite, but he goes there with a chance, and if he’s improving like Ben thinks he is he’s got a real chance.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHarry RedknappKing George VI ChaseKemptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy said he expected US negotiators to be in contact with the Kremlin on Wednesday.Ukraine’s best hope may lie elsewhere as Russia inches forward on the battlefieldRead moreIn the latest version of the peace plan, Ukraine accepts the principle of a demilitarised zone in its eastern regions, control of which has long been a stumbling block, with the insistence thatRussiamake a similar pullback of forces.Details of the proposal have been sent to the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, by his envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, and a Kremlin spokesperson said Moscow was formulating its response and would not immediately comment publicly.The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Dmitriev had briefed Putin on his recent trip to Miami for talks with Trump’s envoys. Peskov refused to be drawn on Russia’s reaction to the proposals, or the exact format of the documents, saying the Kremlin was not going to communicate via the media.“All the main parameters of the Russian position are well known to our colleagues from the United States,” Peskov told reporters.Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede about 5,000 sq km of Donbas, which it still controls, and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join Nato’s military alliance.Ukraine mapIn the continuing complex choreography of negotiations, however, Ukraine will agree to several uncomfortable concessions. That includes a pullback of some Ukrainian troops from the area it controls on the eastern frontline, and giving up on its long-vaunted ambition for Nato membership in exchange for US-European security guarantees mirroring Nato’s article 5 provision. It remained unclear, in public at least, what those security guarantees would look like.The latest plan also calls for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, with international troops to be stationed along the contact line to monitor implementation.Zelenskyy presented the plan during a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading from a highlighted and annotated version. He suggested the proposals put Ukraine in a stronger position, with Moscow facing the risk that the US will supply Kyiv with substantially increased arms and escalating sanctions if Putin rejects the plan.‘Warning to others’: murky death of militia leader as Kremlin reasserts controlRead moreZelenskyy told reporters: “[Moscow] cannot tell President Trump: ‘Look, we are against a peaceful settlement. That is, if they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.“In the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the line of troop deployment as of the date of this agreement is de facto recognised as the line of contact,” Zelenskyy said of the latest draft.“A working group will convene to determine the redeployment of forces necessary to end the conflict, as well as to define the parameters of potential future special economic zones,” he added.This appears to suggest the plan opens the way for – but delays options that Ukraine was previously reluctant to consider – a withdrawal of troops and the creation of demilitarised zones.“We are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from the Donetsk region, while the Americans are trying to find a way,” Zelenskyy said. “They are looking for a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides.”View image in fullscreenPeople take cover in a metro station during a Russian drone attack in Kyiv on 23 December.Photograph: Dan Bashakov/APAny plan that involves Ukraine pulling back its troops would need to pass a referendum in Ukraine, Zelenskyy added. “A free economic zone. If we are discussing this, then we need to go to a referendum,” Zelensky said, referring to plans to designate areas that Ukraine pulls out from as a demilitarised free-trade zone.On Nato, Zelensky said: “It is the choice of Nato members whether to have Ukraine or not. Our choice has been made. We moved away from the proposed changes to the constitution of Ukraine that would have prohibited Ukraine from joining Nato.”Russia, however, has long insisted on full control of Donetsk and it remains highly uncertain that it would accept either a suggested demilitarised buffer zone or a withdrawal of its forces, even as other sticking points remain, including control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that Kyiv says should be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine.Zelenskyy’s press conference was held after Donald Trump’s repeated efforts to try to broker an end to the four-year war, triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion.Tens of thousands have been killed, eastern Ukraine decimated and millions forced to flee their homes. Russian troops are advancing on the front andhammering citiesand Ukraine’s energy grid with nightly missile and drone barrages. The Russian defence ministry on Wednesday said it had captured another Ukrainian settlement in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.In 2022, Moscow claimed to have annexed four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia – in addition to the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinNatonewsShareReuse this content"

Further north it will be cloudier, but by lunchtime the cloud will begin to disperse with “some good sunny spells”, said Claydon.“The other notable factor will be the wind, so with the positioning of the high pressure there is quite a strong easterly wind, particularly across the south coast of England, so it could be quite gusty there.“High pressure is now firmly in control of the weather across the UK, bringing a much more settled spell, and also cooler temperatures than we’ve had of late,” he said.Those dreaming of a white Christmas are likely to be disappointed, with the prospect “highly unlikely” this year, said the forecaster. He added: “We’ve got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days.2025 is UK’s sunniest year on record, boosting solar powerRead more“The only vague possibility is there’s a little band of rain that’s skirting westwards across the Channel through tomorrow and there’s an outside chance it could clip the south-west of England.“The chances ofany snow fallingout of that are very low.”Claydon said the highest temperatures on Christmas Day were forecast to be around 7C in north-east England and 6C in south or south-east England.In rural parts ofScotland, temperatures could be as low as minus 6C on Christmas Day into Boxing Day, and as low as minus 4C in rural Wales, with frost and freezing temperatures likely in western rural areas.The RAC said it wasexpecting festive getaway trips by car to peak on Christmas Eveat 4.2m, with regular commuter traffic “likely to be far lighter”.A spokesperson for the RAC said: “Traffic is expected to be heaviest on major roads between 1pm and 7pm, so our advice to drivers – especially those travelling longer distances – is to set out before this time if possible.“Main roads to watch for jams are the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherTransportChristmasEnglandNorth of EnglandScotlandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files.”The statement came after it was reported earlier Wednesday that there were hundreds of thousands of additional records related toJeffrey Epsteinto review – a process that involves a team of 200 departmental analysts and which will take another week to complete.According to Axios,which cited unnamed justice department officials, about 750,000 records have been reviewed and disclosed, and about 700,000 more remain to be examined. However, many of those may be duplicates, so the remaining number of records may only be in the thousands.Newly released Epstein files include references to Donald TrumpRead more“This will end soon,” an official told the outlet. “The conspiracy theories won’t.”On Friday last week, the day of the first releases, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein”.At the weekend there wasoutrage from victims and legal threatsover the limited initial Epstein files release despite the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December.Pressure to complete the review and release the Epstein documents comes as lawmakers Ro Khanna of California, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a Republican, have threatened contempt hearings against the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, over the justice department’s failure to meet the 19 December deadline in full.CNN reportedthat the justice department office in Florida has asked for career prosecutors to volunteer over the “next several days” to help redact the remaining unreleased files.“We have an obligation to the public to release these documents and before we can do so, certain redactions must be made to protect the identity of the victims, among other things,” the southern district of Florida leadership wrote in an email on Tuesday, CNN reported, adding that it was “aware the timing could not be worse. For some the holidays are about to begin, but I know that for others the holidays are coming to an end.”On Tuesday this week, in a third drop of files since Friday, the justice department released 30,000 records from the investigations into Epstein and his co-conspiratorGhislaine Maxwell.The releases contained more mentions of Donald Trump than in previous drops, including an email from 2020, apparently sent by a federal prosecutor in New York, that said Trump “traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)”, including one where the only listed passengers were Epstein, Trump and a “then-20-year-old”.The latest release included some notable false leads, including a fake letter from Epstein to convicted sex abuser and former Olympic gymnastics coach Larry Nassar, and a fake video of Epstein committing suicide in his jail cell.DoJ says Jeffrey Epstein letter to Larry Nassar referencing Trump is fakeRead more“There has been lots of sensationalism and even outright lies these past few days about the ‘Epstein Files’,” Blanchesaid in a statement on X. “But let’s separate fact from fiction. Document production is just that. We produce documents, and sometimes this can result in releasing fake or false documents because they simply are in our possession because the law requires this.”Blanche pointed to both the letter and video. “The so-called Epstein Nassar letter is clearly FAKE – wrong handwriting, wrong return address, and postmarked three days after Epstein died. Fake videos of Epstein in his cell. Photos with no explanation. Sensational tales and lies by random people. These are not reality. We will continue to produce every document required by law. Let’s not let internet rumor engines outrun the facts.”The latest release of Epstein files cast some light on the FBI’s effort to identify and contact additional possible “conspirators”.One document, an email by an FBI worker in New York, identified the names of 10 potential “co-conspirators” following Epstein’s arrest in July 2019. But only three names are unredacted in the document: Ghislaine Maxwell; Jean-Luc Brunel, a model agent who died by suicide after he was charged with rape and sexual harassment in France; and Leslie Wexner, a billionaire client of Epstein who has said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 and later accused the financier of misappropriating money. Wexner, 88, has always denied any involvement in Epstein’s crimes and is not the subject of any known current investigations related to Epstein.“According to Mr Wexner’s legal representative, the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect,” a representative for Wexner saidin a statement to Bloombergon Monday. “Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.”Mention of potential conspirators in FBI communications, despite redactions and lacking in further context, has provoked a political reaction.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement demanding transparency. “The Department of Justice needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute. Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationGhislaine MaxwellSex traffickingUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She requested that it be returned “promptly”.Sent to the lord chancellor’s office in August, the report is understood to recommend that lessons be learned from the US so that for the most dangerous prisoners privileges can be earned or taken away depending on closely monitored standards of behaviour.In the ADX Florence prison in Colorado, known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies, staff evaluate prisoners continuously. Those who behave well are rewarded with modest but significant extra privileges.These can include access to exercise, radio and television. Bad behaviour can lead to access privileges being removed and restrictions in contact with other inmates.Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the House of Commons’ justice select committee, has called for the government to publish the report immediately. “Allowances can be made for the MoJ and its ministers. This has been a very busy time for the department and there has been a change in the secretary of state,” he said.“But after waiting four months, prison officers, the public and parliament should be able to see the recommendations of the report written by Jonathan Hall KC so we can make sure that similar attacks to the one carried out by Hashem Abedi at HMP Frankland never happen again.”View image in fullscreenHashem Abedi was jailed for life in 2020 for helping his brother carry out the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.Photograph: Libya’s Special Deterrence Force/AFP/Getty ImagesAbedi was jailed for life in 2020 for helping his brother carry out the 2017 bombing, which killed 22 people at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. He was sentenced to a minimum of 55 years in jail.After the incident at HMP Frankland in Durham on 12 April, Abedi pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, to assault causing actual bodily harm, and having offensive weapons inside a prison.Prosecutors allege that he attacked four prison officers with makeshift knives and boiling oil. Three of the prison officers – two men and a woman – were taken to hospital, two with stab wounds.The attack triggered outrage among survivors and victims’ families. Martin Hibbert, who was left with life-changing injuries in the 2017 bombing, said in an open letter to ministers that the incidentrepresented a “catastrophic failure”to protect staff and the public.Abedi was held in a separation centre at Frankland, one of three introduced into the England and Wales prison estate by Theresa May’s government in 2017. They have been used to keep terrorists, particularly Islamists, away from most of the prison population.After the attack, questions were raised over why Abedi and other terror suspects had been given access to kitchen utensils. His knives were fashioned out of cake tins.Hall’s review has considered whether the internal findings from the Abedi incident point to a need for changes in how extremist offenders are placed into separation centres. It also assesses whether the right balance is being struck between security and long-term offender management.Abedi is due to appear at the Old Bailey in Februrary.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Protecting our hardworking staff is a priority. In the past 10 weeks, we’ve announced the rollout of body armour to thousands of frontline officers and expanded the use of Tasers.“We have been thoroughly reviewing Jonathan Hall’s independent report into separation centres and will publish Mr Hall’s report and our response in due course.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationCrimeManchester Arena attackManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Yet climate change and industrial exploitation are pushing this ocean-based culture to its limits.Coastal villages around Toliara, a city in southern Madagascar, host tens of thousands of thesemi-nomadic Vezopeople, who make a living from small-scale fishing on the ocean. For centuries, they have launchedpirogues, small boats carved from single tree trunks, every day into the turquoise shallows to catch tuna, barracuda and grouper.“We rely solely on the ocean,” says Soa Nomeny, a woman from a small island off the south-west coast called Nosy Ve. “Whatever we catch today, we eat today. If we catch nothing, we don’t eat.”View image in fullscreenA boat near lines of seaweed, which has become a main source of income for Ambatomilo village as warmer seas, bleached reefs and erratic weather accelerate the decline of local fish populationsThat dependence is becoming precarious for the 600 or so residents of Nosy Ve. Michel “Goff” Strogoff, a former shark hunter turned conservationist from the Vezo hamlet of Andavadoaka, says fish populations began collapsing in the 1990s and have declined sharply over the past decade.Rising sea temperatures, coral bleaching and reef degradation have destroyed breeding grounds, while erratic weather linked to warming oceans has shortened fishing seasons. “There’s no abundance near shore any more,” he says. “We’re forced to paddle farther.”View image in fullscreenSoa Nomeny, wearing traditional sunblock, prepares the family’s main meal of rice and fish or octopus. The Vezo only eat that day’s catch, ensuring their meals are connected to the sea’s bountyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIn Nosy Ve, fish are often cooked with tomato, onion and garlic; salted sardines are laid out to dry before being sold in Andavadoaka; Soa Nomeny appliestabake, traditional sunblock made from groundtaolo, a fragrant bark; and the catch is taken to market from Bevohitse village by zebu-drawn cart, the main form of transport in remote areasWe still depend on fish for daily needs, but the seaweed helps us plan aheadOlive, farmerLocal fishers echo the same concern. “There are simply too many nets out there,” says Hosoanay Natana, who now travels hours beyond traditional grounds to make a viable catch for him and his fellow fishermen.Industrial trawlers – Malagasy and foreign – often enter near-shore waters despite a national ban on the ships coming within two nautical miles (3.7km) of the coast. Weak enforcement means violations are common, leaving small-scale fishers with dwindling returns.The environmental group Blue Ventures, which has worked in the region for two decades, reports thatreef fish biomass across south-west Madagascar has fallenby more than half since the 1990s. The organisationsupports locally managed marine areas (LMMAs)that help communities set their own fishing rules, restore reefs and look for alternative ways to make a living.Some of the most promising of these include imposing temporary closures, which have allowed octopus stocks to rebound, and the new practice of seaweed farming, which acts as a commercial buffer against overfishing and climate shocks.View image in fullscreenHosoanay Natana tightening the net around a school of barracuda. Divers direct boats to form a circle with the net. Once the fish are trapped, the divers retrieve them and bring them to the boat, ensuring more sustainable fishingView image in fullscreenEven young children must help get the catch inFarther down the coast, the village of Ambatomilo, known locally as Seaweed Village, has embraced this shift. Overseen by its LMMA committee, it is among several communities cultivating seaweed as a supplementary income for fishers whose traditional grounds are overexploited. Families lay freshly harvested seaweed out to dry before selling it to local cooperatives.Fabricé and his wife, Olive, who began farming five years ago, harvest every couple of weeks. “The market pays around 1,500 ariary [25p] per kilo,” says Olive, spreading red seaweed across bamboo racks. Depending on the season, families can produce up to a tonne a month, offering significant extra income that helps cushion households’ living standards when fishing falters.“We still depend on fish for daily needs,” she says, “but the seaweed helps us plan ahead.”Seaweed farming is now one of Madagascar’s fastest-growing coastal industries. The crop is exported mainly for carrageenan – a gelling agent used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals – but also serves locally as fertiliser and livestock feed.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFabricé gathers in the seaweed harvest. Depending on the season, they can harvest up to a tonne a month. With his wife, Olive, he carries the seaweed to prepare it for market. It is also eaten or used as seasoning, and serves as fertiliser or animal feed when dried. Soa Nomeny with an octopus she has speared to supplement the fish catchEnvironmental studies have shown that seaweed farms also help stabilise coastlines byreducing wave energy and absorbing carbon dioxide, contributing to erosion control and carbon sequestration.The Vezo people’s adaptability, once a source of pride, has become a condition of survival. Outside the cyclone season, some families still undertake long fishing migrations, camping on sandbanks and uninhabited islets as they follow fish along the coast. “Extended migrations are always an option,” says Natana. “Whether we embark or not depends on the fish stocks nearby.”Such journeys can last weeks or months, depending on catches and resources. The lure of high-value commodities – such as shark fins or sea cucumbers bound for Chinese markets – draws some to more distant waters up to 1,000 miles (1,600km) away.“Some even venture all the way to the Seychelles,” says Strogoff, a nod to the Vezo people’s enduring nomadic spirit: always chasing the next opportunity to make a living.View image in fullscreenVillagers gathered for theTrombaritual, performed to invoke blessings, honour ancestors and seek protection, good health and plenty. People are possessed by spirits, a goat or even a zebu is sacrificed, and other offerings made, such as rice, bread or rum. The ritual is also performed at times of crisis, before a journey, or for marriagesCultural traditions remain central to community life. On Nosy Ve, families still gather for annual blessing rituals, seeking protection and prosperity. During one such ceremony, elders invoke ancestral spirits in aTrombapossession rite while villagers sacrifice a goat or make other offerings to ensure safety at sea.‘I fear when we stop, no one will replace us’: Madagascar’s forest guardians – in picturesRead moreLife on the island reflects both endurance and fragility. Homes built from pounded seashells and palm fronds line the beach; nights are lit by torches instead of electricity.After a day at sea, the fish catches are shared equally among crews, with the surplus sold or traded for rice or solar batteries. Meals rarely change: rice, beans and grilled fish.For now, the Vezo people continue to depend on the ocean that shaped them. Yet each year, the distance they must travel grows and the risks mount.As industrial fleets expand and reefs decline, an ancient seafaring culture faces an uncertain horizon. Their struggle reflects a wider challenge across coastal Africa: how small communities can endure when the sea that sustains them is changing so fast.View image in fullscreenThe daughter of Hosoanay Natana and Soa Nomeny plays with her ‘sunglasses’.

The footpath is a gully of slop, and each step forwards is a little slip backwards. The north-facing slope was OK – the frost hadn’t been thawed by the sun, and crunchy ground is better than slippy ground. But the rest of Gloucestershire has turned into slurry.It’s just as well that I enjoy it; I do this every week. For the last seven years I’ve been going out on a Friday, taking some combination of buses and trains to wherever the previous walk ended, and continuing. My Friday walk is a single tangly line stretching from Birmingham to Dorset, and the Malverns to the M25, and I go whatever the weather.Today’s weather is mud. My boots are caked in it; it’s weighing me down. When I get home, I’ll have to scrub them and dry them and give them a new coat of wax. I’ll get cold, muddy fingers, and balancing them on the radiator will be a pain. I could’ve bought modern synthetic boots – a quick wipe down and they’re done – but something about the drudgery of trying to keep the leather alive appeals to me. It feels meaningful. Then again, perhaps I’ll just scrape them along the verge and be done with it.It’s getting gloomy as I slog up another steep slope on the western edge of the Cotswolds. From the exposed hilltop, there’s an incredible, if monochrome, view across the Severn vale. The wind hurts my ears as I stop to admire the silvery river slithering along the horizon.It occurs to me that the winter solstice,Christmasand New Year’s Eve all celebrate the light and try to banish the darkness. But these grim winter months are part of the richness of the human experience, and we shouldn’t wish them away.That said, I’ve had enough wind and sludge for one day.Dursley is just down the hill. As I step on to a stile, my foot slips on a slimy, mossy board. I just about save myself by embracing the thorny hedge. Down the lane, I see the soft yellow glow of pub windows. I can’t wait to get into the warm, and sit down with a pint of something brown and wet.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsWalkingCountry diaryRural affairsWinterHobbiesChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ministers have directed the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to reduce the establishment of invasive species by 50% by 2030.Olaf Booy, deputy chief non-native species officer at Apha, said: “The science around biological control is always developing. It really works for those species that were introduced quite a long time ago, that we haven’t been able to prevent getting here or detect early and rapidly respond.”Scientists have been working out which species would be able to tackle the invasive pests by killing them and reducing their ability to spread, without harming other organisms. Booy said the perk of biological control agents was they reduced the need for human labour.View image in fullscreenJapanese knotweed in Taff’s Well, near Cardiff.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesThis includes targeting floating pennywort, which spreads and chokes the life from rivers, by releasing the South American weevilListronotus elongatus. Where weevils have overwintered for several years, floating pennywort biomass appears reduced across a number of release sites.Defra has also employed specialist scientists at the Centre forAgricultureand Bioscience International (Cabi) to conduct biological control (biocontrol) research into the use of naturally occurring, living organisms to tackle Japanese knotweed. Cabi has targeted this species using the release of the psyllidAphalara itadori, which feeds on the plant.Similarly, Cabi has been trialling the release of the rust fungusPuccinia komarovii var.glanduliferaeto tackle Himalayan balsam. Defra said the results of the release were encouraging and would continue at compatible sites.“Once the biocontrol agent is working properly, then it should actually start to spread naturally across the range, where the non-native species is, and it will start to bring that population of the non-native species down,” Booy said. “Hopefully, once it starts to establish in the wild, then it sort of starts taking over itself, and the human effort bit starts to reduce significantly.”As well as releasing biological control agents into the wild, government scientists have been breeding threatened species to protect their populations from invasion. Britain’s native white-clawed crayfish has disappeared from most of the country since the invasive American signal crayfish was introduced in the 1970s. These non-native creatures outcompete the native crayfish and carry a deadly plague, making eradication or containment virtually impossible.View image in fullscreenHimalayan balsam invades the banks of the river Avon.Photograph: Mark Boulton/AlamyInvasive species experts have created protected “ark sites”: safe habitats where white-clawed crayfish can survive free from threats. A new hatchery has been set up in Yorkshire to release them into the wild in secure locations, and in Devon the Wildwood Trust is expanding its hatchery, building a bespoke ark site pond, and rescuing crayfish from rivers under threat. More than 1,500 breeding-age crayfish so far have been translocated to eight safe sites in Gloucestershire.The creatures Booy is most concerned about establishing in the wildinclude raccoons and raccoon dogs, which are kept as pets but are very good at escaping into the wild.The medium-sized predators could be harmful to the amphibians and small birds they feed on, he said. At the moment, keepers of raccoons and raccoon dogs do not have to register with the government, though breeding and selling them is banned.Social media trends depicting raccoons as cuddly and desirable pets could be a concern, he said: “You do see things like raccoons and raccoon dogs popping up on social media and stuff. Particularly raccoons, they’re kind of cute and cuddly, and you could imagine that a TikTok trend might encourage people to think about getting a species like that. Obviously years ago we had the interest in terrapins from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”He added: “If you have a raccoon, you really need to know how to keep it securely to avoid it escaping. You don’t really want any predators of that sort of size establishing and spreading in the country, because it will have knock-on impacts for biodiversity. But they are also potentially vectors of disease as well.”The biosecurity minister and Labour peer Sue Hayman said: “With a changing climate we are constantly assessing for new risks and threats, including from invasive plants and animals, as well as managing the impacts of species already in this country. Invasive non-native species cost Britain’s economy nearly £2bn a year, and our environmental improvement plan sets out plans to reduce their establishment to protect native wildlife and farmers’ livelihoods.”Explore more on these topicsInvasive speciesWildlifeConservationAgricultureEndangered speciesPlantsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Tomar-based Sport Club Operario Cem Soldos posted the message alongside a photograph of Alfie, saying the team had “just become poorer today”.“Our athlete Alfie passed away today aged 13. Played his last game Saturday, played so well seemed like he knew it was his last game but far from imagining … We want to tell you how much we love you and that you will always be in our hearts! Rest in peace.”Neighbours told the TV news station SIC Noticias that arguments were frequently heard coming from the family home and that the mother filed a complaint to authorities against her ex-partner in 2023.Luís Freire, the president of the parish council of Casais and Alviobeira,told SIC Noticias:“There had already been several episodes of violence and, this time, things went very wrong.”The Foreign Office said: “We are in contact with the local authorities following an incident in Portugal, and stand ready to provide consular support.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re the most successful democratic political party on the planet. It’s a long winning streak. We’re up for the fight.”Morgan becameLabour’s first female head of governmentin the UK in the summer of 2024 following the resignation of Vaughan Gething over a donations scandal.Leaders hope budget funding will boost Labour in next year’s Scotland and Wales electionsRead moreShe is seen as charismatic and energetic, but the polls suggest the people of Wales may be ready for change, with herparty being defeated at the high-profile Caerphilly byelectionin the autumn.Morgan said: “Caerphilly was difficult but I’m keen to make sure people recognise that what you have in me is a leader who is determined to turn a page.”She pointed out that Labour Senedd grandees such as the former first ministerMark Drakefordand the social justice secretary,Jane Hutt, who have been at the centre of Welsh politics since devolution in 1999, were leaving the parliament.“They have been here right from the beginning. They helped to establish devolution. They helped to protect devolution from the years of austerity. But what we have now is the end of austerity and what I’m setting out is a vision, whereWaleswill move from post-industrial society to one embracing a digital future, a technology-driven future that will be powered by clean energy made here in Wales.”Morgan highlighted a scheme to build a first-of-its kindnuclear power station on Anglesey(Ynys Môn) in north Wales, announced in November, and the creation oftwo AI growth zones in south Wales.The first minister said if Plaid led the nextWelsh government, its desire for an independent Wales would be a distraction. “What we’ll get is constant talk about the constitution and a constant battle with the UK government.”Morgan said Reform “threw the kitchen sink” at the Caerphilly byelection and came up short.“There is a percentage of people who will buy into their negativity, their division-making, their hatred. What I’m interested in doing is competing on a positive pitch. I want to look to the future and I’m not interested in chasing them down an immigration agenda.“We have a situation in Wales, particularly in the area I represent [mid and west Wales], where 48% of doctors and dentists have been trained overseas. We are dependent on these people.”She said companies would be less keen to invest in Wales and public services would be at risk under Reform. “Reform have no experience of running anything. That is one hell of a risk for the people of Wales to take.”In the summer,Morgan expressed impatience with UK Labour,calling on Keir Starmer to rethink policies on welfare and said she was “tacking to the left”.She said she was pleased changes had been made to thewinter fuel allowanceand thetwo-child benefit caphad been abolished.Morgan also said UK Labour was following theWelsh party’s lead on schemes such as free school breakfasts. “We’ve been doing that for 21 years. And they want to introduce a youth guarantee. Again, 60,000 young people in Wales have already benefited from our youth guarantee. What’s great is, they’re following us. We’ve set the pace, I think, for the UK government. It’s a shame they don’t give us as much credit for the creativity we’ve shown in the past.”SomeLabourparty members have privately suggested it may be time for a spell in opposition, giving time and space for reinvention but Morgan said it would be an “awful thing” for Wales if her party lost power.“I think that the things people rely on every day may not be there. Think about free prescriptions – something they’re not offering in England. That may go. It won’t go if Welsh Labour is in power.”More than anything, she said Labour provided stability.“Instability is very, very dangerous for the country at a time when the world is facing instability. You see the challenges people have with the cost of living crisis, climate change and flooding, Russia and the aggression happening there. All of those things create an environment of instability. I think that what we can offer is stability in an age of instability.”Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsWalesWelsh governmentDevolutionReform UKVaughan GethingUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

There are no trains on Christmas Day, and very few running on Boxing Day.Meanwhile, arecord number of people are taking to the sky this festive season, with the Civil Aviation Authority predicting that 3 million people will fly from UK airports in the week up to Christmas.Heathrow has said it is expecting its busiest Christmas ever, as have airports in Birmingham and Manchester.Travellers from Gatwick are also facing train delays as Great Western Railway has warned that services between Reading and the airport will be disrupted on Christmas Eve because of a shortage of train staff.In a post on X, GWR said that train services to and from Gatwick and Reading could be subject to disruption on all routes, with delays expected until 5pm.Buses are also expected to be busy on Christmas Day, with journeys forecast to reach their highest level in a decade, according to the industry body the Confederation of PassengerTransport. It has predicted that more than 100,000 people will take a local bus journey on 25 December this year, slightly higher than last year and up from 87,000 in 2023.Explore more on these topicsTransportRoad transportRail industryAirline industryTravel & leisureChristmasRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February.Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, a Republican, praisedDonald Trumpand the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, for coordinating the deployment and predicted the guard’s presence would have a positive impact. “It’s going to help us further crack down on the violence here in the city of New Orleans and elsewhere around Louisiana,” Landry said in an appearance on the The Will Cain Show on Fox News. “And so a big shoutout to both of them.”Woman deported before she could see dying husband in ICE custody: ‘I never saw him again’Read moreCritics have argued a national guard deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the community, and they point out thatNew Orleanshas actually seen a decrease in violent crime rates.The deployment of the national guard to the Democratic-led city comes as border patrol agents have been carrying out an immigration crackdown since the beginning of the month. According to the Department of Homeland Security, agents have arrested several hundred people during the first couple weeks of what is expected to be a months-long operation that has a goal of 5,000 arrests.Back in September, Landry asked Trump to send a 1,000 federally funded troops toLouisianacities, citing concerns about crime. Landry has praised Trump for sending troops to other cities, including Washington DC and Memphis, Tennessee.The president has also taken a shine to Landry. Trump on Sunday announced he was appointing the governor to serve as his special envoy to Greenland, the strategic, vast and semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the US needs to take over.New Orleans has been on pace for much of the year to have its lowest number of murders in decades, according to preliminary data from the city’s police department. There have been 97 homicides in 2025 as of 1 November, including 14 revelers who were killed on New Year’s Day during a truck attack on Bourbon Street.A US army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wreaked carnage on New Orleans’ raucous new year’s celebration as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.There were 124 homicides last year and 193 in 2023, according to city figures. Armed robberies, aggravated assaults, carjackings, shootings and property crimes have also trended downward.New Orleans is no stranger to having national guard members in the city. In January, 100 guard members were sent to the city to help with security measures after the New Year’s Day truck attack. Guard members were also present for major events in the city this year, including the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.Explore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS militaryTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS immigrationUS domestic policyLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

Areas scorched by January’s wildfires were under evacuation warnings, and Los Angeles county officials said on Tuesday they were going door to door to about 380 especially vulnerable homes, ordering residents to evacuate because of the risk of landslides and debris flows.The San Bernardino county sheriff’s department also issued an evacuation warning on Wednesday morning for the community of Wrightwood, a mountain resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130km) north-east of Los Angeles, due to potential mud and debris flows from the storm.Debris and mud flow was seen rushing down the road leading into Wrightwood in a social media video posted by county fire officials. Crews were working to evacuate some homes, the post said. County officials didn’t immediately return questions about the evacuation.Areas along the coast, including Malibu, were under flood warnings on Wednesday, local officials said. Parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties were also preparing for potential flooding. Other parts of southern California were under wind and flood advisories. Farther north, much of the Sacramento valley and the San Francisco Bay Area were under a flood watch and high wind warning.Early on Wednesday morning, the Los Angeles fire department rescued a man trapped in a drainage tunnel in north-west LA that led to a river.Firefighters were able to get a ladder down through an opening, allowing the man to climb out, the fire department said. No injuries were reported, but the man is being evaluated.In Monterey along the central coast, more than 5,000 people lost power on Tuesday night due to a damaged power pole, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.The San Francisco and Los Angeles airports reported some minor flight delays on Wednesday morning.Conditions could worsen as multiple atmospheric rivers move across the state during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storm in Los Angeles was expected to strengthen into Wednesday afternoon before tapering off later in the evening.James Dangerfield, an 84-year-old Altadena resident, said his family and neighbor helped place sandbags in his back yard earlier this week. His neighborhood was under a flash flood warning as of Wednesday morning, but he wasn’t too worried.The street he lives on is on a hill, so most rainwater flows away from his home, he said. For now, he and his wife, Stephanie, planned on staying in the house and spending Christmas Eve with their two adult daughters and grandchildren.“We’re just going to stay put and everybody will have to come to us. We’re not going to go anywhere,” he said.Southern California typically gets half an inch to an inch (1.3-2.5cm) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see 4-8in (10-20cm), National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. It could be even more in the mountains. Gusts could reach 60-80mph (97-128km/h) in parts of the central coast.Forecasters also warned that heavy snow and gusts were expected to create “near white-out conditions” in parts of the Sierra Nevada and make it “nearly impossible” to travel through the mountain passes. As of Wednesday morning, there was also a “considerable” avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, a non-profit partnering with the US Forest Service.The National Weather Service said a winter storm warning would be in effect for the greater Tahoe region until Friday morning.Atmospheric rivers transport moisture from the tropics to northern latitudes in long, narrow bands of water vapor that form over an ocean and flow through the sky.Officials have taken steps to reduce the risk in and around burn scars, with Los Angeles county installing K-rails, a type of barrier to help catch sliding debris from burned areas, as well as offering free sandbags to residents.The storm has already caused damage in northern California, where flash flooding led to water rescues and at least one death, authorities said.The state has deployed emergency resources and first responders to several coastal and southern California counties, and the California national guard remains on standby.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaExtreme weatherLos AngelesWest CoastShareReuse this content"

The deal, in which BP will retain a 35% stake in the business through a joint venture, is expected to close at the end of next year, the company said on Wednesday.Was 2025 the year that business retreated from net zero?Read moreIt marks the latest step in BP’s push to sell $20bn in assets as it hasfaced pressure from the activist US hedge fund Elliott Investment Managementto cut costs and reduce debt.BP said it would use the $6bn in proceeds from the deal to pay down its own debt, which stood at $26.1bn at the end of its latest quarter.Carol Howle, the interim BP chief executive, said: “With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen BP’s balance sheet.“The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses and accelerating delivery of our plan.”BP’s new chair isoverseeing a radical overhaul of its strategyafter a failed attempt to pivot to renewable energy under his predecessor.View image in fullscreenMeg O’Neill is taking on a senior role at BP from April next year.Photograph: Edgar Su/ReutersLast week the company made the surprise announcement that it wasreplacing its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, after less than two years in the top job. He will be succeeded by Meg O’Neill, the chief executive of Woodside Energy, in April, with Howle taking charge in the interim.In October, Manifold, the former chief executive of the building materials company CRH, became the chair of the FTSE 100 group. He said last week that O’Neill would help BP become a “simpler, leaner and more profitable company”.Maurizio Carulli, an analyst at the investment company Quilter Cheviot, described the Castrol deal as “a positive step forward for BP, reinforcing its ongoing strategy reset and the aim to reduce its net debt and refocus its downstream business”.BP began the sale process for Castrol in February, whenAuchincloss announced a strategic resetwith a stronger focus on oil and gas and promising to cut costs and reduce debt.The Castrol business includes lubricants for the auto and industrial sectors, and has been developing liquid cooling fluids for datacentres.BP’s continued stake in the business gives it exposure to Castrol’s “growth plan”, it said. The company has the option to sell its stake after a two-year lock-up period.Shares rose 0.3% in early trading on Wednesday, and are up by about 6% in the year to date.Elsewhere, Petrofac, one of the biggest North Sea oil and gas contractors, has agreed to sell its asset solutions business to CB&I, a US industrial designer and manufacturer.The companies did not disclose the financial details of the deal in an announcement made on Wednesday, though it will be welcome news for Petrofac, whichfiled for administrationin October. The company, which employs about 7,300 people, said 3,000 are expected to join CB&I when the deal closes, which should be in the first quarter of 2026.Explore more on these topicsBPOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Across the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, sales were up by 50% on last year.The service works by letting brands sell directly inside TikTok through videos and livestreams with embedded links to items for sale, as well as through a separate shop tab on their profiles.A brand can post its own content and link to products itself, or allow influencers to promote them using affiliate links. Checkout happens without having to leave the app, and money is split after a sale between TikTok, the seller and any creator who helped drive it.View image in fullscreenTikTok Shop launched in the UK in 2021.Illustration: TikTokSainsbury’s, one of the first major supermarkets to launch on the platform, has found success with its Tu Christmas pyjamas. A sponsored collaboration with the influencer Rachel Spicer generated 6.6m views, with the pyjamas selling out in under a week.M&S has also enjoyed strong results from TikTok Shop livestreams with links to featured items, with one recent feed attracting 260,000 viewers and generating sales of about one item every 30 seconds.Small businesses are using it to try to increase their reach, especially now that AI ismaking it more tricky to show up in search results. The Fat Butcher, an online meat delivery service based in Newcastle, is selling fresh turkeys on the platform for the first time this year.According to Danielle Dullaghan, the social strategy director at the global marketing agency Iris, “beauty brands in particular are seeing strong commercial returns”.She says part of TikTok Shop’s success is the fact “it plays directly into impulse buying behaviour”.The London-based jewellery brand L’ERA, run by Lara Mar and her daughters Talia Mar and Angele Sofia, will generate about £145,000 in revenue through TikTok this year.“It has almost doubled year on year, and many of our online customers originally discovered us via TikTok,” Mar says.The brand relies heavily on live shopping, typically running three three-hour live streams a week, increasing to six during the Black Friday and Christmas periods.TikTok shoppers have shown a willingness to spend, with L’ERA’s largest single order via the platform exceeding £1,400.The business and social media consultant Jules Brim says: “TikTok Shop has exploded and for some small brands it’s been a gamechanger in terms of reach and sales. But what we don’t talk about enough is the cost. It can create a race to the bottom on pricing, put pressure on small businesses to produce constant content, and shift the focus from brand building to chasing trends.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokRetail industrySocial mediaE-commerceDigital mediaShoppingSmall businessnewsShareReuse this content"

We will further review our processes to make sure we maintain the highest standards of compliance.“ScotRail remains committed to offering great value for money and helping customers find the best fare for their journey, including through the removal of peak fares, a wide range of discounts, and simple, easy-to-use booking systems.”My Train Ticket said it welcomed the ASA ruling, adding that it regularly reviews and updates its website “to ensure it provides accurate, clear, and impartial information for our customers”.Why are flights in the UK so often cheaper than taking the train?Read moreGeorge Eckton, a rail commuter based in Glasgow and longstanding campaigner for better fare information, who had complained to the ASA, said: “The ASA ruling against Greater Anglia really matters because it shows something quite simple: the company was promising passengers the lowest prices even though it couldn’t prove that was true on its own website.“Passengers shouldn’t have to second‑guess whether a ‘best price’ claim is actually true … something the new Great British Railways needs to quickly address.”Greater Anglia declined to comment. After the ASA ruling, the wording on its website has been changed.The government has pledged to overhaul the confusing fares system and create its own national ticketing website as it sets upGreat British Railways.Explore more on these topicsRail faresRail industryTransportConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor and comedian opens upZoe WilliamsWed 24 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareWhen I catch up with Nick Mohammed, he is on the set of War, a new HBO series. Full of legal eagles, tech-bro hot shots and ugly divorces, it’s a punchy, slick enterprise, nothing at all like The Celebrity Traitors – except for the high drama, unbearable tension and the fact that Mohammed is reunited with Celia Imrie. Traitors was filmed in April and May and this started in September, so they both knew exactly what had happened in the castle, but were still in their chamber of deadly secrecy. Mainly, Mohammed was happy just to kick about with Imrie again. “She’s wonderful,” he says. “Everything you think she might be, she absolutely is – she’s just brilliant.”Which brings us to the root of the problem, the answer to the question: “What the hell happened, Nick?” Spoiler alert: we intend to talk about exactly what went down in the most infuriating Traitors final since, well, the last non-celebrity Traitors. If Joe Marler had had his way, he and Nick would have sauntered to victory, Alan Carr’s magisterial fibbing finally unmasked. Instead, Nick’s niggling doubts brought down the ship.View image in fullscreenBreakfast of not-quite-champions … Mohammed in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertMohammed defends himself stoutly: “I think I was relatively astute during it,” he says. “But when it came to Joe, during those last two or three days, I became convinced I was being played. All of him saying, ‘I want it to be just you and me in the final’ – maybe that was him trying to string me along because he was a traitor and he wanted to win. And then everything becomes confirmation bias.” Whatever the reason, he’s such a lovely guy that I’m just amazed he didn’t try voting himself out rather than upsetting anyone else.Mohammed and Marler have just had a post-Traitors reunion on the Gogglebox Stand Up to Cancer episode, which must surely have been a tiny bit awkward, what with the betrayal of the year hanging in the air. “No, he definitely wasn’t annoyed. You know what he’s like …” (Weirdly, we actuallydo– few of the faithful could have felt more authentically themselves than Joe Marler.) “He said, ‘It’s just a game, innit?’ Obviously he was shocked at the time, but within minutes, as soon as I got outside the castle and we had a drink together, it was all fine.”Before this year, Nick Mohammed had never been on TV as himself before. “I’ve done Taskmaster, but even that was dressed as Dracula. I always have to hide behind something.” That was partly because he wants to act, so has to think about preserving the mystery, “without sounding too pretentious”.But he adored regular Traitors so much that when the call came, he said a hard yes. Stephen Fry had already agreed, “and if he was doing it, who was I to say no?” Plus: “When else would you get that opportunity to orienteer in the Highlands of Scotland with all those people?” Huh. Orienteering. Interesting reason – though not as unusual as I thought. Tom Daley also reckoned he would smash the outdoor stuff, but was murdered too soon to prove it. “I like a good puzzle and a good outdoor activity. Who doesn’t?” says Nick, with fathomless wholesomeness.His career began nearly 30 years ago when he was 16 (he’s now 45). “As soon as I could start working, I was doing hotels and weddings as a closeup magician. I did it till I was 30, to pay my way through university, but as I started to get more and more telly work, it became a little bit odd. People would look at me, like, ‘Why are you here? What’s going on?’ So now I’d say I’m a hobbyist. I adore magic – I still do it every day, I read about it every day. I love going to conventions and talking to other magicians. But unless Mr Swallow does it, it’s not something I readily perform.”View image in fullscreen‘I like having to win people over’ … Mohammed in his 2018 Edinburgh Fringe show, Mr Swallow and the Vanishing Elephant.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianAh, Mr Swallow, the persona that built his profile: “It’s camp, it’s northern, it’s quite mainstream, it’s physical, it’s quite clowny. Even though it’s certainly notfor kids, there’s nothing really offensive in there.” The power-hungry magician character is based on an English teacher he had at school in Leeds, and is shot through with surreal affection. “Don’t get me wrong: I can be snarky and cynical. I enjoy comedians who have that as their shtick – but it’s not mine.”So it was quite tangential, inspired casting that put him inTed Lasso, as Nate Shelley, who goes from sidekick to (another spoiler, soz) villain, and gave Mohammed the urge to act. “That was the first time I was trusted with a role that took a darker turn. I suddenly got really bitten by that, being afforded that licence to stretch myself.”That track delivered Mohammed to the fifth season ofSlow Horses, in which he played the mayor of London. “The mayor was a person of colour and that does come into it. But I wanted to be really clear: this is not me impersonating Sadiq Khan.” That season was based on the Mick Herron volume that came out in 2017: “It’s not quite as on-the-pulse as you’d think. That’s sadly a reflection of the fact that there are lots of racial tensions, in the UK and in America, and they’re not going anywhere.”April 2026 is the next leg of Show Pony, his tenth Mr Swallow show. Has his role on Traitors brought him a whole new audience?“I remember first noticing this when Ted Lasso went really big, gigging in rooms that were a lot bigger than I was used to. A good 40% of the audience would never have seen Mr Swallow, and you could almost see them going: ‘Christ, what is this?’ But I like that, I like having to win people over.”It feels as though the more salient question is: can he make us forgive him? Because we still, bitterly, hold him responsible for the fact that he and Joe Marler didn’t win. All that being said, in losing the game, he did win our hearts.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVThe TraitorsSlow HorsesComedyMagicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s most addictive podcasts …Alexi Duggins,Hollie RichardsonandHannah J DaviesWed 24 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 06.03 ESTShare20Home Cooking With Samin Nosrat and Hrishikesh HirwayChef Samin Nosrat – author of the cult cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat – and Song Exploder supremo Hrishikesh Hirway revived their pandemic-era food podcast this year, and it was truly scrumptious. This warm hug of a show – propelled by the clear chemistry between the two friends – centred the communal and cultural power of food, drawing on its hosts’ diverse tastes and respective Iranian and Indian heritage. All that, while also answering listeners’ kitchen dilemmas (among them: what do you do when your partner has a pathological fear of white sauces, from mayonnaise to sour cream?).19Lucky BoyThe Observer’s Chloe Hadjimatheou has had a big year, thanks in part to her investigation into questions around the honesty of the author of the bestselling memoirThe Salt Path. Over in the podcast world, she’s had another success, too: this dark and gripping four-part series abouta schoolboy groomed by a female teacher in her late 20s. Lucky Boy swerves any temptation towards the salacious, instead focusing on the vulnerable (and sometimes seething) testimony of Gareth – now in his 50s – whose life was devastated both by the actions of his teacher and the inaction of other school staff.18Reclaiming With Monica LewinskyView image in fullscreenOne of the most riveting opening episodes ever … Monica Lewinsky.Photograph: Wondery/PAIn one of the most riveting opening podcast episodes ever, Monica Lewinsky was her own first guest. “There’s no field guide to surviving a scandal,” she said, before a brutally candid hour recounting her affair with Bill Clinton. It was a powerful start to a ballsy series about reclaiming what a person has lost (in the broadest sense). Since then, Lewinsky has proved a great host in meaty chats with guests including Amanda Knox, Margaret Cho, Ronan Farrow, Allison Janney, Elizabeth Gilbert and Kesha.17The Rise and Fall of … Indie SleazeView image in fullscreenWhat a hoot … Kate Nash.Photograph: Jude HarrisonMillennials had a hoot with this rollicking podcast about the messy indie sleaze era. Curiously, the term wasn’t coined until more than 20 years after the Strokes kicked off the scene with their dirty Converse. But hostKate Nashcaptures the unmistakable guitar riffs, skinny jeans and arrogant energy of the time. It’s a nostalgic bop-fest with sounds from the likes of the Long Blondes, Bloc Party, Arctic Monkeys and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, along with outrageous stories of the time told by the Cribs, the Libertines, Razorlight and Art Brut (Nash is very aware of the male-heavy roster – a symptom of the times). This might make you feel old as hell, or like a 17-year-old having the time of their life on a dirty dancefloor again.16Aftermath: Hunt for the Anthrax KillerThe 2001 anthrax crisis in the US has lost some of its sting in the years since, slipping into the footnotes of the post-9/11 “war on terror”. Hosted by Jeremiah Crowell, CBC’s podcast expertly reopened this disquieting chapter of American history, teleporting us back to the time when poisonous white powder began appearing in the mail, and asking whether the authorities ever truly solved the case. As well as zooming in on the blockbuster parts of the tale (FBI raids, suspicious scientists), it also considered the human casualties of this lethal act of bioterrorism.15Wanging OnThere is no naughtier sound thanGraham Nortonand Maria McErlane uncontrollably cackling together. The wickedly funny pair have been mates for three decades and first started solving listener dilemmas on Norton’s Radio 2 show 13 years ago. By popular demand, they’re back at it with this agony-aunt podcast, delving into everything from wedding-invite snubs and naked in-laws to what tote bag to take to the supermarket and holiday flings. But aside from the honest advice, it’s a joy to just hear Graham and Maria catching up (and often squabbling) over tea and biscuits as all great friends should.14Mad, Sad and Bad With Paloma FaithView image in fullscreenReunited … Alan Carr and Paloma Faith on Mad, Sad and Bad.Not content with her role in one of the best TV moments of the year (being bumped off by her best mate Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors, then leaving in a coffin),Paloma Faithalso presented one of the year’s best pods. Running counter to the usual breezy tone of most celeb-on-celeb interview shows, Mad, Sad and Bad invites guests to reflect on the more challenging times of their lives, alongside an ever-disarming host. The result is bracingly honest, from Jamie Laing unpicking his people-pleasing past, to writer Afua Hirsch illustrating the prejudice she experienced while working in television.13What We SpendMoney remains, for many of us, a deeply taboo subject – ironic, really, as speaking about it can educate us on how to save more of it, or remove some of the stigma of debt. Enter What We Spend, where Courtney Harrell scratches our nosy itch while also guiding us through the fiscal habits of a glut of ordinary Americans, complete with spending diaries of their daily lives. For some, there’s guilt – “should I ask my parents for more money for my wedding?” – while others, like a truck driver living in her vehicle, are just trying to survive.12Fela Kuti: Fear No ManView image in fullscreenAstonishing … Fela Kuti.Photograph: Tim Hall/RedfernsThis astonishingly detailed look at a musician whose story is far too little known in the west began with a flurry of impossibly starry endorsements (Obama! McCartney! Jay-Z!). And in nigh-on every episode there was at least one astonishing vignette – think Kuti’s mother’s nudity-assisted overthrow of a colonial governor, how he defied the Nigerian authorities by refusing to defecate for three days while in a prison cell, or the tragic recounting of a violent army raid on his family. Creator Jad Abumrad’s in-depth interviews and passionate explanation of the power of Kuti’s music created not just an immersive account of why Kuti’s name should be writ large in international history books, but quite probably the best music podcast of 2025.11Ill-advised by Bill NighyView image in fullscreenAgony uncle? … Bill Nighy.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for IMDbHe claims to have made so many bad life decisions that his main skill as an agony uncle is to act as a living guide to how not to do things. He promises not to say anything profound. He insists on starting the show by warning listeners that it is simply a way to waste their time. And to a certain extent, he’s right: this series of responses to reader questions washes over you so delightfully that it makes half an hour evaporate. But, despite the protestations, once you’ve spent time with his charming anecdotes, languidly delivered opinions and hilariously quirky takes on how to approach life, it’s impossible not to feel that you’re in the presence of wisdom. An absolutely delightful listen.10Cannonball with Wesley MorrisThe termination of And Just Like That! South Park’s takedown of Donald Trump! Lady Gaga’s triumphant return! After Still Processing, his hit podcast with co-host Jenna Wortham, New York Times critic Wesley Morris cannonballed into the culture pool solo with this lively, accessible series – and he had plenty to dig into with a top roster of guests each week. There were wider and more personal debates, too, from the changing role of music critics to the most formative summer films, and the deeper meaning behind being a Bruno Mars fan. A cracking weekly culture fix.9What’s My Age Again?View image in fullscreenIntriguing … Katherine Ryan.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images for SXSW LondonOne of Britain’s best-loved comics,Katherine Ryanhas become a major podcast player of late, too. What’s My Age Again? could have been car-crash territory, a show that invites celebrities to undergo a biological age test that tells them how old they really are, before branding them as decrepit. Luckily, it’s been a more sensitive affair, opening up all manner of intriguing conversations – from Joanne McNally on being an adoptee to Michelle de Swarte’s memories of her matriarchal upbringing.8Camp Swamp RoadAmerica’s stand-your-ground self-defence laws are at the heart of this Wall Street Journal miniseries, which begins with an agitated 911 call from a motorist, reporting an apparent road rage incident. The man on the phone, Weldon Boyd, would go on to kill the person he was reporting – Scott Spivey – in what local police found to have been self-defence. Valerie Bauerlein’s understated yet excellent journalism underpins this hard-hitting four-parter about events in South Carolina in 2023, and why Spivey’s sister, Jennifer, has long believed there was more to what happened on that day than was initially understood.7Good Hang With Amy PoehlerDescribing a podcast as perfect background listening is liable to come off as a little backhanded. But Good Hang is just that: a tonic of a series that offers levity, joy and just the right amount of celebrity schmoozing, and doesn’t require you to work your grey matter too hard. Poehler has great fun chatting to her showbiz pals, reuniting with most of the cast ofParks and Recin the process. Her episode with Aubrey Plaza is also a masterclass in engaging with a friend’s grief (Plaza had recently been widowed), rather than giving it a wide berth.6The Retrievals: The C-sectionsThe first series of this Serial podcast – also hosted and reported by Susan Burton – told the horrifying story of patients who underwent IVF procedures without pain drugs, after a nurse stole their medication and swapped it for saline solution. This follow-up continued the theme of motherhood and medical injustice, focusing on the grim reality of the many mothers affected – as many as 100,000 in the US each year – many of whom feel excruciating pain during caesareans. Terrifying – and very triggering for anyone who has suffered a similar experience – it also provides a crucial window into an under-reported issue.5StalkedView image in fullscreenCaptivating … Hannah Mossman Moore and Carole Cadwalladr.Photograph: BBC Sounds/Sarah Louise Bennett/PAPulitzer prize-nominated journalist Carole Cadwalladr never fails to tell tales that are anything but fearless. And so it was with her BBC podcast, which saw her team up with Hannah Mossman Moore, the daughter of her ex-partner, so they could detail the awful online abuse that she was subjected to. From chilling interviews with cyberstalking experts to doorstepping the prime suspect, and the forensic detailing of the head-spinning emails and fake accounts Mossman Moore was bombarded with, it’s a captivating, immersive listen that attempts to turn the tables.4Blood RelativesThe New Yorker’s In the Dark has long been one of the most compelling true-crime series around, and its latest British-based outing kept the bar high. Staff writer Heidi Blake was thorough and unrelenting – and left no part of a “bewildering morass” of legal documents unread – as she revisited the infamousWhite House Farm murders, and questioned the evidence that put Jeremy Bamber behind bars for the murder of his adoptive parents, sister and two nephews. It was bolstered by the hours Blake spends in conversation with Bamber – a contradictory figure who, she said, seems to have an “uncanny detachment” from the murders and a deep grief over the loss of his family.3Flesh and CodeView image in fullscreenEye-opening stuff … Travis from Flesh and Code.Photograph: WonderyA show aboutpeople who fell in love with their AI chatbotscould have been an exercise in gawping at baffling lifestyle choices. But while this series didn’t fail to deliver jaw-dropping revelations, it wasn’t at the expense of the interviewees who became romantically entangled with digital creations. Main interviewee Travis, and his account of being taken by surprise byromantic feelings for AI bot Lily Rose, was a sensitively handled, if eye-opening tale that raised questions about the existence of digital consciousness and the difference between online and offline relationships. But it was the way it spun out to look at the brains behind the app and how it became entangled in another user’s wild attempted assassination against a head of state that pushed the show into edge-of-the-seat stuff.2Missing in the AmazonIn June 2022, British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira failed to return home from a reporting trip in Brazil’s Javari Valley. Their disappearance – and the subsequent realisation that they had been murdered – appalled the country, and the world. Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, was the reporter and host of this stirring series – in part an exploration into the climate of organised crime and ecological destruction that surrounded their deaths, but also a tender portrait of two men from different backgrounds united by friendship and a commitment to the rainforest.1WisecrackView image in fullscreenOne of a kind … Edd Hedges.Photograph: Tenderfoot TVThis word-of-mouth hit wasn’t just a gripping true-crime podcast, but a format-busting exercise in ensuring that describing it as “a gripping true-crime podcast” almost certainly fails to do it justice. It began, ostensibly, as a highlights reel of a standup comedy set, with TV crime producer Jodi Tovay talking about stumbling into the Edinburgh festival gig of comedian Edd Hedges. Hugely engaging clip after hugely engaging clip is played of a show in which Hedges talks about his brush with a murderer, and while it’s so addictive that you want to binge the whole thing in one go, it initially feels a tad like Tovay’s show is simply a hack job on someone else’s comedy. Until her true-crime experience is brought to bear, Hedges goes under the microscope and the series flips on its head to become a meticulously researched investigation that encompasses death, trauma and the notion of truth in art. There’s never been another true-crime show quite like it."

I definitely went intoF1: The Movieknowing what I was in for, an answer to the hypothetical: what if the bougiest sport on God’s green earth was turned into a western? But you can’t help going along for the ride once Brad Pitt starts filling the frame with his blue-eyed winks, wry smiles and Butch Cassidy swagger. I should’ve been more indignant about this martinet sport making a literal hero out of the biggest rogue on the grid. But I left disbelief in parc fermé as Pitt’s Sonny Hayes bumped and nicked his way to the season finale at Abu Dhabi to much consternation before his wingman (Damson Idris) takes up the ticky tactics at Yas Marina circuit and winds up sacrificing himself and producer Lewis Hamilton (not again!) to help Sonny win his first race and thwart a hostile takeover of their fragile team. And when the lights went up at my desolate midday screening, it was just me still on the edge of my seat and my disbelief still firmly off track.Andrew LawrenceThe impregnation –Marty SupremeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWhere to start? Jos Safdie’s ping-pong epic is fitted out with one brilliantly imagined sequence after another, any of which could qualify as the year’s best. The death camp honey-licking? The orange-ball sales pitch? The Chalamet ass-whipping? The ping-pong club as mob lounge? You’re spoiling us, Mr Safdie. But I think on balance the most eye-popping bit of all is, of all things, its animated opening credits sequence, which follows, shall we say, a spermatozoa race to the ovum, a pseudo-real version of what Woody Allen got up to in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. This takes its cue from what’s just happened in the film’s opening scene, and ties in (without giving too much away) to its ending. It’s been a long time since I felt my jaw actually drop slightly in a cinema; if nothing else, it tips you off that something ... unusual ... is on its way.Andrew PulverThe loft –The MastermindView image in fullscreenPhotograph: MUBI/PAPlenty of us saw something of the silent comic in Josh O’Connor when he tramped around in La Chimera, and this year, in Wake Up Dead Man he was able to leap triumphantly into physical comedy. But as hapless heistman JB in Kelly Reichardt’s beautiful The Mastermind he is a very appealingly low-key kind of clown. JB is an everyman reaching for an easy win, a little chap hindered by his own ineptitude, and beset by forces beyond his control. In particular, I loved the sequence in which he labours up a rickety ladder in a dark pigsty to stash his pilfered paintings in a hay loft. The camera lingers on the wobbling ladder, the snuffling hog always in sight while JB huffs and puffs. You just know that ladder is going to fall, which tells us so much about the likely success of his entire plan. Sooner or later, slapstick Sisyphus is going to end up flat on his back in the pigshit.Pamela HutchinsonThe dance –SinnersI’m often indifferent to music performances in a movie; they rarely cast the same spell that live music does. Midway through Ryan Coogler’s 1930s vampire thrillerSinners, though, Sammie (Miles Caton) sings an original song, I Lied to You, at his cousins’ juke joint opening night, and what at first seems like a standard party interlude becomes a seductive and sublime centerpiece moment. With cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s Imax aspect ratio choice and Caton’s deep, buttery voice, the room begins to bend around Sammie, his talents suspending the laws of physics. In what feels like one sumptuous, swirling shot, then appears a futuristic Bootsy-Collins-type figurer, a Zaouli dancer, a DJ, Memphis jookin dancers, a ballerina – Black ancestors and descendants of the partygoers appearing under one roof, summoned by Sammie’s song. “This music is ours,” legendary harmonica player Delta Slim tells Sammie in a flashback – “we brought this with us from home.” It’s a risk taken by Coogler that pays off handsomely as we’re given an inebriating taste of transcendence. Watching it for the first time in a crowded theater, I felt every person lock in in a way that now seems meta: relishing in art and feeling its rapture and defiance. Like Slim said: “It’s sacred and big.”Tammy TarngThe fight –SplitsvilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APIn late summer of this year, I briefly took a break from bemoaning the death of the big-screen comedy. That break lasted around 104 minutes as I found myself actually audibly laughing in a cinema at the self-billed “unromantic comedy” Splitsville. It was a film that managed to be both absurdly silly and neatly relatable, a chaotic but thoughtful yet deranged look at straight couples navigating the brave new world of non-monogamy. There were many great small gags but it was the ridiculously extended fight between the central friends turned rivals, played by the film’s writers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, that has truly stuck for me. Post-Bridget Jones it became an easy joke to poke fun at polite middle-class men engaging in fisticuffs without knowing what to do and when this one starts with a slap, one might expect the same, now very tired routine. But instead we see two men whodoknow what they’re doing, albeit messily, proceed to destroy their friendship and the beautiful house around them, a spectacularly violent, and seriously well-directed, set piece. It serves as an early, unhinged reminder that behind the sleekly designed, smugly progressive sheen of certain “modern” couples lies pettiness, rage and a desire to drown your best friend in a bathtub full of fish.Benjamin LeeThe play –HamnetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Agata Grzybowska/APFor weeks, I have been imploring those close to me to seeHamnet,Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, which proves that sometimes, a great ending can save an OK movie. Zhao’s film on Shakespeare’s domestic life pre-Hamlet struggles to balance sylvan fairytale with brutal, beautiful realism – I was put off by the remote romance between William (Paul Mescal) and Agnes (Jessie Buckley), then riveted by the unsparing horror of their child’s final hours, then tepid on the biopic-esque treatments of grief. But the ending! The stellar, knockout, bravura ending, in which – light spoilers ahead – Agnes attends the inaugural performance of Hamlet at the Globe, saves the whole thing, and accomplishes the stunning feat of briefly collapsing time. Watching the title character face death, Agnes reaches for her late son; the audience, moved by the performance, reaches for the departing prince; and we, watching a new imagining of a 425-year-old play, reach toward the same question that has dogged all humans, always: how do you endure, when to live means to lose the ones we love? I left in tears, reminded again that such reaching – for others, for the lost, for connection, for a moment of transcendence through great art – is really all we have.Adrian HortonThe chase –One Battle After AnotherView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APRight in the middle of Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest opus, after years living an incognito, marijuana-saturated life far away from anything, the heat descends on former revolutionary Pat Calhoun in the form of a militarized team reminiscent of Ice stormtroopers, and it’s time for him to run like hell. Crawling through a homemade spider hole, Pat emerges yards away from his house, eventually grabs a burner phone, gets help from his teenage daughter’s ready-for-anything martial arts instructor (played charmingly by Benicio del Toro), attempts multiple times to call up his former revolutionary outlaws (but gets rebuffed because he can’t remember the password), wanders through an immigration raid (orchestrated to give cover to the operation to abduct Pat), leaps across rooftops, and trips over his own two feet at least half a dozen times. On one level this chase is extraordinary film-making, choreographed like a ballet and an exercise in pathos, high-wire thrills and absurd comedy all rolled into one, but on another level it’s absolutely prescient in a way that only movies can be, documenting so much of what it feels like to live in a would-be authoritarian America in 2025. It’s also a showcase for late-stage Leonardo DiCaprio and the absolutely thick chemistry that he has with Del Toro. In its seeming endlessness, its paranoid capacity to bring together things that shouldn’t be combined but are, its slapstick energy, and its finger-on-the-pulse realness, this segment ofOne Battle After Anotherseems destined to be remembered. It was the best part of one of the best movies of the year, and something I’m going to be thinking about for a long time to come.Veronica EspositoThe subway –Highest 2 LowestView image in fullscreenPhotograph: PAThe first half or so of Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest takes place mostly in the rarified world of David King, a wealthy, respected, gregarious but stubborn music mogul played by Denzel Washington. He lives in a Dumbo penthouse with his family, travels by private car, and has a skyscraping office in Manhattan. Lee captures all of this with clear, crisp digital cinematography that borders on antiseptic, especially with the static, sometimes oddly placed camera angles. But when a friend of the family is accidentally kidnapped in place of David’s son and he reluctantly agrees to pay the ransom, the film’s visual strategy shifts. As David boards a subway in Brooklyn to drop the money somewhere in the Bronx, Lee switches to 16mm celluloid, capturing the less controlled, more vibrant energy of a crowded 6 train making its way through multiple boroughs – on a Yankees game day coinciding with the Puerto Rican Day parade, no less. David’s cloistered version of New York falls away. It’s a good long while before any traditional thriller action kicks in, yet in this transition, the movie vibrates, subway-like, with excitement, like it’s about to break into song. Forty years into his career, Lee keeps finding new ways to show his love for the city, and the movies.Jesse HassengerThe van push –It Was Justan AccidentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APThe Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi made It Was Just an Accident in secret, his usual MO to resist censorship from an Iranian regime that recently sentenced him (in absentia) to yet another year in prison. That clandestine approach made way for one of the movie’s most surprising (and in part, accidentally) subversive moments, during an overhead shot where the film-making team is recording and directing from a rooftop. In Panahi’s soul-searching tragicomic allegory about how Iran’s people will find a way forward from oppression and trauma, the occupants in a stalled white van, a bride in a full white gown among them, hop out into Tehran’s traffic to push the vehicle along. They’re in a panic because these former political prisoners have got an abducted man, who they believe to be their torturer, knocked out and tied down in the back. The moment arrives as a joyous bit of comic relief from the urgency of the narrative. But it grows even more transcendent when passersby, at least one who isn’t an actor according to the film’s cinematographer, come along to help the stranded passengers. It’s one of the many fissures between fiction and reality in It Was Just an Accident, a potent and unassuming image of hope and community, where the people of Iran have a hand in the film’s political resistance, whether they know it or not.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe opening –On Becoming a Guinea FowlView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chibesa Mulumba. Courtesy of A24Perhaps the most arrestingly mysterious establishing scene of the year was in Rungano Nyoni’s On Becoming a Guinea Fowl, a drama of memory and reconciliation set in present-day Zambia. The film opens on Susan Chardy’s city-dwelling Shula, driving alone at night on a dark rural road. She is clad in a glittery mask as if having just come from a masquerade ball, a jaunty classic tune (Come on Home by the Lijadu Sisters) brightly blaring on the radio. Her pleasant, if strange, journey is then suddenly darkened by the discovery of a body lying on the road. What follows in Nyoni’s transfixing film is grim and haunting and fitfully funny. That mood is cast perfectly right from the get-go, as dreamy surreality runs into cold, hard fact.Richard LawsonThe skeeting –PredatorsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Sundance InstituteAt first, David Osit’s documentary reflects on the unsavory legacy of To Catch a Predator, the popular mid-2000s Dateline NBC show in which would-be pedophiles were lured to a home packed with hidden cameras and exposed for trying to hook up with underage kids. But the show is merely a jumping-off point for a more prismatic look at a culture of abuse and exploitation, and it leads to a particularly mesmerizing segment on the YouTube copycats who have brought the same TV formula into the digital era. In one sequence, Osit’s camera is present for a chaotic sting operation in a seedy motel where Skeet Hansen, a popular host, emerges from a closet to snare a man who thinks he’s meeting a 14-year-old girl. The man is so profoundly distraught over his choices that it deflates Hansen’s “gotcha” moment. Yet Hansen has a brand to protect, which leads to the most comically sober utterance of his catchphrase imaginable: “You’ve just been Skeeted.”Scott TobiasExplore more on these topicsFilm2025 in cultureSinnersOne Battle After AnotherHamnetMarty SupremefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tobias Menzies stars as Roger Winstanley, haunted since childhood by a peculiar dream. As he crouches in an air raid shelter (the story is set during the blitz, with flashbacks to an earlier era), he shares his vision with a sympathetic stranger. But as the ground shakes with bombs, too much imagination is a dangerous thing.Phil HarrisonThe Great British Sewing Bee Celebrity Christmas Special7.25pm, BBC OneDelicious chaos as more hapless celebrities pick up needles and thread.

Charming stuff.PHMortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Christmas Fishing9pm, BBC TwoIt’s hard to think of a more wholesome way to spend Christmas Eve than in the company of Bob, Paul and Ted the dog. This time, they’re in Devon and Cornwall and heading out to sea – which is often a recipe for disaster. Back on land, they’re joined by Dawn French and Dr Anand Patel.PHTwo Doors Down Christmas Special10pm, BBC OneIn a welcome return for the slow-burn Scottish sitcom, the slightly early unveiling of the Bairds’ Christmas tree sends off a smoke signal declaring the start of the festive season. Much to the disdain of Beth (Arabella Weir), the house is soon filled with friendly neighbourhood faces, requesting mince pies and debating Fairytale of New York.Nicole VassellMidnight Mass From Our Lady of the English Martyrs, Cambridge11.50pm, BBC OneThe traditional first mass of the nativity is a reflective way to usher in Christmas Day. Live from one of the largest Roman Catholic churches in the UK, the celebration includes Mozart’s Coronation Mass and Francis Poulenc’s choral piece O Magnum Mysterium, as well as readings, carols and the blessing of the crib.Graeme VirtueFilm choiceView image in fullscreenTear-jerker … Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/Netflix/PAGoodbye June(Kate Winslet, 2025),NetflixFor her directorial debut, a tear-stained tale of family and fatality in the lead-up to Christmas, Kate Winslet has wisely stuffed it with quality actors. So we have Helen Mirren as the titular, terminally ill mum and Timothy Spall as the slightly feckless father. And their four grownup kids are played by Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself. Joe “son of Kate” Anders’s script keeps the schmaltz to a minimum (despite the presence of small children), with most of the action set in the far-from-festive environs of a hospital.Simon WardellCitizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941),9am, BBC TwoWidely cited as the greatest film ever, Orson Welles’s meditation on power and loneliness has a reputation you can see from space. Bulldozing convention with its cavalier approach to staging and structure, its ambition is evident from the very first scene. True, in the decades since it was released, its power has been diluted by parodies and copyists, but that only makes it more ripe to revisit. And what could be more Christmassy than the tragic tale of a man who has everything except the thing he really wants?Stuart HeritageET: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982),1.35pm, ITV1A raft of billboards recently suggested that Steven Spielberg is about six months away from releasinganother movie about aliens. But it would be a miracle if his new endeavour contained even a 10th of the heart of ET. Equal parts sci-fi adventure and childhood fever dream, this is the tale of a lonely boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas), who befriends a stranded being from another world and learns about connection, wonder and the importance of home. ET is now 43 years old, and the fact that it can still reduce people to puddles is proof that it is a stone-cold classic.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So this new film covering Bowie’s final decades could be a tough sell for non-completists: the 90s and 00s were not, let’s be honest, Bowie’s golden years, creatively or reputationally. After his perpetual self-reinvention during the 70s and early 80s, fans were somewhat baffled by his new band Tin Machine, which critic Jon Wilde dismissed as “glorified pub rock” in his scathing Melody Maker review (even Wilde shakes his head as he reads it out again here; the last line is: “You’re a fucking disgrace.”)It’s not all doom and gloom, though, even if Bowie seemed to be following the zeitgeist rather than leading it - not least with his short-lived foray into drum & bass. The narrative almost acknowledges as much with frequent flashbacks to the halcyon days, and Bowie’s lifelong fascination with outer space the through-line. And there are enjoyable contributions from the likes of Tony Visconti, Rick Wakeman, Dana Gillespie,Hanif Kureishi, and guitarists Earl Slick and Reeves Gabrels.Bowie’s 2000 Glastonbury show is positioned as something of a comeback, after which he enjoyed living legend status, but it’s arguably only his final album, Blackstar, that really stands out creatively. Ten years on, it’s moving to hear Visconti, his lifelong friend and collaborator, talking about recording in secret what they all knew would be his last project. It would be wrong to call it going out on a high, under the circumstances, but it’s heartening that Bowie could craft such a poignant, defiant, dignified exit.Bowie: The Final Act is in UK and Irish cinemas from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDavid BowieTony ViscontiRick WakemanHanif KureishireviewsShareReuse this content"

Spafford Campbell – Tomorrow HeldInspired by Talk Talk’s Spirit of Eden and the quivering soundscapes of early Bon Iver, Tomorrow Held is the beautiful second album by fiddler Owen Spafford and guitarist Louis Campbell, their first on Peter Gabriel’s Real World Records. Mingling traditional tunes with influences from minimalism, post-rock and jazz, they shift moods exquisitely: from the reflectiveness of 26, a track in which drumbeats echo in the distance like heartbeats, to the trip-hop-like grooves of All Your Tiny Bones and the feverish panic of the full-throttle final track, Four.9. Benedicte Maurseth – MirraView image in fullscreenFascinating ways … Benedicte Maurseth.Photograph: Agnete BrunMaurseth wasn’t the only musician inspired by the reindeer-hunting peoples of Scandinavia this year: Sara Ajnnak and the Ciderhouse Rebellion’s Landscape of the Spirits also plumbed this icy soil well. Here, hardanger fiddle player Maurseth sets out to translate the theory of ecosophy, a philosophy of ecological harmony, into sound. She does so in fascinating ways, blending her instrument’s drones and plucked notes with field recordings of the calls and movements of animals and birds, and their resonant approximations on her band’s bass guitar, electronics and piano. Particularly powerful are Kalven Reiser Seg (The Calf Rises), about a newborn deer, and Jaktmarsj (Hunting March).Read the full reviewTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more8. Jennifer Reid – The Ballad of the GatekeeperA Lancashire dialect singer and dogged researcher of workers’ songs, Reid’s voice is like her approach to folk – filled with beauty in its boldness. Her debut album mixes direct a cappellas with songs accompanied by soft percussion, layered harmonies, and birdsong, giving old stories like Spinning Shoddy and Poor Little Factory Girls a powerful new impact. She also mixes in striking political originals like When the Rivers Rise, So Must We, about bankers “dividing up land that is destined to perish”, and Conversa, which connects “factory and call centre cousins through time”.7. Zoé Basha – GambleBasha’s bluesy tones arrive like ghosts from the early days of radio, but she also manages to handle traditional ballads, such as Three Little Babes and Love Is Teasin’, with a sharp freshness. The debut album by this French-American based in Dublin positions folk material on the same sweet platform as country songs such as Sweet Papa Hurry Home and originals dusted with influences from ragtime and chanson. Her intricate accompaniments, from nyckelharper to Spanish guitar and synths swirling in sub-bass on What Dream Is This, herald a refreshing new talent.Read the full review6. Lisa Knapp and Gerry Diver – HinterlandView image in fullscreenWild and innovative … Lisa Knapp and Gerry Diver.Photograph: Rosie Reed GoldKnapp has long been an exciting folk singer and interpreter, with a range that’s open-hearted and wild, and her husband, Gerry Diver, is an innovative producer working with ease across folk, pop, film and TV. The couple’s first officially collaborative album includes a brilliant, cinematic rendition of the murder ballad Long Lankin and a moving, fragile rush through the emotions of Irish ballad Lass of Aughrim. Knapp’s spry facility with the fiddle in Monaghan Jig/Monks Jig Set also impresses, as does her spoken-word delivery of travelling snapshots in Train Song.Read the full review5. Malmin – Med Åshild VetrhusThese bright, rugged settings of Norwegian dances, psalms and ballads, sourced from early to mid-20th-century recordings, are not for those who like their folk polished and cosy. Hardanger fiddles gnash and shiver away while microtonal mandolins and guitars discover the gnarly, wonderful hinterlands between notes. This record’s pace veers between the irresistible energy of Hullaspringar (Hole Jumps) and the reverence of its religious climax, Man Fandt Jo Dette Himmelsind (This Heavenly Mind Was Found), where singer Åshild Vetrhus startlingly pulls you back through the centuries.Read the full review4. Poor Creature – All Smiles TonightView image in fullscreenIntriguing new palette … Poor Creature.Photograph: Cían FlynnAn Irish folk super-trio comprising Landless’s Ruth Clinton, Lankum’s Cormac MacDiarmada and their live drummer John Dermody, Poor Creature diverted from the intensity of their other groups to make one of 2025’s most surprising, haunting and gently poppy debuts. The title track and Adieu Lovely Erin spring off digital rhythms to sound like Broadcast entering the whirlpools of folk, while in Willie-O and Irish love song An Draighneán Donn (The Blackthorn Tree), they build up delightful, dream-like layers of texture. Fiddles and guitars mix with theremin, mid-century organs and modern-day synthesisers to create an intriguing new palette for the genre.Read the full review3. Savina Yannatou, Primavera en Salonico and Lamia Bedioui – WatersongA collection of 14 folk songs that swirl around an essential, mystical resource that can both cleanse and drown, Watersong takes us across Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa with an explorer’s verve. Greek singer Yannatou stunningly conveys longing in O Onda (The Wave) and A los Baños del Amor (To the Baths of Love), bends her voice elsewhere like a multi-faceted piece of percussion, and clicks magically with the album’s other great singer, Tunisia’s Bedioui. Primavera en Salonico’s players also provide fascinating accompaniment on the ney (an ancient flute), the qanun (an Arabian zither) and bowed waterphone.Read the full review2. Širom – In the Wind of Night, Hard-Fallen Incantations WhisperView image in fullscreenFittingly mystical … Širom.Photograph: Nada ŽgankWest African xylophones, Moroccan guembris and resonator guitars are among the two dozen instruments creating the intense, shining soundworlds on the fifth album by Slovenian trio Širom. Its seven tracks come with fittingly mystical titles like Curls Upon the Neck, Ribs Upon the Mountain – a track that begins in intense fiddle harmonies before drums and wails ramp up a mood of menace – and No One’s Footsteps Deep in the Beat of a Butterfly’s Wings, which blends frisky bluegrass with a flute’s high sighs. A rollercoaster journey showing the potential of traditional instruments to make mayhem.Read the full review1. Quinie – Forefowk, Mind MeAn album that has dug deep into my bones since its release in May, this set of Scots Travellers’ songs, put together by Josie Vallely, AKA Quinie (pronounced “q-why-nee” – “young woman” in the Doric dialect), came accompanied by liner notes and a film, made while Vallely travelled on horseback through Argyll. It’s a raw 11-song set, exploring with lusty innovation and energy what our forefowk (ancestors) mean to us, how they care for us and how we care for them. Influenced by the practices of canntaireachd (the vocal mimicry of pipe music), sean-nós singing, spoken-word and raw a cappella, it’s soul-rattling stuff, reminding us of the past as we approach our fragile future.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsFolk musicBest music of 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

One case in 1725 concerned a recently deceased peasant farmer, Peter Blagojević, who rose from the grave, visited his wife to demand his shoes, and then murdered nine people in the night. When his body was disinterred, his mouth was found full of fresh blood. The villagers staked the corpse and then burned it. In 1745, the clergyman John Swinton published an anonymous pamphlet, The Travels of Three English Gentlemen, from Venice to Hamburgh, in which it is written: “These Vampyres are supposed to be the Bodies of deceased Persons, animated by evil Spirits, which come out of the Graves, in the Night-time, suck the Blood of many of the Living, and thereby destroy them.” And so a modern myth was born.But it is not so modern, or exclusively European, as this extraordinary survey shows. Instead, the author, a historian and archeologist, argues that belief in the unquiet dead is found in many cultures and periods, where it can lay dormant for centuries before erupting in an “epidemic”, as in Serbia. Where there is no written source, John Blair makes persuasive use of archeological finds in which bodies are found to have been decapitated or nailed down. In 16th-century Poland, a buried woman “had a sickle placed upright across her throat and a padlock on the big toe of her left foot”. Someone, our author infers reasonably, wanted to keep these people in their coffins.The familiar horror taxonomy of zombies versus vampires and so forth is relatively modern; they are variations on the single ancient theme that dead people can rise from the grave and persecute the living. Blair calls them all “dangerous corpses”, or the “restless dead”, or the “walking dead”. But they still come in different guises, as we learn on this splendidly gruesome journey. Some are “shroud-chewers”, some are “lip-smackers”, some are “suckers”; others are “bloaters”, “damned huntsmen”, “night-stranglers” or “night-mares”, in the original sense of a demon that presses on a person in bed during the dark hours. A 15th-century dead baker in Brittany continued to get up at night to help his family knead dough, but also went around other houses “throwing stones at people”. As late as the 19th century in New England, people who had died of tuberculosis were suspected of killing others from the grave, and so exhumed and incinerated.Blair argues that killing dead people again is actually therapeutic – and this form of therapy is not yet consigned to historySuch beliefs can bubble along underground, as it were, for a long time; but bouts of corpse-killing arise, Blair argues, only when an endemic belief system is animated by a particular set of “stresses and anxieties”. In early medieval England, vampire epidemics attended waves of the Black Death; later, in Saxony, the Lutheran Reformation abolished purgatory, and left grieving families with a need for “new answers” about the fate of the dead. The largest known “corpse-killing panic” in history, which ran into the hundreds of bodies, happened in 18th-century Moravia: Blair diagnoses “a sense of unfinished business” over the decades of witch trials that preceded it. Not long afterwards, we find vampires reported for the first time where an innocent might have supposed they were all along: in Transylvania.The top 10 vampire booksRead moreIn conclusion, Blair argues that killing dead people again is actually “therapeutic”: “Like other extreme rituals, it is distressing at the time but leaves people feeling good afterwards.” And this form of therapy is not yet consigned to history: vampires still harass people in pockets of rural Greece and the Baltics, and a Serbian priest was suspended by his bishop in 2019 for participating in the “exhumation and staking of a woman”.Alas for Bram Stoker fans, for whom Dracula is the Christmassy terror par excellence, the old count himself gets short shrift here, ticked off for being “very unlike the dangerous corpses in which people have actually believed”. Blair even calls Stoker’s novel “misleading”, which is an odd thing to say about a work of fiction. But he does give the Irishman good marks for coining the excellent word “undead”.Killing the Dead: Vampire Epidemics from Mesopotamia to the New World by John Blair is published by Princeton (£30).

Among them were a clutch of literary stars: Oscar Wilde, Evelyn Waugh, Muriel Spark and Graham Greene. But there was a whole host of poets, artists and public intellectuals less known to us today, whose “going over to Rome” provoked envy and dismay.In this thoughtful though brisk book, Melanie McDonagh, a columnist for The Tablet, gives us 16 case histories of Britons who went “Poping” during the scariest decades of the 20th century. At a time when reason and decency appeared to have been chased out by political extremism and global warfare, it was only natural to long for something solid. Writing in 1925, Greene confided to his fiancee “one does want fearfully hard for something firm and hard and certain, however uncomfortable, to catch hold of in the general flux”.Contrary to lurid Protestant fantasies, Catholic priests were not on the hunt for celebrity scalps to “lure” into their incense-fugged, whiskey-sodden clutches. Again and again, McDonagh’s converts report being taken aback by the way in which their approaches to Brompton Oratory or Chelsea’s Farm Street Church were met with a cool equanimity and slightly humiliating lack of interest. The job of the instructing priest was to tell you what was what, furnish you with the Penny Catechism and send you on your way. According to Maurice Baring, a man of letters who converted in 1909, the clergy were what ticket offices were to train stations: they gave the traveller information and told them where to go. Whether the traveller boarded the train was none of their business.But this take-it-or-leave-it approach was ultimately appealing, especially to those who had “come over” from Anglicanism. To worship in the Church of England was to be presented with an infinite number of riddles. Not sure where you stood on the Real Presence, the Immaculate Conception, or even the Resurrection? Anglicans were happy to discuss the complexities ad infinitum. RH Benson, son of a former archbishop of Canterbury, spoke for many when he explained how frustrating he found this latitude when set against Catholic certainty: “there is a liberty which is a more intolerable slavery than the heaviest of chains”.The aesthetic pleasures of Roman Catholicism also turned out to be largely illusory. Unless attending one of the smart London churches, converts had to get used to worshipping in ugly modern buildings alongside largely working-class congregations. Charles Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Proust, described how on Easter Sunday 1915, he had gone “to a hideous drab little RC chapel” on the edge of an industrial estate which had an inaudible priest and no music. Nonetheless, Moncrieff, still an Anglican at this point, realised in a flash that he must be a Catholic. If you wanted magnificent buildings, glorious hymns, beautiful vernacular liturgy and the sort of clergyman whom you could invite to your club then you would be better off staying with the Established Church.Then there was the inevitable censure. When Spark’s Miss Jean Brodie tartly declared that “only people who did not want to think for themselves were Roman Catholics” she was voicing a general prejudice. Also commonplace were charges of moral turpitude (it didn’t help that Wilde, Bosie Douglas, Aubrey Beardsley and many other 1890s decadents had converted). To become a Catholic was to invite suspicion that you were mad, secretly gay or spying for a foreign power.Despite these penalties, few converts seem to have regretted their decision although, as McDonagh points out, it is hard to know for certain. Becoming a Catholic is a recorded event; deciding not to be one is simply a matter of no longer turning up to church. There is, too, a notable lack of women in this book, notwithstanding chapters on Gwen John, Spark and the Oxford philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe. Perhaps, although McDonagh does not say so, this was because women converting did not pose as much of a threat to the established order. The structure of her book, comprising a series of discrete case histories, means that these wider considerations fall between the cracks. What Converts lacks in analysis, though, it makes up for in vivid biographical storytelling.Converts by Melanie McDonagh is published by Yale (£25).

It’s an old home movie showing a boy and a girl on Christmas morning eagerly unwrapping a present that turns out to be an N64 console – the boy is, to put it mildly, extremely pleased. It’s a scene a lot of us who play games will recognise: the excitement and anticipation provided by that big console-sized parcel, or the little DVD-shaped package that could be the latest Super Mario adventure. Although I never got a games machine at Christmas, I remember one year being given Trivial Pursuit on the Commodore 64 and the whole family gathered around the TV to play. It was one of the few times my mum and my sisters showed any interest in the computer, and I loved getting them involved.Veteran designer Rhod Broadbent of Dakko Dakko recalls the Christmas of 1992, when his father, a programmer who had previously looked down on games consoles, bought him Mario Kart and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. “Zelda was completely unknown to me at the time,” he recalls. “I think Dad was probably expecting me to be more excited. But after I had spent the morning in Mario Kart, I plugged in Zelda and everything changed. From the title music, through the intro and into that beautiful initial thunderstorm, everything was so polished and smooth and unlike the video games I’d played before. It didn’t leave the cartridge slot for weeks. I remember that Christmas morning like it was yesterday …”For Anna Hollinrake, founder of Electric Saint, Christmas gaming was an opportunity for sweet revenge. “As a competitive child with a guitarist father, I chose to learn the violin aged six so I could be better than him at something. However, he picked up my violin and immediately smashed out a few pieces way above my level. Years later, Christmas morning 2007, I unwrapped Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Imagine my delight as I watched my dad catastrophically miss every note onthe plastic guitar controller. Oh, how the tables turned, father. Who’s the musician now?!”View image in fullscreenRockers’ revenge … Guitar Hero III.Photograph: RedOctaneThe memories don’t always end so happily. Sam Barlow, creator ofHer StoryandImmortality, recalls when he and his brother used to wait until everyone was in bed on Christmas Eve before sneakily squeezing and shaking all their presents. “One year my brother fishes out a thick rectangular present – exactly the shape of a Super Nintendo game box. We were so excited, we got very little sleep thinking about what game it could be. Skip to the morning, he carefully peels open the wrapping, teasing out the reveal … only to discover a Ghostbusters card game. His utter disappointment was the funniest thing I’ve seen. To this day in our family, ‘Ghostbusters card game’ is used as shorthand for those occasions when life fails to meet our expectations.”But there were also times when disappointment turned to delight. Video game writer Alex Donaldson at Eurogamer recalls being desperate for a PC, but his parents couldn’t afford it so got him a Sega Mega Drive instead. “I quickly set it up and loaded the MegaGamescompilation cart,” he says. “Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi … Everything was so immediate, so visceral. This wasn’t a PC, it wasbetter. I always remember that feeling – there is a beautiful simplicity to the console.”View image in fullscreen‘So immediate, so visceral’ … Streets of Rage on the Sega Genesis Mega Drive.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamySome of us have found ways to keep treasured Christmas gaming experiences alive. I can dig out Singstar and relive festive karaoke sessions of old, while Lucy Blundell of Kinmoku Games (One Night Stand, Videoverse) has a collection of vintage consoles to call upon. “Last Christmas morning, my husband and I snuggled on the beanbags with our dog, plugged in our Japanese Sega Saturn and played Christmas NiGHTS,” she says. “Afterwards, we booted up the Nintendo 64 – the very same console I received for Christmas back in 1999 – and played my favourite Christmas games: Diddy Kong Racing’s winter levels and Super Mario 64, which I bought on Boxing Day in 1999. Spending a quiet Christmas together and sharing our favourite childhood games was a real festive treat!”Last week, I asked on BlueSky for people’s Christmas gaming memories, and what really touched me was how many recalled being given secondhand machines, with bundles of games – and being delighted. A Commodore 128, a Nintendo Wii … the thrill was in having so many new experiences to try, not just the one game that comes with a new console. Christmas for a gamer isn’t always about the flashiest, newest, most expensive things. It can be a few hours of shared fun with whatever machine you have to hand.Please do share your own memories of Christmas gaming in the comments section!Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesThe Legend of ZeldaMario KartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Based in an office above a greengrocer’s shop in Shepherd’s Bush, it housed a cradle of talent shaking up postwar television and radio comedy.Newly out of army officer training at Sandhurst, with a father who was a regimental sergeant-major and arriving wearing a herringbone suit, he found himself among a new generation sticking two fingers up at the establishment. He began by working with Johnny Speight, who went on to create the sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, and said that within months he had become more like his fellow writers.With Speight and others, he scripted The Frankie Howerd Show on BBC radio over the next year (1955-56), but his most fruitful collaboration at Associated London Scripts – whose team includedEric Sykes,Ray GaltonandAlan Simpson– came withSpike Milligan, who was enjoying success withPeter SellersandHarry Secombeon radio in The Goon Show.View image in fullscreenJohn Antrobus in 1966. He jointly wrote, with Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the 1963 comedy film The Wrong Arm of the Law.Photograph: R Powell/Getty Images“Spike took a fancy to my work and we got on well,” Antrobus recalled in a2015 radio interview. “He was very fatherly, really ... always telling me, ‘Look after your money.’ Then Spike asked me to work on The Goon Show.”Antrobus, who loved the programme’s irreverence and surreal humour, scripted two 1958 episodes with Milligan, although he said he resisted offers to do more for the Goons because his ambition was to be a playwright.This worked to his advantage when Milligan was commissioned to write a satirical play for the Tomorrow’s Audience theatre company founded by Richard Ingrams andJohn Duncan– and he needed help to meet a deadline.The Bed-Sitting Room, set in London following a nuclear attack, with survivors believing themselves to be transformed into inanimate objects, was performed as a one-act play at the Marlowe theatre, Canterbury, in 1962 before being expanded and finding a wider audience at the Mermaid theatre in London the following year. It transferred to the Duke of York’s, then the Comedy theatre (1963-64), in the West End, and in 1969 was turned into a feature film, with the screenplay by Antrobus.The writer recalled his years collaborating with Milligan – which included the star’s TV shows of the 1970s and 80s – in his book SurvivingSpike Milligan(2002).He also put words in the mouth of Sellers, jointly writing, with Galton and Simpson, the film The Wrong Arm of the Law (1963), and being called on to rewrite and invent scenes for Sellers’s final film, The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu (1980). One new sequence hadBurt Kwoukas the evil criminal’s servant bringing in a birthday cake with dozens of candles, and Kwouk’s costume catching fire.Antrobus was born in Woolwich, south-east London, to Ada (nee Hopkins) and Arthur Antrobus, who served in the Royal Horse Artillery. As the family moved around, he attended Bishop Wordsworth’s grammar school in Salisbury, and Selhurst grammar school in Croydon, before going to King Edward VII Nautical College, London, when he worked as an apprentice deck officer in the merchant navy (1950-52).This was followed by training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (1952-55) while serving in the West Surrey Regiment. The actorBill Kerrthen introduced Antrobus to Galton and Simpson, who took him on at Associated London Scripts.In 1956, when Milligan and Sellers wanted to transfer the humour of The Goon Show to television in The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d on ITV, with Richard Lester directing, Antrobus contributed material, as he did to its successors, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred, both screened the same year, and the satirical That Was the Week That Was (1962-63).On his own, he wrote the military film comedy Idol on Parade (1959) and episodes of the TV sitcoms Sykes and a … (in 1960), The Army Game (in 1960) and its spin-off, Bootsie and Snudge (in 1961).He also created and scripted the sitcom Room at the Bottom (1964), starringLionel Jeffriesas an incompetent, washed-up television light-entertainment producer andDick Emeryas his boss. Later, when it was revived (1986-88) with James Bolam andKeith Barrontaking over the parts of the producer and executive producer, Galton wrote the scripts. Antrobus also wrote a one-off comedy, An Apple a Day (1971), for Milligan,Dudley Mooreand Peter Cook.Throughout this time, he was fulfilling his ambition to write for theatre. Those plays performed at the Royal Court in London includedCaptain Oates’ Left Sock(1969, adapted two years later for BBC radio), about group therapy in a psychiatric clinic, and Crete and Sergeant Pepper (1972), set in a PoW camp following the Allied retreat in 1941. Hitler in Liverpool, at the Gate theatre, London, in 1980, imagined a supposed 1912 visit by a young Hitler to his half-brother in Britain.Galton, following the retirement of his long-time writing partner Simpson in 1978, worked with Antrobus on several stage plays. When Did You Last See Your Trousers?, first performed by Theatr Clwyd in Mold in 1986, was a switch to farce, while Steptoe & Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane, at the Theatre Royal, York, in 2005, revisited Galton and Simpson’s screen sitcom, although met withmixed reviewson reaching the Comedy theatre in London the following year.In between, Antrobus and Galton wrote the TV sitcom Get Well Soon (1997), based on Galton’s post-second world war experience of meeting Simpson in a sanatorium while suffering from tuberculosis. Antrobus’s own triumph over ill health, at the end of the 60s, was recovering from alcoholism, a result of excessive drinking with his Associated London Scripts colleagues.His CV also extended to the first and last Carry On films, writing additional material for Sergeant (1958) and Columbus (1992), and – while professing to be too shy to act – he occasionally popped up in cameo roles on screen.In 1958, Antrobus married Margaret McCormick, with whom he had three children, Nicholas, Daniel and Louise; the couple divorced in 1980. Nicholas and Louise predeceased him. He is survived by Nicole Souchal, his partner of 35 years, and Daniel.John Arthur Antrobus, writer, born 2 July 1933; died 15 December 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreTV comedyTelevisionRadioLondonSpike MilliganRadio comedyobituariesShareReuse this content"

This was the longest-running cold case to be solved in the UK, and possibly the worldAnna MooreWed 24 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareIn June 2023, Jo Smith, a major crime review officer for Avon and Somerset police, was asked by her sergeant to “take a look at the Louisa Dunne case”. Louisa Dunne was a 75-year-old woman who had been raped and murdered in herBristolhome in June 1967. She was a mother of two, a grandmother, a woman whose first husband had been a leading trade unionist, and whose home had once been a hub of political activity. By 1967, she was living alone, twice widowed but still a well-known figure in her Easton neighbourhood.There were no witnesses to her murder, and the police investigation unearthed little to go on apart from a palm print on a rear window.Policeknocked on 8,000 doors and took 19,000 palm prints, but no match was found. The case stayed unsolved.View image in fullscreen‘I was quite excited’ … Jo Smith, the officer who reopened the case.Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian“When I saw that it was dated 1967, I knew we were only going to solve this through forensics, so I went to the archive to look at the exhibits boxes,” says Smith. She found three. “I opened the first and put the lid back on again immediately. Most of our cold cases are in forensically sealed bags with barcodes and case reference numbers. These weren’t. They just had brown cardboard luggage labels saying what they were. It meant they’d never been subject to modern forensic examinations.”The rest of the day was spent with a colleague (it was his first day on the job), both gloved up, forensically bagging the items and listing what they had. And then nothing more happened for another eight months. Smith pauses and tries to be diplomatic. “I was quite excited, but it wasn’t met with a huge amount of enthusiasm. Let’s just say there was some scepticism as to the value of submitting something so old to forensics. It wasn’t seen as a priority.”It sounds like the opening chapter of a Val McDermid novel, or the first episode of a cold case TV drama, like Unforgotten. (Isn’t there always an obstructive sergeant struggling with budget and caseload?) The final outcome also seems the stuff of fiction. In June this year, a 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, was found guilty of Louisa Dunne’s rape and murder and sentenced to life.Spanning 58 years, this is believed to be the longest-running cold case solved in the UK, and possibly the world. In November, Smith and her colleagues won Investigations Team of the Yearat the National Conference for Senior Investigating Officers. The whole thing still feels extraordinary to her. “It just doesn’t feel real,” she says. “It’s forever giving me goose bumps.”For Smith, cases like this are proof that she made the correct career choice back when her father was trying to persuade her to be a primary school teacher instead. “He thought policing was too dangerous,” she says, “but what could be better than solving a 58-year-old murder?”When Jo told me about the box, it was an absolute no-brainer. Why wouldn’t we give it a go?Smith joined the police when she was 24 because, she says: “I’m nosy and I was interested in people, in helping them when they were in crisis.” Her previous six years in the force were in child protection – Smith worked on the Sophie Elms case,Britain’s youngest female paedophile, and by the time that finished in 2019, she went on maternity leave for her second child and extended it into a career break. “When you’ve got children of your own, you might not want to go back to that,” she says. The hours were also grim. “It had meant nights spent working, weekends cancelled.” When she saw the job advert for a crime review officer, she decided to apply. “It looked really interesting, it’s more of a Monday-to-Friday, nine-to-five, so here I am.”Smith’s job is a civilian role: she had to resign from the police to take it. Avon and Somerset’s major and statutory review team is a small group of police and civilians, part-time and job sharers, set up in 2008. They look at cold cases – murders, rapes, long-term missing people and unidentified bodies and body parts – and also review live cases with fresh eyes. The original team was tasked with gathering all the old case files from around the region (“crawling round attics of police stations trying to find boxes,” says Smith) and relocating them to a new central archive, a former armoury in Avon and Somerset police headquarters in Portishead. “The Louisa Dunne files had started in a local police station, then, in the years since 1967, they moved to Kingswood, then somewhere down in Weston-super-Mare before finally coming here,” says Smith.View image in fullscreenThe Dunne investigation was nicknamed ‘Operation Beatle’ in a nod to its 1967 origin.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThose boxes, their contents now forensically bagged by Smith and her colleague, returned to storage. Towards the end of 2023, a new senior investigating officer arrived to head up the team. DI Dave Marchant took a different approach to his predecessors. Once an aerospace engineer, Marchant had, as he puts it, “taken a hard left on the career path”. He’d started as a volunteer officer in his spare time (“I wanted to do something a bit fun, a bit different, and my wife had banned me from the army reserve”), then found he enjoyed policing far more than his day job. After seven years in uniform, he’d joined the CID before arriving at the crime review team. “I think I’ve now got one of the best jobs in the force,” he says. “Solving problems that are hard to solve – that’s my engineering mindset – trying to think in new ways. We’re making our own luck. When Jo told me about the box, it was an absolute no-brainer. Why wouldn’t we give it a go?”In cold case crime dramas, once items are sent off to forensics, the results come back in days or weeks. In real life, the submission process and testing take many months. “The forensic team are interested, they want to do it, but our work is always slightly on the back-burner,” says Smith. “Live-time murders, when you’ve got someone on remand, in custody or potentially still out there, have to take priority.”It was the end of August 2024, the final day of her summer holiday, when Smith received a message that forensics had a full DNA profile of the rapist from Dunne’s skirt. A few hours later, she got another message. “They had a match on the DNA database – and it was someone who was still alive!”View image in fullscreenRyland Headley, who was found guilty of Louisa Dunne’s rape and murder and sentenced to life.Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/AFP/Getty ImagesRyland Headley was 92, widowed, and living in Ipswich. “When we realised how old he was, we didn’t have the luxury of time,” says Smith. “It was all hands on deck.” In the 11 weeks between the DNA match and Headley’s arrest, the team read every single one of the 1,300 statements and 8,000 house-to-house records to see if Headley had entered the inquiry (he hadn’t). Another colleague was deep in the 1967 archives at Bristol City Hall, searching for Headley’s name, road by road. (He found a record of him living in the area on the third day of searching.)For a while, it was like living in two eras. “Just looking at all the photos, seeing an old lady’s house in 1967,” says Smith. “The witness statements. The way they describe people. Today, it would typically be: ‘He was wearing a tracksuit.’ In the statements, it’s: ‘He always wore brown trousers, a tie and a jacket.’ There are so many generational differences. Neighbours were saying: ‘I did hear a noise but the chap behind me is always beating his wife so I just thought it was that.’”Smith felt she got to know Dunne, too. “Louisa was such a big character,” she says. “Lots of people were saying that they saw her on the doorstep of 58 Britannia Road every day. She was twice widowed, estranged from her family, but she wasn’t reclusive. She had a gaggle of women who used to meet and gossip – and those were the women who realised something was very wrong when she wasn’t outside her house and they couldn’t get hold of her. She was very much part of the fabric of Easton in the 60s. In one statement, someone said: ‘I don’t think she’d have gone through that without putting up a fight.’”View image in fullscreenLouisa Dunne … ‘she was very much part of the fabric of Easton in the 60s.’Photograph: Avon and Somerset Police/PAMost of the team’s days were spent reading and summarising. (“Humongous amounts of paperwork. It wouldn’t make great TV.”) The only door they knocked on was that of Dr Norman Taylor, the GP, now 89, who had attended the scene. “We had his original statement in front of us and asked him what he could remember from that day,” says Smith. “He remembered every detail from the moment he went through the front door, as clear as if it was yesterday. He said: ‘I’ve been a doctor all my life and seen a lot of dead bodies but that’s the only one that had been murdered. That stays with you. Every time I’ve driven through that part of Bristol, I’ve thought about Louisa and the fact that whoever did this was still out there.’”Headley’s previous convictions seemed to leave little doubt of his guilt. After Dunne’s murder, he had moved with his family to Ipswich, where in 1977 he had pleaded guilty to raping two women, aged 79 and 84, again in their own homes. His victims’ harrowing statements from that earlier trial gave some idea of Louisa Dunne’s last moments. “He threatened to strangle one and he threatened to smother the other with a pillow,” says Smith. Both women fought back, trying to scratch Headley’s face; one tried to bite him but didn’t have her false teeth in. One pleaded: “Would you want someone to do this to your mother or your sister?” Though Headley was initially sentenced to life, he appealed, supported by a psychiatrist who stated that Headley was acting out of character because of sexual frustration within his marriage. “In effect, his wife wasn’t doing her wifely duties,” says Smith. “It went from a life sentence to seven years to him serving just three or four.”Smith was present at Headley’s arrest and felt no compunction knocking on the door of a slow, seemingly confused old man. “I knew what he looked like, I knew he was going to be 92, and I also knew how strong the evidence was,” she says. The team feared that the arrest would trigger a medical incident. “We were uncovering the darkest secret he’d kept hidden for 60 years,” says Smith. It was also possible that, once in custody, Headley would not be deemed fit for interview, or that once charged, he wouldn’t be fit for trial. Yet everything was able to go ahead. The trial took place in June.‘I never believed they’d be able to trace him’: granddaughter of 1967 murder victim finally sees justiceRead moreLouisa Dunne’s living relative – her granddaughter, Mary Dainton – had already been identified and approached by specialist family liaison officers. “I didn’t meet her until we were well into the court process,” says Smith. “We have a strong bond now – we went out a couple of weeks ago for tea and cake. Mary had assumed it was never going to be solved.” Dainton’s mother (Dunne’s daughter) had been estranged from Dunne when she was murdered and had never recovered from that. “For Mary, there had also been a stigma about her gran being raped and murdered. People wouldn’t talk to her.”It’s quite possible that this “stigma” could explain why no further rapes by Headley have yet emerged. “Rape is massively underreported now,” says Smith, “but in the 60s and 70s, how many elderly ladies would ever tell anyone this had happened?”Headley was told at sentencing that, for all practical purposes, he would never be released. He would die in prison.For Smith, it has been a special case. “It just feels different, I don’t know why,” she says. “In a live case, the cop who is there first does the basics, then someone else takes over, then CID, then the murder squad. You have the victim’s family, there’s lots of pressure, it’s very reactive. With this case you’re proactive, the pressure is only from yourself. It started with me trying to get someone to take some notice of my baby, that box – and I was able to see it through right until the end.”She is confident that it won’t be the last. There are about 130 cold cases in the Avon and Somerset police archives. “We’ve got so much more to do,” she says. “We have several murders that we’re reviewing – we’re constantly sending things to forensics and following other lines of inquiry. We’ll be forever opening boxes.”Explore more on these topicsCrime2025: what happened next?PoliceBristolEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What could possibly go wrong?Polly HudsonWed 24 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareWe called it “diffmas”, because it was going to be a different kind ofChristmas. Our son was five, so we were trying to package it appealingly for him. But we might have done that anyway, given the kind of year we’d had – and by “we” I don’t just mean my family, I mean the world.It was 2020. When the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, had announced, in March, that we “must stay at home”, it left my mum, who had lived on her own since my dad died in 2012, completely alone, like many people, for months on end. Her work had involved travelling all over the country, having meetings, organising events, networking. Then, in lockdown, everything stopped. She was Zooming with the best of them, but it was clearly extremely difficult.By December, the rules for our area or tier, or whatever they were calling it then, prohibited mixing unless you were in a “bubble” – but we didn’t want to risk giving my mum Covid now, after managing to keep her safe for so long. Yet the idea of letting her endure a solo Christmas was also too much to bear. So, we came up with diffmas.We would have a jolly lunch, safely sitting as far apart as was possible in our small front garden – and protect ourselves from the freezing December temperatures and potential rain by hiring a gazebo and outdoor heaters. We would wear woolly hats instead of paper crowns, and have hot-water bottles inside our coats. It would be fun, I insisted, through gritted teeth. Diffmas!In reality, it was like an episode of a particularly cheesy sitcom. The temperature was arctic, the gazebo so wobbly it kept threatening to topple over and we had to take turns holding it steady and eating with one hand. It was also quite tricky to manoeuvre cutlery in gloves. The outdoor heaters we’d hired were pathetic, failing to keep anyone warm unless they were literally sitting on them, and even then only mildly. Running with plates of food from our kitchen, at the back of our house, to the front garden, led to spills, which created a precariously slippy hallway obstacle course, and somewhere between the turkey and the Christmas pudding my husband twisted his ankle.The silver lining should have been that at least we were together, but in reality we were freezing and miserable. The unexpected bright side was that, once it was over, we were thrilled to go back inside, with walls, and a ceiling, and stay at home once more. We never took lovely warm FaceTime for granted again. And while of course I’m grateful that I got to see my mum that Christmas, particularly as so many others were separated from their loved ones, it was a huge relief when things finally returned to normal and to a boring same-old-same-old-mas, as we have never even dreamt of calling it.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This vibrant sauce is so forgiving and endlessly versatile – a last-minute showstopper that can be whipped up with a few store-cupboard ingredients and some herbs. It’s normally made with parsley, garlic, capers, anchovy fillets, olive oil and vinegar, but as long as the end result is green and saucy, I’m generally more than happy. Finely chop whatever herbs you have to hand – I used rosemary, sage, lemon verbena and nasturtiumsfrom the garden.Anything goes salsa verdeGreen sauce is a forgiving, adaptable recipe, and a great way to use an excess of herbs or leafy greens and their stalks. It’s delicious with almost any simple roast, grilled or fried fish, vegetable or meat, and elevates any meal almost effortlessly. I find that chopping the herbs by hand creates a much nicer texture than using a blender. If you do use a blender, simply pulse all the ingredients at once, but make sure you’ve chopped the herbs 10mm or smaller first.I like salsa verde better once it’s had time to sit and rest, because that gives the acid time to break down the herbs and for the flavours to amalgamate, so ideally make this sauce the day before, or first thing in the morning.100g mixed seasonal fresh herbs, leaves and soft stalks; discard any very woody stalks1 small garlic clove,peeled, or 1 tbsp finely chopped onion1 pinch coarse sea salt1 tbsp capers, finely chopped (optional)2 anchovy fillets(optional)3 tbsp stale bread(optional)1½ tbsp vinegar(white- or red-wine or cider vinegar)1 tsp mustard(optional)50-100ml extra-virgin olive oilGather all the herbs into a bunch and finely chop all the way up from stalk to leaf. Cross chop finely until everything is evenly chopped.If you’d like a thicker sauce, chop the stale bread into small cubes, toss with the vinegar or lemon juice, and leave to soak.In a mortar, pound the garlic and sea salt with the capers and anchovy fillets, if using. Once that’s all broken down into a puree, add all the chopped herbs and pound again for 30 seconds, to break them down. Pound in the stale bread, if using; if not, just add the tablespoon and a half of vinegar or lemon juice now. Stir in the mustard, if using, then finish with enough extra-virgin olive oil to give the salsa a consistency that’s to your liking.Season to taste, adjust the acidity, so, if need be, then store in a clean jar and use within a day or two.Explore more on these topicsSauces and graviesWaste notFoodFood wasteHerbs and spicesBreadItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.All these years, I’ve been getting lace wrong by wearing too much of it. Killing it with overenthusiasm. Lace is beautiful stuff: delicate and romantic. Look closely at it and you will see tiny motifs and patterns, flowers and symbols, crafted in miniature like secret messages. Lace has drama: it is the fabric of marriages, funerals and christenings, after all. And it can switch vibes: white is chaste, red is raunchy, black is sophisticated. Lace has it all going on.But here’s the thing: when you overdo it, lace loses its lustre. Too much lace is slightly exhausting to look at. Unless you are walking up the aisle, head-to-toe lace can be overbearing. And because it looks a little old-fashioned, it can add years to your vibe. Nothing wrong with looking older, obviously. But, well, perhaps worth flagging.Lace looks hot when it peeks out from underneath something else, and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out the psychology of thisBut a little bit of lace? Now you’re talking. A lace trim on a skirt. A lace camisole under a blazer. Lace tights or socks. The kind of lace that winks at you, like white fairy lights nestled in a tree. Which is much better than lace that blinds you with full-beam glamour.With restraint in mind, I have a few formulas to try. Top of my list is a lace edged skirt. Lace hits different if you place it at a less obvious place on the body. The black lace edging elevates this River Island skirt, adding drama and contrast. You won’t have to look far to partake of this outfit, because the lace-trim midi skirt is everywhere this season. My top recommendation is thedouble satin applique lace skirtfrom The White Company (£140) in chocolate with a generous froth of black at the hem. I’m keen on it because the dark colour and heavy satin make it useful, not just as a party piece, but also in the daytime, over tights and boots.View image in fullscreenDôen’s Giulietta Fleur Du Palais skirtArket have a very pretty champagne-on-champagnelace-detail satin skirt(£85), with a flattering bias cut. The best partner for a lace-trim skirt is a top half that is matte, not shiny, and loose rather than tight, but it still needs to have a bit of oomph. A fluffy sweater or an oversized blazer both work well.Lace looks hot when it peeks out from underneath something else, and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out the psychology of this. The association between lingerie and sex is deeply ingrained in visual culture, a trigger that has an undeniable force – on women and men, and even on those who think they are too sophisticated for such things. It has an effect on the wearer, as well as the observer. Just by slipping a lace-edged camisole under a V-neck sweater, you feel a little friskier. If this feels a little too blatant for your taste, you can dial down the vamp by wearing lace where it doesn’t highlight your body. Sheer lace socks between jeans and a loafer look great.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: party season is coming but all that glitters is not goldRead moreBut my top tip is to add lace sleeves as an under-layer. A couple of years ago, I bought a long-sleeved, black lace bodysuit and it’s turned out to be one of the most useful pieces in my eveningwear wardrobe. I wear it under sleeveless dresses to make them work in winter – I hate being cold, but this is also handy if you don’t love your arms – or with a black tux and jeans. I have no idea where it was from as I cut the label out ages ago because it showed through the lace, but theMila Body from John Lewis(£46) is similar.It isn’t just kids who get overexcited at this time of year. It happens to lots of us. But lace works best when it feels like a secret, so resist the urge to overshare. It can make people want to lean in a little closer, to get a better look. Think of it as sartorial flirtation. And always leave them wanting more.Model: Imogen May at Milk. Styling assistant: Charlotte Gornall.

Ten years ago, I’d have told you not to bother with toner unless you particularly enjoyed using it, which is as good a reason as any in a world on fire. And yet over the past couple of years, the new “milky toners” have, to me at least, become so functional as to be indispensable.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.These are cloudy fluids, thicker than a toner but thinner than a moisturiser, usually containing gentle, universally skin-pleasing ingredients like glycerine, ceramides and peptides.The idea is to apply straight after cleansing, to slightly damp skin, before the serum step, to increase hydration and comfort, and impart that glassy look popularised by Korean skincare (from where, it can fairly be said, milky toners first came). In practice, they do all of this and more.If your schedule and priorities won’t tolerate another skincare step, you can still feel the benefits on an ad hoc basis by opting for a mistMilky toners work very well at giving drier, wintery skins an additional opportunity to drink up, and can even be used by very oily skins in place of day cream. In either case, I recommend Rhode’s wildly popularGlazing Milk, from £20, a milky toner that I was almost determined not to like but is probably my most used.As well as providing instant comfort, ungreasy moisture and an aesthetically pleasing dewiness to my makeup, it has the bonus benefit of being the perfect mixing medium for tanning drops (trust me – I’ve now converted several beauty editors to this method) and to sheer-out heavy foundation.Sali Hughes on beauty: introducing my hero skincare products of 2025Read moreFor nighttime, I step things up a gear to indulge my skin barrier function and buffer my somewhat feisty prescription retinoid.

It’s a clear, cold night, and the inn couldn’t look more welcoming: a cosy glow from within the historic building, the Cowal hills beyond. The Christmas lights are twinkling, the glasses are charged and there’s a palpable sense of goodwill, cheer, and plenty of pride in the air. By 6pm, it’s buzzing. Locals are already propping up the bar as a stylish woman sweeps in and bags the last table. She is Debbie Rycroft, a local haberdasher. “A pint in my own local,” she smiles happily, relishing a toast with her husband and equally dapper 19-year-old son.First-night hiccups are limited to a wonky nozzle and a brief worry about a small radiator leak. “How many people to fix a heater?” quips someone as a line of concerned faces survey the scene. Almost immediately, a punter walks in with a radiator key. All sorted. Someone orders a Guinness; the bartender pulls it off. A two-part pour, pitchblack perfection with a balanced, creamy top. Good things come to those who wait? Well, this one’s been three years in the making.The Oakbank, a landmark building at the heart of Sandbank for the last 160 years, closed at the end of 2022, like so many businesses that struggled in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Next came the closure of the nearby Holy Loch inn. The village was left without a pub – a huge loss for a rural community.Ian MacNaughton remembers sneaking into the pub for a pint, aged 16. These days he’s retired and learning about compliance lawsA group of locals got together in early 2023, formed a committee, chaired by Sue McKillop, and began the long slog to buy the Oakbank. “It’s been an uphill struggle,” says Ian MacNaughton, another founding committee member. “I just didn’t think the hill would be so steep!” Now retired, MacNaughton remembers sneaking into the Oakbank for a pint, aged 16. These days he’s learning about compliance laws. “We must do everything right.”View image in fullscreenThe Oakbank’s opening night.Photograph: Sue McKillopAfter an initial rejection, their persistence finally paid off last December with the award of a Scottish Land grant just shy of £150,000, covering most of the purchase price. In January, McKillop advertised shares, raising more than £23,000 and an “inspiring amount of enthusiasm” from locals. By April this year, they had the keys. It’s been nonstop ever since up until opening night last Saturday, she says.While the shares didn’t reach the £90,000 target, people have contributed “thousands of volunteer hours” to get the place ready, Dawn Petherick tells me. They shifted and updated the bar, now an airy sky blue, while the old wood burner’s still there but “needing work”. Another one for the list. And Petherick’s list is long. She is Oakbank’s development officer, a fixed-term post funded by the initial grant, and, like everyone else involved, she’s been busy all year.View image in fullscreenThe view outside the Oakbank.Photograph: Susan SmillieThe Oakbank has been running pop-ups, workshops and charity mornings during the refurbishment. More events are being added all the time. “Whatever the community wants – knitting groups, book clubs, exhibitions, ‘sober nights’ – it should be a hub more than a pub,” says Petherick. “Somewhere to alleviate social isolation.”And that is needed more than ever. Yet another local pub, the Strone Inn across the bay, is set to close at the end of the year. Like many local business owners, Stephen Mitchell is supportive of the Oakbank project. “Fair play to them,” he says. “It’s taken them three years, so it’s a real result.” But, he warns, “the hard work starts now as things are really tough”.The best thing about the Oakbank is at the back of the bar – big glass doors offer views across the Holy LochMcKillop agrees. “It’s exciting but a wee bit scary,” she says. “We are under no illusions as to the challenges that lie ahead. Like any pub venue, we will need to keep innovating in order to survive.” But she can take comfort from recent figures; community pubs are doing well. According to the charity Plunkett UK, community-owned businesses are “highly resilient”, with a five-year survival rate of 98%.“We’re delighted that the Oakbank Community Inn is opening under community ownership,” says James Alcock, Plunkett UK’s chief executive. “We see time and again how saving local assets like village pubs protects vital services and social spaces, helping to reduce isolation and strengthen communities.”View image in fullscreenThe Oakbank at night.Photograph: Susan SmillieFuture plans include refurbishing accommodation upstairs, a studio/gallery space in the adjoining cottage and renovating the commercial kitchen. In a nice piece of alchemy, the pub sits opposite Sandbank’s community-owned garden, so its polytunnels and raised beds will be nurturing hyper-local vegetables destined for that kitchen.But the best thing about the Oakbank is the bit you see last. At the back of the bar, big glass doors offer views across the Holy Loch. It’s inaccessible now, but outside the doors, a grassy verge leads to the Holy Loch marina below. It has its own regulars hauling out on the slipway – giant Atlantic grey seals. With neighbours like that, you can see why McKillop has ambitious plans. “We’re going to rebuild the rotten deck and make a bridge to connect to the marina,” she says.That should please boat-owners Tony, Rob and Alan, enjoying a pint beside the bar. “Sailors don’t like going places where you can’t go to a pub,” says Rob. “And Sandbank’s had absolutely nothing to offer.”“Hang on,” offers Tony. “It’s got a lot of history.”But Rob’s having none of it. “You can’t drink a pint of history.”Explore more on these topicsTravelPubsScotland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But after that night, I formed a double act with a friend, writing jokes and making a radio show, before heading off to Australia …Rich PelleyWed 24 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareAlthough I loved my time at Nottingham University, I didn’t go there with much intention of doing anything with my degree in chemistry afterwards. Not only was it full-on, I wasn’t particularly good at it. In an experiment to examine the incubation of goat’s blood, I accidentally added 10 times too much hydrogen peroxide. Blood shot out of the flask and splattered all over my face like a scene from The Sopranos. I can still hear my professor’s screams.But that’s OK, because I hadn’t really gone to university to win the Nobel prize, I’d gone to experience the culture of the mid 90s. British dance music – through acts such as Orbital, Leftfield, Underworld, Faithless and the Chemical Brothers – was exploding. Britpop was happening around me: (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory was released the week I went to uni. My entry to this smorgasbord of cool happened when, in our second year,Ant and Decannounced a live show up in town.No longer known as their aliases PJ and Duncan from Byker Grove, the pair had started presenting CBBC’s The Ant & Dec Show, which featured “Beat The Barber”, in which they’d shave kids’ heads if they lost a multiple choice pop quiz. We assumed the live show would be comedy, and full of ironic students, maybe because around the same time we went to see Robbie Williams on his first ever solo tour – where he played Let Me Entertain You, Angels and a thrash version of Back for Good – and itwasfull of ironic students. However, Ant and Dec hadn’t really moved away from their pre-pubescent audience. The theatre was full of teenage girls who kept pinching us on the bottom and we were the only people at the bar because everyone else was under age.After drinking too much beer, we managed to work out which hotel Ant and Dec were staying at and somehow charmed our way into their hotel rooms, chatting away to the pair for hours while helping ourselves to their aftershow beers.Our radio highlight was when we forgot to press the ‘broadcast’ button, and sent two hours of silence over the airwavesIt was in those bleary early hours that suddenly a new career path opened up. Why become a boring chemist who spent the day boiling, titrating, stirring, filtering, distilling, crystallising, diluting, synthesising and pH testing, when I could forge a career out of goofing? I now knew that I wanted to become Ant instead. And, luckily, there was a Dec to this plan – my mate Phil, who was sitting right next to me. It might sound like the kind of drunken plan that wouldn’t stand up in the light of day, but from then on we (ultimately unsuccessfully) started a double act.We wrote together for our student magazine, Impact, under a single pen name – Phil and Rich. We bought cheap decks, gave each other DJ names (him: Flashmaster Chops; me: Flexmaster Groove) and attempted to DJ by mixing the Flash Gordon soundtrack by Queen into Children by Robert Miles, then playing Born Slippy .NUXX by Underworld on repeat. We reinvented ourselves as “comedy” radio DJs and presented Phil and Rich’s Potato Mash on University Radio Nottingham, with rubbish games such as “Feel the Food” (don’t ask) and “Name That Twang” (ditto). The highlight was when we forgot to press the “broadcast” button, and sent two hours of silence over the airwaves.We even managed to – vaguely – keep our dreams alive after uni. We sent our radio demo tape off to everyone we could think of. The Radio 1 controller told us to “keep up the good work”, but didn’t offer us the Breakfast Show on the spot, like we’d hoped. We later lived in Australia, where we started our own website – philandrich.com – full of comedy, jokes and banter, mainly stolen from A Bit of Fry & Laurie. Then … the dream of being a joint brand fizzled out, although we’ve both managed to work in creative industries: I fell into journalism and Phil does something I don’t understand at the BBC. But there’s always a chance that Ant and Dec will take early retirement, ITV will advertise for a new double act, and we’ll be the obvious shoo-in.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMy big night outComedyAnt and DecfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We all discovered this during the first outbreak of Covid, when people temporarily lost their sense of smell.”Have a laughWith crackers a staple of Christmas, Sophie Scott, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London suggests experimenting to see what can influence whether or not people laugh at a (terrible) joke.“First, try reading those jokes to yourself and see if you laugh at any of them,” she says. “Second, read the jokes to someone else – maybe a room full of people.”Scott says to look and see if anyone laughs – including you – when you get to the punchline, or if they respond in some other way such as groaning. She notes that although we associate laughter with jokes and humour, we laugh mainly for social reasons.“You are 30 times more likely to laugh if there is someone else with you than if you are on your own,” she says. “What this means for cracker jokes is that a joke read by someone alone is much less likely to make them laugh than the same joke read – or heard – in company. And laughter is amplified by social connection, so the more you know and like the people that you are with, the more laughter there will be.”Get stuck into the festive fowlView image in fullscreenLook at the bones and understand how they fit together and move.Photograph: Jonathan Knowles/Getty ImagesIf you are having a turkey or another bird for your Christmas meal then take time to explore the carcass.“We did a Thanksgiving dinner a few weeks ago and I got an enormous turkey, cooked the thing for a few hours, basted it lovingly every 30 minutes or so,” says Steve Brusatte, a professor of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh. “Mostly so it would be delicious, but also so the meat would fall off the bone well enough that I could remove the bones and show my wife and my six-year-old boy the shoulder area.”That allowed Brusatte to demonstrate how the various bones fit together to move the wing up and down, and how the huge springy wishbone stores energy as the wings beat.“This is a simple thing that you can do with a roast turkey or chicken – actually look at the bones and understand how they fit together and move, and that gives a better understanding of biomechanics and flight motions than I’ve ever seen in any textbook during my many years of study,” he says. “And then you get a delicious meal afterwards.”Prof Sue Black, a forensic anthropologist, anatomist and academic at the University of Oxford, also recommends dissecting the festive bird to understand the anatomy of motion.“Boil the carcass so that only the bones are left and you have a 3D jigsaw to reconstruct,” she says.Chemistry of ChristmasSalt is commonly spread on pavements in the winter and there is a simple experiment that can help to explain why.“You will need 500ml of full-fat milk or cream, five egg yolks and 125g of sugar. A bit of vanilla never goes amiss,” says Andrea Sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at UCL.“Whisk them together and then warm almost to the boil until the mixture starts to thicken. Let it cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, get some ice from the freezer. Either bash it, like an alchemist, with a mortar and pestle, or grind it up in a blender like a modernist.”Next, he says, take two plastic bags – ideally zippable ones. “Drop some of your crushed ice into one and add generous amount of salt. Into the second, spoon some of your custard mixture, adding sprinkles, nuts or bits of fruit. Seal the [second bag] and put it into the first.“Now mash the ice and salt together, and the custard in the bag. The temperature will plunge, to -10C or even lower. In seconds you’ll have ice-cream, a soft (and delicious) solid.”Sella says this happens because the dissolved salt prevents liquid water molecules, produced as the ice melts, from freezing back on to the remaining ice.“So the ice keeps melting and steals heat from the custard (and your fingers),” he says. “It’s practical magic – also known as science.”Festive pi(e)View image in fullscreenPi seems to crop up in really unusual places.Photograph: Anastassiya Bezhekeneva/Getty Images“One of the most surprising little science experiments you can do at home is called Buffon’s Needle, but for festive purposes let’s call it Buffon’s Pine Needles. It’s a way of approximating the value of ϖ,” says Kit Yates, a professor of mathematical biology and public engagement at the University of Bath.First off, grab a bunch of pine needles and select as many as you can that are roughly the same length (L).“Let’s say you manage to find a total (T)of similar-sized pine needles. You’re going to also need a piece of paper that has lines ruled on it which are a distanceWapart – further apart than the length of your needles,” Yates says.Scatter the pine needles, without aiming, on top of your piece of ruled paper and then count the number of needles that cross one of the lines. This number isC.Once you have counted, you can find your approximation of ϖ by plugging your numbers into this formula: ϖ ≈ 2LT/CW“What I love about this is that it demonstrates how ϖ seems to crop up in really unusual places,” Yates says. “It feels almost like magic, but it’s just probability in action on your living room floor.”Explore more on these topicsScienceChristmas food and drinkChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, “its political and symbolic significance is important: it marks a rupture in the relationship with France in terms of memory,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAlgeriaFranceAfricaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision was criticised by defeated candidates andlamented by the Organization of American States, which sent an observation mission to the election held on 30 November but whose vote counthad remained unresolved since then.Asfura has already declared himself president-elect. “Honduras, we now have the official declaration from the CNE [electoral council]. I recognise the great work carried out by the councillors and the entire team that ran the election. Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down. God bless Honduras,” hewrote.Nasralla refused to concede andposted a series of statementsalleging fraud in the counting process, including “forgery of public documents”, claiming that “the data from the original tally sheets were altered”.Nasralla urged his supporters to remain calm and refrain from any acts of disruption or violence, adding this was “the saddest Christmas for the Honduran people.”The head of the Honduran Congress also rejected the results. “This is completely outside the law. It has no value,” Congress president Luis Redondo, of the ruling Libre party, wrote on X.The electoral council is made up of three councillors: one aligned with Asfura’s party, one with Nasralla’s, and one with the party of the leftist president, Xiomara Castro, whose candidate finished third. Asfura’s victory was declared only by the first two councillors.The representative linked to the president’s party refused to recognise the result, alleged that an “electoral coup” was under way and filed a complaint with the public prosecutor’s office, raising the prospect that the outcome will be challenged in court.In its statement, the council said: “By the majority will of the Honduran people, expressed sovereignly at the ballot box, the full council of the CNE declares Nasry Juan Asfura Zablah constitutional president of the Republic ofHondurasfor the four-year term beginning on 27 January 2026 and ending on 27 January 2030.”The declaration before the end of the recount was the latest in a string of controversies that marked the Central American country’s presidential race, starting with what many saw as open interference by the US president.Days before the vote, Trump publicly backed Asfura, said the US would support the next government only if he won, and attacked the other leading candidates, calling them communists or allies of Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro.On the eve of the election, the US president alsoannounced a pardonfor the former Honduran president and Asfura ally Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,congratulated Asfura on social media. “The people of Honduras have spoken: Nasry Asfura is Honduras’ next president,” said Rubio. “The United States congratulates president-elect Asfura and looks forward to working with his administration to advance prosperity and security in our hemisphere.”Explore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In the video, Xu said he refused because he did not want to become “a sinner in history”.The video “confirms the legend about Xu Qinxian”, said Zhou Fengsuo, a leader of the Tiananmen demonstrations who now lives in exile in the US. “This is the first time that we have a clear first-person view of this period,” he added.The source of the video is unknown. It was first posted online last month and hasmore than 1.2m viewson one YouTube account alone. Wu Renhua, a historian of the Tiananmen movement who took part in the protests, was one of the first people to share it online. He said it was provided to him on one condition: that he keep his source secret.Wu said the video was “perhaps the most important piece of data that I have gathered in my three decades of research”. He believes it is genuine as many of the details are corroborated by his separate research.The demonstrations that gripped Beijing for weeks in the spring of 1989 ended with a bloody massacre in the early hours of 4 June, when PLA troops opened fire on civilians around Tiananmen Square, the 21.1 hectare (53 acre) central plaza of China’s capital. Hundreds, potentially thousands, of people were killed and the event remains one of the most sensitive in the Chinese Communist party’s rule overChina. Discussion of the massacre is censored and there has never been any open or official reckoning with the events or the aftermath.View image in fullscreenPeople in the student-led demonstrations in Beijing in May 1989.Photograph: Chip Hires/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesAt the time, there were widespread rumours about dissent within the military. Zhou said many uniformed soldiers came toTiananmen Squarebefore 4 June to show their support for the protesters.When the demonstrations started, Xu, who came from a working-class family of fruit and vegetable vendors, was in hospital recovering from kidney stones.But on 18 May, he received orders to deploy his 15,000 troops to Beijing and impose martial law. In the video of his court martial, Xu explained his reservations. In a gruff, plain-spoken accent he said: “I said I had a different opinion on this matter. I said this was a mass political incident, and it should primarily be resolved through political means.”He ultimately refused to carry out the order, although he did pass on the message. He said he told his superiors that if martial law was a failure, the commander who imposed it “might become a sinner in history”.Joseph Torigian, an associate professor at American University and a historian of Chineseelite politics, said that the video showed the extent to which senior figures in China “exist in fundamentally ambiguous political environments”.Xu’s testimony shows him grappling with what it means to be a loyal military general in a CCP-ruled system. He said he “worried about the potential for large-scale conflict or bloodshed”.Tiananmen Square: China steps up curbs on activists for 30th anniversaryRead moreHe said that, even if he had made a mistake, “whether a person is loyal to the party should be judged by their implementation of the party’s ideological and political line”, and that Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping had spoken about the importance of the party hearing differing opinions. Xu “seems to be struggling with himself about when exactly the right answer was”, Torigian said.Tiananmen experts say one of the most important aspects of Xu’s testimony was that he questioned whether the decision to impose martial law could come from the Central Military Commission, which gave him the order. He said that such a serious matter should be discussed by China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress.In the years since the massacre, the CCP has tightened its grip on the PLA and made it clear that the army serves the party, not any other authority. Torigian said: “The party knows and understands that its last line of defence for regime security and survival is the PLA.”Loyalty in the PLA remains a preoccupation for the CCP. In recent months, Xi Jinping, China’s leader and commander-in-chief of the military, haspurged several senior military leadersfor alleged corruption violations.Xu was expelled from the CCP and sentenced to five years in prison. He lived the rest of his life exiled from Beijing and died in 2021 at the age of 85.Additional research byJason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTiananmen Square protests 1989ChinaCommunismHistoryAsia PacificProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

They are a far cry from the challenging downwind conditions that saw two lives lost in the first night of racing in storms in 2024.Wednesday’s briefing began with a minute’s silence for the sailors who died aboard separate yachts last year, Nick Smith and Roy Quaden.Race organisers the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia also announced a group of 15 yachts will scatter rose petals off the coast of Bondi beach in memory of the 15 lives lost during the Bondi terror attack, when they pass the site.Line honours favourite Master Lock Comanche is co-captained by two eastern suburbs residents who were shocked when they heard news of the attack on Sydney’s Jewish community two Sundays ago.“Everyone was very worried,” said co-captain Matt Allen. “We went down with a large group of Jewish and non-Jewish Olympians last Friday and had a service there, and then a brunch to really show our support for the victims, the entire community.”In the west, Tropical Cyclone Grant was passing close to the Cocos Islands, 2,750km north-west of Perth, on Thursday. The category 1 cyclone was expected to bring heavy rain, storms and strong winds as it moved westwards.Perth was forecast to reach 40C on Thursday with an extreme fire danger warning in place for much of south-west Western Australia for Christmas. Awatch and act warningwas in place near Boddington in the Peel region south-west of Perth on Thursday morning.Bradbury said the heat would begin to ease on Friday. “Today is the last day of the intense heat for now for the west coast,” she said.A flood watch was in place for much of northern Australia on Thursday. Brisbane was facing a hot, dry start, with showers and possible storms and a high of 33C. Darwin had forecast rainfall of up to 50mm with thunderstorms and showers likely.Melbourne was forecast to have its coldest Christmas Day since 2006, with a high of 17C and showers possible in the morning and afternoon, while Hobart was also cool, with a high of 15C, and the chance of hail.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherSydney to Hobart yacht racenewsShareReuse this content"

Words have potential to lead to catastrophic outcomes … anyone that says anything remotely intimidatory, suggestive of violence, needs to be acted on very quickly.”The state’s acting premier, Rita Saffioti, and its police chief, Col Blanch, have commended the member of the public who spoke to police after coming across the alleged post online that led to Glynn’s arrest.“The report from the member of the public was critical and demonstrates just how important it is that the community in WA is kept safe but also the community in WA engage in this process,” Whitby said.In a statement posted to X on Wednesday afternoon, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he had been briefed on the arrest by Saffioti and the Australian federal police (AFP) commissioner, Krissy Barrett. He thanked police for “quickly identifying this individual and acting quickly”.“There is no place in Australia for antisemitism, hate and violent ideologies.”Police said Glynn had a gun licence for hunting, and all but one of his firearms were registered, but Blanch has instructed his officers to initiate a process to cancel Glynn’s permit.The accused is being investigated by officers linked to Operation Dalewood, which was launched by WA police in response to the Bondi attack.He was not known to WA, New South Wales or federal authorities before his arrest and there is no evidence to suggest any attacks are being planned, Blanch said.“We don’t think there is an ongoing threat,” he said. “We don’t believe there to be a network involved. We think this is an individual who has made these comments online.”Whitby reiterated WA’s tough penalties for hate-related crimes, including up to five years’ imprisonment for displaying Nazi symbols or performing Nazi salutes and up to 14 years for conduct intended to incite racial hatred.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackWestern AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

He is an orthopaedic surgeon but is not involved in his treatment.0:47Alleged gunman tackled during Bondi beach shooting – videoAhmed would probably soon be able to be discharged as he continued to improve, Kahil said.“He looks happier … He’s a humble person and he’s a shy person as well,” Kahil said.Ahmed, a tobacco shop owner from Sydney’s south, had been getting coffee with his cousin in Bondi when Sajid Akram and his son, Naveed, allegedly opened fire, killing 15.Mobile phone footage shows Ahmed creeping towards Sajid Akram behind cars before tackling him, pulling the rifle from his hands and pointing it at him, then laying the weapon against a tree. Subsequent gunshots left five bullets in Ahmed’s left arm and shoulder.The media director for the Australians for Syria Association, Lubaba Alhmidi AlKahil, said Ahmed’s left arm was not expected to regain normal function for at least six months due to his injured nerves.He was not likely to soon reopen his Sutherland shop, where hundreds of people have left notes and flowers paying tribute. Instead, he would rest and recover and spend time with family, AlKahil said.“He needs to get rest, he needs to spend time with his family, he has been away from his wife and daughters for a long time,” she said.Family members have watched over Ahmed as he has recovered and been visited by well-wishers and dignitaries.“He said that a lot of people from the government, from different backgrounds, different religions, different ethnicities, visited him and congratulated him,” AlKahil said.“He’s very happy, he feels very peaceful.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Fateh al-Ahmed, the father of Bondi shooting hero Ahmed Al-Ahmed, attends the vigil for victims and survivors of the Bondi massacre.Photograph: Dean Lewins/EPAVisitors have included the prime minister, the NSW premier, the Australian governor general, passing on personal thanks from King Charles and more recently David Ossip, the president of NSW’s Jewish Board of Deputies.Ossip praised Ahmed’s “unbelievable bravery” at Sunday’s vigil for the victims of the terror attack, attended by his father, Mohamed Fateh al-Ahmed, who embraced members of the Jewish community and received a standing ovation.He and his wife, Malakeh Hasan al-Ahmed, have been visiting from Syria for the past three months and Ahmed’s former migration lawyer, Sam Issa, had called for them to be granted Australian citizenship so they did not have to return. The government was yet to accept that suggestion, Issa said on Tuesday.1:58Bondi hero Ahmed al-Ahmed presented with $2.5m cheque in hospital – videoThe prime minister on Wednesday announced a new honours list for heroes of Bondi and AlKahil said she expected Ahmed’s efforts to be recognised.Australians and sympathisers worldwide donated $2.5m to the shopkeeper via GoFundMe to support his recovery.Presented with the novelty cheque, Ahmed asked: “I deserve it?”AlKahil said the fame and recognition along with the injuries would change Ahmed’s life.“Now he is a very famous person,” she said. “He has a fortune. He needs to think a lot about what is next step in his life while they surround him with all love and care they can.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackNew South WalesSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Does it have a leg to stand on?Read more“We are concerned that, despite many warnings, some retailers are still using a range of tactics to misrepresent the size or scope of discounts and the duration of sales to consumers,” she said.The regulator wrote to “a number” of major retailers after the initial findings of a Black Friday sweep of retailers indicated some were still using a range of potentially misleading strategies, such as fake countdown timers.The household goods and fashion sectors are expected to dominate on Boxing Day with forecast sales of $476m and $216m respectively, while department stores should receive a boost with sales on the day expected to be worth $123m, up 5.1% from 2024.The comparison website Finder was even more bullish, forecasting that one in three Australians would shop the Boxing Days sales and spend $3.1bn overall, based on a survey of 1,005 people.The chief executive of the ARA, Chris Rodwell, attributed the forecast growth in sales to the “resilience” of the retail sector as well as the “enduring appeal of Boxing Day as a premier discount event”.Even though the ARA is expecting strong Boxing Day sales, overall consumer confidence in Australia is not high and experts warn it could take a further hit if the Reserve Bank lifts interest rates again.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence rating dropped two points to 81.5 in the week of 9-15 December, 2.4 points lower than the year before and 2.8 points below the 2025 weekly average of 86.3.The rating calculates the difference between the percentage of respondents who give favourable answers and those who give unfavourable answers to five key questions about the economy and spending.Sophia Angala, an economist at ANZ, said the rating ended 2025 six points lower than at the start of the year, with the drop potentially due to the risk of an interest rate rise as well as soft labour market figures.Prof Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said having interest rate reductions on hold for the past three months and the potential of an increase in the new year would continue to stifle confidence.But he said there was “an element of tradition” about shopping in the Boxing Day sales which meant they remained popular even if overall consumer sentiment was down.The chief economist at KPMG, Brendan Rynne, said uncertainty about the economy meant people were limiting their discretionary spending to when big sales were on.“[It] doesn’t mean people aren’t spending money, they’re just being more cautious about how they’re spending money,” he said.“It’s not surprising the ARA think there will be a healthy sales period but it comes at a cost of more moderate growth and outcomes during the year.”While consumer confidence is relatively low, household spending increased 1.3% in the month to October and 5.6% compared with to October 2024, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.But Rynne said high employment and higher prices due to inflation meant there could be an increase in household spending even with subdued consumer sentiment.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsAustralian lifestyleBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

To refuse one is to refuse the other,” said the pope during the solemn service, attended by about 6,000 people inside the basilica.Leo, the first US-born pope, is celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world’s cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis. The pope,who has criticised Donald Trump’s divisive immigration crackdown, quoted a line from Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the world does not care for children, the poor or foreigners.“While a distorted economy leads us to treat human beings as mere merchandise, God becomes like us, revealing the infinite dignity of every person,” said Leo. “Where there is room for the human person, there is room for God. Even a stable can become more sacred than a temple.“Outside the basilica, about 5,000 people watched the service on screens from St Peter’s Square, holding umbrellas and wearing ponchos under a hard rain in Rome.Leo, 70, came outside to greet them before the start of the mass. “I admire and respect and thank you for your courage and your wanting to be here this evening, even in this weather.”On Thursday, the pope will celebrate a Christmas Day mass and deliver a twice-yearlyUrbi et Orbi(to the city and the world) message and blessing.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyVaticanCatholicismChristianityReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Images broadcast on Russian television showed an area cordoned off and a large police presence. Witnesses described an explosion that occurred at about 1.30am local time.Russian Telegram channels close to the security services said the third person who died was believed to have been planting the explosive device.An anonymous official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as the GUR, told the Associated Press the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation.The blast occurred less than half a mile from where a senior Russian military officer, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed this week when a bomb exploded under his car.

Zelenskyy said he expected US negotiators to be in contact with the Kremlin on Wednesday.Ukraine’s best hope may lie elsewhere as Russia inches forward on the battlefieldRead moreIn the latest version of the peace plan, Ukraine accepts the principle of a demilitarised zone in its eastern regions, control of which has long been a stumbling block, with the insistence thatRussiamake a similar pullback of forces.Details of the proposal have been sent to the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, by his envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, and a Kremlin spokesperson said Moscow was formulating its response and would not immediately comment publicly.The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Dmitriev had briefed Putin on his recent trip to Miami for talks with Trump’s envoys. Peskov refused to be drawn on Russia’s reaction to the proposals, or the exact format of the documents, saying the Kremlin was not going to communicate via the media.“All the main parameters of the Russian position are well known to our colleagues from the United States,” Peskov told reporters.Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede about 5,000 sq km of Donbas, which it still controls, and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join Nato’s military alliance.Ukraine mapIn the continuing complex choreography of negotiations, however, Ukraine will agree to several uncomfortable concessions. That includes a pullback of some Ukrainian troops from the area it controls on the eastern frontline, and giving up on its long-vaunted ambition for Nato membership in exchange for US-European security guarantees mirroring Nato’s article 5 provision. It remained unclear, in public at least, what those security guarantees would look like.The latest plan also calls for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, with international troops to be stationed along the contact line to monitor implementation.Zelenskyy presented the plan during a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading from a highlighted and annotated version. He suggested the proposals put Ukraine in a stronger position, with Moscow facing the risk that the US will supply Kyiv with substantially increased arms and escalating sanctions if Putin rejects the plan.‘Warning to others’: murky death of militia leader as Kremlin reasserts controlRead moreZelenskyy told reporters: “[Moscow] cannot tell President Trump: ‘Look, we are against a peaceful settlement. That is, if they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.“In the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the line of troop deployment as of the date of this agreement is de facto recognised as the line of contact,” Zelenskyy said of the latest draft.“A working group will convene to determine the redeployment of forces necessary to end the conflict, as well as to define the parameters of potential future special economic zones,” he added.This appears to suggest the plan opens the way for – but delays options that Ukraine was previously reluctant to consider – a withdrawal of troops and the creation of demilitarised zones.“We are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from the Donetsk region, while the Americans are trying to find a way,” Zelenskyy said. “They are looking for a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides.”View image in fullscreenPeople take cover in a metro station during a Russian drone attack in Kyiv on 23 December.Photograph: Dan Bashakov/APAny plan that involves Ukraine pulling back its troops would need to pass a referendum in Ukraine, Zelenskyy added. “A free economic zone. If we are discussing this, then we need to go to a referendum,” Zelensky said, referring to plans to designate areas that Ukraine pulls out from as a demilitarised free-trade zone.On Nato, Zelensky said: “It is the choice of Nato members whether to have Ukraine or not. Our choice has been made. We moved away from the proposed changes to the constitution of Ukraine that would have prohibited Ukraine from joining Nato.”Russia, however, has long insisted on full control of Donetsk and it remains highly uncertain that it would accept either a suggested demilitarised buffer zone or a withdrawal of its forces, even as other sticking points remain, including control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that Kyiv says should be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine.Zelenskyy’s press conference was held after Donald Trump’s repeated efforts to try to broker an end to the four-year war, triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion.Tens of thousands have been killed, eastern Ukraine decimated and millions forced to flee their homes. Russian troops are advancing on the front andhammering citiesand Ukraine’s energy grid with nightly missile and drone barrages. The Russian defence ministry on Wednesday said it had captured another Ukrainian settlement in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.In 2022, Moscow claimed to have annexed four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia – in addition to the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinNatonewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.”Germany, Spain, the UK and a chorus of EU officials joined the French president in condemning the move, with Brussels signalling it could “respond swiftly and decisively” against the “unjustified measures”.The DSA is seen by Washington as a form of censorship while European leaders say the regulations are necessary to control hate speech, but the row threatens to become part of a far wider existing cultural and political conflict between Donald Trump’s administration andEurope. Artificial intelligence and digital technologies were always likely to become a major theatre of confrontation between the US and Europe, as these technologies become ever more central to wielding power.Macron condemned the visa ban in furious terms. “These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he wrote, also on X. “The European Union’s digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council. They apply within Europe to ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country, and to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. The rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe”.He later added he had spoken to Breton, who is French, and had thanked him for his work. “We will not give up, and we will protect Europe’s independence and the freedom of Europeans,” Macron said.The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “The peoples of Europe are free and sovereign and cannot let the rules governing their digital space be imposed by others upon them.”Breton, a former French finance minister and the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019 to 2024, said: “Is McCarthy’s witch-hunt back?“As a reminder: 90% of the European parliament – our democratically elected body – and all 27 member states unanimously voted the DSA. To our American friends: censorship isn’t where you think it is.”The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy. We are proud of it. We will protect it.” A commission spokesperson added: “If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures.”In the UK, the government said it was “fully committed” to upholding free speech.The EU law, passed in 2022, requires large digital platforms to show they are taking steps to address online risks, including the spread of illegal content, hate speech and the use of disinformation to manipulate election results.After two years of investigation, Elon Musk’s X platform was this month fined €120m (£104m) over a series of transgressions mainly relating to transparency, including deceiving users about verification checks, and researcher’s access.Washington said the EU was pursuing “undue” restrictions on freedom of expression and the DSA’s s extraterritorial restrictions were designed to weaken US tech firms and US citizens.Breton was replaced in the internal market role at the EU by another French politician, Stéphane Séjourné, who is the Commission’s executive vice-president. Séjourné expressed his support for his predecessor saying: “No sanction will silence the sovereignty of the European peoples. Total solidarity with him and all the people of Europe affected by this”.Outlining the bans on Tuesday, US under secretary for public diplomacy, Sarah Rogers, classified Breton as a “mastermind” of the DSA.Germany’s justice ministry said the two German campaigners had the government’s “support and solidarity” and the visa bans were unacceptable, adding that HateAid supported people affected by unlawful digital hate speech. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, echoed the remarks on X: “The DSA was democratically adopted by the EU for the EU – it does not have extraterritorial effect.Spain’s foreign ministry also condemned the US measures, saying in a statement: “A safe digital space, free from illegal content and disinformation, is a fundamental value for democracy in Europe and a responsibility for everyone.“Anyone who describes this as censorship is misrepresenting our constitutional system. The rules by which we want to live in the digital space in Germany and in Europe are not decided in Washington.”Dennis Radtke, an MEP and member of the German ruling CDU, said: “The Trump fans in Europe defend this as a fight for freedom of speech. Where exactly has an opinion been suppressed? Where is the fight for freedom of speech with regard to China and Russia? It’s only about business here and the fight against the rule of law.”Raphaël Glucksmann, a French socialist MEP, said in a message to Rubio: “For far too long, Europe has been weak in implementing its own laws and defending its own interests. You have chosen to cosy up tyrants and confront democracies. The time has come for us to stand up. Kneel as much as you want in front of Putin, we are the free world now.“We are not a colony of the United States. We are Europeans, we must defend our laws, our principles, our interests. This scandalous sanction against Thierry Breton pays tribute to his fight for our sovereignty. We will continue it together. To the end.”The row is the latest to showcase tensions between the US and Europe. In August, Washington imposed sanctions on the French judge Nicolas Yann Guillou, who sits on the international criminal court, for the tribunal’s targeting of Israeli leaders and a past decision to investigate US officials.Michel Duclos, a former senior French diplomat and resident senior fellow in geopolitics and diplomacy at the Institut Montaigne thinktank lamented the move, referencing Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev’s recent trip to Miami for talks on the Ukraine war. He said: “Dmitriev celebrated in Miami, Breton denied US visa: Europe is becoming the new Russia for Washington. It brings to mind the 1920s – America favouring the former enemy [Germany) against its former allies – but worse.”The chair of the German Journalists’ Association, Mika Beuster, expressed, solidarity with the Berlin-based HateAid. “This is censorship in its purest form, the likes of which we have previously only known from autocratic regimes,” said Beuster.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Dressed in dark winter jackets, the mourners on Monday filled one of Russia’s most sacred spaces – a church usually reserved for moments of state ritual and national commemoration. Later, near his grave, the crowd lit bright flares and shouted: “One for all, and all for one.”They had gathered to bid farewell to Stanislav Orlov, better known by his callsign “Spaniard”, the founder of the far-right Española unit – a formation of football hooligans and neo-Nazi volunteers who fought as a paramilitary force on Russia’s side inUkraine.Russian pro-war Telegram channels framed the funeral as an act of consecration: a battlefield commander laid to rest at the heart of Moscow’s spiritual and political establishment. Yet amid the solemnity, one detail was conspicuously absent. No official cause of death was mentioned – a silence that only underscored the unease surrounding Orlov’s final days.View image in fullscreenStanislav Orlov led Russia’s far-right Española unit, which recruited football hooligans.Photograph: Social media/east2west newsFor more than two weeks, Orlov’s death, first rumoured online on 9 December, was the subject of intense speculation and debate. Kremlin-linked Russian news websites and independent outlets soon reported that Orlov was not killed on the battlefield in Ukraine, but was ambushed and shot at his home in Russian-annexed Crimea by Moscow’s own security services.On Monday, Astra, an anti-war outlet operating in exile,publishedCCTV footage that it said showed the moments before Orlov was killed, with a group of armed Russian servicemen arriving outside his house, followed by the sound of gunshots. Astra reported that an ambulance only arrived to collect Orlov’s body six hours later.Analysts say Orlov’s death reflects a broader, increasingly visible crackdown by the Kremlin on renegade ultranationalist figures and semi-autonomous armed groups as a result of theWagner mutiny.For much of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, the Russian state tolerated – and at times encouraged – radical formations that could mobilise fighters quickly and project uncompromising zeal. Units such as Española were useful militarily and ideologically, embodying a raw, street-level patriotism that complemented official propaganda.View image in fullscreenMourners attend Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour for Orlov’s funeral.Photograph: TelegramEspañola – which has been sanctioned by the UK and the EU – took part in some of Russia’s bloodiest assaults on Ukrainian cities, including thebattles for Mariupol and Bakhmut.But it also served its purpose away from the frontlines. Española, which brought together football hooligans from Russia’s biggest football clubs, ran a particularly effective publicity campaign and managed to intersect with Russian sports culture and broader social life.The group attracted prominent former athletes as poster children, including the ex-Russian football international Andrei Solomatin, who enlisted with the unit in 2022. The group’s imagery also surfaced at major sporting events: during a popular CSKA Moscow ice hockey match, Española symbols were displayed, and patches linked to the unit were worn.View image in fullscreenFormer footballer Andrei Solomatin (left) with Orlov.Photograph: TelegramBut tolerance for irregular units operating outside the main chain of command, such as Española, narrowed sharply after June 2023, when Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner mercenary group rebelled, briefly seizing a military headquarters and sending an armed column towards Moscow.Although the rebellion collapsed within hours, it marked the most serious challenge to Putin’s rule in decades. Two months later,Prigozhin was killed in a plane crashwidely seen by western officials as a Kremlin-ordered reprisal. Since then, Russia’s security apparatus has moved systematically to reassert control.Independent armed formations have been dismantled or absorbed into the regular military. Prominent ultranationalist critics have been silenced: Igor Girkin, a former commander, wasjailedlast year on extremism charges after attacking Russia’s military leadership and mocking the war effort.The same fate awaited Española, which in October abruptly announced that it was disbanding and that its units would be absorbed into Russia’s regular army. Two months later, its founder was dead.View image in fullscreenThe grave of the Wagner group leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is located in Porokhovskoe cemetery on the edge of St Petersburg.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“Orlov’s death is yet another demonstrative elimination of radicals who have slipped out of control, following the same logic as the removal of Prigozhin,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst.Kolesnikov said the apparent killing was intended to serve as “a warning meant to discourage others from pursuing an independent path”, particularly with the prospect of large numbers of embittered and armed men returning from the front if ongoing peace talks open the way to an end to the war.Trump and Putin share a craving for status. That’s why they both want to destroy Europe | Henry Farrell and Sergey RadchenkoRead moreThe message appears to have landed. Few of the hundreds of influential pro-war bloggers have commented publicly on the circumstances of Orlov’s death, with most remaining silent.Española itself issued a carefully worded statement on Telegram, saying: “We cannot fail to note that many people are interested in the reasons for Spaniard’s death – and we are no less so.” The group urged supporters, however, to wait for the results of an official investigation.Still, the decision to allow Orlov to be buried at Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour captures one of the central paradoxes of wartime Russia, Kolesnikov noted.“Radical zealots are celebrated, sanctified and mourned in the most sacred of spaces,” Kolesnikov said. “But when they step beyond the narrow boundaries set by the state, they can be eliminated.”Kolesnikov argued that the Kremlin had applied the same logic to Prigozhin. While the Russian president has disowned Prigozhin for his treachery, he has also been careful not to diminish the warlord or his fighters’ role in the war in Ukraine, wary of antagonising their many admirers.Prigozhin’s memorial, just 300 metres from Red Square in one of Moscow’s most tourist-heavy areas, has been left untouched. “Russians are free to keep the memory of men like Prigozhin alive, by all means” Kolesnikov said. “But the message is clear: do not lay claim to power – not even a small share of it.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropeYevgeny PrigozhinVladimir PutinUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, there were 141 settlements in the West Bank. After the latest approval there are 210, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group.Settlements are considered illegal under international law.The 14 countries’ statement added: “We are resolute in our support of Palestinians’ right of self-determination. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution in accordance with relevant UN security council resolutions where two democratic states, Israel andPalestine, live side by side in peace and security within secure and recognized borders. We reaffirm that there is no alternative to a negotiated two-state solution.”Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, rejected the statement, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats the country faced.He wrote on X: “Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineWest BankInternational lawMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Residents reported that Israeli drones continued to hover over the area and other areas of southLebanonand its eastern Bekaa valley after the strikes.In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck launching sites and military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah, the presence of which it called “a violation of the understandings betweenIsraeland Lebanon”.Israel regularly strikes southern Lebanon,in violation of the more than-year-old ceasefirein place, which ended a 13-month war with Hezbollah.Israel has bombed Lebanon once every four hourson average since the implementation of the ceasefire, according to ACLED, an independent conflict monitor.Hezbollah shelled Israel once, in the week after the establishment of the ceasefire in December 2024.Airstrikes have been accompanied by heightening Israeli rhetoric in recent weeks, as a deadline for the Lebanese army to clear all of Hezbollah’s arms from south of the Litani River grows closer.Is Lebanon the new flashpoint for Israel? – podcastRead more“There will be no calm in Beirut, nor order and stability in Lebanon, until the security of the state of Israel is guaranteed … Hezbollah: we will disarm them,” Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, told parliament in November.Under a US-approved plan adopted by the Lebanese army, by year’s end, the Lebanese army is meant to clear all Hezbollah infrastructure, weapons and personnel from the area south of the Litani, about 20 miles from the country’s border with Israel. Israeli forces are meant to withdraw from the country, though its troops continue to occupy five points in the south and regularly conduct ground operations there.Lebanese officials say they have all but finished with the disarmament of Hezbollah in the south and regularly blow up old weapons caches from the group.The deputy prime minister, Tarek Mitri, said on 17 December that the government was nearly done with disarmament in the south and said while Lebanon was “strictly observing” the ceasefire, that Israel continually violated it.Israel has rejected the claim, however, and says that Hezbollah is attempting to rebuild itself along its borders.On Monday, an Israeli drone strike killed three men in a car 10 miles south of the Lebanese city of Saida, far north of the Litani. Israel claimed that one of the men killed, who was a warrant officer in the Lebanese army, was also a member of Hezbollah and was involved in planning attacks on Israel.It further pointed to the presence of a Hezbollah member in the army as proof that the Lebanese state was not doing enough to combat the group.The Lebanese army and Hezbollah denied the soldier had any connection to the armed group, with Lebanon’s defence minister, Michel Menassa, saying the accusation was a “malicious attack” on the army.Israeli media has reported that one of the topics on the agenda in an expected meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and US president, Donald Trump, is an expanded offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.As Israeli airstrikes continue on south Lebanon, Israeli and Lebanese officials continue to meet in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura to discuss the status of the ceasefire.Last Friday, the delegations included civilian representatives for the second time, drawing outrage in Lebanon, which said inclusion of civilian negotiators was paramount to recognition of Israel – a taboo in Lebanese politics. The civilian representatives were meant to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as the potential economic cooperation between the two countries.Israel said it considers the diplomatic engagement with the Lebanese state to be separate from its military attacks on Hezbollah and is pushing forward on both tracks.The Lebanese state has continually appealed to the international community for help to stop what it said were near-daily attacks on its sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In the trailer, a voiceover says: “Whatever happened to Tommy Shelby? The famous gypsy gangster.”Peaky Blinders: The Immortal ManShelby says “I’m not that man any more”, and a separate clip shows him walking with his head held down while wearing his distinctive bakerboy cap after a female voice says: “Tommy, you’ve got to come back.”Viewers are also offered a glimpse of Keoghan’s character, who wears a white vest top with tattoos on his arms.The forthcoming movie serves as a continuation of the hit BBC drama series, which followed the rise of the Birmingham crime family the Shelbys.The show’s six seasons spanned the end of the first world war through the end of prohibition in the US.Returning cast members include Sophie Rundle as Ada Shelby, Stephen Graham as union convener Hayden Stagg, and Packy Lee as Tommy’s friend Johnny Dogs.Saltburn actor Keoghan, Dune actor Rebecca Ferguson and Reservoir Dogs star Tim Roth are among the new additions.The film has been directed by Tom Harper and written by creator Steven Knight, who is to write the next James Bond film.Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man premieres in cinemas on 6 March next year and will be available on Netflix from 20 March.In October, the BBC announcedPeaky Blinders would return with two new seriesfocusing on a “new generation of Shelbys”.The spin-off series is set in 1953, years after the events of the forthcoming feature film, and is to be filmed at Digbeth Loc Studios in Birmingham.Murphy, 49, will return to executive produce but it has not been disclosed if he will reprise his role as the protagonist.The spin-off is the latest incarnation in the Peaky Blinders universe after Rambert Studios’ ballet about Tommy.The sixth series, which was broadcast in 2022 and was billed as the final series, saw Tommy almost shoot himself after being given false information that he had a brain tumour.Peaky Blinders first aired on BBC Two in 2013, before getting picked up by Netflix in 2014, where it gained a global following and launched Murphy to international fame along with co-stars Tom Hardy, Anya Taylor-Joy and the late Helen McCrory.The drama, which also triggered a surge in popularity of the flat cap, moved to BBC One in 2019 after a Bafta win for best drama series for its fourth season.Explore more on these topicsPeaky BlindersNetflixCillian MurphyBarry KeoghannewsShareReuse this content"

He also does not mention storage costs or flag that gold does not bring in a regular income in interest or dividends.One pensions expert, Tom McPhail, a governor of thePensionsPolicy Institute, described the idea that people should be converting some of their pension into physical gold as “niche” and suggested it was appropriate only for sophisticated investors.“There is nothing inherently wrong with holding actual gold,” he said. “But you have got to look at the transaction and storage costs and the whole thing in the round. It is pretty niche stuff.“For 90% or more of the population, join your workplace pension, go into the default fund, have a mixture of bonds and equities, plus property and cash. Just do that. The people who could be looking at [buying physical gold] should be reasonably sophisticated investors. It’s definitely not for most people and should only be done by someone who understands how physical gold fits into a diverse portfolio.”He added: “You can make the argument that he’s just acting as a billboard, saying, ‘how about investing in gold? Talk to these guys, who will tell you about the details.’ But it does feel quite irresponsible. Farage has a strong brand. Not everybody likes him, but some people really like him. So when Nigel tells you to invest in gold, you might just dutifully do what he tells you. If I were to put all my money in gold, that would be a really high-risk thing to do.”View image in fullscreenFarage said: ‘Since I began my relationship with Direct Bullion, people that took my advice will have seen returns of over 100% on their money.’Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesTom Brake, the chief executive of Unlock Democracy, said he had raised the Direct Bullion videos promoted by Farage with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), asking them to look into whether the online material met its standards and whether it fell under its regulatory orbit.He highlightedtwo videoswherethere were no disclaimers, and pointed to another where he said the disclaimer at the end was in such a tiny font and appeared so fleetingly there was a dangerthe viewer may not see it.A spokesperson for Reform UK, asked whether it was appropriate for an MP and political leader to suggest people used their pension pots to buy gold without disclaimers that the value could go up and down, or explaining that gold did not bring in regular income or making clear any storage costs, said the party “took pity on the Guardian for not having better things to do with their time than measure font sizes”.Farage said: “For five years I have publicly recommended that people invest a decent chunk of money into gold. Since I began my relationship with Direct Bullion, people that took my advice will have seen returns of over 100% on their money.”Direct Bullion did not respond to requests for comment. Reform UK sources said Farage had a working relationship with Direct Bullion that preceded his time as an MP.Promoting the company’s physical gold bars and coins is one of many jobs Farage has had at the same time as being the MP for Clacton.The Reform leader is a presenter for GB News, and has been paid about £450,000 from that role since entering parliament. He is also a columnist for the Daily Telegraph, bringing £48,000 a year, and a commentator for Sky News Australia, which pays him more than £50,000 a year.Other pensions experts said putting gold into pensions could be part of a diversified portfolio. Kate Marshall, a lead investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Gold can play a useful role in a diversified pension portfolio, but it’s important to keep it in proportion.“We favour gaining exposure through exchange traded commodities (ETCs), such as the iShares Physical Gold ETC, which aims to provide exposure to physical gold. ETCs are one of the simplest ways to invest and can be a low-cost way to add exposure to gold to an investment portfolio.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content, and he was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability.“Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.”Her comments came after Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The CCDH has previously incurred the wrath of Musk over its reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took over the platform. Musktried unsuccessfullyto sue the organisation last year, before calling it a “criminal organisation”.Visa ban for European critics of online harm is first shot in US free speech warRead moreThe X owner has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation. And he has railed against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which Breton helped spearhead, and under which Xwas hitwith a €120m (£105m) fine for what the EU called the deceptive design of its blue tick system for verifying users.Melford is UK-based, while Ahmed, whose organisation once employed Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a director, lives in Washington DC with his family.A spokesperson for GDI called the sanctions “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. They added: “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.”Ahmed has been approached for comment.A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”That response contrasted, however, with the more combative stance taken by the French government and the European Commission.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the measures “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. The commission said in a statement it “strongly condemns” the actions of the Trump administration.Jonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Times Radio: “[This] will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject [internet regulation] at the moment.”Campaigners in the UK warned the British government was likely to be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.Ava Lee, the executive director of People Vs Big Tech, said: “The Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Europeans trying to uphold the rule of law when it comes to big tech. With the Online Safety Act (OSA), the UK is likely to be next in the firing line.”The Trump administration has previously flagged its concerns about the OSA. This year a group of officials from the state department metOfcom, the regulator charged with overseeing the act, and are understood to have raised concerns that the act will risk infringing free speech.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK’s House of Lords and a prominent online safety campaigner, said Rubio’s comments on the visa bans were an “outrage”.“The US tech sector, backed by the US administration, is attempting to undermine European laws and values,” she said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Both pieces of legislation require social media firms to protect users orface the threat of sizeable fines. Indeed, Elon Musk’s X has been fined €120m (£105m) this month forbreaching the DSA.These acts are prime examples of what US Republicans see as an anti-free speech culture on the other side of the Atlantic.View image in fullscreenThierry Breton is thought to have been a leading figure in bringing through the EU’s Digital Services Act.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyOfcom, the UK’s communications regulator charged with overseeing the OSA, has not been affected by the visa bans announced on Christmas Eve, but there is an implicit threat in the air. One of those targeted by the move is the former European industry commissioner Thierry Breton, an architect of the DSA. The message is clear: watch out regulators.Trump allies have also targeted Imran Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a US-UK organisation which campaigns against online hate speech. Ahmed was one of the people who received a visa ban on Wednesday. CCDH was the target of an Elon Musk lawsuit in 2023 but the claim was thrown out by a judge last year who said thelegal challenge, which focused on allegations that CCDH accessed data on X illegally, was in fact “about punishing the defendants for their speech”. In a post on X, Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”, described CCDH as a “truly evil organization that just wants to destroy the first amendment under the guise of doing good!”The UK’s OSA remains asubject of White House ire. JD Vance, the US vice-president, has said free speech in the UK is “in retreat”. In July, Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman who has criticised the act, led a delegation of US politicians to discuss the legislation with the Labour government andOfcom.Ofcom is aware it could be in the crosshairs. In May, the state department announced it willblock entry to the USto “foreign nationals who censor Americans”. The watchdog has said it is seeking “clarity” on the planned visa restrictions.Elon Musk, AI and the antichrist: the biggest tech stories of 2025Read moreThe EU and UK have only just got going on implementing their acts and, as the visa ban for Breton shows, opposition is building. In October, Ofcom fined the online forum 4chan £20,000 for breaching the act by failing to respond to a request for a risk assessment. Emboldened by domestic opposition to the OSA, 4chan is suing Ofcom in the US, claiming its enforcement of the OSA violates Americans’ right to freedom of speech.The UK government has said it won’t back down on the OSA, while the X fine signals the EU is determined to enforce its own legislation. There is also an effective non-profit ecosystem – in Europe and the US – campaigning for online safety. These visa bans are just the latest shot in what will be a long-running battle under theTrump administration.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyElon MuskJD VanceOnline abuseInternet safetyRegulatorsFreedom of speechanalysisShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "04.28 ESTTwo British anti-hate speech campaigners sanctioned by US state departmentGood morning. Christmas is the time of peace on earth and goodwill towards all men. But there is not much sign of that in US/UK relations this morning, where theTrump administrationhas just sanctioned two Britons, among others, for supposedly trying to suppress free speech in the US, and that has led to the Lib Dem leader Ed Davey engaging in a Twitter spat with a senior figure in the US state department.Let’s start with the sanctions. YesterdayMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, issuedthis statementsaying:The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose. These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies. As such, I have determined that their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.The state department has sanctioned five Europeans.Former EU commissioner and activists barred from US in attack on European tech regulatorsRead moreThe list includes two Britons: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index. Ahmed used to work for the Labour party and he is close to Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. According toPolitico’s London Playbook, Ahmed is based in Washington, where he has an American wife and child, and he now faces deportation. Politico also says Melford faces having her US visa revoked.Last nightSarah Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy at the state department, posteda thread on Xdefending the decision. She said the Trump administration was targeting the “censorship-NGO ecosystem”.Today, the United States issued SANCTIONS reinforcing the “red line” I invoked on @GBNEWS. Namely: extraterritorial censorship of Americans.Today’s sanctions target the censorship-NGO ecosystem.These sanctions are visa-related. We aren’t invoking severe Magnitsky-style financial measures, but our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.She also took a swipe at theLiberal Democrats.None of those sanctioned is a current UK or EU official—however, we know that foreign government officials are actively targeting the United States. This week, the UK’s Liberal Democrats claimed President Trump’s National Security Strategy amounts to “foreign interference” by a “hostile foreign state” because it correctly identifies mass migration and decaying national sovereignty as existential European security concerns.In fact, Davey did not say thenational security strategyamounts to foreign interference in British politics because it is critical of mass migration. He said that because the document explicitly says US policy for Europe should prioritise, among other things, “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.In a direct response to Rogers on X last night,Daveymade this point himself.Donald Trump has made it his explicit policy to ‘cultivate resistance’ in the UK and elsewhere.So yes, I think that counts as foreign interference.I will be blogging until about 2pm.

Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files.”The statement came after it was reported earlier Wednesday that there were hundreds of thousands of additional records related toJeffrey Epsteinto review – a process that involves a team of 200 departmental analysts and which will take another week to complete.According to Axios,which cited unnamed justice department officials, about 750,000 records have been reviewed and disclosed, and about 700,000 more remain to be examined. However, many of those may be duplicates, so the remaining number of records may only be in the thousands.Newly released Epstein files include references to Donald TrumpRead more“This will end soon,” an official told the outlet. “The conspiracy theories won’t.”On Friday last week, the day of the first releases, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein”.At the weekend there wasoutrage from victims and legal threatsover the limited initial Epstein files release despite the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December.Pressure to complete the review and release the Epstein documents comes as lawmakers Ro Khanna of California, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a Republican, have threatened contempt hearings against the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, over the justice department’s failure to meet the 19 December deadline in full.CNN reportedthat the justice department office in Florida has asked for career prosecutors to volunteer over the “next several days” to help redact the remaining unreleased files.“We have an obligation to the public to release these documents and before we can do so, certain redactions must be made to protect the identity of the victims, among other things,” the southern district of Florida leadership wrote in an email on Tuesday, CNN reported, adding that it was “aware the timing could not be worse. For some the holidays are about to begin, but I know that for others the holidays are coming to an end.”On Tuesday this week, in a third drop of files since Friday, the justice department released 30,000 records from the investigations into Epstein and his co-conspiratorGhislaine Maxwell.The releases contained more mentions of Donald Trump than in previous drops, including an email from 2020, apparently sent by a federal prosecutor in New York, that said Trump “traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)”, including one where the only listed passengers were Epstein, Trump and a “then-20-year-old”.The latest release included some notable false leads, including a fake letter from Epstein to convicted sex abuser and former Olympic gymnastics coach Larry Nassar, and a fake video of Epstein committing suicide in his jail cell.DoJ says Jeffrey Epstein letter to Larry Nassar referencing Trump is fakeRead more“There has been lots of sensationalism and even outright lies these past few days about the ‘Epstein Files’,” Blanchesaid in a statement on X. “But let’s separate fact from fiction. Document production is just that. We produce documents, and sometimes this can result in releasing fake or false documents because they simply are in our possession because the law requires this.”Blanche pointed to both the letter and video. “The so-called Epstein Nassar letter is clearly FAKE – wrong handwriting, wrong return address, and postmarked three days after Epstein died. Fake videos of Epstein in his cell. Photos with no explanation. Sensational tales and lies by random people. These are not reality. We will continue to produce every document required by law. Let’s not let internet rumor engines outrun the facts.”The latest release of Epstein files cast some light on the FBI’s effort to identify and contact additional possible “conspirators”.One document, an email by an FBI worker in New York, identified the names of 10 potential “co-conspirators” following Epstein’s arrest in July 2019. But only three names are unredacted in the document: Ghislaine Maxwell; Jean-Luc Brunel, a model agent who died by suicide after he was charged with rape and sexual harassment in France; and Leslie Wexner, a billionaire client of Epstein who has said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 and later accused the financier of misappropriating money. Wexner, 88, has always denied any involvement in Epstein’s crimes and is not the subject of any known current investigations related to Epstein.“According to Mr Wexner’s legal representative, the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect,” a representative for Wexner saidin a statement to Bloombergon Monday. “Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.”Mention of potential conspirators in FBI communications, despite redactions and lacking in further context, has provoked a political reaction.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement demanding transparency. “The Department of Justice needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute. Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationGhislaine MaxwellSex traffickingUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As people all over the nation thrill to the twinkling lights and accumulating gifts under the boughs this festive season, few who buy a real tree may spare a thought for where it came from.In October, 2024, Helene tore through the region,killing at least 95 peopleand causing widespread damage to homes, farms, roads, land and infrastructure. Officials estimated that the storm, at one stage a category 4, caused about$125min losses of ornamental nurseries and Christmas trees alone.A year later, while full recovery for some farms is still distant, many growers said their sales before the holidays were lively.At Avery Farms, a 200-year-old family operation in Avery county, Helene ripped out about80,000of their Christmas trees, wrecked fields, equipment and buildings, and destroyed the home of manager Graham Avery’s parents.That fall, the family sold what they could to the customers: a limited number of trees, wreaths, boughs and improvised tabletop trees fashioned from salvaged tops.This year has been focused on rebuilding. Avery’s parents’ home was rebuilt with help from “lots of people donating their time” and they moved back in just a month ago. The family bulldozed damaged fields, fertilized the soil and planted about 20,000 trees this spring, a long-term project to regain pre-Helene output, as Christmas trees take fromsix to 12 yearsto mature.“It’s going to be a while, but that’s the whole game that we play doing Christmas trees. It’s a very long-term investment,” Avery said. “We are set up to do it, and we will continue to do it.”Even with significantly reduced inventory, Avery said, this season’s sales have been “very, very good” and the farm has doubled its wreath output and is shipping them nationwide.“With what inventory we do have, we’ve had no issue selling,” Avery said.Jennifer Greene, executive director of theNorth CarolinaChristmas Tree Association, said the industry remained strong despite the devastation to some growers.The 2025 growing season also offered some relief. “We had a great spring with April rainfall,” she said, noting the trees “have actually had a great growing season”.“We’re in the middle of a great season, we’re happy to not have a hurricane and we’ve had good weather for harvest. So things are looking good,” she said.Dee Clark, owner of Christmas Corner and C&G Nursery in Avery county, shared similar optimism, despite retail sales plummeting last year when a road washed out and remained closed until summer.“Early indications look promising,” Clark, 63, said, earlier in December. He added that his son had developed social-marketing efforts to boost sales.A third-generation grower, Clark said Helene destroyed much of his farm’s infrastructure and damaged roads and culverts, triggering landslides that cost about 1,000 trees and stripped vital nutrients from the soil.Clark, who said the storm “almost put us out of business”, has focused on repairs, replanting and restoring the land. He expects it will take years to replace lost trees, and knows many growers face a similar, long climb. But, he said: “The Christmas tree industry in western North Carolina as a whole is probably the best shape it’s ever been in as far as the supply of trees right now.”At Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm, owner Sam Cartner said he felt fortunate no lives or homes were lost in the flooding, but said landslides destroyed up to 10,000 trees.“We probably won’t ever be able to plant those areas back, because the topsoil slid off,” he said. “We’ll have to find other areas to plant if we recover that number of trees.”The Cartners worked quickly, and made enough repairs to have a “relatively normal harvest” last fall, he said, despite the major damage to roads, bridges and culverts on the property.One of their trees was even selected last yearto be displayedat the White House.For many in the region, the Cartners’ White House treebecame a symbol of resilience. Jamie Bookwalter, an extension specialist at North Carolina State University, recalled attending its send-off ceremony in Avery county.“That Christmas tree represented a lot of people problem-solving,” she said, “which I think is what this area of the country is kind of known for: resiliency, problem-solving and self-reliance.”Will Kohlway IV, a Christmas tree production extension specialist also at NC State, said the Cartners’ ability to harvest and deliver the tree, despite everything the region had dealt with, exemplified “the spirit of the mountains and also Christmas tree growers”.They called the tree “Tremendous”, he said, because “it was really a tremendous effort”.Bookwalter visited some of the hardest-hit farms immediately following the storm. “Helene was a terrible event, but farming in general is just becoming more difficult as temperatures become more unpredictable and we get wetter periods – the wetter periods are wetter, the drier periods are drier,” she said. “We’re all just kind of learning day by day.”She saidresearchers are working to develop treesmore resilient to the changing climate.Kohlway said that the public’s support for the region’s growers and farms had been “humbling”.“Buying a tree supports a North Carolina farmer,” he said. Even if purchased at a big-box store, the tree, Bookwalter added, “really represents probably a pretty small farmer”.Explore more on these topicsNorth CarolinaFarmingChristmasAgricultureHurricane HeleneClimate crisisExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

If successful, it could mark a major setback in US effort to rein in Pfas pollution.The Republican-led House energy and commerce committee recentlyheld a hearingat which it invited representatives from the water treatment and landfill industries, among others, to make the case about why they should be exempted from rules that hold polluters financially accountable for the cleanup of two types of dangerous Pfas.Water treatment plants and landfills are major polluters and represent critical points in the effort to curbPfaswater pollution nationwide. Utilities already have to remove hundreds of chemicals, so it is unclear why they are so opposed to removing two types of Pfas, said Scott Faber, vice-president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group non-profit.“The only real difference is Pfas are more toxic … so the fact that water utilities and landfills are being such crybabies about Pfas says something about how little regard for public health they have,” Faber said.Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.Over industry objections, the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2024, under Joe Biden, put in place the rules when it designated PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the nation’s Superfund law.The designation gives the EPA the option to require polluters to pay for cleanups, though it isn’t mandated, and the agency has already said it in many cases may not take enforcement action against water utilities.Still, reversing the rule has been at the top of industry’s wishlist since Trump’s election, but the EPA in September reaffirmed the rule. The hearings represent a first step toward attacking the rule from a different angle by chipping away at it, public health groups opposed to the plan say.The water utility industry, which hasoften strongly opposed to new clean water rulesin recent decades, argues that it should not be liable for contaminated water pollution or contaminated drinking water because it is not the source of the chemicals.Industry spits virtually unchecked amounts of Pfas into the nation’s sewer system and surface water, creating a problem for the utilities.“When utilities are forced to spend limited resources on litigation or cleanup costs, ratepayer funds must be diverted from replacing ageing infrastructure, complying with Safe Drinking Water Act requirements, and performing other essential functions,” said Tracy Mehan, a lobbyist with the American Water Works Association, the trade group that represents many of the nation’s utilities.But the water utilities have a responsibility to provide clean water, advocates note. Exempting them from liability would eliminate a major incentive to take strong action to address Pfas in drinking water and wastewater, Faber said.Utilities and state agencies typically have the power to order polluters to stop discharging Pfas into the sewer system, and the process is not difficult, advocates say. In Michigan, regulators in 2018developed a successful programto identify companies that were a major source PFOA and PFOS discharges, then require them to reduce the levels of the chemicals they spit into the sewer.“Utilities have complete control over the pipes and they don’t have to allow industry to do this,” said Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, a citizens group that formed in Wilmington, North Carolina in response to widespread Pfas pollution in the region.Industrial polluters and drinking water utilities can use granular activated carbon filters, a common technology that is not difficult to deploy, to remove PFOA and PFOS, advocates noted.Donovan questioned why water utilities are dispatching lobbyists – paid for by utility customers – to lobby against clean water actions instead of pushing for the government to provide more money to improve systems.“They weren’t [at the hearing] advocating for money – not once did they say, ‘Hey, we could use more money,’” Donovan said. “Instead they said, ‘Don’t do this, it’s too expensive.’” She added that utilities should also push for a ban on Pfas altogether to stop the problem from growing.Similarly, landfill operators say they should not be liable for their pollution because they receive and manage trash that already has the chemicals in it. PFOA and PFOS concentrate in landfills and up in the facilities’ leachate that contaminates ground and surface water.Exempting landfills from liability would eliminate industry incentive to eliminate a major nationwide source of Pfas pollution. Representatives from airports, the military and real estate industry were also at the hearing asking for exemptions, Donovan said.“Where do we stop? Everyone is going to start lining up for this,” Donovan said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.Critics have compared the offensive to the Iraq war, citing a familiar mix of regime-change rhetoric, security pretexts and oil interests. This month, theTrump administrationlabeled fentanyl – which it says flows from Venezuela – a “weapon of mass destruction”.On Monday, Trump suggested oil seized from Venezuela could be treated as a US asset. “Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it,” hetold reporters. “Maybe we’ll use it in the strategic reserves. We’re keeping the ships also.”The remarks echo earlier statements from Trump where he has repeatedly called for the US to seize oil from other countries, indicating a broader belief that US power entitles it to control or extract resources from other states.“The administration’s global energy policy is mostly about using the threat of violence or the withholding of aid to secure the inputs for the ‘most of the above’ energy strategy,” which excludes only solar and wind, said Patrick Bigger, co-director of Transition Security Project, a research initiative focused on the climate and geopolitical concerns of militarization.The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment.Trump’s belief in what Bigger calls “resource imperialism” emerged during his first presidential campaign. Then, he repeatedly suggested that though the US should not have waged the Iraq war, it should have taken the country’s oil in compensation for the costs of the conflict.“You win the war and you take it,” he told ABC in 2015. “You’re not stealing anything … We’re reimbursing ourselves.”He expanded upon the argument the following year: “If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have Isis, because Isis formed with the power and the wealth of that oil,” he said in an NBC News forum.He took a similar approach to resource extraction in Syria, tying US troop deployments to control over eastern oilfields.“We’ve secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil, and we’re going to be protecting it, and we’ll be deciding what we’re going to do with it in the future,” hesaidin October 2019, later adding that Exxon Mobil couldlead the effortto tap the resources.The president has worked to obstruct other countries from selling their own resources, notably Iran. Via a combination of sweeping sanctions and threats of military force, the administration sought to cut off Iran’s revenue streams, framing this as a strategy to curb the country’s regional influence and nuclear ambitions.“Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions,” the president said in a post on Truth Social this year.Beyond targeting other countries’ oil, Trump has sought to secure rare earth minerals – materials vital for the production of batteries, cellphones, electric cars and weapons systems – from other countries, even seeking to strong-arm traditional US allies to get them.The president has long fixated on Greenland, an autonomous territory under Danish rule, saying earlier this year that the US needs the island “very badly” for “national security and international security” reasons. In an extraordinary threat thatshookDenmark, Trump didn’t rule outusing forcein order to seize Greenlandand this week appointed a special envoy to the territory.The island contains vast deposits of cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and other minerals, and the White House hasconsideredtaking a direct stake in its largest rare-earths mining project. JD Vance warned earlier this year that China and Russia were “interested in the minerals of the Arctic territories”, saying: “We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because if we don’t, other nations will fill the gap.”Meanwhile, in April, the Trump administrationstruck a dealwith Ukraine granting the US preferential access to the country’s minerals and uranium in exchange for continued military support against Russia’s ongoing invasion.When not claiming resources directly for the US, Trump has actively agitated for increased fossil fuel use by ostensible allies. In September, Trumpcalled onthe UK to open up the North Sea for more oil drilling, criticizing the British government for making it “impossible for people to drill”.In the same month, the US president expanded upon a worldview that is dominated by fossil fuels in a discursive, often fact-freespeech to the UN, where he warned countries if they “don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail”.He added: “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”The “elephant in the room” in Trump’s quest to seize foreign resources is escalating tension with China, said Adam Hanieh, a development expert and author of Crude Capitalism:Oil, Corporate Power, and the Making of the World Market. US-China rivalry is “pushing the US to attempt to exert control over various energy and industrial supply chains”. he said.It’s a playbook that previous administrations have also followed, Hanieh added.“I think Trump’s difference with other US administrations is mostly stylistic,” he said. “Previous administrations pursued the same strategic control of energy, minerals and chokepoints, but cloaked it in multilateralism and ‘market stability’, whereas Trump voices the extractive logic directly.”Trump’s approach is “essentially resource nationalism”, according to Alice Hill, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and former climate and national security adviser to Barack Obama’s White House.“He sees fossil fuel dominance as key to our national power and he doesn’t care about international norms or what climate science says,” Hill said.“That’s very unfortunate given the clear need for rapid decarbonization. This is a short-term gamble that will cost everyone a great deal. For current and future generations who will have to deal with climate change, he’s making a catastrophic mistake.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOilForeign policyVenezuelaOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February.Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, a Republican, praisedDonald Trumpand the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, for coordinating the deployment and predicted the guard’s presence would have a positive impact. “It’s going to help us further crack down on the violence here in the city of New Orleans and elsewhere around Louisiana,” Landry said in an appearance on the The Will Cain Show on Fox News. “And so a big shoutout to both of them.”Woman deported before she could see dying husband in ICE custody: ‘I never saw him again’Read moreCritics have argued a national guard deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the community, and they point out thatNew Orleanshas actually seen a decrease in violent crime rates.The deployment of the national guard to the Democratic-led city comes as border patrol agents have been carrying out an immigration crackdown since the beginning of the month. According to the Department of Homeland Security, agents have arrested several hundred people during the first couple weeks of what is expected to be a months-long operation that has a goal of 5,000 arrests.Back in September, Landry asked Trump to send a 1,000 federally funded troops toLouisianacities, citing concerns about crime. Landry has praised Trump for sending troops to other cities, including Washington DC and Memphis, Tennessee.The president has also taken a shine to Landry. Trump on Sunday announced he was appointing the governor to serve as his special envoy to Greenland, the strategic, vast and semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the US needs to take over.New Orleans has been on pace for much of the year to have its lowest number of murders in decades, according to preliminary data from the city’s police department. There have been 97 homicides in 2025 as of 1 November, including 14 revelers who were killed on New Year’s Day during a truck attack on Bourbon Street.A US army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wreaked carnage on New Orleans’ raucous new year’s celebration as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.There were 124 homicides last year and 193 in 2023, according to city figures. Armed robberies, aggravated assaults, carjackings, shootings and property crimes have also trended downward.New Orleans is no stranger to having national guard members in the city. In January, 100 guard members were sent to the city to help with security measures after the New Year’s Day truck attack. Guard members were also present for major events in the city this year, including the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.Explore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS militaryTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS immigrationUS domestic policyLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods likemanty– intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Orchak-chak, a dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey syrup.Kompot,too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home.Mantywas one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin, yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to have soda or sugary drinks, but homemadekompotwith fruits and berries from our garden was an exception. And though I never masteredchak-chak, the store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always findplovandsamsasat eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.When I moved toNew YorkCity in 2019, I felt that instant sense of familiarity at Tashkent, the largest and at the time closest supermarket specializing in Central Asian food. I would regularly make the hour-and-a-half journey to the far end of Brooklyn, stocking up on my favorite spices and grains like buckwheat, orgrechka,before lugging all the goods back on to the B train to upper Manhattan.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: An employee places freshsamsasinto the hot food bar.Bottom:Plovwith lamb.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianThis year, the journey felt less like a pilgrimage, as the newest Tashkent Supermarket opened in Manhattan’s trendy West Village, known not only for its easy subway access but also for its abundance of influencers. Since March, food bloggers have brought a newfound popularity to the store onsocial media, turning often overlooked Central Asian food into must-tries for curious New Yorkers. Perhaps most notorious is Tashkent’s hot bar, with itsplov– a rice and meat dish infused with cumin and carrots – andsamsas, meat or potato pastries wrapped in the flakiest dough imaginable and dotted with black sesame seeds. Accounts such assistersnackingandbabytamagohave taken viewers through this hot bar, its countless dishes spread across illuminated warming trays, and urged them not to sleep on the smoked fish counter. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani gave his own ravereviewfor Tashkent’smanty.When Odiljon Tursunov and his family arrived in the United States in the early 2000s, they couldn’t find the traditional bread and homemade halal sausages they ate back home in Uzbekistan. So they opened the first Tashkent in 2012 in Coney Island, right after Hurricane Sandy hit, naming it for the capital of Uzbekistan. Over the years, it grew from one storefront to five New York locations, as well as a wholesale sausage company and slaughterhouse facility in New Jersey.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Tashkent is famed for its food bar.Bottom: Customers check out.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianAs of 2019, more than1.2 millionpeople from former Soviet republics live in the US.Part of Tashkent’s success came from strategically opening locations across Brooklyn and Queens where a large number of Central Asian immigrants – Kazakhs, Kyrgyzes, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmens – as well as eastern Europeans settled. “Forest Hills has a very large Uzbeki Bukharian population,” said Misa Khayriddinova, head of accounting and human resources for Tashkent, who herself is originally from Bukhara, Uzbekistan. “The Coney Island and Brighton Beach locations are predominantly where Uzbeki people settled after immigrating here, and there’s a lot of Russians and Ukrainians who immigrated here in the 1990s.”With the West Village location, the owners are accommodating their existing customer base while also introducing new customers to distinct flavors from the Central Asian diaspora.Historically, people in regions that are now Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan were nomadic, relying on dishes heavy in meat and dairy, while people in settled populations that are now Uzbekistan and Tajikistan cultivated crops such as carrots, rice and cumin. Proximity to China and Iran affected the gastronomy of the region, once the heart of the Silk Road. But nothing was as significant in reshaping the cuisine as the formation of the Soviet Union in 1922.The nearly 70-year rule not only spread Russian and Slavic dishes to Central Asia but also brought on shortages of food, shifts in agriculture and collectivization of farms, transforming the flavors of the region as people adapted.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTashkent’s West Village location is the chain’s newest addition.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianTashkent sources products from the former Soviet Union, including a variety of cheeses from Georgia, bread from Ukraine, and wholesale nuts and raisins from Uzbekistan. “It’s a fusion of both American products and Central Asian products,” Khayriddinova said.Due to Manhattan real estate costs, along with the impact ofcongestion pricingon delivery trucks, Tashkent raised the prices on hot foods by at least a dollar this year. Aziz Muzdybayev, a Kazakh immigrant, also noticed the West Village location had fewer deals when he stopped by with his family. “We don’t really go to Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods,” Muzdybayev said. “When [we] miss the food from home and want the food your body is craving, we like driving down to Brighton, getting a portion ofplovand a couple ofayrandrinks, and then walking over to the beach to spend time with family.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTashkent’s West Village location brings together customers of all ages.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianJesse Badash, who lives in Queens and works in Manhattan, excitedly anticipated the West Village location openingfor a while. “I’m very interested in Georgian and Azerbaijani food. The prices seem a little bit more expensive than the one in Brighton, but reasonable. The figs were ridiculously cheap,” Badash said as he browsed the store with a friend.For Khayriddinova, seeing Tashkent’s signature green grocery bags in the wild is a major point of pride. “Central Asia is not well known,” she said. “For us to be the first brand to introduce the beautiful taste and authenticity of Uzbeki culture and food is wonderful. It highlights a lot of what Central Asia actually is: the hospitality, the unique taste of what we offer.”One Tuesday evening, I headed to the West Village Tashkent during the post-work dinner rush. I didn’t hear as much Russian or other Central Asian languages as I would in Brooklyn. But as I shuffled from one end of the crowded market to the other, I watched someone at the salad bar curiously inspect theherring under the fur coatwhile another filled a container witholivier,both staples of New Year’s Eve. Among the bright lights and crowded shelves, I saw newcomers willing to try unfamiliar dishes, and instantly recognized the longtime patrons searching for familiar tastes that brought back memories. It gave me a rare sense of recognition – recognition of my food and culture that for so long had been flattened into the legacy of the former Soviet Union, despite having a rich identity of its own.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkSupermarketsRetail industryFoodSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Next year he will take even moreFrom the Super Bowl to UFC cards to the US Open to the Ryder Cup, the US president has turned sport into his own personal stage. There’s more to comeBryan Armen GrahamWed 24 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 12.33 ESTShareConsidering he’s theself-declared hardest workingpresident to ever hold the office, Donald Trump has spent a remarkable amount of the past year away from it. In 2025, he loomed over sports like no American politician before him, his visits to stadiums and arenas and golf courses and race tracks so frequent they began to feel like part of the job description. But if Trump’s presence on the sporting scene has seemed hard to escape, gird yourselves for 2026, when the American presidency no longer merely intersects with sport but threatens to subsume it. The World Cup is on the way, the Olympics are right behind it, a UFC card is coming to the White House lawn (not a joke) and the commander-in-chief’s well-documented fondness for jumbotrons is becoming less of a habit than a dependency.Trump’s grand tour sportif began less than three weeks after his second inauguration, when he become the first sitting presidentto attend the Super Bowl. One week later he was at the Daytona 500, where Air Force Onebuzzed the speedway on arrivalbefore his armored limousine, “The Beast”,paced the fieldfor a couple of ceremonial laps.Trump led the field in a couple of pace laps at the Daytona 500 in February.There were theNCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphiaand the UFC cards in Miami and New Jersey, where his rapturous receptions were covered by Fox News for days; the Fifa Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, where heremained center stage for Chelsea’s trophy lift, a refusal to cede space that felt less like ignorance of protocol than an animal assertion of dominance; the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, where his hyper-jingoistic receptionpresaged a total breakdown in public behavior; a LIV Golf event at his own Doral resort; the US Open men’s final, where the United States Tennis Associationasked broadcasters to censor protests or reactionto his appearance.By the time he surfaced at Tigers-Yankees in the Bronx,Lions-Commanders in Landoverand the Army-Navy game in Baltimore, it was clear the president’s sporting crawl was not leisure but something more coordinated. Still, nothing could prepare us for Trump’s appearance at the World Cup draw, where hewas awarded Fifa’s Peace Prizein a ceremony that delivered a coup de grace to what remained of parody.Trump uses these appearances the way politicians once used county fairs and parades: as staged demonstrations of relevance, engineered for cameras and social feeds. The walk-ins are rallies distilled to their most efficient form. Thirty seconds of visibility is enough to saturate feeds, boosted reflexively by sports accounts, political reporters, celebrities, supporters and detractors alike. The reaction itself barely matters. Trump traffics in “heat”, the age-old pro-wrestling metric that collapses cheers and boos into the same currency. He chooses arenas that lean his way, or venues where displays of dissent can be caricatured as elitist and unserious. Being cheered at a Nascar race orUFCcard flatters his strength. Being jeered at somewhere like the US Open, by patrons at paying $23 for vodka-lemonades, serves the same purpose. None of this feels aberrant in a country where political coverage has fully absorbed the grammar of Monday Night Football: spectacle over substance, momentum over meaning, constant motion and zero reflection.🇺🇸President Trump Makes EPIC Entrance at UFC 314 in Miami🔥CROWD ERUPTS IN USA CHANTpic.twitter.com/xEFte8VEix— The White House (@WhiteHouse)April 13, 2025Sport has long been a favored instrument of strongmen, a means of laundering legitimacy, prestige and international standing through spectacle. Tyrants as far back as Peisistratus of Athens sponsored athletes and infrastructure to naturalize their rule at the ancient Olympics, while Roman emperors from Augustus to Trajan to Commodus bound personal authority to public games as displays of power, generosity and divine sanction. The playbook has proven durable. Mussolini used the 1934World Cupto present fascism as disciplined, modern and triumphant, with Italy’s national team folded seamlessly into the regime’s propaganda. Hitler’s vast investment in architecture, pageantry and media at the 1936 Berlin Olympics served the same end, staging Nazi Germany as peaceful, advanced and legitimate. Franco’s embrace of Real Madrid’s European dominance in the 1950s and 60s functioned as soft-power rehabilitation after civil war and diplomatic isolation. Mobutu Sese Seko, Mohammed bin Salman, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and countless others … same soup, different bowl.But as any exhausted observer of the Trump ecosystem knows, none of this is really about the crowd. The real business happens backstage, where commissioners, promoters, broadcasters and owners mingle in a lightly perfumed donor sauna. Trump treats these events as networking chambers, places where alliances are forged that flatter his vanity and serve his political ambitions in equal measure. (The Rolex suite at the US Open certainly appeared to operate as soft diplomacy: Switzerland’s 39% tariff problemeased soon after, with a gold Rolex clock later appearing on the Resolute desk.)Grinningphoto-ops with Yankees star Aaron JudgeandYouTube walk-ons with Bryson DeChambeaubecome content, currency and campaign messaging all at once, collected with the zeal of a child filling a Panini album. But it is whales like Miriam Adelson – the majority owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, whopoured roughly $100m into Trump’s re-election campaignand hasglibly pledged another $250m if he seeks a third termin 2028 – who really butter his bread.Trump elbowed his way into Chelsea’s Club World Cup celebration at MetLife Stadium in July.But beneath the theatrics is something more pragmatic. Sport, in the Trump imagination, is the great pipeline of Americana. And he’s shown how even sporting conversations on the margins can be turned into political accelerants. During the 2024 campaign,he elevatedthe niche question of transgender participation in women’s sports into a full-blown cultural wedge, using it to galvanize his conservative base and funnel wider anxieties about gender and social change into a single, emotive grievance. In an election decided on a knife-edge, it functioned much like gay marriage in Bush v Kerry two decades earlier: not a dominant policy issue, but a turnout driver potent enough to shape the result. That strategy has carried into his second term, a reminder of how sport can be repurposed as a proxy battlefield in America’s culture wars.All of which brings us to the year ahead, and the grim knowledge that 2025 was merely a dress rehearsal. In 2026 the United States will host the men’s World Cup, a month-long global festival that Trump will aim to co-opt for the international validation he’s long craved. He has already laid claim to the footballing spotlight through his endlessly reciprocated bromance with Infantino, the only world sports leader who treats Trump not as a diplomatic inconvenience but as a kind of visiting archangel. Of course the football will take a backseat on the World Cup’s fourth day, when Trump will fete his 80th birthday from a VIP box at the UFC card to be heldon the White House’s South Lawn.SEE YOU ON THE SOUTH LAWN@UFCpic.twitter.com/02HoAdxc9e— The White House (@WhiteHouse)September 20, 2025The truth is that sport, in its current hyper-politicized and hyper-commodified form, is exquisitely suited to Trump’s needs. It supplies the crowds, the cameras, the ritual patriotism and the ready-made mythologies of strength and struggle. It gives him stadiums and arenas that can be turned into instant rallies and backstage corridors that double as donor gatherings. It offers him a role he prefers to the one described in the constitution: not head of the executive branch, but ringmaster-in-chief.And so the man will keep appearing, a recurring character in the American sporting dreamscape, impossible to edit out of the footage, unbowed by the boos, delighted by the cheers, and constitutionally incapable of declining the opportunity to preen on another jumbotron. Sport gives Trump everything he wants. Next year, he will take even more.Explore more on these topicsSportDonald TrumpUS sportsNFLSuper Bowl LIXWorld Cup 2026LA Olympic Games 2028featuresShareReuse this content"

Their coach has completed an unlikely journey to the top of his sportJacob UittiWed 24 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 11.35 ESTShareAs an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved. For the British-born Sarama, who on 28 October was named the head coach of the WNBA’s newest expansion team, the Portland Fire, people doubted him before he even put two sentences together.“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”Sarama, however, would not be dissuaded.“So, it’s been great!” he says with a laugh. “It’s given me a real chip on my shoulder to go the extra mile to make sure I’m meticulous knowing my stuff. Because at the end of the day, the players don’t care. The players just respect you if you’re competent, if you make them better.”All joking aside, it’s true. It’s not every day that you see a British basketball coach make it in the US. But that’s exactly what Sarama has achieved. While his homeland has never been known as a hotbed for basketball, he’s made a name for himself.Growing up, though, Sarama played soccer and tennis. While basketball is a religion to many in the United States, It was never nearly as important in the UK. Still, as he got older, the game drew Sarama in.“I think the fact that basketball wasn’t as popular made me even more determined,” he says. “Even when all my friends were playing other sports.”Indeed, where there’s a will there’s a way.“I think because basketball in the UK is less developed, it actually awarded me more unique opportunities to accelerate my coaching career,” the 30-year-old says, reflecting on his journey. “When I was 15, I knew I was never going to be good enough to be a professional player. But I thought that coaching would be the best way to have a career at the highest level.”In need of an outlet, Sarama was in his mid-teens when he started his own basketball club, the Guildford Goldhawks. In just a few years, he grew it to be one of the bigger youth teams in the United Kingdom. “We actually won the national championship for the under-14 girls team,” he says. “That was my first experience coaching girls basketball.”In his early 20s, Sarama continued his education at the University of Nottingham, studying history. He also coached – some of the players were nearly twice his age. He garnered important experience. “If I was in [a bigger basketball market like] Serbia, Spain or Lithuania, I would never have had those chances to coach,” he says. “To lead.”From there, he managed to make the leap to the highest level of basketball: the NBA. He worked in the league’s international office, starting in London, before moving to Madrid and Antwerp. When he came to America, he worked in player development with the G-league’s Rip City Remix and then got a job with the Cleveland Cavaliers.“The resources are very different in the UK,” Sarama says. “The universities – it’s not professionalized like it is in the US. For a lot of universities, it’s more for participation, rather than elite performance.”The new head coach for the Fire, though, says that Britain does have a lot ofpotentialwhen it comes to hoops. He goes as far as to call the country a “sleeping giant” when it comes to basketball. “I think it has so much potential with the players,” he says, “and some really good coaches who mean well. We just need as a country to prioritize a lot more coaching education and development.”Sarama says he does maintain hope for the sport to grow there, however.“I think there’s no reason why England couldn’t be a great basketball country,” he says. “It’s going to require a lot of intentional work to get things moving in the right direction. One day I would love to be a part of that and really initiate some positive transformations.”As for his job with the Fire, he certainly has his work cut out. Building an expansion team is not for the weak of heart. Sarama, the author of the book,Transforming Basketball, is going to have to help build a franchise from square-one in a league that is both growing and changing faster than anyone can predict. To do so, he will employ some unique methods.“We’re going to haveeverycoach doing player development,” Sarama says, “with a shared methodology and a shared framework of the principles of play and the individual development plans we have for each athlete. So, a strength coach is not just going to do weight room and warmup. They’re going to be in the whole practice, doing actual basketball activities.”Sarama says he’s keeping three things in mind in his new job – courage, confidence and humility. He believes he is working in the most exciting time in WNBA history. “I feel very privileged to be coming in during this moment in time,” he says. “Just the chance with an expansion team – this is so unique. I could coach the rest of my life and never have this situation. A lot of times in an organization, you have to unlearn previous processes.”Sarama says he’s going to be instituting a lot of new “standard operating procedures”.“We’re going to have absolutely everything documented in the organization,” he says. “That includes checklists in every area from how we go about building the culture to how we build an offense, how we run film sessions, how we give feedback to the players, what we do during a timeout. There’s going to be a checklist to everything.”One thing that he will assuredly keep track of is his team’s rivalry with the squad a few hours north of Portland – the Seattle Storm, who are one of the successful teams in league history, with four championships to their name.“It’s the game I’m most looking forward to, I can say that,” Sarama says. “That will be a very hyped game, which I’m eagerly looking forward to … I watch a lot of basketball – leagues all over the world. And I really want to try to bring the best ideas I’ve been fortunate enough to learn in all these different places to the Fire.”Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The announcement was made in a post on the club’s website by two of its owners, Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. The post did not disclose the size of the investment.The move underlines the increasing influence in British football of US owners, who appear to be drawn by the strong heritage and potential financial returns, at least for clubs below the Premier League.The retired American football starTom Brady is a minority owner at Birmingham City, while Stewart attended last week’slast-gasp 2-1 comebackagainst Wrexham AFC, a north Wales club that has secured three successive promotions thanks to the heavy financial backing of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, who has changed his name from Rob McElhenney.Reynolds and Mac have created a Disney television show tracking their fortunes with Wrexham.

She has written 99 books, according to her website.The “Martha Stewart” brand has been sold several times and remains well known, particularly in the US despite her 2004 conviction for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and other charges in the relation to her sale of shares in the company ImClone Systems.Stewart served five months in prison.In recent years she has struck up a perhaps unlikely friendship withSnoop Dogg, appearing with him at the 2024 Paris Olympics.The size of the celebrities’ minority investments has not been disclosed.

Cravatt and Cohen said that “we do not expect the January window to be a particularly busy one for Swansea City” undernew head coach Vítor Matos. They pointed to Matos’s experience in developing young players.Cravatt and Cohen wrote: “We are very excited to welcome Martha onboard, and we know experiencing Friday night’s game in-person has only increased her own enthusiasm and anticipation for being part of Swansea City.”Swansea City have been owned by an American consortium since 2016, although Cravatt and Cohen took control last year.Explore more on these topicsSwansea CityMartha StewartSnoop DoggLuka ModricShareReuse this content"

News that Brooks Koepkawill step away from LIV Golfin 2026 comes as no shock. This never felt a particularly sensible alliance; an individual who craves glory at the top level and a disruption regime that has grasped for relevance with only varying degrees of success.Koepka has looked unhappy in his professional domain for some time. He has all but admitted he would never have joined LIV but for fears over a potentially career-threatening injury. Golf’s ultimate alpha male was the captain of LIV’s Smash GC team. The whole thing always seemed preposterous.Koepka’s exit is a blow to LIV, however it is spun. Two years ago, the Saudi Arabian-backed tour spent the festive seasonpurring after Jon Rahm signed up. Golf’s existing ecosystem remained in a state of panic. LIV’s Koepka was the reigning US PGA champion. Amalgamation, surely, was necessary.Brooks Koepka quits LIV Golf after three years but PGA Tour return uncertainRead moreBut as we prepare to bring in 2026, LIV rumbles along somewhere in the loose consciousness of even dedicated golf followers. That combining of tours no longer feels particularly likely nor needed. In one sense, that is sad; a lot of people made a lot of money out of fracturing an industry as the watching public suffered.Koepka’s case is interesting, primarily because it has to accelerate discussions in the environment he once left behind. As word of the 35-year-old’s LIV departure broke, the PGA Tour could not resist an immediate dig. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best competitive golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness,” read a statement. Receipts have been kept since the 2022 moment in which LIV started coaxing at least some of the PGA Tour’s hottest properties. More recent times have seen the PGA Tour noticeably emboldened, hence the untypical swipe at LIV.As they chuckle in Ponte Vedra, the PGA Tour hierarchy should also be reminding Tiger Woods of the role of his future competition committee, a body formed in slightly vague circumstances this year. Consensus is that Woods will assess how the PGA Tour season flows, how many events take place, field sizes and the dishing out of exemptions. All worthy enough stuff within the golf world but not on a par with: how does the PGA Tour handle any player, such as Koepka, who may want to return from LIV?Future competition means future participants. Woods and his colleagues have to deliver advice to the PGA Tour’s full board on how to handle what has loosely been labelled returning player protocol. Woods, a PGA Tour man to the core, knew this was coming. A test of his big-picture credentials are about to come sharply into view. Woods’s committee is expected to make recommendations before the 2026 Masters.View image in fullscreenBrooks Koepka will be welcomed with open arms at any DP World Tour event next year.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty Images“Not a single player on LIV wants to play on the PGA Tour,” insisted Phil Mickelson in 2023. A bold statement then and a nonsensical one now. Yet there is strong feeling within both sides of this scenario. Some on the PGA Tour, including those who knocked back exorbitant LIV approaches, will feel sore if a golfer is reintroduced without at least the perception of penalty. It would feel wrong if Koepka can have tens of millions of dollars worth of Saudi cake and eat it. What sanction is that?At base level, like all individual sportspeople, golfers are conditioned to be selfish; the PGA Tour’s membership will accept old friends and brief adversaries if they are convinced there is something in it for them. The level-headed people in the PGA Tour will view an opportunity here that exists beyond moving above the acrimony which engulfed this sport for too long. Bringing a Koepka – or a Bryson DeChambeau – back into the fold would be an undoubted win for the old boys. A salient lesson in biding one’s time. LIV might continue but if the talent drain starts to flow the other way,as an entity propped up by Saudi generosityit has very limited scope.In a basic, commercial and competitive sense the PGA Tour would benefit from adding certain names to fields. The rank and file may well complain but Koepka attracts more eyeballs than Sam Burns. Sponsors and investors have a say here too. It is also worth noting that no two cases are identical. Koepka’s is not the same as umpteen others – Mickelson included – who leapt to the LIV side while flinging verbal grenades or legal cases back at whence they came.Koepka has major status until 2028. His LIV deal does not expire until the end of the 2026 season. The tone of his own statement suggested nothing is imminent in respect of a concrete career plan. He will also be welcomed with open arms at any DP World, formerly European, Tour events where he wishes to mark some time. It is just that this five-time major winner suddenly looks poised to become a fascinating test case for golf’s future. The most iconic player of its recent past is front and centre of the conversation.Explore more on these topicsBrooks KoepkaLIV Golf SeriesGolfSaudi Arabia and sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

A Saudi Pro League (SPL) that had been moving away from signing big-name veterans is tempted by a player who will be 34 just as this season ends.Although playerssuch as Cristiano Ronaldoand Karim Benzema have been successes on and off the pitch, albeit incredibly expensive ones, the powers that be don’t want the SPL to be regarded as a retirement league in the sun for stars whose powers are waning. But Salah is different, the attraction intensified by the fact that he is the biggest-name player in the Arab world.Mohamed Salah hits late Afcon winner for Egypt to break brave Zimbabwe at the lastRead moreThis is a direction that many in the league want to move towards as it searches for an enduring identity on the global stage. Is the goal to become a rival to the Premier League, or perhaps to try to take second place behind England’s top tier in the marketplace? Or is there a different direction, now the initial wave of excitement and interest has tailed off?China found a decade ago that suddenly signing famous players guarantees short-term headlines butBeijing’s boom didn’t last long enoughto think about what would come next. Players such as Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba were back in Europe within months.Yet in Saudi Arabia, despite the headlines of impending doomwhen Jordan Henderson left earlyinto his Al-Ettifaq stint and Neymar’s injury-hit spell at Al-Hilal, the stars have largely stayed. Benzema, N’Golo Kanté, Sadio Mané, Riyad Mahrez and others are in their third seasons – Ronaldo, the face of it all, is in his fourth. Time is ticking for many of these in terms of contracts, and, well, time.View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson in action for Brentford. The midfielder left Liverpool for Saudi Arabia but stayed only six months.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesThere has been a noticeable move away from signing the veterans, with clubs still shopping in Europe but usually for those in their prime, such as last summer’s signings of Mateo Retegui, Darwin Núñez and Theo Hernández. There have also been many younger additions, such as Nathan Zézé and Enzo Millot. If these can be developed and sold on for profit, so much the better. Being regarded as a decent alternative to Europe for young global talent may not sound especially glamorous or exciting, but it is something no other league has managed.Salah would, however, be a big boost. The SPL is popular in the Arab world but the Liverpool forward’s arrival would take it to a new level. Players such as Mahrez and Yassine Bounou are there and the recent Fifa Arab Cup (the 16-team tournament in Qatar went almost unnoticed internationally but attracted an impressive average attendance of more than 38,000), showed there is plenty of passion and no small amount of talent. There will be at least seven Arab teams – eight if Iraq win their playoff – at the 2026 World Cup. Becoming a go-to league for Africa, which has happened to an extent, and Asia, which hasn’t, is also an obvious step. Signing an Indonesian player, for example, adds millions to social media accounts, and there is always the tantalising prospect of finding the first Indian or Chinese breakout star.Brendan Rodgers confirmed as head coach of Saudi Pro League club Al-QadsiahRead moreThat would be welcomed in Riyadh. Maintaining the early international interest was always going to be a challenge but this season has been especially tough. Despite the 2025-26 season kicking off in August, teams have played nine league games, compared with 17 by English teams. The international windows were bigger deals for Saudi Arabia because the national team had playoffs to qualify for the World Cup, which were won, just. Then came a longer stop for the Arab Cup. The league restarts on Thursday, the first action for more than a month.Global broadcasters – the league said it had 37 media rights deals in place for this season, with matches available in more than 180 markets – have become increasingly frustrated, trying to build a loyal audience for a product that comes in fits and bursts, trying to build a narrative for clubs and players that have barely appeared. One told the Guardian that this season was almost a write-off with viewers having so many other options available.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema joins Al-Ittihad in June 2023. He is one of the top-name recruits from Europe who is now in his third season in Saudi Arabia.Photograph: APLeague officials in Riyadh are going to have to find a way to ensure that the domestic competition does not play such a clear second fiddle to the national team. Otherwise, becoming a competition of global stature is going to be next to impossible whatever Gianni Infantino says. The Fifa president told Saudi media this week that he believes the league is on track to become one of the top three in the world.Salah would add some immediate sparkle, but his greater value comes in what he could bring to the Arab world in the longer term. This is assuming, of course,that he wants to leave Liverpool, the club want to sell and that he wants to go to Saudi Arabia – all sizeable “ifs”. If it does happen, it will be more important as a capture of a still-glittering Arab legend than of an ageing English Premier League one.Explore more on these topicsSaudi Pro LeagueAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Africa Cup of NationsMohamed SalahSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United host Newcastle in Boxing Day’s only Premier League fixture and Amorim was asked how he couldcompensate for Fernandes’s absencewhen the 31-year-old’s deputy, Kobbie Mainoo, is also injured.Amorim warns against panic buying after Fernandes joins Manchester United injury listRead more“It is impossible to replace Bruno but I said that this morning to the team – [that] we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, which is a lot of people need to step up,” the head coach said. “It is not just the creation. Every set piece he is the guy who is organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and understand we cannot rely on one player for everything.”Amorim also pointed to Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away with Cameroon and Ivory Coast respectively at the Africa Cup of Nations. “Sometimes we rely on Bruno for organisation and the creation. We have lost Bruno on set pieces, Bryan and Amad on set pieces, so this is massive for the team. He understands every position on the field, he pays attention to every detail. Every set piece when you have a substitution he is always the guy telling the other guys where they should be.“But that is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], Luke Shaw, all these guys. We need to step up to have more leaders in the group because this can happen to Bruno. It is not usual but this can happen so it is a big opportunity for the other guys. It is an opportunity for other players to step up and to show the leadership that we need.”Amorim was asked when Fernandes and Mainoo, who has a calf problem, may be available. He said: “Not for this game. They are recovering. I don’t think that is going to take a lot of time. I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno. I don’t want to say [how long for Fernandes]. I have an idea but let’s see.”At Villa Park Jack Fletcher – son of the former United midfielder Darren – made his debut on 73 minutes. Amorim suggested the 18-year-old midfielder was an option to cover for Fernandes and Mainoo. He said: “We have other players, we need to maybe try to see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that is why when we have this opportunity we have to give space to Jack and the other ones. We will find solutions.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

He then saved from Awad again before Abdel Raouf fired over with Sudan pushing for a way back into the game.However, their hopes suffered a significant blow six minutes before the break when the midfielder Salah Adel was dismissed for a second bookable offence after a challenge on Manchester City’s Rayan Aït-Nouri.Monged was beaten for a second time with 61 minutes gone when Mahrez accepted Mohamed Amoura’s fine pass and stepped inside the defender Mustafa Karshoum before finding the back of the net. The substitute Ibrahim Maza completed the scoring with his first senior international goal from Baghdad Bounedjah’s knock-down five minutes from time.Earlier in the day, Edmond Tapsoba headedBurkina Fasotoa dramatic 2-1 victoryagainst 10-manEquatorial Guineaas they struck twice in stoppage time to snatch the points.The Stallions dominated the first half of the opening Group E encounter at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, with Sunderland’s Bertrand Traoré and Brentford’s Dango Ouattara causing problems down the flanks, but ultimately had nothing to show for their efforts at the break.Equatorial Guinea’s problems mounted within five minutes of the restart when the defender Basilio Ndong was dismissed after a review of his clumsy challenge on Bertrand Traoré. Jesús Owono, theEquatorial Guineagoalkeeper, had to save from Ouattara after he had been played in by Gustavo Sangaré.Lassina Traoré, on as a substitute, had a 71st-minute strike ruled out for offside asBurkina Fasopiled on the pressure, but Marvin Anieboh put their opponents ahead against the run of play with a firm header from Carlos Akapo’s 85th-minute corner.However, there was a sting in the tail when Georgi Minoungou, who had also come off the bench, levelled five minutes into added time after Ouattara had carved his way into the box. Tapsoba then headed home the winner three minutes later after Owono had palmed away Cyriaque Irié’s cross.Côte d’Ivoire, the holders, squandered a number of chances but Amad Diallo’s goal early in the second half was enough to beatMozambique1-0.

Mozambique brought on the winger Dominguez as a second-half substitute at the age of 42 years, one month and six days, becoming the oldest outfield player in tournament history, behind only the former Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary, who was 44 when he played in the 2017 final.Mozambique are still to win a match at the finals, stretching back to their tournament debut in 1986.

After the England captain, Leah Williamson, and herArsenalteammate Steph Catley visited the previous week, rumours have been spreading that there could be some more very special guests arriving in the buildup to Christmas.“I think there’s a little bit of a rumble,” says Danny Bell, a specialist paediatric physiotherapist in neuro-oncology who works with children recovering from brain tumours. “I can see an Arsenal shirt out there, so that might just be a very big coincidence! They may know the team involved, but I don’t think they know any individuals. So I’m really looking forward to seeing their faces as it dawns on them who is going to be here.”Mikel Arteta admits long-term future at Arsenal dependent on winning silverwareRead moreSure enough, there are gasps of disbelief when Bukayo Saka and – most aptly for this time of year – the three Gabriels (Jesus, Martinelli and Magalhães) emerge wearing bright red Arsenal Christmas jumpers and carrying red sacks stuffed full of presents. Other members of thePremier League leaders’ squadare taking advantage of their first midweek without a fixture since the end of August by visiting charities connected to the club. Eberechi Eze is pictured playing bowls with Ethan Nwaneri at the Arsenal Hub – the home of Arsenal in the Community – while Mikel Merino spars with a boxing class.Arsenal have a long history of supporting Great Ormond Street, having helped to fund a new lung function unit, opened by Arsène Wenger in 2012. Five patients who have been receiving treatment for several years at the world-renowned children’s hospital have gathered in the large and brightly coloured physiotherapy room on the ground floor and are ready to challenge the guests to a few games, their equally starstruck parents watching on. First, the visitors from Arsenal are invited to beat the mark set by their female counterparts in sitting-down volleyball – a task that Saka in particular seems determined to achieve, judging by the way he throws himself around. The England forward was less keen to don deer’s antlers for a game of hoopla, with Martinelli and Jesus gamely stepping up.There are no signs of the groin injury that issidelining Magalhãesas the Brazil defender takes aim, although he is spared having to go in goal for the penalty shootout that finishes the session. Simon, who is wearing a fluorescent yellow Arsenal away shirt, manages to nutmeg Saka with a spot-kick before deftly dispatching his next attempt into the corner with his other foot and performingMartinelli’s new goal celebrationwith a hand over one eye.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson, the Arsenal women and England Lionesses captain, gets into the festive spirit at Great Ormond Street.Photograph: Anya Broido/Great Ormond Street Hospital“To arrange all this for the children is unbelievable – this is something he is never going to forget,” says Simon’s mother, Fatima Allard. “Simon has been in and out of the hospital since he was born and has just had a really big operation. He is obsessed with football and he just loves being able to play sport. It is so important for his mental health.”Depending on the severity of their illness, children are encouraged to begin two to three hours of physiotherapy a week as soon as possible after surgery. That can include opportunities to play sports such as football and tennis in the state-of-the-art gym stacked with equipment, and access to their own swimming pool.‘Un club d’ici’: FC Supra turns to a Bilbao-style model to keep Québec talent at homeRead more“The biggest thing we do is push the idea that physical activity is something that young people with health conditions can and should do,” says Bell. “There’s perhaps a little bit of a stigma around a child who is ill. ‘We need to wrap them up in cotton wool and they can’t leave the hospital.’ Well, no, actually, if we just make sure that they’re OK to do that, absolutely they can go and have a kick around the park with their mates.“We know the psychological benefits social interactions can have for these kids. So I think probably the biggest thing that I try to do is to try and foster a healthy relationship with physical activity. Because if we get that right, the child, as they grow, is going to want to do recreational activity.”Bell cites the example of another patient, Maya, who was diagnosed with a serious brain tumour in April and has just finished her treatment. A big Arsenal supporter, sadly she misses this visit because she isn’t feeling her best but she has made significant strides in her rehabilitation by regularly swimming.“She was a little bit apprehensive at first,” Bell says. “I remember she said: ‘I’m a bit tired today, I’m not sure I’m going to be able to do it.’ And then 45 minutes later, we said: ‘Maya, we probably have to get out now …’”View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus (left) and Gabriel Magalhães bring a smile to a girl and her mother at Great Ormond Street.Photograph: Anya Broido/Great Ormond Street HospitalOn the ward, Simon has just surprised his friend by FaceTiming them with Saka and Martinelli standing next to his bed. “Please do the celebration if you score against Everton on Saturday,” he says to the Brazilian.“Connecting with our local community and supporters brings me so much joy and really puts things into perspective,” says Martinelli, who didn’t find the net in Arsenal’s 1-0 win but says the visit has given them motivation for the rest of the season.“They fuel us and give us inspiration. We are the same family and spending time with supporters makes you realise how special the connection is. It’s difficult to see people going through a tough time in hospital, but hopefully our visits bring some joy. The staff here are incredible as well. They bring so much energy and positivity and make every day feel as special as they can.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It comes as their Ashes campaign threatens to fully unravel in response to a guaranteed series defeat and allegations of excessive drinking during a mid-tour break in Noosa.Sitting 3-0 down going into the Boxing Day Test, England have been hit by reports that their downtime in between the defeats in Brisbane and Adelaide wasakin to a “stag do”. The emergence of footage appearing to show Ben Duckett drunk and slurring his words on a night out has heightened things.Wounded England must salvage more than pride in MCG Boxing Day Ashes TestRead moreThe video, taken by an English traveller called “Sam” and posted on social media, has not cost Duckett his place albeit England have made changes to their XI for the fourth Test. Jofra Archer’s tour is over with a side strain, Ollie Pope has been dropped, with Jacob Bethell and Gus Atkinson coming in.Whether these tweaks can change the direction of this failed tour remains to be seen. Stokes declined to comment on the specifics in Noosa – an internal review is being undertaken – but admitted he faces a battle to lift a side that is dealing with a wave of criticism.“My main concern right now is my players,” said Stokes. “The welfare of everyone in there, and some certain individuals as well, is the most important thing to me right now – to get them into the best possible state to try and perform for their country and for the remainder of this trip.”Quick GuideEngland XI for fourth Ashes TestShowZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Will Jacks, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Visibly emotional in his pre-match press conference, Stokes gave a rare nod to his own experiences in the spotlight, most likely the Bristol street fight in 2017 that eventually saw him cleared of affray in court.The 34-year-old also took time out of the game in 2021 after suffering panic attacks triggered by the fallout from that episode and the death of his father.Stokes: “This kind of stuff is very … I don’t know if close to me is the right wording, but I have first-hand experience of how this can affect people.“It’s never a nice place to be in when not only the media world, but also the social media world, is just piling on top of you. You don’t really have a leg to stand on when you have lost three games in a huge series like this. When you’re winning, everything’s great. When you’re losing, it’s not.View image in fullscreenBen Duckett (right) speaks to Rob Key before the fourth Test in Melbourne.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images“Just in this moment right now, I think a little bit of empathy from everyone would be not too hard to think about, if that makes sense.”On Duckett, averaging 16 in this series and part of a faltering top three that is at least refreshed by Bethell’s inclusion, Stokes said: “He’s an incredibly influential person within this group. But he knows that he’s got the support of myself and the other guys around him as well.“I’ve had some pretty good times over my career. I’ve also had some pretty tough times. This is probably the toughest time right now as an England captain that I’ll have. I ain’t going to run away from it.”While there is broader discussion to be had over alcohol consumption and its compatibility with international sport, England’s four-night break on the Sunshine Coast sits low onthe list of reasons as to why they are 3-0 down.Nevertheless, the episode does feel emblematic of a campaign that began with optimism but has since malfunctioned through a combination of poor preparation off the field and poor decision-making on it.Archer’s injury simply represents another blow. Picked up by scan on Tuesday and set to cause him to fly home next week, it now has him facing a race to be fit for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka which starts in February.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamCricketBen StokesnewsShareReuse this content"

And it is only possible due to Carey’s talent with the gloves.Ahead of the Boxing Day Test, Boland said the tweak has been an adjustment for him and something of a blow to his ego, given he is one of the best pacemen in the country and typically bowls close to 140km/h.“Because I’ve never really had it before, I just didn’t really feel comfortable with it,” he said. “I know everyone wants to be a ‘fast’ bowler, and you don’t really like to see the keeper up to the stumps, but I’ve seen over the last month how effective it is and how still I can keep their batter by Alex being up to the stumps.”View image in fullscreenAlex Carey whips the bails off in Adelaide.Photograph: Nigel Owen/Action Plus/ShutterstockCoach Andrew McDonald first raised the possibility of using the tactic with Boland before the last Ashes, but it has taken more than two years for it to fully come to fruition. “Speaking on the phone, he said just get your head around bowling with the keeper up to the stumps because the batters like to move around the crease a lot and if we can get them camped where you want them to be, at least you know where you’re going to be, the length of the want to bowl,” he said.Carey revealed after the Brisbane Test he does not practise the technique given the danger involved, but it has proven an ace up the Australians’ sleeve in countering England’s aggression.Boland was targeted during the 2023 Ashes, and said they “came hard” at him during the first innings of the first Test in Perth, where he was wicketless in 10 first-innings overs that went for more than six runs apiece.English cricket meets Spinal Tap as Rob Key delivers latest Ashes autopsy | Barney RonayRead more“In the past when I’ve had the keeper up at the back, I haven’t felt that comfortable and you end up bowling a little bit fuller, but I’ve got full trust in Cares [Carey] that if I hit my normal length and if the ball does go above the stumps, he’s got amazing hands and has been really keeping the pressure on the English batters,” he said.Captain Pat Cummins and stand-in Steve Smith have been happy to let the pair dictate when and when not to deploy the approach.“The best thing about that is we’d speak every couple of overs, or every over before the start of it, if he’s feeling that it’s better off being back, then I trust him,” Boland said. “If he’s like, ‘nah, I want to come up, I think we can trap him on the crease’ then I’ll back his judgment.”Boland has overcome a hip complaint and is in line to play at the MCG on Boxing Day, while Carey’s glovework this summer has been accompanied by brilliance with the bat. His 267 runs are behind only Travis Head’s 379 for the series.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Imran Ahmed gave evidence to the select committee’s inquiry into social media, algorithms and harmful content, and he was an articulate advocate for greater regulation and accountability.“Banning him won’t shut down the debate, too many people are being harmed by the spread of digital hate.”Her comments came after Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The CCDH has previously incurred the wrath of Musk over its reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took over the platform. Musktried unsuccessfullyto sue the organisation last year, before calling it a “criminal organisation”.Visa ban for European critics of online harm is first shot in US free speech warRead moreThe X owner has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation. And he has railed against the EU’s Digital Services Act, which Breton helped spearhead, and under which Xwas hitwith a €120m (£105m) fine for what the EU called the deceptive design of its blue tick system for verifying users.Melford is UK-based, while Ahmed, whose organisation once employed Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, as a director, lives in Washington DC with his family.A spokesperson for GDI called the sanctions “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship”. They added: “The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful and un-American.”Ahmed has been approached for comment.A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”That response contrasted, however, with the more combative stance taken by the French government and the European Commission.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the measures “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty”. The commission said in a statement it “strongly condemns” the actions of the Trump administration.Jonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Times Radio: “[This] will send a really massive chilling effect on everyone else who’s discussing the subject [internet regulation] at the moment.”Campaigners in the UK warned the British government was likely to be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.Ava Lee, the executive director of People Vs Big Tech, said: “The Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Europeans trying to uphold the rule of law when it comes to big tech. With the Online Safety Act (OSA), the UK is likely to be next in the firing line.”The Trump administration has previously flagged its concerns about the OSA. This year a group of officials from the state department metOfcom, the regulator charged with overseeing the act, and are understood to have raised concerns that the act will risk infringing free speech.Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK’s House of Lords and a prominent online safety campaigner, said Rubio’s comments on the visa bans were an “outrage”.“The US tech sector, backed by the US administration, is attempting to undermine European laws and values,” she said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Across the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, sales were up by 50% on last year.The service works by letting brands sell directly inside TikTok through videos and livestreams with embedded links to items for sale, as well as through a separate shop tab on their profiles.A brand can post its own content and link to products itself, or allow influencers to promote them using affiliate links. Checkout happens without having to leave the app, and money is split after a sale between TikTok, the seller and any creator who helped drive it.View image in fullscreenTikTok Shop launched in the UK in 2021.Illustration: TikTokSainsbury’s, one of the first major supermarkets to launch on the platform, has found success with its Tu Christmas pyjamas. A sponsored collaboration with the influencer Rachel Spicer generated 6.6m views, with the pyjamas selling out in under a week.M&S has also enjoyed strong results from TikTok Shop livestreams with links to featured items, with one recent feed attracting 260,000 viewers and generating sales of about one item every 30 seconds.Small businesses are using it to try to increase their reach, especially now that AI ismaking it more tricky to show up in search results. The Fat Butcher, an online meat delivery service based in Newcastle, is selling fresh turkeys on the platform for the first time this year.According to Danielle Dullaghan, the social strategy director at the global marketing agency Iris, “beauty brands in particular are seeing strong commercial returns”.She says part of TikTok Shop’s success is the fact “it plays directly into impulse buying behaviour”.The London-based jewellery brand L’ERA, run by Lara Mar and her daughters Talia Mar and Angele Sofia, will generate about £145,000 in revenue through TikTok this year.“It has almost doubled year on year, and many of our online customers originally discovered us via TikTok,” Mar says.The brand relies heavily on live shopping, typically running three three-hour live streams a week, increasing to six during the Black Friday and Christmas periods.TikTok shoppers have shown a willingness to spend, with L’ERA’s largest single order via the platform exceeding £1,400.The business and social media consultant Jules Brim says: “TikTok Shop has exploded and for some small brands it’s been a gamechanger in terms of reach and sales. But what we don’t talk about enough is the cost. It can create a race to the bottom on pricing, put pressure on small businesses to produce constant content, and shift the focus from brand building to chasing trends.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokRetail industrySocial mediaE-commerceDigital mediaShoppingSmall businessnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, those targeted will generally be barred from entering the US, and some may face removal proceedings if already in the country.Rubio did not name those targeted, but under secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of “fomenting censorship of American speech”.The five named were: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index’; and former EU commissioner Breton.The visa bans come after the administration’sNational Security Strategy this monthsaid European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk “civilisational erasure” for the continent.Rogers called Breton – who served as the European Commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024 – “a mastermind” of the DSA.Melford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the organisation “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to “choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarising and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”A spokesperson for GDI called the US action “immoral, unlawful, and un-American” and “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”Most Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don’t necessarily need visas to come into the US. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.With Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsTechnologyEuropean UnionMarco RubioUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both pieces of legislation require social media firms to protect users orface the threat of sizeable fines. Indeed, Elon Musk’s X has been fined €120m (£105m) this month forbreaching the DSA.These acts are prime examples of what US Republicans see as an anti-free speech culture on the other side of the Atlantic.View image in fullscreenThierry Breton is thought to have been a leading figure in bringing through the EU’s Digital Services Act.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyOfcom, the UK’s communications regulator charged with overseeing the OSA, has not been affected by the visa bans announced on Christmas Eve, but there is an implicit threat in the air. One of those targeted by the move is the former European industry commissioner Thierry Breton, an architect of the DSA. The message is clear: watch out regulators.Trump allies have also targeted Imran Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a US-UK organisation which campaigns against online hate speech. Ahmed was one of the people who received a visa ban on Wednesday. CCDH was the target of an Elon Musk lawsuit in 2023 but the claim was thrown out by a judge last year who said thelegal challenge, which focused on allegations that CCDH accessed data on X illegally, was in fact “about punishing the defendants for their speech”. In a post on X, Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”, described CCDH as a “truly evil organization that just wants to destroy the first amendment under the guise of doing good!”The UK’s OSA remains asubject of White House ire. JD Vance, the US vice-president, has said free speech in the UK is “in retreat”. In July, Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman who has criticised the act, led a delegation of US politicians to discuss the legislation with the Labour government andOfcom.Ofcom is aware it could be in the crosshairs. In May, the state department announced it willblock entry to the USto “foreign nationals who censor Americans”. The watchdog has said it is seeking “clarity” on the planned visa restrictions.Elon Musk, AI and the antichrist: the biggest tech stories of 2025Read moreThe EU and UK have only just got going on implementing their acts and, as the visa ban for Breton shows, opposition is building. In October, Ofcom fined the online forum 4chan £20,000 for breaching the act by failing to respond to a request for a risk assessment. Emboldened by domestic opposition to the OSA, 4chan is suing Ofcom in the US, claiming its enforcement of the OSA violates Americans’ right to freedom of speech.The UK government has said it won’t back down on the OSA, while the X fine signals the EU is determined to enforce its own legislation. There is also an effective non-profit ecosystem – in Europe and the US – campaigning for online safety. These visa bans are just the latest shot in what will be a long-running battle under theTrump administration.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyElon MuskJD VanceOnline abuseInternet safetyRegulatorsFreedom of speechanalysisShareReuse this content"

Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.Over the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardiangames of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!‘I absolutely devoured this gem of a game’“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured thisgemof a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!”Jen Baker“Death Stranding 2is a truemasterpieceof a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.”Simon White“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. ButAvowedgot its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.”Matt Froggatt“Split Fictionis themost funco-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!”Simon Watson“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to theLiesof Puniverse and the DLC,Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.”Tara CooperView image in fullscreen‘It has been my favourite game for years’ … Ghost of Yōtei released in October 2025.Photograph: Sony Interactive Entertainment“Myfavouritegame of the year has been my favourite for years:Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.”Gareth Jones“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).”Thomas Jones“The top VR game of 2025 has to beGhost Townby FireproofGames. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.”Martina Stender“For me, it has to beMonsterTrain 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!”Nell Guy“Maybe it’s recency bias, butArc Raidershas come out of nowhere and completelytaken overmy gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.”Brett BatesView image in fullscreen‘A well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way’ … Silvano Cardin on Chicory: A Colorful Tale.Photograph: Chicory“One game I played this year will stay with me for life:Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.”Silvano Cardin“Absolum.I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!”Asher Alexander“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had meobsessedlikeBlue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.”Marie-Jill Landry“Kaizen Game Works’Promise Mascot Agencyis a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.”Paul Jones“My favourite game of the year is, very much,Dispatch– and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!”Chris Cunliffe“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2isoutstandingin all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.”Bob WatkinsWhat to clickKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this ChristmasTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆Call of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memoriesQuestion BlockView image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?You know what to do: email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an old home movie showing a boy and a girl on Christmas morning eagerly unwrapping a present that turns out to be an N64 console – the boy is, to put it mildly, extremely pleased. It’s a scene a lot of us who play games will recognise: the excitement and anticipation provided by that big console-sized parcel, or the little DVD-shaped package that could be the latest Super Mario adventure. Although I never got a games machine at Christmas, I remember one year being given Trivial Pursuit on the Commodore 64 and the whole family gathered around the TV to play. It was one of the few times my mum and my sisters showed any interest in the computer, and I loved getting them involved.Veteran designer Rhod Broadbent of Dakko Dakko recalls the Christmas of 1992, when his father, a programmer who had previously looked down on games consoles, bought him Mario Kart and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. “Zelda was completely unknown to me at the time,” he recalls. “I think Dad was probably expecting me to be more excited. But after I had spent the morning in Mario Kart, I plugged in Zelda and everything changed. From the title music, through the intro and into that beautiful initial thunderstorm, everything was so polished and smooth and unlike the video games I’d played before. It didn’t leave the cartridge slot for weeks. I remember that Christmas morning like it was yesterday …”For Anna Hollinrake, founder of Electric Saint, Christmas gaming was an opportunity for sweet revenge. “As a competitive child with a guitarist father, I chose to learn the violin aged six so I could be better than him at something. However, he picked up my violin and immediately smashed out a few pieces way above my level. Years later, Christmas morning 2007, I unwrapped Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.

Who’s the musician now?!”View image in fullscreenRockers’ revenge … Guitar Hero III.Photograph: RedOctaneThe memories don’t always end so happily. Sam Barlow, creator ofHer StoryandImmortality, recalls when he and his brother used to wait until everyone was in bed on Christmas Eve before sneakily squeezing and shaking all their presents. “One year my brother fishes out a thick rectangular present – exactly the shape of a Super Nintendo game box. We were so excited, we got very little sleep thinking about what game it could be. Skip to the morning, he carefully peels open the wrapping, teasing out the reveal … only to discover a Ghostbusters card game. His utter disappointment was the funniest thing I’ve seen. To this day in our family, ‘Ghostbusters card game’ is used as shorthand for those occasions when life fails to meet our expectations.”But there were also times when disappointment turned to delight. Video game writer Alex Donaldson at Eurogamer recalls being desperate for a PC, but his parents couldn’t afford it so got him a Sega Mega Drive instead. “I quickly set it up and loaded the MegaGamescompilation cart,” he says. “Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi … Everything was so immediate, so visceral. This wasn’t a PC, it wasbetter. I always remember that feeling – there is a beautiful simplicity to the console.”View image in fullscreen‘So immediate, so visceral’ … Streets of Rage on the Sega Genesis Mega Drive.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamySome of us have found ways to keep treasured Christmas gaming experiences alive. I can dig out Singstar and relive festive karaoke sessions of old, while Lucy Blundell of Kinmoku Games (One Night Stand, Videoverse) has a collection of vintage consoles to call upon. “Last Christmas morning, my husband and I snuggled on the beanbags with our dog, plugged in our Japanese Sega Saturn and played Christmas NiGHTS,” she says. “Afterwards, we booted up the Nintendo 64 – the very same console I received for Christmas back in 1999 – and played my favourite Christmas games: Diddy Kong Racing’s winter levels and Super Mario 64, which I bought on Boxing Day in 1999. Spending a quiet Christmas together and sharing our favourite childhood games was a real festive treat!”Last week, I asked on BlueSky for people’s Christmas gaming memories, and what really touched me was how many recalled being given secondhand machines, with bundles of games – and being delighted. A Commodore 128, a Nintendo Wii … the thrill was in having so many new experiences to try, not just the one game that comes with a new console. Christmas for a gamer isn’t always about the flashiest, newest, most expensive things. It can be a few hours of shared fun with whatever machine you have to hand.Please do share your own memories of Christmas gaming in the comments section!Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesThe Legend of ZeldaMario KartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump doesn’t have the right answerSusi Geiger and Théo BourgeronAmericans are not paying high prices because of other western countries. Pharmaceutical companies are to blameWed 24 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 13.26 ESTShareWhenDonald Trumpspoke about drug prices on 19 December, he struck a familiar note. Americans, he said, were paying far too much for medicines – and it was everyone else’s fault.There would be no talk of reining in private insurers or pharmaceutical profits. Instead, Trump blamed foreign governments for getting a better deal. Countries like France, Germany and Japan, he argued, were piggybacking on the United States by keeping their drug prices low.Later that day, at a rally in North Carolina, he performed an imaginary showdown with Emmanuel Macron. Trump claimed he had told the French president that France would have to double or triple its drug prices – and that France would ultimately give in. Thanks to this tough approach, Trump promised to cut US drug prices “by 700%”, a figure so nonsensical it barely merits scrutiny.Trump is right about one thing: the US system is a public health failure. Drug prices are eye-wateringly high. Millions of Americans struggle to afford essential medicines such as insulin. Private insurers add costs without improving access. The result is a country that spends more on healthcare than anyone else, yet has lower life expectancy than many poorer nations.But Trump’s explanation is wrong. Americans are not paying high prices so that European, Canadian, South Korean and Japanese citizens can enjoy cheap medicines. They are paying high prices because pharmaceutical companies charge what they can get away with.Other countries’ patients and their governments do pay less than Americans, but they hardly get medicines for free. Prices for new drugs are high and rising everywhere. The real winners are the shareholders of multinational pharmaceutical companies who have enjoyed extraordinary profits, dividends and share buybacks over the past two decades –more than $1,500bn between 2000 and 2018. A majority of them are US-owned. In 2024, US corporations made49% of the top 20 big pharma revenue.This matters because Trump’s outburst points to something bigger than campaign rhetoric. The United States is now turning against a global pharmaceutical system it helped to create.That system took shape in the 1990s, when rich countries pushed tough intellectual property rules through global trade agreements, especially the infamous 1994 Trips agreement. Patent rules were strengthened and harmonized worldwide, with devastating effects on many patients in countries dependent on generic manufacturing. The new patent rules overwhelmingly benefited large pharmaceutical firms based in the US, Europe and Japan.In return, through parallel trade agreements, poorer countries were offered access to rich markets for their manufactured goods and were drawn into global supply chains. The system delivered huge profits for pharmaceutical investors – but also restricted access to medicines and pushed prices ever higher.Today, that model is under strain. Pharmaceutical companies are spending a smaller share of their revenues on research, for innovations that are often judged less innovative by experts, while paying more out to investors. In 2024, the US pharma giant Pfizerspent just 18% of its revenue on internal research and development– while 27% went to shareholders through dividends and debt repayment. Innovation has slowed. Breakthroughs that transform public health are rarer, while ultra-expensive treatments for small groups of patients are becoming the norm.At the same time, countries outside the old system are catching up. China, for example, has built a large state-backed pharmaceutical industry and now produces vaccines and medicines without relying on western patents. Between 2021 and 2022, Chinese corporations alone were able to produce3.4bn Covid-19 vaccine doses, 28% of all doses produced at the time. Even countries such as Cuba were quick to develop their own vaccines through a state-controlled biotech ecosystem.From Washington’s point of view, the problem is that profits may have peaked. When US industries face that kind of pressure, they tend to look for someone else to pay. Trump’s answer is to target allies rather than companies.Instead of challenging pharmaceutical power at home, he wants to force European and Asian allies to pay more for US drugs, while pushing down prices for US citizens. It is a familiar strategy: use economic pressure on partners who depend on US military protection and have limited room to resist.This could leave governments in Europe and Japan in an awkward position. Their domestic pharmaceutical firms have long argued for higher domestic prices, closer to US levels. Private insurers would probably not object. But voters would – as public healthcare systems would quickly be unable to handle even more elevated price levels.Trump presents his plan as standing up for American patients. In reality, it protects the same corporate interests that made medicines unaffordable in the first place – while exporting the damage to others.Susi Geiger and Théo Bourgeron are the authors ofPeak Pharma: Toward a New Political Economy of Health(Oxford University Press)Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryOpinionUS healthcareDonald TrumpTrump administrationMedical researchHealthHealth insurancecommentShareReuse this content"

It will come only by building a more equal AustraliaBrad ChilcottWealth is shifting upwards, basic universal services are outsourced and  improving the lives of the Australians doing it toughest is being ignored. So where can we find hope?Wed 24 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 14.02 ESTShareThe Christian scripture “Peace on Earth and goodwill to all” is not only the hope of those who celebrateChristmas, it’s also both the weary longing of those who don’t profit from the war, violence and division that has characterised recent local and global history, and the go-to solution for political and community leaders looking for solutions.In practice, however, “goodwill to those like us and ‘please stay peaceful’ to those who aren’t” may be a more accurate characterisation of our collective experience as wealth shifts inexorably upwards, basic universal services are outsourced – disability support, early education, aged and health care – shifting shareholders into the role of primary beneficiaries, and the corporatisation of not-for-profits has social services providers placing increased market share higher on their priority list than improving the lives of the Australians doing it toughest.It is hard to pursue the vision of “goodwill to all” when the system feels rigged towards “more money and power for them” and you’re struggling to buy Christmas presents for your children, lining up at endless unsuccessful rental inspections, carrying the stress of insecure work or, for others, working long hours while still being unable to pay the mortgage. Even harder when you’re being told – explicitly in the street or implicitly by the media – that you don’t belong and that your vision of a better life for your family may be destroying the country.BoM reveals Christmas Day forecast as nation sweats through extreme heatwaveRead moreLooking for solutions, or seeking to lay blame, there are demands the government ends antisemitism, run another anti-racism campaign and lower migration, rather than looking at the structurally embedded causes of exclusion, disadvantage and growing frustration experienced by a growing number of Australians – from First Nations and migrants through to generations of white Australians who have never known anything but financial distress.It goes without saying that racism, religious extremism and the growing neo-Nazi movement must be combatted through every available means – strengthening hate speech and gun laws, resourcing intelligence agencies and influencing society through cultural engagement – but if we neglect to address the soil in which disaffection, disengagement and resentment grows, peace on Earth and goodwill to all will continue to face global shortages.With economic structural disadvantage as the fertile ground in which disaffection germinates requiring a long process of reform to address, it is essential that now – today – we cease adding fertiliser.Fomenting division is the business model for political leaders searching for a hook – any hook – to attract votes. Let’s be clear – lowering the number of refugees Australia welcomes by a few thousand, or tweaking the skilled migration numbers down a few thousand more will not address the cause of discontent. It is instructive to consider that when our heroes are migrants – whether they be Gout Gout, Usman Khawaja or Ahmed al-Ahmed – there is almost never a resultant positive conversation about the value of migration. Rarely do we maturely discuss the negative impact for all Australians should skilled migrants collectively choose a more welcoming nation to contribute their skills to and cause our already dire workforce shortages across dozens of industries to deepen, or the system barriers that prevent those already here from accessing the health, education, employment and social services that would enhance their lives, increase belonging and build stronger communities.Religious radicalism is found in every religion, crime in every culture and racism in every ethnicity. Extremism percolates in social, economic and cultural inequality. If we are to eradicate extremism, as the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has committed us to, those politicians seeking to profit from fear and division will need to redirect their energy towards creating an Australia where inequality and exclusion are likewise eliminated – goodwill for all people, not only those they can distract from the root causes of their disaffection through distributing blame away from the systems that entrench economic disadvantage and social division.This Christmas, let’s ban the world’s most miserable gift-giving game | Dave SchillingRead moreSo, where can hope be found?Throughout Hanukah, my friend, and Orthodox Jewish rabbi, Gabi Kaltmann was leading the Pillars of Light festival in Melbourne’s Federation Square, which people of all faiths and no faith attended. At a vigil the day after the Bondi murders, Rabbi Jeffrey Kamins and the Australian National Imams Council’s Bilal Raufembraced in solidarity. Turbans 4 Australia, the charity led by Sikh Local Hero Australian of the Year Amar Singh, handed out water and food to anyone who needed sustenance.This is what “goodwill to all” looks like in action. It is the Australia that could be, and – if you look away from your social media feed – already is. Peace on Earth – or in our community – won’t come from the politics of deficit and envy, nor from diverting our attention from the causes of exclusion and inequality by laying blame on its victims. If we are to find hope in our mourning, and in a future without fear, it will be found in our collective commitment to build an Australia where socially, economically and culturally everyone is equally welcome to belong, contribute and thrive.Brad Chilcott is the founder of Welcoming Australia.

Would that happen now?Nell FrizzellI’ve taken in refugees from time to time, and formed ties that have lasted to this day. Instead of demonising people, we could try sharing our lives with themWed 24 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 09.07 ESTShareThere is one Christmas story from when my father first arrived in the UK, 43 years ago, that can still make me howl with laughter. It was a cold winter and my dad had been gripped by the idea of roasting chestnuts. He had grown up in the southern hemisphere, in a former British colony, so despite the fact that his Christmases were hot – spent in shorts and flip-flops – he had been surrounded by images of snowy churches, robin redbreasts, holly, ivy and, yes, chestnuts roasting on an open fire.And so, he headed out to Clapham Common in south London to collect conkers. They were chestnuts, after all. Horse chestnuts but hey, that’s still a chestnut. Or so he thought. And so, that evening when his British friends arrived at the house where he was staying, they were greeted by the suspiciously acrid smell of about 30 conkers, baking away in the little gas oven, plus a wild-haired man in his 20s primed to chomp into his tray of baked poison.View image in fullscreenBill Frizzell in 1981. He was a builder’s labourer at the time.Photograph: Bill FrizzellHopefully you all know already that unlike sweet chestnuts, horse chestnuts are, in fact, incredibly poisonous. Conkers are great for hitting against each other on bits of string. But roast them and eat them, and you could be looking at least a couple of nights in hospital. This story reminds me of two things. First, to never trust anything my father produces for dinner, and second, that everyone arriving in a new country needs friends. They need a home and they need a community. For company, for shelter, for a sense of belonging. But also, apparently, to stop them eating spiky-shelled poisonous nuts gathered from Clapham Common.I wonder what Shabana Mahmood would make of this idea. The home secretary seems to have a brutal, if not poisonous attitude to those reaching Britain seeking education, seeking the opportunity to work, and build a community and, in the case of many refugees, seeking to literally save their own lives. I am not traditionally a Labour voter and I am ashamed to have lent my vote to a government that could even countenance these ideas:seizing the jewelleryof desperate asylum seekers;refusing people citizenshipfor 20 years; continuing to deny refugees the right to paid work.Like many across the UK, I have hosted several asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants, through the brilliant Refugees at Home organisation. While my son was between the ages of three and seven, we offered our home as emergency accommodation to young men from Sudan and Afghanistan. Because we have a small house and no actual spare room, we are only allowed to host for up to two weeks at a time, but when the alternative may be sleeping on the street, a sofa bed in the front room will do.The young men who have stayed with us have played football with my son, watched soap operas with us on the sofa, walked in the park and texted their friends and drunk a glass of milk with us at breakfast. They have often needed no more than a bed to sleep in, perhaps a meal or occasional cups of coffee, and the chance to do a single load of washing. The sort of things you would offer to anyone staying for a few nights at your house. Our first guest, who I will call G, still sends his love to my mother every time we speak. Once he passed his exams, he bought my baby a soft white babygrow to sleep in. He texts me to wish me a happy Eid and talks to my husband about Arsenal. He was a guest at my wedding and helped me weed my allotment and waves from his bike whenever I see him cycling through town.Children are taught from the first moment they pick up a wooden block at a playgroup that we are supposed to share. Sharing is what makes us successful as a species. Sharing is what makes us survive. Sharing is as innate to the human condition as singing and walking and eating. So I am grateful that my children are growing up seeing how easy, how important and how nice it is to share. I am glad that they have learned, at my knee, that if you have food in your fridge and a washing machine and radiators, you can share them with people who do not.When my baby no longer cries in the night, I will open my home to refugees again. It might mean cooking an extra potato or buying a few more tins of beans; but that is a very small sacrifice in the scheme of things. If these guests come to us in winter, they may well be forced to sit at the table and admire my children’s collection of sticks, and precious rocks and shining conkers. And I will think of my father, sun-baked, scruffy and far from home, stalking the wilds of Clapham Common, saved from a dinner of roasted aesculin by people who knew the importance of making someone feel at home.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

I hope so, or I’m in troubleRavi HolyThe great Santa deception arguably breaches the ninth commandment (‘Thou shalt not bear false witness’). I think God would cut us some slackWed 24 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 11.23 ESTShareWhen I was first ordained, an older priest gave me three commandments for a successful ministry: one, try not to upset the flower ladies; two, don’t preach pacifism on Remembrance Sunday; and, three – and most important – never tell children that Santa isn’t real.If only someone had had that talk with RevDr Paul Chamberlain, who last Christmas reduced a classroom full of year 6 children to tears bytelling them the truth: “It’s your mum and dad.” (I hope that doesn’t come as a shock to any of you.)He has since apologised and, in his defence, he’d assumed that at their age they would have worked that out already. But I know from my own experience both that some children still believe for longer than others and how traumatic it is for them when their illusion is finally shattered.In my son’s case, it was his evil twin sister who burst the bubble. They were only nine but she had some older friends, one of whom had given the game away to her – although she wasn’t bothered because she liked the idea of knowing something that her brother didn’t.So she came home and told him that if they searched the house, they’d probably find everything they’d asked for in their letters to Santa stashed in a cupboard somewhere – which they did.I heard the scream from downstairs and rushed up to see what was wrong. My distraught son turned to me with tears in his eyes, still hoping against hope for an alternative explanation, but in the split-second that I paused, trying to think of one, he knew. “But I don’t understand,” he sobbed in a scene reminiscent of The Truman Show. “It’s not just you and Mum that have lied to me. It’s my teachers and even people on the telly.”So that’s why some Christians have a problem with the whole Santa thing: it arguably breaches the ninth commandment (about lying) but that seems very Scrooge-like to me. Given all the horror there is in the world and how hard adult life can be, what could possibly be wrong with a little childhood magic?I recently had the privilege of being Santa at my local school’sChristmasfete and it really was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.The grotto that the PTA had put together was worthy of John Lewis (other department stores are available) and my costume was so good that even some of my adult parishioners didn’t recognise me. But I was keenly aware that, because these children really believed that they were actually meeting Father Christmas, I also needed to deliver the goods (no pun intended) in terms of my performance.So I tried to channel the late great Richard Attenborough, who had played the same role so perfectly in the 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street. However, for some reason, I ended up sounding more like King Charles: “Howlovelyto see you.Docome in. I’m Santa.” My daughter – now 22 and no longer evil – was kind enough to say that I was giving off Albus Dumbledore vibes.View image in fullscreen‘I tried to channel Richard Attenborough in the 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street, but I ended up sounding more like King Charles.’Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarBut what I wanted to do was incarnate pure unconditional love and welcome. To make myself the kindest, friendliest, safest being imaginable – and, from the way the children reacted, I think I did a reasonable job. What I wasn’t prepared for was the impact that all this would have onme. Yes, it was magical for the kids to be ushered into the grotto by one of my elves and meet The Man Himself, but to see the absolute joy on their little faces, to grasp the extent of their perfect innocence was almost overwhelming. A religious experience, even.So, there is no doubt in my mind that this was a Holy Thing of which God approves. Jesus famously said, “Let the little children come to me. Do not stop them” and, while Santa isn’t Jesus – the point that the Reverend Chamberlain was presumably trying to make – both are supposed to be manifestations of ultimate goodness. Obviously, the former was created by human beings – or indeed, the Coca-Cola company – and the latter, Christians believe, was sent by God but both bring joy and hope to millions.The only thing I do feel slightly guilty about is the dreadful sexism of it all: since Santa is male, only men get to experience what I did in that grotto. How unfair is that? Women probably do most of the work at Christmas, buying all the presents and no doubt making the dinner as well and then amanwaltzes in and steals all the glory. Typical.Fortunately, Jesus was not that kind of man and, far from seeking glory, he embraced ordinariness by being born in a stable and, through his teaching and, supremely, his death showed us that true love involves sacrifice and serving others. But that’s Easter so, meanwhile, have a great Christmas.Ravi Holy is rector of the United Wye Benefice in Canterbury, Kent, and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinionChildrenChristianityReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Indeed, this new cultural ritual is now a social media staple that sweeps across our feeds over the festive period. We post about intergenerational debates on politics; stomaching “wokeness” jokes; and the now near-mythical “uncle” character – the older male holding court at the table – exemplified by tweets that go something like: “My uncle just went on a 10-minute rant about [insert topic]. The turkey is dry and so is his take.”In these situations, many of us are torn between the impulse to call out harmful speech and our (or more often, our mother’s) longing for family harmony. These micro-yuletide tensions are played out at dinner tables across the country and are indicative of broader cultural and political polarisation. Polarisation is amplified by the social media-driven information silos in which we all now live.This year, rather than suggesting ways to deal with whatever echo chamber your in-laws have found themselves in, I am advocating for a new approach. That is, instead of trying to debate loved ones on the details of their own personal “filter bubble” or “you loop”, it might be better for us to step back from the minutiae and together discuss the technological processes pushing us all down more and more segregated and specific pathways.For context, a “filter bubble” is a concept proposed by the digital activistEli Pariser. He argues that there is no longer a singular internet but rather as many internets as there are users, as algorithms continue their ever-increasing attempt to personalise our online experience and feed us more “relevant” content. This means you could be seeing completely different news, ideas, culture and – arguably – facts from someone sitting next to you on a bus or on your own sofa.Let’s take a minute to reflect on the financial structures at play here: on social media, our time, and our attention, is a product that is sold to advertisers. This process has been labelled the “attention economy” or the “algorithmic economy”. My research has looked at the way in which, through the attention economy, algorithms can allow harm and misinformation to flourish. Because misinformation is often more attention-grabbing than the truth. And harm – or things that hook into our insecurities – might hold us there just that little bit longer. That extra attention, that engagement, is what advertisers are paying for. I’m nowhere near the only one who has researched this. Other researchers have looked at this same phenomenon around a variety of topics:self-harm,violence,pornographyandpolitical radicalisation, to name a few.Even if you are getting your news from reputable mainstream sources, by way of news apps (eg Apple News or Google News), the articles you are fed will probably be on specific topics algorithmically tailored for you. Pariser uses the term “you loop” here, which researchers broadly apply to any algorithmic feed that shapes and ultimately limits the culture and information that we receive. Increasingly, new generations are consuming much less radio or terrestrial TV (which selects a variety of content, arguably, with a relatively balanced view). Instead, with the promise of immediacy, choice and personalisation, we turn to Instagram or TikTok, andOfcomreports that 88% of three– to 17-year-olds use YouTube. But now – even with all of the world’s content at our fingertips – do we actually see much less? Less difference of opinion? Less diverse content?The fear is that this process begins to shape who we are; not just kids, but all of us so-called “grownups”. “You loops” and “filter bubbles” can give way to echo chambers, which function by feeding each person a high dosage of information that confirms a very narrow worldview.There are, of course, many, many different echo chambers peddling different beliefs but employing the same digital processes. It might be your neighbour, who has done away with mainstream news, and is now only receiving information on Telegram; or your cousin, who’s now convinced that the moon landing was faked; or that nice mum at the school gates, who after being diagnosed with breast cancer began to follow a course of natural treatments pushed to her on Instagram instead of chemotherapy – she was a mum of two. And, if you’re willing to open your mind and look at this honestly, you might find that it’s you.There are ways to talk to people, to adults in your life, about these issues. We can step away from the minutiae of the arguments and speak about the broader structures that are facilitating these information pathways. It doesn’t matter if it’s your neighbour, cousin, the mum at school drop, or you (in whatever echo chamber you may have found yourself). What is important is to recognise these structures. And if someone in your life is in an echo chamber, rather than trying to debate them around the actual topic, try to help them step away and see the broader processes at play. In doing so, you can acknowledge your own “you loops”, “filter bubbles” and echo chambers. You can think critically about what you are consuming and encourage those you love to do the same. Together, we can question these technological processes. Together we can game our algorithms. Together we can take back control. Happy holidays.How to recognise an echo chamber, and what you can do about it.A: If everyone and everything that you are interacting with online has the same opinion as you and you only see content that confirms your point of view – and if certain news stories, people and themes come up over and over again – you are probably stuck in an echo chamber.B: If you think you might be in an echo chamber, look for alternative sources of information and other points of view. You don’t necessarily have to agree with them, but it is important to understand that they are there.How to talk to someone in your life who might be in an echo chamberTo recap, disinformation or things that elicit an emotive response are often algorithmically prioritised in the digital space. You can use this information when embarking on such conversations, and then:Be proactive, not reactive.Start conversations organically, rather than in reaction to a comment or event. This will set an objective tone. Make conversations short and often, rather than one big event.Think “big picture”.Focus the conversation on the overarching structures at play,perpetuated by the attention economy. Where possible, inspire agency around these topics by offering information about online processes and then let them do the critical thinking.Focus on the positive.For young people in particular, focus on positive examples, role models and narratives. This is often much more powerful than talking about the negative examples. Talk to older children and teens about what they can be rather than what they can’t.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

I am here to tell you this is totally wrong. There are situations when, yes, it is rude. There are situations when it basically doesn’t matter. But there are also situations when being late is actually the height of good manners and decorum.If you are invited to dinner, especially by a person who you can sense is an inexperienced cook or host, you should endeavour to be late. By at least 10 minutes I would say. But, honestly, if your host is a 25-year-old who has sent you a message saying, “I’m going to try making this :)” and then attached a picture of an elaborate recipe with two separate kinds of molasses, then I would say half an hour is probably best.Their oven gloves will have caught fire and they’ll have had to sort that out. They’ll forget to give themselves time to shower. They will have started a step and realised they’re missing key equipment and then they’ll have directed a piercing scream at the recipe book, and so forth. When you arrive half an hour late they will be so frantically grateful they’ll try to lick you. Just say, “Oh no, that’s fine, no need” if they do.There are other situations too. If you are going on a date with someone who has a huge crush on you, you should arrive 10 minutes late to give them time to calm down and sort themselves out. If you’re meeting a new mum with no baby attached you should be 15 minutes late to give her a rare window of time with her own thoughts or her book. If you’re meeting someone who is too rule abiding at the cinema you should disobey them and arrive after the adverts, to teach them that the meaning of life is to break the rules. Likewise, if you’re taking them to the airport, don’t let them get there three hours early.If you are going to break up with someone who is still in love with you, you should be half an hour late so they remember you as squalid and disorganised instead of perfect. If you are going to collect a beloved pet to rehome, you should be 20 minutes late to give everyone extra time to say goodbye or change their mind.There are many other such instances. You must use your own judgment. But instead of seeing good manners as a set of catch-all rules, my feeling is we should treat them instead as the answer to the question: what does this person truly need from me in this situation?Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsTime managementThe hill I will die onFriendshipDatingcommentShareReuse this content"

And there’s the issue that things may get worse before they get betterWed 24 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 08.52 ESTShareAll governments go through bad patches, when nothing seems to go right and voters turn against them. Often they bounce back from the midterm blues and go on to be comfortably re-elected. That said, Labour’s current unpopularity is in a class of its own. It is not just the scale of its problem, with opinion polls suggesting support for the partyhas almost halved, from 34% to 18% since the 2024 general election. Nor is it simply the speed at which disillusionment with the government has set in, though that too is unprecedented.What’s really remarkable is that the public is not normally this negative about a government unless the economy is in the deepest of slumps. If the UK had double-digit unemployment and house prices were crashing, Labour’s political predicament would be a lot easier to explain.Clearly, 2025 has been a far from vintage year for the economy, but it hasn’t been that bad either. Britain has trundled on in much the same way it has since the global financial crisis of 2008. Economic performance has been mediocre but not disastrous.True, growth has slowed since a strong start to 2025 and unemployment has edged up. At 5.1%,the jobless rateis a full percentage point higher than when Labour came to power in July 2024, but still a long way short of the levels seen in the deep recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. What’s more, for those in work, living standards have been rising, because wage growth has outpaced inflation. Governments normally benefit when voters are better off, but this one hasn’t.Past Labour governments have been through much worse years without suffering such a marked drop in public support. In 1947, Clement Attlee’s administration was buffeted by a series of adverse shocks, with fuel shortages during a brutally cold winter followed by a sterling crisis in the summer. Rationing imposed during the second world war was still in force.In 1975, inflation hit a postwar peak of 25%, eventually leading to a run on the pound and spending cuts imposed on Jim Callaghan’s government by the International Monetary Fund in late 1976 as the price of securing a loan. It took many years for Labour to recover from that humiliation.More recently, in 2008, the near-collapse of the banks during the global financial crisis led to the economy shrinking for more than a year. From peak to trough,the economy shrankby more than 6%. In the past year ithas grownby slightly more than 1%.Labour is confident that its political fortunes will improve, as voters start to feel the benefits of rising incomes and lower interest rates. That certainly happened in the past, although the impact has not always been enough to save the party from defeat at the subsequent election.Attlee narrowly won in 1950 and secured Labour’s highest-ever vote share, despite losing the 1951 election. The economy grew strongly in the two years after the IMF loan, and by 1978, Callaghantoyed with the ideaof holding an autumn election. He eventually lost in May 1979, as did Brownin May 2010.Starmer is the most unpopular prime ministeron record. His approval ratings are worse than those of Callaghan – who, even after the strikes in the 1978-79 winter of discontent,remained a more popularchoice for prime minister than Margaret Thatcher – and of Gordon Brown, who ran out of time in 2010 but still did well enough to deprive David Cameron of an overall majority.It is far from clear why the present Labour government has lost public support more extensively and more rapidly than those of the 1940s, 1970s and 2000s, even though economic conditions have been more benign. Almost certainly it is a combination of factors: life isgenuinely tough for many people, especially for the young; the public’s patience has worn thin after a decade-and-a-half of flatlining living standards; Labour’s lack of a real plan has been exposed; issues other than the economy –such as immigration and asylum– may now influence voters more than they once did.One thing seems obvious. There is no guarantee that voters will reassess their view of Labour even if – and this seems unlikely – the economy really starts to motor in 2026. On the contrary, things are likely to get worse before they get better, partly as the result of policy errors by the Bank of England and the Treasury. The Bank has been too slow in cutting interest rates, andlast week’s downward movefrom 4% to 3.75% was a classic case of too little, too late. Rachel Reeves, for her part,made it more expensiveto hire workers by raising employers’ national insurance contributions in her 2024 budget.All governments make mistakes, and they need not be fatal. But Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time on its hands to turn things around, even though the next election could be as far away as the summer of 2029 and much can happen in that time.Yet, the economy ends 2025 with precious little forward momentum. Business confidenceis weak, and high street spending by consumersfell in both October and November. The rate cut from the Bank of England was a response to an economy that is not simply sluggish, but in real distress.So here’s the rub: the government is already phenomenally unpopular. There would be no coming back from a recession – even a relatively short-lived and shallow one.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)OpinionEconomicsLabourEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

By 1945, after fleeing the Nazis first to Czechoslovakia, then Palestine, then Britain, Tergit had finished her novel, but it took until 1951 for The Effingers to be published. Even then, only a few German booksellers wanted it in their shops. It was too strange a piece of work for a German public that had watched, if not participated, in the Holocaust.Though overlooked at the time, it has been rediscovered as a classic in Germany, and has now beenpublished in English for the first time. It is a chronicle of three affluent Jewish families in Berlin between 1878 and 1942, with an epilogue set in 1948, based on Tergit’s return visit to her destroyed city. Tergit understood how dangerous the Nazis were. She was a court reporter and covered Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels on trial in the 1920s – this also made her a target, and she fled Berlin after narrowly escaping an SA (“Brownshirts”) raid in March 1933.It is eerie, reading The Effingers in 2025, that the Nazis’ rise to power is something that happens largely on the periphery of the protagonists’ lives. There is a sense that while they recognise them as bad actors, they nevertheless feel themselves insulated from the Nazis in their extravagant villas in Tiergarten, with their good dresses and connections.A similar atmosphere of overhanging political danger is apparent inCabaret, the 1972 film based on the Berlin novels of Christopher Isherwood. The Weimar republic is portrayed as a hedonistic time, and the Nazis only emerge slowly from the background. One character even says: “The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans – but they do serve a purpose: let them get rid of the communists and later we’ll be able to control them.” The sense of looming but underappreciated danger struck me as something contemporary.The Effingers by Gabriele Tergit review – a vivid portrait of Berlin before the NazisRead moreDiscourse on fascism is ubiquitous at the moment. Here in Germany it is being debated inarticles,books,exhibitionsand publiclecture series. There are arguments about whether the politics of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) can be called fascism, or whether this 21st-century form of rightwing authoritarianism is qualitatively different.In an attempt to better understand these historical precedents and our own times, I enrolled in an evening seminar on fascism entitled “Monsters” of Fascism Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, at the leftwing Berthold Brecht Literary Forum in Berlin. The central idea was, the lecturer explained, that being able to define fascism is the first step in increasing our resilience to it. Despite some challenges in determining a definition, we arrived at a few markers we could agree on: some attempt to create an ethnically “pure” nation, the engagement of a paramilitary force and use of excessive violence, anti-liberal and anti-democratic sentiments, and the involvement of wealthy backers from the economic elite.When the discussion turned to the AfD, and where we might position them on the spectrum, a depressing air hung over the seminar room. We were moving from the theoretical realm to the political reality of Germany in 2025, and, while the AfD does not have its own paramilitary force or use excessive violence, there are reasonable concerns about the other criteria. This is a party for whomwell over 30%of blue-collar workers and unemployed Germans voted in February’s federal elections. The AfD came in second overall nationally, winning 20.8% of the vote, with the CDU taking 28.5%. Thelatest pollinghas the AfD leading by 26% to the CDU’s 24%. The AfD is a party that has been deemed “rightwing extremist” by our ownFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.One delusion from history that Germany’s establishment is in danger of repeating is the idea that the old elites can maintain control over newly emerging powers on the extreme right. A few weeks before the 2025 election, the Christian Democrat (CDU) chancellor, Friedrich Merz,broke the so-called firewall– the agreement among all democratic parties not to partner with the AfD in parliamentary votes. Merz got a proposal to crack down on illegal migration through parliament with the support of the AfD. Since then, several CDU members have called on Merz to end the firewall altogether.When Germany commemorated the victims of the Nazi pogroms of November 1938 last month, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, our symbolic head of state, gavea speechin which he warned about the AfD in all but name. He called on Merz’s government to maintain the firewall, and even urged that legal options to ban anti-democratic political parties be considered. The prospect of banning the AfD has been debated extensively, but seems unlikely to happen; it also sidesteps tackling the roots of its support.For people wanting to resist rightwing extremism, one of the first priorities is to show solidarity with those who are under threat. InGermanyin 2025, this means mostly asylum seekers, specifically Syrians, Afghans and Ukrainians, but generally young men with migration histories. And there have been some public displays of such solidarity.In January 2024, millions of people went out into the freezing streets across Germany to protest against the notorioussecret “remigration” conference in Potsdam, attended by neo-Nazis and AfD members, and exposed by the investigative platform Correctiv. But neither this outrage nor concerns about the weakening parliamentary firewall seem to have made a lasting impact on Merz’s government.The bitter moral lesson of Tergit’s novel comes in the final letter, written by the elder Effinger on the way to the concentration camp: “I believed in the good in people – that was the gravest error of my misguided life.” We shouldn’t stop believing in the good in people, but we should also heed the warnings of history. What The Effingers teaches us is not to underestimate the danger of the fascist menace, and to fight on all fronts against it, before it is no longer possible.Tania Roettger is a journalist based in BerlinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whatever!The bigwigs in the top of the equator might have convinced the world of such, but that’s only because they lack the innate knowledge that us southern hemisphere folk know all too well: a warm Christmas is simply superior. This time of year is stressful enough – regardless of temperature – but hey, at least we don’t have to deal with seasonal depression on top of it all.And I’m not just speaking from the orifice that doesn’t have teeth, I spent my entire childhood in the cold during the festive season.BoM reveals Christmas Day forecast as nation sweats through extreme heatwaveRead moreDespite my entire family hailing from New Zealand, Dad’s job meant that big international moves were inevitable. I spent most of my younger years scattered across the UK (plus a quick stint in North Carolina), meaning that every time December rolled in I could expect a dark sky by 4pm and a crisp sting on my cheeks. The only upside was the fashion choices; layering is just so effortlessly chic.In fairness, a cold Christmas does have a lot else going for itself. It’s traditional, classic and I’d be lying if I said that the possibility of seeing snow isn’t enchanting. The cosy charm of a chilly celebration is pretty hard to dismiss as anything other than magical but, since my extended family was stuck on the other side of the world, I always felt like I was missing out on authentic merrymaking that not even the most decadent hot chocolate could make up for.Growing up so far from every cousin, uncle, aunt and grandparent meant that big reunions were things I only saw in movies, and I was green with envy over those that got to see extended family without having to endure a 30-hour flight. There was still something to love about sharing the holiday with just immediate family – plus hopping over to the local pub – it was just that it was so different to the Christmases that everyone else around me seemed to have.It was only when Dad’s job prompted another international move to Australia that I finally got to experience a proper festive family affair; joined by my uncle, aunt and grandma for the first time. Because there was a bigger crowd to entertain, Dad got especially experimental in the kitchen and created a heavily marinated vodka jelly, knocking everyone on their arse after two bites. We all slept pretty well that night.This was our Christmas routine for years – sharing the day with family, friends or a mix of both and water gun fights across the table – up until Dad once again answered the siren call of a new job opportunity from across the pond. Mum and Dad moved to the north of England, to one of the coldest parts of the entire country, right before the 2020 pandemic.When my brother and I visited for the first time in almost two years for Christmas, I expected a wave of nostalgic longing to hit me in full force. But instead of being paralysed by the overwhelming sensation of long-forgotten childhood memories, I found myself missing everything that made a summer Christmas so special. Sipping sangria in the sun. Noshing on piles of fresh fruit. Family and friends being just a phone call away. Hot-pink sunsets stretched across the sky.Suddenly, I was a hot-Christmas convert.This Christmas, let’s ban the world’s most miserable gift-giving game | Dave SchillingRead moreThen, when Dad died in 2024, Mum made the decision to permanently plant her roots back on this side of the world and return home to Aotearoa. The first Christmas without him was tough, his absence felt in every corner, but being once again surrounded by family (this time including my sister-in-law, her brothers and mum) plus the soft warmth of the sun helped ease the grief in monumental ways.All that to say, I am a massive hypocrite.I will be spending this Christmas during winter in South Korea; and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t excited to wander around Seoul in my fluffiest coat, holding out hope for the chance to catch a glimpse of snow. Cold Christmas propaganda still has a little hold on me – sue me!Still, I’m keen to return back home and experience another New Year’s Day under the light of the Australian summer sun. Knowing that my family – including my newborn nephew – will be close by as we enter 2026 gives me so much joy that little me was always yearning for.

Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.Over the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardiangames of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!‘I absolutely devoured this gem of a game’“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured thisgemof a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!”Jen Baker“Death Stranding 2is a truemasterpieceof a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.”Simon White“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. ButAvowedgot its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.”Matt Froggatt“Split Fictionis themost funco-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!”Simon Watson“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to theLiesof Puniverse and the DLC,Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.”Tara CooperView image in fullscreen‘It has been my favourite game for years’ … Ghost of Yōtei released in October 2025.Photograph: Sony Interactive Entertainment“Myfavouritegame of the year has been my favourite for years:Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.”Gareth Jones“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).”Thomas Jones“The top VR game of 2025 has to beGhost Townby FireproofGames. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.”Martina Stender“For me, it has to beMonsterTrain 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!”Nell Guy“Maybe it’s recency bias, butArc Raidershas come out of nowhere and completelytaken overmy gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.”Brett BatesView image in fullscreen‘A well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way’ … Silvano Cardin on Chicory: A Colorful Tale.Photograph: Chicory“One game I played this year will stay with me for life:Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.”Silvano Cardin“Absolum.I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!”Asher Alexander“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had meobsessedlikeBlue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.”Marie-Jill Landry“Kaizen Game Works’Promise Mascot Agencyis a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.”Paul Jones“My favourite game of the year is, very much,Dispatch– and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!”Chris Cunliffe“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2isoutstandingin all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.”Bob WatkinsWhat to clickKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this ChristmasTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆Call of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memoriesQuestion BlockView image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?You know what to do: email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are comedians moonlighting as detectives? And what happens when an AI steals your heart? This year’s most addictive podcasts …Alexi Duggins,Hollie RichardsonandHannah J DaviesWed 24 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 06.03 ESTShare20Home Cooking With Samin Nosrat and Hrishikesh HirwayChef Samin Nosrat – author of the cult cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat – and Song Exploder supremo Hrishikesh Hirway revived their pandemic-era food podcast this year, and it was truly scrumptious. This warm hug of a show – propelled by the clear chemistry between the two friends – centred the communal and cultural power of food, drawing on its hosts’ diverse tastes and respective Iranian and Indian heritage. All that, while also answering listeners’ kitchen dilemmas (among them: what do you do when your partner has a pathological fear of white sauces, from mayonnaise to sour cream?).19Lucky BoyThe Observer’s Chloe Hadjimatheou has had a big year, thanks in part to her investigation into questions around the honesty of the author of the bestselling memoirThe Salt Path. Over in the podcast world, she’s had another success, too: this dark and gripping four-part series abouta schoolboy groomed by a female teacher in her late 20s. Lucky Boy swerves any temptation towards the salacious, instead focusing on the vulnerable (and sometimes seething) testimony of Gareth – now in his 50s – whose life was devastated both by the actions of his teacher and the inaction of other school staff.18Reclaiming With Monica LewinskyView image in fullscreenOne of the most riveting opening episodes ever … Monica Lewinsky.Photograph: Wondery/PAIn one of the most riveting opening podcast episodes ever, Monica Lewinsky was her own first guest. “There’s no field guide to surviving a scandal,” she said, before a brutally candid hour recounting her affair with Bill Clinton. It was a powerful start to a ballsy series about reclaiming what a person has lost (in the broadest sense). Since then, Lewinsky has proved a great host in meaty chats with guests including Amanda Knox, Margaret Cho, Ronan Farrow, Allison Janney, Elizabeth Gilbert and Kesha.17The Rise and Fall of … Indie SleazeView image in fullscreenWhat a hoot … Kate Nash.Photograph: Jude HarrisonMillennials had a hoot with this rollicking podcast about the messy indie sleaze era. Curiously, the term wasn’t coined until more than 20 years after the Strokes kicked off the scene with their dirty Converse. But hostKate Nashcaptures the unmistakable guitar riffs, skinny jeans and arrogant energy of the time. It’s a nostalgic bop-fest with sounds from the likes of the Long Blondes, Bloc Party, Arctic Monkeys and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, along with outrageous stories of the time told by the Cribs, the Libertines, Razorlight and Art Brut (Nash is very aware of the male-heavy roster – a symptom of the times). This might make you feel old as hell, or like a 17-year-old having the time of their life on a dirty dancefloor again.16Aftermath: Hunt for the Anthrax KillerThe 2001 anthrax crisis in the US has lost some of its sting in the years since, slipping into the footnotes of the post-9/11 “war on terror”. Hosted by Jeremiah Crowell, CBC’s podcast expertly reopened this disquieting chapter of American history, teleporting us back to the time when poisonous white powder began appearing in the mail, and asking whether the authorities ever truly solved the case. As well as zooming in on the blockbuster parts of the tale (FBI raids, suspicious scientists), it also considered the human casualties of this lethal act of bioterrorism.15Wanging OnThere is no naughtier sound thanGraham Nortonand Maria McErlane uncontrollably cackling together. The wickedly funny pair have been mates for three decades and first started solving listener dilemmas on Norton’s Radio 2 show 13 years ago. By popular demand, they’re back at it with this agony-aunt podcast, delving into everything from wedding-invite snubs and naked in-laws to what tote bag to take to the supermarket and holiday flings. But aside from the honest advice, it’s a joy to just hear Graham and Maria catching up (and often squabbling) over tea and biscuits as all great friends should.14Mad, Sad and Bad With Paloma FaithView image in fullscreenReunited … Alan Carr and Paloma Faith on Mad, Sad and Bad.Not content with her role in one of the best TV moments of the year (being bumped off by her best mate Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors, then leaving in a coffin),Paloma Faithalso presented one of the year’s best pods. Running counter to the usual breezy tone of most celeb-on-celeb interview shows, Mad, Sad and Bad invites guests to reflect on the more challenging times of their lives, alongside an ever-disarming host. The result is bracingly honest, from Jamie Laing unpicking his people-pleasing past, to writer Afua Hirsch illustrating the prejudice she experienced while working in television.13What We SpendMoney remains, for many of us, a deeply taboo subject – ironic, really, as speaking about it can educate us on how to save more of it, or remove some of the stigma of debt. Enter What We Spend, where Courtney Harrell scratches our nosy itch while also guiding us through the fiscal habits of a glut of ordinary Americans, complete with spending diaries of their daily lives. For some, there’s guilt – “should I ask my parents for more money for my wedding?” – while others, like a truck driver living in her vehicle, are just trying to survive.12Fela Kuti: Fear No ManView image in fullscreenAstonishing … Fela Kuti.Photograph: Tim Hall/RedfernsThis astonishingly detailed look at a musician whose story is far too little known in the west began with a flurry of impossibly starry endorsements (Obama! McCartney! Jay-Z!). And in nigh-on every episode there was at least one astonishing vignette – think Kuti’s mother’s nudity-assisted overthrow of a colonial governor, how he defied the Nigerian authorities by refusing to defecate for three days while in a prison cell, or the tragic recounting of a violent army raid on his family. Creator Jad Abumrad’s in-depth interviews and passionate explanation of the power of Kuti’s music created not just an immersive account of why Kuti’s name should be writ large in international history books, but quite probably the best music podcast of 2025.11Ill-advised by Bill NighyView image in fullscreenAgony uncle? … Bill Nighy.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for IMDbHe claims to have made so many bad life decisions that his main skill as an agony uncle is to act as a living guide to how not to do things. He promises not to say anything profound. He insists on starting the show by warning listeners that it is simply a way to waste their time. And to a certain extent, he’s right: this series of responses to reader questions washes over you so delightfully that it makes half an hour evaporate. But, despite the protestations, once you’ve spent time with his charming anecdotes, languidly delivered opinions and hilariously quirky takes on how to approach life, it’s impossible not to feel that you’re in the presence of wisdom. An absolutely delightful listen.10Cannonball with Wesley MorrisThe termination of And Just Like That! South Park’s takedown of Donald Trump! Lady Gaga’s triumphant return! After Still Processing, his hit podcast with co-host Jenna Wortham, New York Times critic Wesley Morris cannonballed into the culture pool solo with this lively, accessible series – and he had plenty to dig into with a top roster of guests each week. There were wider and more personal debates, too, from the changing role of music critics to the most formative summer films, and the deeper meaning behind being a Bruno Mars fan. A cracking weekly culture fix.9What’s My Age Again?View image in fullscreenIntriguing … Katherine Ryan.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images for SXSW LondonOne of Britain’s best-loved comics,Katherine Ryanhas become a major podcast player of late, too. What’s My Age Again? could have been car-crash territory, a show that invites celebrities to undergo a biological age test that tells them how old they really are, before branding them as decrepit. Luckily, it’s been a more sensitive affair, opening up all manner of intriguing conversations – from Joanne McNally on being an adoptee to Michelle de Swarte’s memories of her matriarchal upbringing.8Camp Swamp RoadAmerica’s stand-your-ground self-defence laws are at the heart of this Wall Street Journal miniseries, which begins with an agitated 911 call from a motorist, reporting an apparent road rage incident. The man on the phone, Weldon Boyd, would go on to kill the person he was reporting – Scott Spivey – in what local police found to have been self-defence. Valerie Bauerlein’s understated yet excellent journalism underpins this hard-hitting four-parter about events in South Carolina in 2023, and why Spivey’s sister, Jennifer, has long believed there was more to what happened on that day than was initially understood.7Good Hang With Amy PoehlerDescribing a podcast as perfect background listening is liable to come off as a little backhanded. But Good Hang is just that: a tonic of a series that offers levity, joy and just the right amount of celebrity schmoozing, and doesn’t require you to work your grey matter too hard. Poehler has great fun chatting to her showbiz pals, reuniting with most of the cast ofParks and Recin the process. Her episode with Aubrey Plaza is also a masterclass in engaging with a friend’s grief (Plaza had recently been widowed), rather than giving it a wide berth.6The Retrievals: The C-sectionsThe first series of this Serial podcast – also hosted and reported by Susan Burton – told the horrifying story of patients who underwent IVF procedures without pain drugs, after a nurse stole their medication and swapped it for saline solution. This follow-up continued the theme of motherhood and medical injustice, focusing on the grim reality of the many mothers affected – as many as 100,000 in the US each year – many of whom feel excruciating pain during caesareans. Terrifying – and very triggering for anyone who has suffered a similar experience – it also provides a crucial window into an under-reported issue.5StalkedView image in fullscreenCaptivating … Hannah Mossman Moore and Carole Cadwalladr.Photograph: BBC Sounds/Sarah Louise Bennett/PAPulitzer prize-nominated journalist Carole Cadwalladr never fails to tell tales that are anything but fearless. And so it was with her BBC podcast, which saw her team up with Hannah Mossman Moore, the daughter of her ex-partner, so they could detail the awful online abuse that she was subjected to. From chilling interviews with cyberstalking experts to doorstepping the prime suspect, and the forensic detailing of the head-spinning emails and fake accounts Mossman Moore was bombarded with, it’s a captivating, immersive listen that attempts to turn the tables.4Blood RelativesThe New Yorker’s In the Dark has long been one of the most compelling true-crime series around, and its latest British-based outing kept the bar high. Staff writer Heidi Blake was thorough and unrelenting – and left no part of a “bewildering morass” of legal documents unread – as she revisited the infamousWhite House Farm murders, and questioned the evidence that put Jeremy Bamber behind bars for the murder of his adoptive parents, sister and two nephews. It was bolstered by the hours Blake spends in conversation with Bamber – a contradictory figure who, she said, seems to have an “uncanny detachment” from the murders and a deep grief over the loss of his family.3Flesh and CodeView image in fullscreenEye-opening stuff … Travis from Flesh and Code.Photograph: WonderyA show aboutpeople who fell in love with their AI chatbotscould have been an exercise in gawping at baffling lifestyle choices. But while this series didn’t fail to deliver jaw-dropping revelations, it wasn’t at the expense of the interviewees who became romantically entangled with digital creations. Main interviewee Travis, and his account of being taken by surprise byromantic feelings for AI bot Lily Rose, was a sensitively handled, if eye-opening tale that raised questions about the existence of digital consciousness and the difference between online and offline relationships. But it was the way it spun out to look at the brains behind the app and how it became entangled in another user’s wild attempted assassination against a head of state that pushed the show into edge-of-the-seat stuff.2Missing in the AmazonIn June 2022, British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira failed to return home from a reporting trip in Brazil’s Javari Valley. Their disappearance – and the subsequent realisation that they had been murdered – appalled the country, and the world. Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, was the reporter and host of this stirring series – in part an exploration into the climate of organised crime and ecological destruction that surrounded their deaths, but also a tender portrait of two men from different backgrounds united by friendship and a commitment to the rainforest.1WisecrackView image in fullscreenOne of a kind … Edd Hedges.Photograph: Tenderfoot TVThis word-of-mouth hit wasn’t just a gripping true-crime podcast, but a format-busting exercise in ensuring that describing it as “a gripping true-crime podcast” almost certainly fails to do it justice. It began, ostensibly, as a highlights reel of a standup comedy set, with TV crime producer Jodi Tovay talking about stumbling into the Edinburgh festival gig of comedian Edd Hedges. Hugely engaging clip after hugely engaging clip is played of a show in which Hedges talks about his brush with a murderer, and while it’s so addictive that you want to binge the whole thing in one go, it initially feels a tad like Tovay’s show is simply a hack job on someone else’s comedy. Until her true-crime experience is brought to bear, Hedges goes under the microscope and the series flips on its head to become a meticulously researched investigation that encompasses death, trauma and the notion of truth in art. There’s never been another true-crime show quite like it."

They deserve a whole new episode togetherFrances RyanWed 24 Dec 2025 16.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 16.01 ESTShareIn an era in which it is now an annual tradition for the US streaming giants to put out bland paint-by-algorithm holiday movies, there is something rather satisfying about the oddball BritishChristmasstand-alone special. The ingredients tend to be as follows: appearances by the year’s favourite comic actors; niche cultural references, with or without cameos; a wittily biting but heartwarming script that preferably leaves the viewer weeping into their Baileys.In many ways, Finding Father Christmas hits all those notes, if never quite fulfilling its potential. It follows 16-year-old Chris (Bafta-winner and total delight Lenny Rush), who still believes in Santa despite being in the middle of his GCSEs. Three years after the death of his mother and with Chris still writing letters to the north pole, his concerned dad and depressed postman Nicholas (The Inbetweeners’ James Buckley) decides it’s finally time to have “the talk”.View image in fullscreenCrunching the numbers … Stephen Fry in Finding Father Christmas.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Nicholas lays it bare. Santa’s sipped whisky. The snow on the roof. The reindeer tracks. All done by him. But the show would be very short if Chris believed his dad, and so he embarks on a mission to prove him wrong and discover the science behind the magic, aided by his lovably eccentric cousin, Holly (Ele Mckenzie), and a range of experts.The USP is that said experts are real-life scientists and thinkers playing themselves: Prof Hannah Fry, Dame Maggie Aderin-Pocock, and, for reasons I don’t quite understand, Jason Fox from SAS: Who Dares Wins. Everyone involved is a good sport as they use physics to explain how Father Christmas does the seemingly impossible in just one night. But it is national treasure andmediocre faithfulStephen Fry who steals the show.Having stalked him via a tipoff by the local Santa (a guest appearance by People Just Do Nothing’s Asim Chaudhry), Chris, Holly and super fan Nicholas find themselves in Fry’s front room being given a full-blown presentation weighing up the logistics of Christmas Eve, complete with a chalkboard and equations. (Look out for the press clippings framed above Fry’s downstairs toilet.)There is a sweet side plot in which Nicholas tentatively takes a step back into dating with Miss Bailey (Rochenda Sandall), Chris’s science teacher who lives across the road. But there would surely have been more depth to the characterisation if Chris had gone on the journey of discovery with his dad rather than his cousin. Buckley and Rush are a wonderful pairing who clearly could have carried it off, with Rush showing the same easy chemistry that saw him shine with co-star Daisy May Cooper in Am I Being Unreasonable? I find myself wishing the script had been returned around February with a note from Channel 4 bosses asking to turn it into a two-hander, in a similar vein to 2018’s pathos-filled Click & Collect.View image in fullscreenThe TV equivalent of a Christmas buffet … Asim Chaudhry as Santa with Ele McKenzie as and Lenny Rush as Chris.Photograph: Big TalkInstead, we’re given multiple characters we never really get enough time with. There’s a fun scene reminiscent of Paddington where Chris and Holly break into a warehouse to discover the truth about Father Christmas, but Taskmaster’s Greg Davies is criminally underused as the big man himself, other than a quick joke about air fryers as dated presents. Similarly, there’s a nice running gag about Royal Mail (you can imagine legal action starting over the claim that they shred children’s letters to Santa), but Nicholas’s unhappiness at work doesn’t get the chance to be properly explored. We do, however, get some time with Holly and her podcast without any explanation of her role in Chris’s life or why she is keen to commit crimes for him. It is the TV equivalent of a Christmas buffet. A nice sausage roll there, a pot of Pringles here. But you can’t help wishing you were sitting down to a full roast dinner.By the end, I simultaneously have the feeling it is going on too long (call me anti-expert but after physics has been explained in terms of Santa’s movements once, do we need it again and again?) and also could do with an extra 15 minutes. The loss of Chris’s mum is covered briefly in the first and last five minutes, but some exploration in the middle would have given the whole thing more emotional punch. As the credits roll, I am not crying into my Baileys. Perhaps I’m dead inside. Perhaps I started drinking this morning and fell asleep in the third ad break facedown in a panettone. Perhaps – and I’m going with this option – there needs to be a part two next year to fill in some of the blanks.I vote Chris and his dad spend Christmas Eve with Davies’s Santa, ideally with a post-watershed liberalism to expletives. The physicists can come along for the ride (if they must).Finding Father Christmas is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Be warned, though: it verges on horror – young kids may well be terrifiedLucy ManganWed 24 Dec 2025 17.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 17.32 ESTShareIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a family gathered around a roaring yuletide screen must be in want of a ghost story. Since 1968, therefore (or a couple of years earlier, depending on whether you count the precursor Whistle and I’ll Come to You, directed by Jonathan Miller – and who am I to tell you nay?), the BBC has sporadically provided one in the form of the Ghost Story for Christmas series. These days, it is an annual event, delivered as a half-hour adaptation by Mark Gatiss of a spooky short story from the Victorian or Edwardian archives, which gives us some shivery distraction and provides some lovely actors with gainful employment of a not too onerous kind in the lead-up to Christmas.To begin, the recent reboot of the series comprised mostly adaptations of Gatiss’s greatest love, MR James, but there has also, as befits the co-creator of Sherlock, been one by Arthur Conan Doyle (Lot No 249). Then, last year, it was derived from a tale by E Nesbit-yes-that-E-Nesbit from the days before she was pulling in royalties from The Railway Children, and the Psammead wasn’t even a glint in Edith’s eye.This year it is the turn of EF Benson. A prolific writer, Benson is best known as the author of the Mapp & Lucia books, but he often wrote what he called “spook stories” for magazines. Gatiss has chosen The Room in the Tower, written and published in 1912, and reset it (partly at least) during the second world war.Roger Winstanley (Tobias Menzies, an understated actor who always makes you lean in and is perfectly cast in a part made up largely of whispered dread) is making stoic small talk with a stranger, Verity (Nancy Carroll), as they shelter in a tube station during an air raid. Does she dream, he suddenly asks her. She does. “Have they ever come true?” And we slip back to his childhood as he begins the story for which “I can find no explanation at all”.View image in fullscreenNice to see it again … The Room in the Tower: A Ghost Story for Christmas.Photograph: BBC/Adorable Media/Joe DugganSince he was a schoolboy, we hear, Winstanley has had the recurrent dream/nightmare that he arrives at the house of a schoolfellow, Jack Stone, and is ushered into the garden for tea with Jack’s black-gowned mother Julia (Joanna Lumley), his father and a couple of other relatives. There is utter silence until he is told by Julia: “Jack will show you to your room. I’ve given you the room in the tower.” Young Roger is filled with inexplicable terror but there is no escape. Jack shows him to the room, leaves him there – and he would always wake up just before he discovered what awful fate awaits him.Eventually, Roger tells Verity, it was succeeded by a slightly different version: Julia was no longer there in body. Her voice, and the same feared instruction, however, remained and the rest of the hated dream continued to its usual end.In the most recent dream, Roger has joined his jolly friend John Clinton (Ben Mansfield) for a game of tennis and John invited him back to his house for tea. Guess what? Yes indeed – they drive up to the house of Roger’s nightmares. He rallies when he sees that the family assembled on the lawn for tea is not Jack Stone’s but a far more cheerful and rambunctious group, surrounded by welcoming guests. All is well until the matriarch (this time played by Polly Walker) announces that – guess what again! Those of you who have already remembered that “Jack” is a nickname for “John” will be ahead of the pack (I had to look it up, and if you wish to escape the festivities at any point in this exhausting season, do Google it and give yourself 10 minutes of etymological satisfaction). But, yes, indeed comes the line. Jack will show him to his room. She has put him in the room in the tower.Benson’s twist, plus Gatiss’s further turn of the screw (although we should save that description until he gets to Henry James), round off the atmospheric half-hour nicely – although you could argue that we are now entering horror rather than ghost story territory; if you are gathered for a family viewing, it may cause the youngest members to recoil. Once again, like an inoffensive second cousin round the Christmas table, you wouldn’t miss the Gatiss ghost story if it wasn’t there, but it’s always nice to see it again.The Room in the Tower: A Ghost Story for Christmas aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJoanna LumleyTobias MenziesHorror (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

For decades, Ken Bonham, a retired teacher, has made memory boxes of places he has visited with his dressmaker wife of 54 years, Maggie, each made up of items they have collected on their travels or Bonham has made.Models of barns, castles and churches are also crammed into the property – made from cork, balsa wood, styrofoam – or 3D card elevations from Bonham’s photos. Each Christmas, Bonham delights his neighbours by crafting nativity scenes from items he has collected and crafted.Celebrating architecture, geography, history of art with a touch of satire, Bonham’s creations are in part inspired by his years teaching integrated studies to schoolchildren.“It’s the story of my life,” Bonham said, of the collection of dioramas that fills the couple’s home. “There’s card models that I make from my photographs, which I’ve written abookabout, and then there’s my model barns, and the life boxes and the memory boxes that I make of our travels.”View image in fullscreenKen Bonham, a retired teacher, surrounded by his memory boxes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianExplaining how he started making the memory boxes, Bonham said: “When it was my wife’s 60th birthday I asked her if she’d like a diamond ring and she said she’d sooner go to Italy. So we went to Italy and fell in love with Rome and all things Italia. So when I came back I made a display of them.“Now, we’ll go on holiday, collect postcards, tickets to museums, miniatures of various things, figures and things that are, I don’t like the word, but iconic. And then, when I get home I arrange them all in a order of some sort and then make a box. Some of them will hang on the wall, some of them are freestanding on a shelf.“I’ve done one of our visits to Paris and another one of our train trip down through the south of France when we went to Avignon.View image in fullscreenKen Bonham with his wife, Maggie.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian‘The Irish trip has got Celtic crosses, card models that I made from my photographs of some of the Celtic monasteries, some model stones of the Celtic stones, a small souvenir of Georgian doorways in Dublin, a model of Trinity College Dublin and a mini bottle of Guinness.“The British box has got my model toy soldiers from when I was a kid, some of my toy cars, sand from various beaches, England’s Glory matchboxes, a telephone box and a London transport bus, a lighthouse, a Royal Lifeboat man and various animals – and the whole thing hangs on the wall and it’s 4ft high and 3ft wide.“And then on another Italian trip, we went to Naples, which is where the Nativity scenes started.”View image in fullscreenA 3D model of a nativity scene made by Ken for the foyer of the block of flats where he lives.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianKen, a lifelong modelmaker, traces his interest back to childhood, when his grandfather “used to come and have Friday tea – and always bought me a bag of wood offcuts and half a pound of mixed nails”. His father was “a metal polisher at Daimler … so I sort of inherited the gene”, he adds.Now 79, Bonham’s creations and outlook on life have built a loyal following onFacebook. “I’m not interested in arguing politics,” he said. “I’m not interested in criticising other people’s photographs.

Among the winding pathways lined with flowers, about halfway back, stood a bench under a tree, largely identical to the others throughout the park.Was this the one?I wondered.I didn’t have to question it for long. A closer look revealed words and images etched along its wooden slats, all along similar lines: “Lyra + Will”, they said. Or: “Pantalaimon” and “Kirjava”. Tucked between the bench’s arm and seat was a folded-up scrap of paper with a handwritten message of thanks.That was five years after The Amber Spyglass, the final novel in Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy, was published; this was the bench at the center of the book’s heart-wrenching conclusion. Visit it today and there’s no doubt about its literary significance: a statue of two of those characters, the animal-shaped Pantalaimon and Kirjava, wasplaced behind the benchin 2019.25 years of His Dark Materials: Philip Pullman on the journey of a lifetimeRead moreAfter His Dark Materials, Pullman wrote The Book of Dust, a second trilogy set in the same world(s). In October, the final book in that trilogy, The Rose Field, was published, bringing readers’ time with Lyra Silvertongue, the fantasy series’ protagonist, to a close. It marks the end of one of the great literary accomplishments of recent decades: theGuardian listedThe Amber Spyglass among its top 10 books of the 21st century, andthe BBC,Newsweekand other prominent publications have made similar assessments. The original trilogy has inspired a film, a BBC/HBO series, a National Theatre production and aKate Bush song. The two trilogies and companion books havesold more than 49m copies; the original has beentranslated into 40 languages. Many children arenow named Lyra(not least Ed Sheeran’s kid).If the first trilogy’s success – and its critical portrayal of organized religion – marked Pullman,in the wordsof the British columnist Peter Hitchens, as “the anti-[CS] Lewis, the one atheists would have been praying for, if atheists prayed”, the second warns against excessive rationality – or “what happens if you go too far the other way”, as another fantasy author,Lev Grossman, put it. Thirty years after the publication of Northern Lights (The Golden Compass in the US), the second trilogy has expanded our understanding of Lyra’s world, and in turn helps us process our own.His Dark Materials tells the story of a (roughly) 12-year-old girl’s journey between worlds, initially to rescue a friend but ultimately to confront the mysteries of the universe – and save it. In the process, she grapples with threats from a powerful religious organization as well as her own parents, and falls in love with Will, a boy from our own world. She encounters witches, talking bears and scientists studying dark matter, as well as perhaps the series’ two most memorable conjurings: daemons and Dust. Each person has a daemon, an animal companion that is physically separate but fundamentally a part of them, representing a portion of their identity. Dust is the stuff of consciousness: largely invisible particles that accumulate around people as they grow up and become aware of themselves, and which guides Lyra as she reads her truth-telling device, the alethiometer, or titular golden compass.View image in fullscreenPhilip Pullman before speaking at the 2018 Edinburgh International Book Festival, in Edinburgh, Scotland.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianHis Dark Materials was originally marketed as a children’s series, though Pullman isskeptical of the ideathat a book’s audience should be so clearly designated. I first read His Dark Materials as a teenager and found the books thrilling and deeply moving; I remember stumbling around in an emotional haze, to the detriment of my summer job, in the 24 hours after finishing them. In rereadings over the years – and especially after being forced, as a student, to read the epic 17th-century poem Paradise Lost, one of the series’ key inspirations – I have been in awe at their stunning scope. They investigate the most fundamental questions of what it means to be human – about growing up, consciousness, imagination, religion, science, morality, sexuality and the importance of storytelling – without ever losing their enormous sense of adventure.The books understand that children crave stories on the epic scale, that infinity is not too large for themKatherine RundellThe first trilogy is primarily about the transition between youth and adulthood, or, as the 18-19th century poet William Blake – another major influence on the series – would put it, innocence and experience, and what we gain and lose in the process. In a rebuttal to traditional narratives that understand Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden as a total disaster, His Dark Materials celebrates the acquisition of knowledge and the development of sexuality. In the books, the powerful church, known as the Magisterium, seeks in effect to prevent children from growing up; Lyra and Will are central to the fight against the organization.In this, the books can be read as a rebuttal to another Oxford-based children’s writer, CS Lewis, whose Narnia series reflects his devotion to Christianity. Pullman called the Narnia books “nauseating drivel” in the Guardian in 1998, condemning their religious allegory and Lewis’s views on women. The character Susan, for instance, is (69-year-old spoiler alert) barred from heaven because she is too interested in “nylons and lipstick” and growing up. Pullman developed a reputation as Lewis’s atheist opposite.And indeed, the books have faced extensive religious backlash: a 2008 list by the American Library Association found Pullman’s novels were thesecond-most-targeted for censorshipin the US that year. The biggest driver, the ALA believed, was the film version of the first book, The Golden Compass , whichfaced a boycott campaignby the Catholic League.Pullman has made no secret of his antipathy for much of organized religion. “If there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against,” he toldthe Telegraphin 2002, in remarks that echo what happens in the novels. “As you look back over the history of the Christian church, it’s a record of terrible infamy and cruelty and persecution and tyranny.”View image in fullscreenDavid Harewood and Lesley Manville in a 2004 stage production of His Dark Materials at the National Theatre in London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut to suggest that Pullman, now 79, is out to undermine religion itself would be a vast oversimplification. In the same interview, he called himself an agnostic: “Atheism suggests a degree of certainty that I’m not quite willing to accede to.” He valued his experience growing up in the Church of England: “The beauty of the liturgy, the hymns, the psalms, the Bible and so on – this is something that’s very deeply part of me,” he told theBBCin 2004. And in a 2014 interview withAeon, he reflected further: “I’m religious, but I’m an atheist. I think religious questions are the big questions. Where did we come from? What is life about? What is evil?” And he has celebrated much of religion’s intent, if not its execution. “The original impulses of the great religious geniuses – with whom I include Jesus – were, as often as not, something that all of us would benefit from studying and living by,” hetold the Guardianin 2002. “The churches and priesthoods would benefit more than most.”The Book of Dust, the second trilogy set in Lyra’s world – and one which, Laura Millerwrites at Slate, is “manifestly for adults” – adds more nuance to these questions: a sisterhood of nuns, for instance, plays a heroic role, and the books make it clear that Pullman’s assessment of organized religion does not equate to an embrace of ruthless rationality. He is critical of Richard Dawkins’ skepticism of fairytales, which the biologist hascalled“very unscientific”. In The Book of Dust, a 20-year-old Lyra falls victim to the writings of two popular authors who are determined to see the world as a collection of meaningless facts and circumstances: “It was nothing more than what it was,” one writes. The authors are so enamored of doubt that they question the very existence of daemons in a world full of them.Her interest in these writers drives a wedge between her and her own daemon, the strong-willed pine marten Pantalaimon, leading him to leave her side – an extraordinary separation in Lyra’s world – in an attempt to restore her imagination, a faculty that daemons themselves may represent. As she pursues him, and becomes entangled in a far-reaching conflict involving roses with mystical properties, she is often reminded, by other characters and her own experiences, of the potency of an unseen world of fairies, ghosts and other fantastical creatures that operates just out of our sight. As Lev Grossmanwrites in the Atlantic, Pullman is “adding to his religious skepticism a skepticism about skepticism itself”. In one of the more recent novels’ many parallels with our own universe, a leading figure in the Magisterium suggests that “we should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.”View image in fullscreenDafne Keen and Ruth Wilson in a scene in the BBC/HBO TV series, His Dark Materials (2022).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAnd while the Magisterium retains its stranglehold on Lyra’s world, others compete or join with it for the title of Most Evil. They include familiar figures such as a self-serving polemicist, and shadowy alliances between governments and corporations seeking to take advantage of a precious resource. A company boss manipulates the media, touting his ability to “curate” the news. Those few dedicated to justice are driven out of government, and the public is fed false explanations for political acts. As a wise character points out, nefarious forces always have an advantage because “evil can be unscrupulous, and good can’t.”In reading the six books, along with the short companion stories Pullman has written, it becomes clear that the antagonist is not spirituality – or even organized religion per se. The chief threat is something closer to dogma or absolutist thinking, and the authoritarian mindset that often accompanies it. There’s no question that His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust criticize certain worldviews – but they are less an attack on specific factions or sects than they are a testament to “the spirit of free inquiry”, as Sophia Nguyen puts it in theWashington Post.And perhaps more than religion, more than investigations of consciousness or authority, Pullman’s greatest commitment may be to storytelling itself –an essential, “nourishing” human function that helps us to grow. “I think we can learn what’s good and what’s bad, what’s generous and unselfish, what’s cruel and mean, from fiction,” the author said in a2005 lectureat the University of East Anglia. He has discussed at length a sense of responsibility to the stories he tells; 30 years spent shaping Lyra’s world is a testament to this ethic.View image in fullscreenPhilip Pullman’s The Book of Dust books on display at Waterstones in London.Photograph: Kathy deWitt/AlamyIt is also a testament to the vividness of his writing that, unlike other wildly successful fantasy series – Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games – and in spite of several attempts, his stories have never felt like a multimedia franchise. Lyra’s adventures are most potent when rooted to the page, perhaps because no one else has quite figured out how to convey Pullman’s themes so convincingly.Lyra’s last story – exclusive extract from Philip Pullman’s final instalment in The Book of Dust trilogyRead morePullman’s stories, for me, have provided a framework for understanding the world. For instance, visible or not, we all have something like daemons: sides of ourselvesthat can offer clarity, act as a check on our behaviors, or reinforce our worst impulses.Dust, particles akin to dark matter, suggests a self-awareness in the universe, a celebration of consciousness, and is probably the most appealing depiction of a force outside ourselves I have ever encountered, as a committed agnostic. The flow state Lyra achieves when studying the alethiometer offers anaspirational concept of creativity.“The books understand that children crave stories on the epic scale, that infinity is not too large for them,” the children’s author Katherine Rundell recently told theNew York Times. And child or no, when I read these novels, their boundlessness, their wrestling with the most profound questions we face, makes me feel somehow more alive and grateful to be part of a brilliant, unique, altruistic and infuriatingly selfish species.Pullman has spoken at length about his trepidation about the fantasy genre; he never wanted to be a JRR Tolkien type, inventing a world for its own sake. Instead, “I had to try to use all my various invented creatures – the daemons, the armored bears, the angels – to say something I thought was true and important about us, about being human, about growing up and living and dying,” he said in a 2002 speech. “This, finally, is what I think the value of fantasy is: that it’s a great vehicle when it serves the purposes of realism, and alot of old cobblerswhen it doesn’t.” Two trilogies have shown us Lyra’s world is very real. A much-graffitied bench in the Oxford Botanic Garden is proof.Explore more on these topicsPhilip PullmanFictionFantasy booksReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It won awards for writing, for directing, for cinematography. Three of its actors – Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty and Owen Cooper – all took home awards. But Adolescence also earned another Emmy for a craft that often goes overlooked: best casting.Shaheen Baig was the woman responsible for casting Adolescence, and her Emmy is tucked away in the top right corner of the screen as we chat about her year over Zoom.

As the woman who populated Adolescence with actors, Baig is ultimately the woman who discovered Owen Cooper. Despite its incendiary subject matter and technical wizardry, Cooper was the beating heart of the series. So revelatory was his performance – in turn heartbreakingly vulnerable and incandescently vicious – that it was hard to believe he was just 14 years old at time of filming, let alone that this was his first ever role.Baig nods. “He did exceptionally. He had this wonderful quality on screen. There was a real innocence to him visually, and a clarity which I thought was just wonderful.”Cooper’s discovery came as the result of a highly targeted six-month search for someone to fill the role. Baig knew that the show would be filmed in the north of England, so that was where she and her team set to work.“I chose five cities,” she says. “We then thoroughly researched those cities. We created databases. We looked at schools, youth groups, art groups, music groups. We talked to people that ran the clubs.”View image in fullscreenOwen Cooper as Jamie Miller in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixOnce she was convinced that she had a good grasp of the cities, she put a flyer together. “We sent it out on social media, and all the places that we had spoken to, and then we essentially street cast,” she says. “We go, we talk to people, we hand out flyers, we engage with people. It’s a lot of work, and it takes time, but that’s how you get the best results.”After this phase, Baig and her team received 600 audition tapes to sift through, and gradually went about whittling them down. “In the first rounds, we got people to do little improvs, and then every subsequent stage became a little bit more sophisticated. We would see people in the room, do a bit of improvisation with them. Then we’d recall, get them to work from script, until we got down to five.”Baig is keen to stress that every one of the final five candidates was “brilliant”, and they all ended up with roles on the show. Nevertheless, Cooper stood out. “Owen had this ability to really listen and connect with Stephen,” she says. “But also he wasn’t scared of repetition. We went over scenes time after time, trying different things. We wanted to push him to see where he could go, and he had this extraordinary focus for somebody so young. I mean, that’s a rare find.”This year has been a banner year for Baig. In the past, she has cast everything from Black Mirror to Giri/Haji to Peaky Blinders to Sherwood. But in 2025, in addition to Adolescence, she was responsible forA Thousand Blows,Toxic Town, Man Like Mobeen,The Death of Bunny Munroand BBC Three’s beautiful and underappreciatedJust Act Normal. As soon as you notice her name in the credits of a film or TV show, you can immediately be assured of its quality.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham (centre) in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Dan Smith/Disney+“I’m always working,” she says with a smile. “I’ve always been a bit of a workaholic, but I think Adolescence has made me more visible. I’d normally run a mile from doing anything like this interview. I’m quite shy, and I find these things quite difficult. But actually it’s really good to talk about casting, because it makes the profession more visible.”One of the issues with making filmed entertainment, be it movies or TV, is that people often assume that a director or showrunner controls everything from the top down. Is there a sense that this is changing, at least when it comes to casting?“It’s a collaboration, but like every other department – like a cinematographer, an editor, a costume designer – a huge amount of work and skill goes into creating a cast,” she says. “I think it’s really great that it’s suddenly being recognised.” This is certainly true when it comes to awards. Bafta recently started recognising casting on awards night, and the Oscars will feature it as a category from next year.“It’s great that the craft is being finally recognised as an essential element of film-making,” she continues. “Because it really is. If you don’t have the actors, you can’t make the thing.”Part of the job, she says, is being able to intuit the vision of the person in charge. “It’s my job to find the tone of a project,” she explains. “Some directors are more visual than others. Some are very focused on the script. Directors have all got different strengths. I like to work really closely with the director. Sometimes you don’t always agree with one another, but I have to find a way to make it work, because I’m not the director of the film. I want my directors to have the best experience they can with the cast that we’ve put in front of them. So I will always find a way to make it work, because I think I want to do what’s best for the film.”After starting her career as a production assistant in the 1990s, Baig found herself being drawn more and more towards actors. She eventually became an assistant to Debbie McWilliams, the James Bond casting director , before setting up shop on her own at the start of the century.View image in fullscreenSam Buchanan and Chenée Taylor in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeHowever, during this time she noticed an imbalance in the industry. “There weren’t really many other people like me,” she says. “Working-class, from Birmingham, mixed race. Even now, it’s not really a very representative industry, and that has to change.” And so she began to work with Open Door, an organisation that seeks to help young actors who lack the resources and financial means to attend drama school.“Being able to go to drama school is a privilege, and it can feel quite a long way away for many, many people,” she says. “Applying for drama school is expensive. Travel to your auditions is expensive. Open Door has worked really hard to break down some of those barriers. We work with people on movement, on voice, on auditions. We pair people with buddies, so they have somebody to connect to who has got a career. It’s all about making sure there are people in our industry that are recognisable to you.”Happily, it’s paying off. “I’ve really noticed a difference,” she says. “Open Door has been going for nearly 10 years, and I’ve seen a real change in intake at drama schools. So many of our students have been successful and are working and have got really good careers.”The 50 best TV shows of 2025Read moreBaig’s 2026 looks set to be just as busy as this year. Already on the slate is Daisy Haggard’s Scottish-set thriller Maya. “The scripts are stunning,” she says. “Beautiful. She’s such a gifted writer.” Then there’s Riz Ahmed’s Bait, about a struggling actor who lands a big role, and the upcoming Peaky Blinders film. But, still, surely there’s still time to luxuriate a little in the success of Adolescence.“I’m so happy that Warp Films are getting their flowers,” she says, deflecting. “They have been doing brilliant work for a really long time. They’re great people. They care about people. They’ve got a proper moral code. They’re great role models. Stephen Graham’s a great role model, too. It has all just been a really positive experience.”More than anything, though, you sense that Shaheen Baig is really just thrilled for Owen Cooper, and all the things he’s bound to achieve in his career.“He’s looking fantastic,” she says, like a proud mum. “There are a lot of very fancy photoshoots with him at the moment.” She pauses for a second, then adds. “He’s still got to do his GCSEs, though. That’ll bring him down to earth.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescenceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And their four grownup kids are played by Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself.

One case in 1725 concerned a recently deceased peasant farmer, Peter Blagojević, who rose from the grave, visited his wife to demand his shoes, and then murdered nine people in the night. When his body was disinterred, his mouth was found full of fresh blood. The villagers staked the corpse and then burned it. In 1745, the clergyman John Swinton published an anonymous pamphlet, The Travels of Three English Gentlemen, from Venice to Hamburgh, in which it is written: “These Vampyres are supposed to be the Bodies of deceased Persons, animated by evil Spirits, which come out of the Graves, in the Night-time, suck the Blood of many of the Living, and thereby destroy them.” And so a modern myth was born.But it is not so modern, or exclusively European, as this extraordinary survey shows. Instead, the author, a historian and archeologist, argues that belief in the unquiet dead is found in many cultures and periods, where it can lay dormant for centuries before erupting in an “epidemic”, as in Serbia. Where there is no written source, John Blair makes persuasive use of archeological finds in which bodies are found to have been decapitated or nailed down. In 16th-century Poland, a buried woman “had a sickle placed upright across her throat and a padlock on the big toe of her left foot”. Someone, our author infers reasonably, wanted to keep these people in their coffins.The familiar horror taxonomy of zombies versus vampires and so forth is relatively modern; they are variations on the single ancient theme that dead people can rise from the grave and persecute the living. Blair calls them all “dangerous corpses”, or the “restless dead”, or the “walking dead”. But they still come in different guises, as we learn on this splendidly gruesome journey. Some are “shroud-chewers”, some are “lip-smackers”, some are “suckers”; others are “bloaters”, “damned huntsmen”, “night-stranglers” or “night-mares”, in the original sense of a demon that presses on a person in bed during the dark hours. A 15th-century dead baker in Brittany continued to get up at night to help his family knead dough, but also went around other houses “throwing stones at people”. As late as the 19th century in New England, people who had died of tuberculosis were suspected of killing others from the grave, and so exhumed and incinerated.Blair argues that killing dead people again is actually therapeutic – and this form of therapy is not yet consigned to historySuch beliefs can bubble along underground, as it were, for a long time; but bouts of corpse-killing arise, Blair argues, only when an endemic belief system is animated by a particular set of “stresses and anxieties”. In early medieval England, vampire epidemics attended waves of the Black Death; later, in Saxony, the Lutheran Reformation abolished purgatory, and left grieving families with a need for “new answers” about the fate of the dead. The largest known “corpse-killing panic” in history, which ran into the hundreds of bodies, happened in 18th-century Moravia: Blair diagnoses “a sense of unfinished business” over the decades of witch trials that preceded it. Not long afterwards, we find vampires reported for the first time where an innocent might have supposed they were all along: in Transylvania.The top 10 vampire booksRead moreIn conclusion, Blair argues that killing dead people again is actually “therapeutic”: “Like other extreme rituals, it is distressing at the time but leaves people feeling good afterwards.” And this form of therapy is not yet consigned to history: vampires still harass people in pockets of rural Greece and the Baltics, and a Serbian priest was suspended by his bishop in 2019 for participating in the “exhumation and staking of a woman”.Alas for Bram Stoker fans, for whom Dracula is the Christmassy terror par excellence, the old count himself gets short shrift here, ticked off for being “very unlike the dangerous corpses in which people have actually believed”. Blair even calls Stoker’s novel “misleading”, which is an odd thing to say about a work of fiction. But he does give the Irishman good marks for coining the excellent word “undead”.Killing the Dead: Vampire Epidemics from Mesopotamia to the New World by John Blair is published by Princeton (£30).

Among them were a clutch of literary stars: Oscar Wilde, Evelyn Waugh, Muriel Spark and Graham Greene. But there was a whole host of poets, artists and public intellectuals less known to us today, whose “going over to Rome” provoked envy and dismay.In this thoughtful though brisk book, Melanie McDonagh, a columnist for The Tablet, gives us 16 case histories of Britons who went “Poping” during the scariest decades of the 20th century. At a time when reason and decency appeared to have been chased out by political extremism and global warfare, it was only natural to long for something solid. Writing in 1925, Greene confided to his fiancee “one does want fearfully hard for something firm and hard and certain, however uncomfortable, to catch hold of in the general flux”.Contrary to lurid Protestant fantasies, Catholic priests were not on the hunt for celebrity scalps to “lure” into their incense-fugged, whiskey-sodden clutches. Again and again, McDonagh’s converts report being taken aback by the way in which their approaches to Brompton Oratory or Chelsea’s Farm Street Church were met with a cool equanimity and slightly humiliating lack of interest. The job of the instructing priest was to tell you what was what, furnish you with the Penny Catechism and send you on your way. According to Maurice Baring, a man of letters who converted in 1909, the clergy were what ticket offices were to train stations: they gave the traveller information and told them where to go. Whether the traveller boarded the train was none of their business.But this take-it-or-leave-it approach was ultimately appealing, especially to those who had “come over” from Anglicanism. To worship in the Church of England was to be presented with an infinite number of riddles. Not sure where you stood on the Real Presence, the Immaculate Conception, or even the Resurrection? Anglicans were happy to discuss the complexities ad infinitum. RH Benson, son of a former archbishop of Canterbury, spoke for many when he explained how frustrating he found this latitude when set against Catholic certainty: “there is a liberty which is a more intolerable slavery than the heaviest of chains”.The aesthetic pleasures of Roman Catholicism also turned out to be largely illusory. Unless attending one of the smart London churches, converts had to get used to worshipping in ugly modern buildings alongside largely working-class congregations. Charles Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Proust, described how on Easter Sunday 1915, he had gone “to a hideous drab little RC chapel” on the edge of an industrial estate which had an inaudible priest and no music. Nonetheless, Moncrieff, still an Anglican at this point, realised in a flash that he must be a Catholic. If you wanted magnificent buildings, glorious hymns, beautiful vernacular liturgy and the sort of clergyman whom you could invite to your club then you would be better off staying with the Established Church.Then there was the inevitable censure. When Spark’s Miss Jean Brodie tartly declared that “only people who did not want to think for themselves were Roman Catholics” she was voicing a general prejudice. Also commonplace were charges of moral turpitude (it didn’t help that Wilde, Bosie Douglas, Aubrey Beardsley and many other 1890s decadents had converted). To become a Catholic was to invite suspicion that you were mad, secretly gay or spying for a foreign power.Despite these penalties, few converts seem to have regretted their decision although, as McDonagh points out, it is hard to know for certain. Becoming a Catholic is a recorded event; deciding not to be one is simply a matter of no longer turning up to church. There is, too, a notable lack of women in this book, notwithstanding chapters on Gwen John, Spark and the Oxford philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe. Perhaps, although McDonagh does not say so, this was because women converting did not pose as much of a threat to the established order. The structure of her book, comprising a series of discrete case histories, means that these wider considerations fall between the cracks. What Converts lacks in analysis, though, it makes up for in vivid biographical storytelling.Converts by Melanie McDonagh is published by Yale (£25).

So this new film covering Bowie’s final decades could be a tough sell for non-completists: the 90s and 00s were not, let’s be honest, Bowie’s golden years, creatively or reputationally. After his perpetual self-reinvention during the 70s and early 80s, fans were somewhat baffled by his new band Tin Machine, which critic Jon Wilde dismissed as “glorified pub rock” in his scathing Melody Maker review (even Wilde shakes his head as he reads it out again here; the last line is: “You’re a fucking disgrace.”)It’s not all doom and gloom, though, even if Bowie seemed to be following the zeitgeist rather than leading it - not least with his short-lived foray into drum & bass. The narrative almost acknowledges as much with frequent flashbacks to the halcyon days, and Bowie’s lifelong fascination with outer space the through-line. And there are enjoyable contributions from the likes of Tony Visconti, Rick Wakeman, Dana Gillespie,Hanif Kureishi, and guitarists Earl Slick and Reeves Gabrels.Bowie’s 2000 Glastonbury show is positioned as something of a comeback, after which he enjoyed living legend status, but it’s arguably only his final album, Blackstar, that really stands out creatively. Ten years on, it’s moving to hear Visconti, his lifelong friend and collaborator, talking about recording in secret what they all knew would be his last project. It would be wrong to call it going out on a high, under the circumstances, but it’s heartening that Bowie could craft such a poignant, defiant, dignified exit.Bowie: The Final Act is in UK and Irish cinemas from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDavid BowieTony ViscontiRick WakemanHanif KureishireviewsShareReuse this content"

It also may yet prove that, yes,Hugh Jackmanreally is the greatest showman (his role here is much more interesting than his bland impersonation of PT Barnum) and his co-star Kate Hudson brings just the same performance megawattage.Mike and Claire Sardina, terrifically played by Jackman and Hudson, were a Milwaukee married couple with kids from previous relationships who in the 90s formed a cheesyNeil Diamondtribute act called Lightning and Thunder; they became a cult hit in their home state and even opened for Pearl Jam whose guitarist Eddie Vedder good-naturedly joined them on stage for an encore. But things were not easy for them, and this film broods on how tough it is when the lightning of ill fortune strikes more than once.It is in fact adapted froman existing documentary of the same titlefrom 2008 by Greg Kohs about this stranger-than-fiction world, a film that was heavily reliant on the couple’s family archive of home video – and it’s fair to say that the documentary puts more emphasis on the delusional and absurd aspects of Mike and Claire’s life. But that’s not how this film from writer-director Craig Brewer reinvents their story. He,Jackman and Hudson turn the laugh-at into laugh-with. Jackman absolutely crushes it as a Neil Diamond impersonator, sounding almost like him, and looking almost like him; he’s perfectly plausible as someone who isn’t supposed to be in the big league but who clearly has the chops (and the pipes) to carry a show. Mike is a Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who insists on playing his guitar at 12-step meetings so the other people in AA have a sense of his journey. It’s very funny when he practises singing Diamond’s Cracklin’ Rose at home in his underpants and painfully strains a groin muscle while cavorting.Hudson is also excellent, doing her own singing as Claire, who before she joined Mike in the Neil Diamond tribute world had a thriving act as Patsy Cline; she is shown belting out Cline numbers although there is one Cline standard that this film interestingly misses out. Michael Imperioli plays a Buddy Holly impersonator called Mark and Mustafa Shakir is a James Brown act called Sex Machine. Ella Anderson plays Claire’s teen daughter Rachel, and King Princess is Mike’s daughter Angelina of about the same age – and their burgeoning friendship is another underplayed aspect of the film’s likability.Irony and satire have been surgically removed from Mike and Claire’s heart-stoppingly eventful life stories, and in their place Brewer substitutes those qualities that the couple themselves would have been aware of: the vulnerability and loneliness of trying to make it in the margins of the music industry, or for that matter making it anywhere and in any business. This is a never-say-die story and its cheerful optimism makes it a calorific Christmas treat.Song Sung Blue is out on 25 December in the US and 1 January in Australia and the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsHugh JackmanKate HudsonNeil DiamondreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a clear, cold night, and the inn couldn’t look more welcoming: a cosy glow from within the historic building, the Cowal hills beyond. The Christmas lights are twinkling, the glasses are charged and there’s a palpable sense of goodwill, cheer, and plenty of pride in the air. By 6pm, it’s buzzing. Locals are already propping up the bar as a stylish woman sweeps in and bags the last table. She is Debbie Rycroft, a local haberdasher. “A pint in my own local,” she smiles happily, relishing a toast with her husband and equally dapper 19-year-old son.First-night hiccups are limited to a wonky nozzle and a brief worry about a small radiator leak. “How many people to fix a heater?” quips someone as a line of concerned faces survey the scene. Almost immediately, a punter walks in with a radiator key. All sorted. Someone orders a Guinness; the bartender pulls it off. A two-part pour, pitchblack perfection with a balanced, creamy top. Good things come to those who wait? Well, this one’s been three years in the making.The Oakbank, a landmark building at the heart of Sandbank for the last 160 years, closed at the end of 2022, like so many businesses that struggled in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Next came the closure of the nearby Holy Loch inn. The village was left without a pub – a huge loss for a rural community.Ian MacNaughton remembers sneaking into the pub for a pint, aged 16. These days he’s retired and learning about compliance lawsA group of locals got together in early 2023, formed a committee, chaired by Sue McKillop, and began the long slog to buy the Oakbank. “It’s been an uphill struggle,” says Ian MacNaughton, another founding committee member. “I just didn’t think the hill would be so steep!” Now retired, MacNaughton remembers sneaking into the Oakbank for a pint, aged 16. These days he’s learning about compliance laws. “We must do everything right.”View image in fullscreenThe Oakbank’s opening night.Photograph: Sue McKillopAfter an initial rejection, their persistence finally paid off last December with the award of a Scottish Land grant just shy of £150,000, covering most of the purchase price. In January, McKillop advertised shares, raising more than £23,000 and an “inspiring amount of enthusiasm” from locals. By April this year, they had the keys. It’s been nonstop ever since up until opening night last Saturday, she says.While the shares didn’t reach the £90,000 target, people have contributed “thousands of volunteer hours” to get the place ready, Dawn Petherick tells me. They shifted and updated the bar, now an airy sky blue, while the old wood burner’s still there but “needing work”. Another one for the list. And Petherick’s list is long. She is Oakbank’s development officer, a fixed-term post funded by the initial grant, and, like everyone else involved, she’s been busy all year.View image in fullscreenThe view outside the Oakbank.Photograph: Susan SmillieThe Oakbank has been running pop-ups, workshops and charity mornings during the refurbishment. More events are being added all the time. “Whatever the community wants – knitting groups, book clubs, exhibitions, ‘sober nights’ – it should be a hub more than a pub,” says Petherick. “Somewhere to alleviate social isolation.”And that is needed more than ever. Yet another local pub, the Strone Inn across the bay, is set to close at the end of the year. Like many local business owners, Stephen Mitchell is supportive of the Oakbank project. “Fair play to them,” he says. “It’s taken them three years, so it’s a real result.” But, he warns, “the hard work starts now as things are really tough”.The best thing about the Oakbank is at the back of the bar – big glass doors offer views across the Holy LochMcKillop agrees. “It’s exciting but a wee bit scary,” she says. “We are under no illusions as to the challenges that lie ahead. Like any pub venue, we will need to keep innovating in order to survive.” But she can take comfort from recent figures; community pubs are doing well. According to the charity Plunkett UK, community-owned businesses are “highly resilient”, with a five-year survival rate of 98%.“We’re delighted that the Oakbank Community Inn is opening under community ownership,” says James Alcock, Plunkett UK’s chief executive. “We see time and again how saving local assets like village pubs protects vital services and social spaces, helping to reduce isolation and strengthen communities.”View image in fullscreenThe Oakbank at night.Photograph: Susan SmillieFuture plans include refurbishing accommodation upstairs, a studio/gallery space in the adjoining cottage and renovating the commercial kitchen. In a nice piece of alchemy, the pub sits opposite Sandbank’s community-owned garden, so its polytunnels and raised beds will be nurturing hyper-local vegetables destined for that kitchen.But the best thing about the Oakbank is the bit you see last. At the back of the bar, big glass doors offer views across the Holy Loch. It’s inaccessible now, but outside the doors, a grassy verge leads to the Holy Loch marina below. It has its own regulars hauling out on the slipway – giant Atlantic grey seals. With neighbours like that, you can see why McKillop has ambitious plans. “We’re going to rebuild the rotten deck and make a bridge to connect to the marina,” she says.That should please boat-owners Tony, Rob and Alan, enjoying a pint beside the bar. “Sailors don’t like going places where you can’t go to a pub,” says Rob. “And Sandbank’s had absolutely nothing to offer.”“Hang on,” offers Tony. “It’s got a lot of history.”But Rob’s having none of it. “You can’t drink a pint of history.”Explore more on these topicsTravelPubsScotland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This vibrant sauce is so forgiving and endlessly versatile – a last-minute showstopper that can be whipped up with a few store-cupboard ingredients and some herbs. It’s normally made with parsley, garlic, capers, anchovy fillets, olive oil and vinegar, but as long as the end result is green and saucy, I’m generally more than happy. Finely chop whatever herbs you have to hand – I used rosemary, sage, lemon verbena and nasturtiumsfrom the garden.Anything goes salsa verdeGreen sauce is a forgiving, adaptable recipe, and a great way to use an excess of herbs or leafy greens and their stalks. It’s delicious with almost any simple roast, grilled or fried fish, vegetable or meat, and elevates any meal almost effortlessly. I find that chopping the herbs by hand creates a much nicer texture than using a blender. If you do use a blender, simply pulse all the ingredients at once, but make sure you’ve chopped the herbs 10mm or smaller first.I like salsa verde better once it’s had time to sit and rest, because that gives the acid time to break down the herbs and for the flavours to amalgamate, so ideally make this sauce the day before, or first thing in the morning.100g mixed seasonal fresh herbs, leaves and soft stalks; discard any very woody stalks1 small garlic clove,peeled, or 1 tbsp finely chopped onion1 pinch coarse sea salt1 tbsp capers, finely chopped (optional)2 anchovy fillets(optional)3 tbsp stale bread(optional)1½ tbsp vinegar(white- or red-wine or cider vinegar)1 tsp mustard(optional)50-100ml extra-virgin olive oilGather all the herbs into a bunch and finely chop all the way up from stalk to leaf. Cross chop finely until everything is evenly chopped.If you’d like a thicker sauce, chop the stale bread into small cubes, toss with the vinegar or lemon juice, and leave to soak.In a mortar, pound the garlic and sea salt with the capers and anchovy fillets, if using. Once that’s all broken down into a puree, add all the chopped herbs and pound again for 30 seconds, to break them down. Pound in the stale bread, if using; if not, just add the tablespoon and a half of vinegar or lemon juice now. Stir in the mustard, if using, then finish with enough extra-virgin olive oil to give the salsa a consistency that’s to your liking.Season to taste, adjust the acidity, so, if need be, then store in a clean jar and use within a day or two.Explore more on these topicsSauces and graviesWaste notFoodFood wasteHerbs and spicesBreadItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
