I should shower so it’ll wake me up; if I shower, I should exercise first so I don’t have to shower twice,” intones the voiceover. “If I’m going to exercise, I should eat first; if I’m going to cook, I should have coffee first so I have energy to cook,” it continues. The video – which has almost 5m views – bears the caption: “What executive dysfunction looks like.”Hundreds of videos have circulated through social media, pinning people’s various struggles on “executive dysfunction”. Each video follows similar themes: showing people failing to initiate tasks, growing overwhelmed by household chores or theorizing why they’renever on time.But what is executive dysfunction? Why do people experience it, and what can be done to mitigate it? Additionally, what is executive function? We asked experts to explain.What is executive function?Executive functionis the ability to manage and organize tasks on a daily basis, says Mai Uchida, a pediatric psychiatrist at Massachusetts general hospital and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This includes planning, prioritizing and thinking about how long a task will take you before you need to move on to the next thing. But it also includes the ability to break down larger tasks into smaller ones, being able to shift attention from one task to another, and maintaining working memory.What is executive dysfunction?“Executive dysfunction”, on the other hand, is not really a term used by mental health professionals. You’re much more likely to hear a professional say that a person “has difficulties with executive functioning” or “has poor executive function”, says Kristin Carothers, a clinical psychologist based in Atlanta and New York. These professionals don’t want to label anyone as “dysfunctional”, she says.The unconscious process that leads to creativity: how ‘incubation’ worksRead moreBut the idea of executive dysfunction does get at a real experience that some people live with.The obvious hallmarks of poor executive function include difficulty initiating tasks, missing or running up against deadlines, being late, and losing things. But it can also include patterns such as poor impulse control and overspending, difficulties in following through on promises, and overestimating your ability to follow through on commitments, says Carothers.Critically, “poor executive function” and “executive dysfunction” are not diagnoses, says Uchida. You cannot be diagnosed with either of these terms, but poor executive function could be a symptom that accompanies a genuine psychiatric condition. Most often, poor executive function is associated with ADHD, she says, though “there are plenty of people with ADHD who don’t have executive functioning difficulties”. It has no relationship to intelligence. Executive functioning difficulties can also accompany anxiety and depression.What has a negative effect on executive function?Like most other human traits, executive function exists on a spectrum. “It’s on a bell curve, where most people are somewhere in the middle,” says Ari Tuckman, a clinical psychologist in Westchester, Pennsylvania. Executive function can also change over your lifetime. For example, “adults have better executive function than kids”, he says. It can decline a bit as a consequence of normal ageing, and those going through menopause will also likely see a greater degree of change as a side-effect of hormonal changes.Life circumstances can also affect executive function. “If you have a bad night’s sleep or if you have the flu”, your executive function will take a hit, Tuckman says. Bouts of depression or anxiety, stress, intoxication, head injuries and being busier than usual are also influential factors.If you normally don’t struggle with executive function but are having trouble because of temporary life circumstances – such as getting poor sleep, or being busier than usual – things should return to normal afterward. But if you have chronic, persistent trouble with managing daily tasks, to the point that it’s affecting your personal and professional life, that might be a sign that there’s an underlying issue, and you might want to see a professional, says Carothers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many are tried and true organizational strategies, says Tuckman: “You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.” For example, set up multiple reminders and alarms for yourself, and write out on paper checklists of things to do, even for tasks that are extremely small and easy.Reflect on and try to recognize the patterns that get you into trouble. If you have a work deadline approaching, and you know you tend to lose track of time when you open up and scroll through Instagram, try temporarily removing the app from your phone. Essentially, avoid putting yourself into situations that require more impulse control than you are able to muster, says Tuckman.If you get overwhelmed by the size of a task and have trouble getting started, Uchida recommends finding a small amount of time you can commit to. Maybe that’s 15 minutes; maybe it’s just five. Then dedicate just that small amount of time to the task. “When the bar is low, it’s a lot easier to get started,” says Uchida, “and sometimes it’s just getting started that’s difficult.” You might find that after that first 15 minutes, you have the ability to keep going. Or you might need a break before you commit to another 15. You have to find and adapt strategies that work for you, she says.Carothers also recommends turning to community to help you understand where you might need assistance. “Sometimes other people have more insight into your behavioral patterns than you do,” she says. “Ask a trusted friend, colleague, romantic partner for areas where they’ve noticed you struggle.” Then ask them to help you brainstorm workarounds for those specific circumstances – they might have ideas that you never learned or considered. “Strong social connections are important,” Carothers says. “Learn from the people around you.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyTime managementMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flanked by officials in white thobes, he prayed over six caskets – one draped in a Qatari flag and five bearing Palestinian flags.Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha on Tuesday, which also killed a Qatari officer, marked an unprecedented moment for the Gulf kingdom. The attack undercut the assumption that has underpinned Qatari foreign policy for three decades and reverberated across the Arab region: be useful to the United States, and it will protect you.Qatar has been useful. It has facilitated peace talks between Israel and Hamas, did the same with the Taliban and the US during the war in Afghanistan, and hosts the Al Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the Middle East.Israeli airstrikes ‘killed any hope’ for hostages in Gaza, says Qatari prime ministerRead moreFor decades the arrangement has held. The US supplied arms, parked its aircraft carrier in the Gulf and provided political cover internationally. The support has helped spare Gulf nations from the unrest that has consumed much of the Middle East, despite the rivalry with Iran.That changed when the US failed to stop the strike on Qatar this week, despite Israel being one of its closest allies. Donald Trump said he tried to give warning, but Qatar said it was only notified after the strike.Doha strongly condemned the strike, with al-Thani calling it “state terror” in an interview with CNN.“I have no words to express how enraged we are from such an action … This is state terror. We are betrayed,” he said.Although Trump tends to view international relationships as transactions, diplomats say that the strike has wounded the trust between the Gulf and the US that has existed since the 1930s.“This has real repercussions for the relationship,” said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar who helped build the Al Udeid base.“The Gulf states, beginning with Saudi Arabia, believe that their security and stability still depend on America. For them, preventing an Israeli attack on Qatar was a no-brainer – the US could have done it without barely lifting a finger,” he added.The message taken from the strike was not that Washington cannot control Israel, which it arms and equips to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but it does not want to rein it in. Trump’s ability to call back Israeli jets on their way to bomb Tehran showed he has leverage when he chooses to.“The perception in the Gulf is that at worst is that the US didn’t want to stop Israel and gave it a green light, or at best, that it doesn’t care about the sovereignty of its Gulf allies,” said Yasmine Farouk, project director at the International Crisis Group.The reaction among Gulf states has been immediate. Despite past rifts with Qatar, its neighbours viewed the attack as an assault on all of their collective sovereignty.A flurry of diplomacy has followed, much of it spearheaded by the UAE. Qatar has welcomed Jordan’s crown prince, the UAE president and Egypt’s foreign minister. On Sunday, Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit.“The repercussions of Israel’s war in Gaza and its military campaigns across the region have been bringing the gulf states closer together,” said Farouk. “I think this will be a moment where they try to move from solidarity to action.”In the short term, there will likely be little change in Washington relations. The US still underpins security and economic order in the Gulf and a hasty breakup is not in the cards.But Gulf states may quietly start turning down American requests.Getting more Arab states to sign up for the Abraham Accords – Trump’s major initiative in the region – is farther off than ever. The relationship between the UAE and Israel is already on the rocks, with the former summoning the Israeli ambassador. US access to Gulf capital could also be in jeopardy.If the US has stopped holding its side of the quid pro quo, the Gulf could quietly re-evaluate the return it is getting on its investments. By the time the US notices, it might be too late.“It will be the little things being turned down, but they will accumulate. We won’t notice at first, but Qatar will stop taking chances on our behalf,” said Theros.Explore more on these topicsQatarMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelanalysisShareReuse this content"

Twice is clearly careless. But there are few words available for a family newspaper to describe hiring Peter Mandelsonthrice, only for him to become mired in yet another scandal of career-ending proportions.Rarely has the Labour party been so united as it is now in rage. Once again, thePrince of Darknessis dragging everyone through the mud, thanks to his moth-like attraction to wealth and power. Once again, awkward questions are being asked about his integrity, or what he disclosed and when. The only surprise is that this time it unravelled so fast: just seven months from resurrection to disgrace.Though there is no good time to lose our ambassador to Washington over his friendship with a convicted paedophile, this one is biblically bad: days after losing Angela Rayner, in the middle of a deputy leadership contest that is being viewed as apower strugglebetween Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham, ahead of astate visitby a US president with his own embarrassing connections to Epstein.Yet this sacking couldn’t wait. Mandelson might have survived Monday’s publication of a gushing birthday tribute to his “best pal”, written before Epstein’s conviction for soliciting prostitution from minors. But the lateremails that surfaced on Wednesday, fondly urging his now disgraced friend to fight for early release and promising that “your friends stay with you and love you”, were beyond toxic. No Labour government battling poisonous conspiracy theories about the left turning a blind eye to grooming gangs could tolerate this, but perhaps especially not from a man who had just effectively made a public fool of his leader.Twice in a week now,Starmer has defendeda scandal-ridden colleagueto parliament, only for them to be gone 24 hours later. But where Angela Rayner’s resignation was met with sorrow on the backbenches, Mandelson’s sacking invites only rage that he was ever allowed to get this close to power again.What hurts isn’t just the grubbiness – the impression created that pretty much any scandal can be overlooked if hiring someone is politically expedient, reinforcing all voters’ most cynical assumptions – but the crystallising of backbench concerns about Keir Starmer’s poor judgment and consequent overreliance on close aide Morgan McSweeney. Anger once aimed at Downing Street’s longsuffering monkeys is now converging on the organ-grinder.Ironically, Mandelson and Starmer are not personally close, and in opposition his constantly proffered advice was sometimes a source of irritation. But Mandelson found a way in, as he always does, via friendlier shadow cabinet ministers and crucially his mentorship of McSweeney. It is precisely that ability to ooze through locked doors that got him to Washington: if anyone could get inside Donald Trump’s head at a time of existential danger for Europe, it was the man who for all his flaws is an extraordinarily gifted politician, possessing an almost supernatural ability to anticipate and manipulate those around him.On his shift, Britain got its trade deal,escaped miraculously lightly from tariffsand helped persuade the White House, at least temporarily,not to betray Ukraine. Perhaps history will judge some of these victories worth having, though it’s hard to say precisely how much was owed to Mandelson and how much to his old friend (and now foreign policy adviser) Jonathan Powell, assorted cabinet ministers, or outgoing ambassadorKaren Pierce. But if the prize was epic, so were the risks.For the sake of full disclosure, I was a baby political reporter during Mandelson’s first resignation in 1998 – over taking a secret loan from the millionaireLabourminister Geoffrey Robinson to buy a swanky house he couldn’t afford – and part of the Observer reporting team that precipitated his second, this time over his response to allegations that he intervened on behalf of an Indian billionaire seeking a British passport.Years later, my overriding memory of that time is the palpable anguish of his colleagues deciding that they couldn’t trust his version of events. What most surprises me isn’t that another prime minister took a risk on Mandelson’s talents and lived to regret it, but that when trouble came calling, Starmer seemingly gave him the benefit of the doubt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it came to Mandelson, the wrong side won | Emma BurnellRead moreMandelson insists that he never personally saw any wrongdoing in Epstein’s homes, suggesting thatas a gay manvisiting with his then partner (and now husband), it’s perhaps not surprising that Epstein never offered him “any introductions to women in the way that allegedly he did for others”. But it was a matter of public record that their friendship survived Epstein’s exposure and every alarm bell should have rung on Wednesday morning, when the Sun’s Harry Cole posted clips of a forthcoming interview in which Mandelson said he regretted staying close for too long – a classic move to get ahead of a damaging story.Questions will obviously be asked about everything from vetting to who knew what in advance of prime minister’s questions. But barely a fortnight after the last reset of the Downing Street machine, there are almost no minions left to fire.What is left instead is a prime minister who in surrounding himself with Tony Blair’s brightest talents – not just Powell, but fixer Pat McFadden, policy chief Liz Lloyd and most recentlyspin doctor Tim Allan– inadvertently left himself nowhere to hide. If all the old ingredients, added to the pot in roughly the old order, can’t start producing something like the old magic by next spring’s local elections, then eventually there will be nobody to blame but the chef. Don’t be surprised if, at that point, someone else tries to take over the kitchen.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He feared it would be his last stop before deportation.He remembered the stench of the place. The packed jail rooms where hundreds of men were warehoused together with little access to showers, which sometimesspouted brown, rusty water – when they worked.The 29-year-old, a father of two young daughters who are US citizens, had come to the US from Honduras and had previously been protected under the Obama-era program known as Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which halted deportation for many undocumented people who arrived in the US as children. He had entered as a nine-year-old but his Daca protection had lapsed.Plane to purgatory: how Trump’s deportation program shuttles immigrants into lawless limboRead moreIn March, Lisser-Posadas was apprehended by police in Shelby county, Tennessee, for driving with an expired license and was turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). He had no prior criminal record. For four weeks he was moved around various Ice detention centers. He filed a legal request to Ice for permission to remain in the country, citing fears of targeted violence in Honduras. He received no response.The Alexandria Staging Facility – as it is formally called – was “just not a place for human beings”, he said in a phone interview.The isolated, Ice staging facility in rural central Louisiana has emerged as a hub of the Trump administration’s deportation machine. The center, which has operated since 2014, is run by the private corrections giant Geo Group. It is considered a “black hole”, by many lawyers, advocates and former detainees interviewed by the Guardian. Living conditions are deplorable, many former detainees have alleged, and there is almost no legal access to the center.A four-month Guardian US investigation into the Alexandria facility has revealed a pattern of alleged due process violations, previously unreported accounts of neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays, despite the center’s intended use as a short-term detention facility. It also found that the facility adopted a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year that protect detainees’ welfare. Reporters relied on court documents, public records, internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) statistics, 911 calls and interviews with 10 people either formerly detained or deported from the Alexandria facility, or those with loved ones held there.View image in fullscreenA GlobalX (Global Crossing airlines) aircraft at England airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana.

They underscore the critical role the Alexandria facility, which is within the grounds of a small regional airport, has played in Ice’s mission of rapidly transferring and deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The data, which covers roughly 100 days from Donald Trump’s second inauguration, shows that more than 20,000 migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport on Ice charters operated by the carrier at a rate of almost 200 a day.“Louisiana is where people go to be disappeared,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “My concern about the Alexandria facility is [that] it is a black box.”Visitors are not permitted, and it is the kind of place where mistakes can happen, giving officials “a convenient excuse to wrongly deport people”, Ahmed added.“The only way to stop that is for people to have access to attorneys.”Alexandria, Louisiana, is a hub for Ice flightsNote: 80 GlobalX flight routes from 19 January 2025 to 2 May 2025.In response to the Guardian’s findings, the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, did not address specific questions but said in a statement: “Any claim that there are inhumane conditions at Ice detention centers are false. Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.”She added: “All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.”A spokesperson for Geo Group also did not respond to specific questions, but said in a statement that the company was “proud” of the role it had played for over 40 years “to support the law enforcement mission” of Ice.The statement added that all the company’s “support services” were monitored by Ice and the DHS to ensure “strict compliance” with the agency’sdetention standards. When issues are identified by Ice, a company spokesperson said they were “quickly” resolved.The Alexandria staging facility is supposed to bea short-term center that holds detainees for a maximum of 72 hours. It has a 400-person capacity, and detains only men. It is divided into four large shared rooms holding about 80 people and a separate cell block.But the center is routinely holding people for longer than the three-day maximum, a Guardian review ofanonymized immigration enforcement datareveals. Of the more than 28,000 people who were detained in Alexandria from January 2025 until late July, 20% were held longer than 72 hours. Since October 2023, analysis shows that 742 people have been held there for 10 days or more.Chart showing many days people are held in the Alexandria facility for longer than the three-day limitWhile immigration detention standardsare not uniform, centers detaining people for longer than 72 hours are generally required to provide more services – ranging from personal hygiene to recreation to legal visitation rights – than those designated as short-term.“What this analysis tells us is that there is a requirement for the government to provide 24-hour attorney access at this facility forthwith,” said Ahmed of the ACLU of Louisiana. “It is clearly not a short-term facility any more, if it ever was one.”Lisser-Posadas was one of those held for an extended period.He was detained in Alexandria for about 12 days, according to a family member who remained in contact with him throughout, and a review of dated Ice detainee locator screenshots. He described routine lockdowns and a lack of food. He was unable to change his clothes or underwear. He arrived in Alexandria with chest congestion, a fever and an ear infection that worsened over time. He received no medication until the last two days of his stay, he said.Medical care at the facility isprovidedbyIce’s health service corps, which is a part of the agency’s enforcement and removals operation.Lisser-Posadas remembered asking Geo Group guards repeatedly for an update on the status of his legal request to remain in the country.“I was trying to make sure that I got an explanation. Why I was being brought there? Why they wanted to deport me? Why they were holding me there for so many days?”Instead, he said, one staff member, a detention lieutenant, looked at him through a secure window. “She would look at me straight, and then start laughing,” he recalled.A GEO Group Ice staging facility is located within England airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana.A GEO Group Ice staging facility located within England airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana. The airfield has become a major hub for deportations from the US.Eventually, after staging a small protest by refusing to return to his cell, Lisser-Posadas was moved back to another Louisiana facility in the nearby town of Jena for about four days. He was then brought back to Alexandria and quickly deported to Honduras on a series of GlobalX flights that left Louisiana at 6am on 23 April. His request for deferred removal citing fear of persecution was never resolved.“My heart broke,” he said. “I saw kids [on the plane], some were still in their school uniform. They were being deported with their families. There were pregnant women as well.”The leaked flight records confirm there were eight children under the age of 16 booked on the same plane.Lisser-Posadas spoke to the Guardian from a federal prison where he was being held after he was apprehended at the southern border trying to re-enter the US in May to reunite with his family. He is now facing deportation again.The Alexandria staging facility is operated under theperformance-based national detention standards, an extensive set of guidelines designed to ensure a “safe and secure detention environment for staff and detainees”. The standards reflect that immigration detention is designed to be non-punitive as it relates to civil rather than criminal charges.Alexandria has been found deficient in a number of these standards, according to a review of Ice inspection reports from 2022 onwards, including specific shortcomings over medical care and the use of force.But because the standards are not legally binding,deficiencies rarely lead to meaningful consequences.The facility was inspected by Ice in February this year – the first such examination in Trump’s second term.A contractseen by the Guardian, agreed between Ice and the local district authority, shows the site was granted a special waiver four days before the DHS inspectors arrived, which absolved it of certain medical screening standards. The standard – which states that all detainees must receive a medical, dental and mental health intake screening as soon as possible, but no later than 12 hours after their arrival at a detention facility – was waived from 21 February to 22 May, according to the contract.The document notes “there shall be no public disclosures regarding this agreement” without approval by Ice and offers no rationale for the decision.View image in fullscreenFrances Kelly, of Louisiana Advocates for Immigrants in Detention, makes a video from a window of the observation deck at the Alexandria international airport. She was observing the transportation of detainees at a GEO Group Ice staging facility within the airport.Photograph: Kathleen Flynn/The GuardianJohn Roth, the DHS inspector general between 2013 and 2017, described the revelation as “highly troubling for the population of detainees there”.“The reason they wrote the performance-based standards is partly to avoid constitutional challenges on the conditions of confinement,” Roth said. “To the extent you are deviating from that in any way, you run into trouble.”The DHS declined to provide a comment on Roth’s statement.Alexandria passed the February inspection without any deficiencies. Inspectors with the DHS’s office of professional responsibility noted in their report that 13 detainees had been interviewed who all “reported satisfaction with facility services”.Roth argued the facility should face an immediate independent audit, describing the most recent inspection as holding “no validity because there is no detail behind it”.A review of 911 calls, released by local emergency authorities, reveals that the facility has seen a spike in emergency call-outs since 2023, under the Biden administration. This year, between January and the end of May, there was an average of more than two 911 calls per month, a rate that – if it persists – would put 2025 on track as the year with the most calls in recent history. On 19 March, a staff member frantically called 911 to report a detainee had attempted to hang themselves. “We need an ambulance, emergency ASAP,” says a panicked staffer at the facility. “What’s going on in there?” Another person can be heard shouting in the background. Five days earlier the center called to report a man with a history of stroke had passed out. Next month, the facility called requesting an ambulance for a detainee with low oxygen and high heart rate. In May, a call was made after an apparent episode of self-harm.'A guy was in there hanging himself'911 callSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/08/01-hanging.wav00:00:0000:00:00'A man passed out and he has a history of a stroke'911 callSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/09/08/02-stroke.wav00:00:0000:00:00McLaughlan, the DHS assistant secretary, said: “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters Ice custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”She added: “The Alexandria Staging Facility is in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody.”The Alexandria facility began operations over a decade ago, costing about $20m to construct, at the end of adeportations peakduring Barack Obama’s second term. Louisiananow detains more migrants per capita than any state in the US. The facility, one of nine privately operated centers, sits as the effective nucleus in the middle of “detention alley”, the network of remote immigration detention centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.View image in fullscreenLeft to Right: Amilcar Lisser-Posadas, Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, Badar Khan Suri.

Its CEO predicted the new administration’s mass deportation agendacouldincrease revenue by an additional $400m annually. Itwas reported in Maythat Trump’s hard-right border czar, Tom Homan, was a paid consultant for Geo Group before joining the administration. A White House spokesperson has said Homan abides by “the highest ethical standards”.The former acting head of Ice, Todd Lyons, has said the administration wanted to turn Trump’s deportation machine into “[Amazon] prime, but with human beings”. It has already begun attempting to replicate Alexandria’s functionality in other states, with new detention centers inFloridaandTexasconstructed in close proximity to runways. But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub. On 21 July 2025, the facility saw its highest detained population since 2023, with nearly 500 people held there – almost 100 people above its stated capacity.Chart showing the eight times in recent months Alexandria has been over capacityA spokesperson for Geo Group did not dispute the Guardian’s findings on capacity numbers but said that the company’s facilities “are never overcrowded”.The detention center is set within the grounds of a second world war-era airpark, once an air force base, and now a minor regional airport complex that sees a small handful of commercial flights each day. In July, the Guardian observed from a third-floor observation deck inside a red-bricked terminal building as a cluster of large Ice charter jets landed in quick succession and taxied towards the detention center out of public view.Although the entrance to the center is situated on a restricted road, the site is partially surroundedby an 18-hole golf course. From the vantage point of the 13th hole, a reporter observed as dozens of shackled detainees, including a line of young women, were driven on to the tarmac in minibuses and escorted under guard to a queue of six planes. The asphalt shimmered in the searing heat and many bent their heads as they walked towards their flights. Golfers teed off just a few hundred feet away.View image in fullscreenA golf course borders the England airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana.Photograph: Kathleen Flynn/The GuardianOf the 39 Ice flights that day, 23 July, over half either departed or landed in Alexandria, according to tracking data shared with the Guardianby the immigration advocate Tom Cartwright, highlighting its centrality to the mass deportation agenda.Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, an immigrant community leader and father of one, remembered taking a similar walk across the tarmac when he was deported in the early hours of 14 May 2025.He had been arrested by Ice less than 24 hours earlier and driven at extraordinary speed from Carthage, Mississippi, 250 miles to Alexandria – the sole passenger in the back of a government SUV.He repeatedly asked staff in Alexandria to call his family or a lawyer, but was denied telephone access, he claimed. Emails reviewed by the Guardian confirm he was deported before his lawyer could find him. Although facing a removal order, Orozco-Juarez held a valid work permit and a pending legal application to remain in the US.“They made us walk slowly,” he said in a phone interview from Guatemala. “They just laughed. Laughed at the way we walked. The way we got on the plane. They treated us so badly.”His attorney, Jeremy Jong, described the deportation as “a targeted kidnapping”.“And I would ask: is this the system that we want? Where someone can be deported in the middle of the night, without access to their lawyer.” Jong added. “Is that a system that treats everyone with dignity and respect?”View image in fullscreenA warning sign hangs on a fence at England airpark in Alexandria, Louisiana.Photograph: Kathleen Flynn/The GuardianBadar Khan Suri remembered landing in Alexandria with little comprehension of where he was.He was marched single file in shackles from a jet parked about 50 meters from the detention center and held in a waiting area lined with metal benches for over an hour. He claimed in an interview that a security guard forcefully spread his legs and punched him in the ankles as they eventually removed his restraints and took him to a cell block.Leaked flight manifests confirm Suri was flown to the staging facility on 18 March 2025 on a packed GlobalX flight from Richmond, Virginia, in mid-afternoon.Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University in the US on a valid academic research visa, was one of a group of immigrant students targeted by the Trump administration for their criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. He had been arrested in Virginia, detained, and then flown over a thousand miles to Louisiana without the ability to contact a lawyer or his family.He was held in Alexandria for three days, inside a windowless cell under rolling lockdown, which intensified his claustrophobia and panic. He said he could not recall speaking to a government representative for his entire time in Alexandria and was given no official answers about why he had been detained or where he was being sent. He feared deportation at any moment.He had not been fully processed into Ice detention, he said, and so was unable to use a phone within his cell block for longer than 20 seconds. He would ring his family back in Virginia at regular intervals and hear their panicked voices, but they were unable to hear him speak as his line was muted, he said.“I was able to hear my wife’s voice, my children in the background. But they never responded to my call,” he said. “‘Who is there? Can you hear me?’ they would say. And if I wasn’t able to connect to them, I would think: ‘What has happened? Maybe someone has also taken them away too.’”The staging facility has no space for confidential legal calls, no visitation capacity, or attorney client meeting room, according to multiple attorneys who have visited the center on Ice approved tours. Lawyers who have tried contacting clients held in Alexandria have said the only way to do so is to directly contact the Ice field office director for the entire region to facilitate a phone call.Ice’snational detention standards on telephone accessstate detainees and legal counsel should “be able to communicate effectively with each other” and that privacy for legal phone calls “shall be ensured”.Geo Group said it provides “in-person and virtual legal visitation”, but declined to comment on Alexandria specifically.Suri’s immigration attorney Hassan Ahmad confirmed he was eventually able to contact him via the Ice field office director. The phone call was brief and the two spoke in Urdu as Ahmad “couldn’t be assured of confidentiality” and could hear an Ice officer present in the background.Suri was transferred from Alexandria by van to a detention center in Alvarado, Texas, the next day. Eventually, on 14 May, he was released and continues to fight his immigration case back in Virginia. It was the same day that Orozco-Juarez was removed from the US.“This [center] should not exist,” said Suri. “There should be detention centers with due process.“At that time [in Alexandria], I realized there is nothing called rights. It was a real black hole. A real disgrace.”He continued: “Who are the people detained there? Those people are married to American citizens. They have American children. They are an integral part of American society.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In response to a decline in visitor numbers and a cash crisis leading to redundancies, the museum group emphasised “record numbers of young visitors” toTate Modern(who cares about all those uncool visitors above the age of 35?).Yet in the summer, Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, blamed the group’s problems on a dearth of 16-24-year-old visitors from continental Europe. So they appeal to youth, but the wrong youth?This week, Tate Modern will open a blockbuster show that may attract paying adults. But Theatre Picasso draws almost entirely on the museum’s own collection of his works, which should be on permanent view in its free displays anyway, though for some time they have not.National Gallery accused of risking ‘bad blood’ with Tate over 20th-century artRead moreIt is a far cry from past exhibitions of Picasso and Matisse, Gauguin, Rauschenberg, and in 2022 Cézanne, boasting superb loans from museums all over the world. Why has Tate seemed to become so … small?Meanwhile, its rival, the National Gallery, is expanding. The Nationalannounced this weekthat it had accumulated the funds to build an entire new wing, and would drop its policy of collecting only pre-1900 art, reversing an agreement that only ever helped Tate. The gallery is openly poaching Tate’s territory after its Van Gogh exhibition established it as a world-class venue for modern art.This comes hot on the heels of a ravishing rehang this year from Cimabue to – yes – Picasso. It is going modern, and it even has a new Locatelli bar that seems to have floated in from Rome’s Termini station.TheNational Galleryand Tate’s approaches to modern art are very different. Tate Modern has always put the contemporary to the fore, refusing to emphasise early 20th-century “masters”. But the National can show how art was revolutionised between 1870 and 1920 against the deep history of the art it houses. It is perfectly placed to tell the tale Tate Modern does not, of how Cézanne inspired Picasso and Braque, how cubism sparked futurism and suprematism.View image in fullscreenThe National Gallery is to build a new wing and will drop its policy of collecting only pre-1900 art.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ShutterstockBut if it is to collect more modern art, it must stay serious. No purpose would be served by randomly showing a Jeff Koons or two. We don’t need a fifth Tate on Trafalgar Square.Meanwhile,Tate Liverpoolis closed for rebuilding and when I recently visited its temporary home, it felt like a deserted husk complete with grumpy caretaker. The only Tate where I can honestly say I had a good time lately was St Ives, and that was mostly for the views of the beach.Tate and the National both suffered in the Covid years but it is the older institution that has come out fighting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Turbine Hall commissions are still timed to the FriezeArtFair, even though Frieze is nothing like the event it once was.And it still insists on a definition of the modern that mostly means video, film, performance, installation despite the fact that art now is more eclectic, shifting easily from such media to painting, drawing and sculpture. Tracey Emin’s Tate Modern retrospective next year is a good sign, though, giving star treatment to an artist who has led the way back to painting.View image in fullscreenTate Britain currently stands not for a broad-based idea of British art, but one uninterested in most pre-1800 artistsPhotograph: Madeleine Buddo/TatePerhaps this is the real reason the National Gallery has the wind in its sails: we are not so sure what is avant garde or conservative any more, and the new, these days, is as likely to happen on canvas as on screen. There may be some catch-up in the shortlisting of the painter Mohammed Sami for this year’s Turner Prize, run by Tate Britain though staged this year in Bradford. Yet Tate needs more than a couple of moves in the right direction. It needs to break out of its rigid brand.The overwrought hang at Tate Britain, which has been widely and rightly criticised for its didactic wall texts and glib historical grandstanding, will have to be ditched at some point and replaced with rooms celebrating, rather than judging, 500 years of national artistic achievement.As for Tate Modern, it should tell the story of how modernism was born and evolved from fauvism to abstract expressionism with some sense of history, some reverence for greatness. Or if not, now is the time to consider giving its Picassos and Rothkos to the National Gallery.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsTate ModernTate BritainTate LiverpoolTate St IvesNational GalleryArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thearrest of a suspect, Tyler Robinson, has hardly settled the nerves, not when the revelation of any supposed political allegiances could touch off a fresh round of recriminations. The fear is that the country is about to descend into a new era of political violence, becoming a place where differences are settled not with words and argument but by guns and blood. After all, it has plumbed those depths before.The US was born in violence, fought a civil war less than a century after its founding and in living memory seemed to be on the brink of another one – with a spate of assassinations in the 1960s that took the lives of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Medgar Evers and John and Bobby Kennedy. That should provide some consolation, the knowledge that the country has been through this before and survived.And yet the comfort is scant, because these are different times. For one thing, guns are even more available now than they were then: there are more than 850m firearms in private hands in the world, and nearly half of those areowned by Americans. For every 100 Americans, there are120 guns.For another, today’s information supply is dominated by social media, amplifying the most extreme voices and rewarding the angriest sentiments. Where once the CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite couldbreak the newsof a presidential assassination and provide sombre balm, now grief is inflamed into fury, with footage of Kirk’s horrific shooting entering global circulation mere moments after his death.But the crucial difference is at the top. An act of political violence used to be met by a standard, reassuringly predictable response: the president would condemn it, grieve for the dead and their families, plead that there be no rush to judgment, and call for calm and for unity, insisting that Americans not give the killers what they want, which was division, but rather come together as fellow citizens of a republic they all loved. I heard versions of that speech, delivered at different moments by Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. On Wednesday night, Donald Trump chose an alternative path – one that proved that, as he later admitted to Fox News when asked about bringing the country together, he “couldn’t care less”.Instead, and at a time when no one was in custody and nothing at all was known of Kirk’s killer, Trump said the blame for his death lay with “the radical left”. It was its “rhetoric” that was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today”. The problem was not political violence in general, but “radical left political violence”.Put aside the inaccuracy of such a statement. Put aside the documented fact that not some, butallextremist-related killings in the US in 2024 wereconnected to rightwing extremism, just as they were in 2023 and in 2022. Put aside that, although Trump listed incidents in which figures associated with the right had been attacked, he pointedlydid not mentionand wilfully chose to ignore the murder of the DemocraticMinnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortmanand her husband in June; orthe arson attackon the home of the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, in April; or an earlier plot to kidnap the Democratic governor of Michigan.Put it all aside, even though it exposes the transparent falsity of Trump’s declaration that US political violence comes from one side only. Consider instead the likely effect of his words. At best, they add fuel to an already incendiary situation. At worst, they encourage retaliation and revenge.Witness Trump’s allies and cheerleaders. “We’re gonna avenge Charlie’s death,” promised Fox News host Jesse Watters.Elon Musk declared that“The Left is the party of murder”. A legion of other rightwing influencers have already taken this talk to its logical conclusion, announcing, as one put it, that “THIS IS WAR”. Could the message being sent to a furious and well-armed support base be any clearer?And notice something else Trump said on Wednesday. He pledged to find those “organisations that fund and support” what he classifies as political violence. Given that one of his closest aides said before Kirk’s murder that the Democratic party should be viewed as a “domestic extremist organisation”, it’s not hard to imagine who he will be coming for. Surely any group that opposes him.How should they – Democrats, liberals, the left – be responding to this moment of peril? So far they have observed the old norms, with almost every Democratic figure of any standing, whether former president or serving politician, offering the decent, human response: horror at such a brutal act, sympathy for Kirk’s wife and now-fatherless young children, fear for where this leaves the country. Watch MSNBC, or listen to the Pod Save crowd, and you’ll see that that’s how most of the leading lights in the anti-Trump universe have, rightly, responded. Any deviation from that normhas been punished.It is one of the asymmetries of the US culture wars that this etiquette, rigorously enforced from left to right, is not observed in the other direction. So when an intruder broke into the home of the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and nearly clubbed her husband, Paul, then 82, to death, the leading Republican in the country did not offer condemnation or words of consolation. No, Trump responded by makingrepeated jokesat Paul Pelosi’s expense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After an act of violence, Democrats must be gracious, empathetic and call for calm on all sides, whileRepublicanscan mock the victims, blame only one side and demand more violence. And there’s a further asymmetry: a single post from a random, anonymous user online will be treated as a statement from “the left”, while the outpourings of the right’s most powerful voices, in politics or the media, and including the president himself, somehow get a free pass.As part of this etiquette, it’s become poor taste to point out Kirk’s actual views. It’s as if the belief that no one should be killed for their opinions requires you to withhold any judgment of those opinions. But Kirk did not hold back. He was happy to tell people that he would be nervous getting on aplane flown by a Black pilot, and to talk of “prowling Blacks”; totell Taylor Swiftto “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband … You’re not in charge”; to deny the truth of the 2020 election; to recommend that children should watchpublic executions; and to suggest “Jewish dollars” were to blame for the spread of “cultural Marxism”.Many liberal luminaries have swerved past this back catalogue, preferringto express their admirationfor Kirk’s willingness to debate and his genuine gift for engaging the young. That has left the field clear for the right to redefine Kirk not as the extremist he was – and was proud to be – but as a paragon of civic participation, one who merits a posthumous presidential medal of freedom and a lowering of the flag. While the liberal left is observing the conventional pieties, the right is swiftly sanitising Kirk’s views and canonising him, hailing him as a martyr for the cause of what they insist is “simple common sense”. As a result, it will have moved theOverton windowyet further in its direction.These are dynamics Kirk knew well and that he was adroit at using to his advantage. He understood that a culture war inherently favours those willing to disregard the rules. It is a lesson that liberals and the left are, rightly, reluctant to learn – but that reluctance comes at an increasingly high price.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.“Personally, I think the clock is ticking,” one MP said. “It sometimes happens to people who are incredibly well meaning, but you can pass that tipping point and can’t recover.”It came as Lucy Powell, who was sacked from the cabinet in the reshuffle after Rayner’s departure and who is standing to replace her as deputy leader, called for a “change of culture” in a Downing Street she described as overly factional and error-prone.“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” Powelltold the Guardian.The only MP to go public in saying Starmer should go is Clive Lewis, a regular critic of the government from the left of the party.The Norwich South MP told BBC’s The Week in Westminster programme that Starmer had “lost control within the first year”, adding: “We don’t have the luxury of carrying on this way with someone who I think increasingly, I’m sorry to say, just doesn’t seem up to the job.”Allies of Starmer are urging a sense of proportion. “No one is oblivious to the scale of the challenge or the need to be better, least of all Keir,” one said. “We know it’s a difficult time and MPs are worried about their own majorities. We’re more aware than anyone that things are very febrile.”It comes ahead of another potentially tricky week for Starmer, which includes the state visit to the UK for Donald Trump, who is both hugely unpredictable and unpopular withLabourMPs. The US president and his wife, Melania, will arrive on Tuesday evening, and be greeted by James Roscoe, Mandelson’s interim replacement as UK ambassador to the US.With morale described as very low in the parliamentary party, some of the anger has centred around Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, who has been blamed for No 10’s initialdefence of Mandelson– something one government source denied – and for being central to a narrow, clique-based ruling faction.One minister said: “The one person who is the constant through every bad decision since 24 July [last year] is Morgan. Maybe the PM keeps getting rid of the wrong people.”But other MPs, including some who are normally loyal, are increasingly questioning whether Starmer can lead the party out of its current slump in the polls.“The problem is Keir,” one normally loyal MP said. “He doesn’t have any judgment, he doesn’t make an effort to speak to MPs, let alone ministers. Unless Keir has a personality transplant and majorly changes things, I don’t know how he is going to improve. For the first time I’ve begun to wonder if he is going to be the leader at the next election.”Another backbencher said: “So far this has been Keir on his own terms, with us doing everything that he wants, other than welfare reform, and it’s driven our poll ratings absolutely into the toilet.“He’s replaced everyone, at every level, and everything keeps going the same direction. The only conclusion can be that the PM just has terrible judgment.”One MP from the usually loyal contingent of 2024 entrants said: “It’s not a happy parliamentary party at the moment.The only person less popular than Keir Starmer in my constituency is Rachel Reeves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And earlier this week Ed Balls said on his podcast that his wife, Yvette Cooper, had found her move from home secretary to foreign secretary “frustrating”.“He’s moved all the people who are loyal to him into ministerial or PPS roles, with the end result being that he’s now got no one really left in the backbenches fighting his corner, and put a load of pissed-off ex-ministers there instead,” one minister said“If we were 20 points ahead in the polls, people would probably suck it up. But if we bomb next May, I can’t really see Keir surviving that without at least a challenge.”For many MPs, the next key moment will be this month’s Labour conference in Liverpool, where they are hoping for signs of change. “I’ve never known the mood in the parliamentary Labour party to be this bad,” one said. “The normally loyal are furious.”“We know that things like this knock you off course. It’s bad and we have to get back on track,” a Downing Street source said.The ally of Starmer said the prime minister was well aware of the task he faced: “He knows we need to do a huge amount of work to rebuild relations with the party, and to do a better job of conveying what he wants to do to the public. We think that conference will help with that.”TheScotland secretary, Douglas Alexander, told BBC Breakfast on Friday morning that he understood why Labour MPs were “despondent”, saying that “nothing justifies” Mandelson’s appointment “in light of what has now emerged”.He added: “These are not the headlines any of us in government or in parliament would have chosen or wanted. But the fact is when the evidence emerged, action had to be taken and we are looking forward, therefore, to moving on.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourAngela RaynerPeter MandelsonnewsShareReuse this content"

But then I grew up to learn through military service the impact and responsibility that comes with service. It’s the purpose of serving others that has saved me.”View image in fullscreenPrince Harry embraces Oksana Ilnytska, whose husband, Serhii Ilnytskyi, the team captain at the Invictus Games in Sydney 2018, was killed in 2023.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHarry said he had come to Kyiv to show his support for the country and all the veterans who were now recovering and rehabilitating from their injuries.“We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.“We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”Earlier this year it was estimated that theUkrainewar had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry lays flowers in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, where a missile strike in June killed more than 20 people.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and chief executive of the Superhumans trauma centre in Lviv, which treats wounded amputees. He visited the centre in April, but met Rudnieva by chance a couple of months ago in the US.“I bumped into Olga in New York,” he said. “It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said: ‘The biggest impact you could have is coming to Kyiv.’ I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”The prince has toured Kyivsince arriving this morning, meeting veterans and visiting areas bombed by Russian drones and missiles.In the afternoon, he laid a wreath at a flower and flag memorial to the war dead that has sprung up, and continues to grow, in Kyiv’s Maidan Square.One of those waiting to meet the prince was the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarína Mathernová, whose embassy was bombed last month.View image in fullscreenHarry holds a division flag given him by a war veteran at Kyiv’s National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMathernová said the prince had become very popular in Ukraine, despite having visited the country only once before. “I think he is associated with veterans and the Invictus Games,” she said. “It’s not easy to come here during the war. People appreciate the personal time he has taken and the attention it brings.”Ukraine first took part in the Invictus Games in 2017, but Ukrainians’ enthusiasm for the competition, which was founded by the prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.Harry remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out.“Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield.“It means so much to us, because it means so much to them,” he said.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry on the train from Poland to Kyiv. Ukraine.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDuring the trip, the prince was due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He was also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.Travelling to Kyiv would give him the chance to see some of the destruction first-hand, he said.While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become a key function in veterans’ healthcare.“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy,” she added.Explore more on these topicsUkrainePrince HarryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The text states: “We condemn the attacks perpetrated on 7 October by Hamas against civilians,” and “Hamas must release all hostages” held in Gaza.Israel, the US, Hungary and Argentina were among the countries voting against. There were 12 abstentions.The vote for the declaration will be seen as paving the way for the one-day UN conference on a two-state solution, due to be held in New York immediately before the UN general assembly high level week. At that conference a host of states, including France, UK, Canada and Australia, will formally recognise the state of Palestine.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, insisted on Thursday that Israel would never accept a Palestinian state. Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.Germany and Italy remain the two large European countries holding out against recognition of a Palestine state, although the Italian coalition government is increasingly divided on the issue. Five European countries have now banned allimports from illegal Israeli settlements.The declaration states: “In the context of the end of the war in Gaza, Hamas must cease exercising its authority over the Gaza Strip and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with the support and cooperation of the international community, in accordance with the objective of a sovereign and independent State of Palestine.”It also mentions the deployment of a “temporary international stabilisation mission” under a mandate from the UN security council to protect the population, support the strengthening of the capacities of the Palestinian state and provide “security guarantees to Palestine and Israel”.Hamas has said that it will not agree to disarm unless a sovereign Palestinian state is established.Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, on Friday said the resolution was not a serious attempt at peacemaking. “This is not diplomacy, this is theatre, a carefully staged performance for headlines and not peace.”The UN security council on Thursday condemned airstrikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, without naming Israel.Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, is due to meet Donald Trump on Friday, when he will be able to investigate exactly what the US knew aboutthe attack on Hamas in Doha, and whether US fighter jets at the giant US airbase in Qatar could have moved to repel the Israeli jets.The Qatari diplomats are likely to seek guarantees that Hamas negotiators will not be attacked again either in Qatar, Turkey or Egypt. Trump has said he was not happy with Israel’s actions, but also welcomed efforts to remove Hamas.Qatar is holding an Arab-Islamic summit in Doha on Sunday to discuss a collective regional response to Israel, and there is pressure on the United Arab Emirates to suspend the Abraham accords, the cooperation agreement that it signed with Israel in September 2020.The UAE summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday to express its displeasure over Israel’s attack on Hamas leaders.Dr Anwar Gargash, a senior UAE diplomat, warned Israel at the security council on Thursday: “These reckless belligerent actions will deliver neither Israel nor the region our shared goal for peace, prosperity, security and stability. They only serve to fuel more violence, extremism, and chaos – precisely when the region desperately needs restraint and de-escalation.“Furthermore, the relentless threats of land annexation and attacks on neighbouring countries destroys any foundation for lasting peace, and threatens the entire region’s stability.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

She added: “I have a friend who calls it ‘the licence to kill bill’.”MPsvoted in Juneto allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to be helped to end their lives, in a historic move that could transform end-of-life care. After scrutiny by a committee of MPs, peers now have an opportunity to debate the legislation in detail, recommend amendments or even reject the bill outright, though the last is seen as unlikely.May was one of about 190 peers scheduled to speak in a two-day debate, the first day of which attracted passionate and emotional arguments on both sides as many peers described the painful deaths of loved ones and friends.Opening the debate on Friday, Charlie Falconer said it was the duty of the Lords to pass the legislation because MPs had voted in favour and “the public want this”.Calling it a “historic occasion”, Falconer said the current law was “confused, causes terrible suffering and lacks compassion and safeguards”, adding: “This bill before us has already given hope to those with personal experience of the injustice of the current law.”He was backed by Dawn Primarolo, a former Labour public health minister, who said it was the “fundamental right of the individual to exercise agency and autonomy over their own lives”.Primarolo said: “Denying the ultimate right to end one’s life in peace and dignity in the manner and circumstances of one’s choosing, when the alternative is so scary and appalling, is not being compassionate. We need to facilitate this bill.”The former Conservative home secretary Kenneth Baker also spoke in support, saying it would be “wonderful” if dying people could instead rely on a choice of palliative care, as many of those opposed suggested, “but it’s totally unrealistic. It’ll cost billions. Is the Labour party or the Conservative party going to say in their next manifesto, we will spent billions on palliative care? It just won’t happen.”Others argued equally passionately against the bill. Some opposed in principle, while others said the form of legislation under discussion, introduced as a private member’s bill by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, was flawed and lacking in safeguards.The bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, a former government’s chief nursing officer, said: “If passed, this bill will signal that we are a society that believes that some lives are not worth living. It is the role of this house to scrutinise, but there are no amendments to this bill that can safeguard us completely from its negative effects.”The crossbench peer Kishwer Falkner said that having been diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer last year, she felt that she had “glimpsed the grim reaper through my hospital window in a morphine-induced haze”. Though she previously supported assisted dying, she said, the current bill raised many questions. Falkner said: “I do wish we did not have to deal with this flawed bill, but we will do so in good faith.”Peers will continue to debate the bill on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingTheresa MayHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.The Met’s handling of the scandal,with one officer being promoted, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed totransform the cultureof Britain’s biggest police force.Stephen Lawrence’s mother makes plea for witnesses as review beginsRead moreThe new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.Sadiq Khan, the mayor ofLondon, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report.

In January,AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facilityin Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced itwould invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country intoa “global science and technology superpower” by 2030.Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe,scrapped a £1bn London research centreas well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned thatother big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investingin the UK.He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi,told the GuardianBritain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It claimed that Joell-Deshields’s conduct since being put on a leave of absence risked “irreparable damage” to the prospects of future parades.The suspended chief executive “is known to have breached a number of contractual obligations owed by him in his capacity as an employee in relation to company property/confidential information and threatens to continue to do so unless restrained”, it was claimed in legal documents.During a hearing, Marc Brittain, representing Joell-Deshields, said that his client would consent to an order forcing him to hand over company property but that this did not prejudice his defence against Pride’s legal claim for breach of contract or any other wrongdoing, which he denies.A separate legal claim is being pursued by Pride against its suspended chief executive.London’s annual Pride parade is the largest LGBTQ+ event in the UK and attracts about 30,000 participants. Joell-Deshields has been chief executive since 2022.The Guardian revealed earlier this month thatJoell-Deshields had been suspendedat the end of August over a series of allegations of impropriety, including that he had bought luxury perfumes with food and drink vouchers donated by a sponsor for use by Pride volunteers.He is currently under internal investigation. Pride had claimed that Joell-Deshields had refused demands to hand over company property. It claimed that this included “the passwords, usernames and access information required to operate the applicant’s bank accounts, social media accounts and other digital or electronic facilities”.The court ordered that Joell-Deshields hand over his mobile phone and laptop to an independent investigator examining allegations against him as well as the passwords cited in the application.According to Pride, Joell-Deshields is accused of “misuse of company funds for his own personal benefit; financial mismanagement of the company’s funds (including misreporting of its financial activities and lack of oversight of expenditure)” as well as “bullying and safeguarding failures in relation to volunteers who provide services to the applicant and a fundamental attempt to conceal, and evade accountability”.Joell-Deshields’s lawyer did not submit a skeleton argument to the court as he had been hired just 24 hours before the hearing.Pride in London is financed by a £625,000 five-year grant from the London mayor as well as its own fundraising.Concerns about governance and the conduct of the chief executive were raised in June. This was followed by a formal whistleblowing disclosure by a group of volunteer directors at the end of last month. A new board was set up at the end of August.Among the allegations was the potential misuse of some of the £30,000 worth of food and drink vouchers provided by an unnamed sponsor for volunteers.According to the volunteer directors, the sponsor’s head of ethics and compliance had written on 18 February to the legal director at Pride in London to say that the company’s fraud systems had detected that two accounts had used £7,125 of the vouchers on luxury items.The items included an Apple HomePod, Apple AirPods and cologne, including Creed Aventus, which has a retail price of at least £165, and Burberry Hero, which starts at £118 a bottle.According to the whistleblowers, the sponsor advised the legal director that “the pattern and nature of the transactions strongly suggested personal – rather than organisational – benefit”.One of the two accounts flagged was that of Joell-Deshields.Pride in London commissioned external lawyers to investigate, according to the directors’ letter, and an interim report was written.According to the letter, the report states that Joell-Deshields claimed the vouchers were used for gifts and prizes for raffles and that the HomePod was used in the office and at “pop up” events.Joell-Deshields’s barrister said he denied any wrongdoing.A spokesperson for Pride for London said: “Today’s outcome will ensure that our staff and volunteers can continue to carry out their invaluable work without undue obstruction. We remain focused on our service of the LGBTQ+ community of London, and working towards a successful Pride in London 2026.”Explore more on these topicsPrideLondonLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

But their family and friends could offer no explanation, nor could hotel staff at the Carlton hotel in Prestwick, where the event took place in November 2021. An appeal onFacebooklikewise yielded no clues.Eventually, with the mystery still niggling, Wylie asked the popular Scottish content creator Dazza to cast the online net wider – and a sheepish Andrew Hillhouse finally stepped forward.In his explanatory post on Facebook, Hillhouse admitted that he had been “cutting it fine, as I’m known to do” when he pulled up at the wedding venue with five minutes to spare. Spotting a piper and other guests, he followed them into the hotel – “I remember thinking to myself: ‘Cool, this is obviously the right place’” – unaware that he had the address completely wrong and was supposed to be at a ceremony 2 miles away in Ayr.View image in fullscreenMichelle and John enjoy their wedding, unaware of the crasher.Photograph: Courtesy Michelle Wylie/SWNSHe was initially unperturbed to find himself surrounded by strangers as the ceremony began – at the marriage he was due to attend, the only person he knew was the bride, Michaela, while his partner, Andrew, was part of the wedding party. It was when an entirely different bride came walking down the aisle that he realised: “OMG that’s not Michaela … I was at the wrong wedding!”Hillhouse said: “You can’t exactly stand up and walk out of a wedding mid-ceremony, so I just had to commit to this act and spent the next 20 minutes awkwardly sitting there trying to be as inconspicuous as my 6ft 2 ass could be.”At the end of the ceremony, Hillhouse, who is from Troon, was hoping to make a discreet exit, only to be waylaid by the wedding photographer, who insisted he join other guests for a group shot.

It is the first project from Enninful’s new venture EE72, a media and entertainment company he set up in May with his sister, the talent agent Akua Enninful. On the magazine’s mastheadEdward Enninfulis credited as chief creative officer, cementing his pivot from editor to entrepreneur.Speaking to the Guardian, Enninful said he wanted to “create something tactile, timeless and collectible by creating an object that honours traditional media with an unconventional approach to modern storytelling. While people say print is dead, I believe the opposite – print has become more powerful than ever and an art form that must be preserved.”Enninful is known for his starry contacts book and the magazine’s front cover reads like an extract. Fronting the issue isJulia Roberts, who is interviewed by George Clooney. In a behind-the-scenes video on Instagram, Roberts says to Enninful: “You left your other job, so I left your other job and now we’re both at your new job together.”View image in fullscreenThe front cover of the first issue of 72 magazine, featuring Julia Roberts.Photograph: PR Image/Craig McDean/72 MagazineIn place of coverlines that usually describe the features inside a magazine is a list of 20 celebrity names including Pharrell Williams, Oprah Winfrey, the Italian film director Luca Guadagnino, Gwyneth Paltrow and the American painter Amy Sherald.Its launch comes a week afterChloe Mallewas appointed the head of editorial content at American Vogue, succeeding Anna Wintour, who announced she wasstepping back as editor-in-chiefin July. Malle, a long-term Vogue veteran, has said she plans to reduce its print frequency, creating instead more collectible editions.The publication has recently been criticised by fashion fans for becoming too mainstream. Its latest issue, which landed on shelves on Monday, co-stars the models Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner. Malledescribedher recent digital cover story on Lauren Sanchez Bezos as a “calculated risk”.The PR consultant and author Mark Borkowski says Enninful’s rebrand would have been carefully considered. In June 2023 when he announced he was leaving BritishVogueafter six years as editor-in-chief in addition to four years as European editorial director of Vogue, there were rumours Enninful had been forced out after a power struggle with Wintour. “There were obituary-type pieces written about Enninful,” Borkowski says. “Some felt he had risen to a pedestal he wasn’t worthy of.”Now it appears we are entering the era of rivalry 2.0. For anyone who thought Enninful had fallen off his path to rise to the top of the fashion chain, this phoenix-like comeback hints that he believes his journey is not over.“The launch shows he is a very powerful person and influencer,” Borkowski says. “But being an entrepreneur brings added baggage. You are not the product of an empire. Now it’s about the quality of the team he builds. Every move he makes will be pored over. He cannot fail.”If the other names on the masthead seem familiar, it is because many used to appear under Enninful’s own at British Vogue. Sarah Harris, who spent more than 20 years at Condé Nast and worked under Alexandra Shulman (Enninful’s predecessor at Vogue), is EE72’s editorial director.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Friday in an interview withBloomberg, Enninful said he never wanted Wintour’s job. “I wanted my own thing. I wanted to create something for the next generation. And that’s why I left.”September is historically the most important month in fashion with magazines at their heaviest, laden with new season luxury advertising. But there is not a single one in 72 magazine. A spokesperson described it as a “strategic decision” and “a direct challenge to the advertising-dependent model that’s been constraining editorial creativity for years”. They declined to comment when asked if there were paid product placements or if brands paid for shoots.Harris describes the opportunity to work with Enninful again as “a no-brainer”. She says the biggest difference from going from a legacy brand “with established systems, relationships and ways of working” to what Enninful describes as a startup is the decision-making process. “You make decisions quickly and don’t waste time on corporate processes. We’re not bound by precedent or traditional hierarchies that restrict innovative thinking. This gives us the freedom to be organically responsive to culture as it’s happening.”Features inside the £15 magazine’s 111 pages span fashion to wellness to arts and culture. Marc Jacobs shares his bedtime routine. A beauty shoot features a $24 (£17.70) toothpaste and an unbrandedGLP-1 medicationpen. And there is a three-page spread dedicated to a shoot featuring a Moncler collection designed by Enninful himself.Jeremy Leslie, an art director and founder ofMagCulture, an online platform and shop that specialises in independent magazines, says 72 is lacking a “a vital spark” and “not the anticipated mould-breaking launch”. Instead he says today’s successful print magazines “produce biannual issues with twice the number of pages, invest in special print effects and strong typography, and mix glossy and matt paper throughout their pages”. He also finds the lack of advertising “baffling”.Editorial independence has become somewhat of a grey area when it comes to glossies. Most recently, Vogue was called out online for its September issue featuring Emma Stone wearing only Louis Vuitton over a 12-page spread. The actor has been an ambassador for the French brand since 2017. A spokesperson for Voguedescribed itas an “entirely editorial” decision without commercial influence.On 72’s back cover, a much-desired slot for brands to gain maximum exposure, there is another shot of Roberts. This time she is grinning. With rumours swirling about Wintour’s next move and Vogue downsizing, some are wondering if Enninful may have the last laugh after all.Explore more on these topicsEdward EnninfulMagazinesVogueNewspapers & magazinesJulia RobertsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But how different is he to Alan Partridge really? Ahead of the presenter’s new show about mental health, Coogan is put in the psychologist’s chairFri 12 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe line between Steve Coogan andAlan Partridgeis a blurry one. The love of cars. The clothes. They’ve both done their own live arena tours. They even share a face. But if you ever needed proof that they’re not actually the same, it’s the fact that when I meet him for breakfast at his London hotel, he’s not at the buffet with an oversized plate, the staff aren’t giggling at him, and we’re not in a Travel Tavern.We’re here to talk about his new show, How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge). It’s the latest instalment in the wider Partridge universe in which he presentsdigital radio,writes books, successfullypodcasts,goes on tour, and made his BBC comeback on magazine programmeThis Time.(The character is now co-written with the Gibbons brothers, rather than Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham.)This time round we meet an altogether happier, wiser Partridge 3.0. He’s no longer in the public eye, but “finds a steady stream of Norfolk-based corporate work just as fulfilling. On the face of it, my life is great,” we learn. “I’ve got a large house,” – he lives in the oasthouse from his podcast – “my partner Katrina [played brilliantly by Katherine Kelly] is one of the fittest women over 40 in Norfolk.”View image in fullscreenNorfolk legend … Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.Photograph: Rob Baker Ashton/BBC/Baby CowThe show is a documentary, self-funded by Pear Tree Factual Productions, as he explores the topic of mental health: something else that Partridge is dealing with personally. He presents to camera. He conducts vox pops, hosts focus groups and interviews local experts. There are infographics. There’s behind-the-scenes stuff with (yes!) Lynn. He attempts to reconcile with Sidekick Simon (Tim Key), who has had enough of Partridge’s constant criticism, in the name of mental health. He visits a book club and takes to the air wearing a jet pack. Forget Partridge 3.0. This is Partridge 4.0 and a half.Given the theme of the new show, what I really want to get to grips with is Coogan’s inner Partridge. I’ve come armed with therapy-style questions. My thinking is: if I don’t have Coogan in tears with repressed emotion by the end of the interview, I haven’t done my job properly.Things start well when Coogan’s press woman (who disappointingly looks nothing like Lynn) introduces me with a mention of the Guardian’srecent autumn TV preview, which (correctly) claims Partridge to be “the greatest comedy character ever produced by the UK.”“No pressure then,” smiles Coogan.“Alan’s definitely more popular than me. That’s a given,” he says when I ask if he’s jealous of Partridge’s universal appeal. “He also wants to be liked by as many people as possible. I don’t care about that. I want enough people to like me so that I’m allowed to exist.“As you get older, I do feel like Idon’thave to be to everyone’s taste. I’m OK with some people finding me irritating. When something has really gotten under my skin, rather than get broadsided for it, I’ll have Alan be the champion of the thing I loathe, but in a funny way. You can’t just have a big psychological wank. That’s not entertainment. But it’s a good starting point.”What advice would Coogan give Partridge on this chapter of his life?“I would say: ‘Don’t try and be something you’re not. You’re never going to host Newsnight. Lean into what you’ve got.’”What would Alan say to the seven-year-old Alan Partridge – and what would Coogan say to his younger self?“[Alan would say:] It’s going to be OK. They will all be proved wrong. You will win.”And Coogan? “It’s not a million miles away. I did have an odd childhood,” he continues. “I was quite sociable and popular, but lazy. I’m an autodidact. What drives me is the class thing. I have deep-seeded class issues, but I don’t mind, because they’re part of the engine. I used to have low expectations of myself. I’d get from one place to another place career-wise, then think: ‘I wonder if I can get over here?’ There’s been times when I’ve turned down quick money. I’ve never done any panel shows. I watch Would I Lie to You? with my mum and think it’s really funny, but I don’t want to go on it. I don’t have the personality …”Why doesn’t he think he has a personality?“I’ve got a personality. But I’m notapersonality. I have to talk about this shit to get people to watch it,” he says, of days when he’s forced to meet the press. “Sometimes people, like you, ask me questions I haven’t thought about before, and that gets folded back into my work, because I’ll think: ‘Oh yeah, that’s why I do that …’”View image in fullscreenA good match? Katherine Kelly as Katrina with Coogan in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: Matt Frost/BBC/Baby CowQuestions like what?“Well, the direct parallel about what Alan and I would say to our younger selves. It makes me think of the sixth-form common room. Maybe this is [a bit] Alan Partridge, I don’t know. Forty years ago, I remember thinking: ‘I could be part of the next generation of comedy. Why don’t I do whatever it is you’re supposed to do and see if that happens? And if it doesn’t, at least I know I tried.’”If Alan was on the therapy couch, what would he be trying to get to the nub of?“I think he would masquerade as emotionally open. But all the things he would confess to would be completely risk free. He’d be posturing. His vulnerability isn’t real vulnerability. It’s affected.”I crank it up. A therapist might say: “Steve, you are using Alan as an avatar. What’s the story you’re not telling yourself?”“I’m reasonably happy as me,” says Coogan. “I look around and think I have lots to be grateful for, so that keeps me grounded. Idoaccept that Alan is an unfiltered, unmitigated, unedited version of me. What’s the story I’m not telling myself? It might be that I don’t really want to fully understand the dysfunctions of my personality. All I know is it works when I shovel it into this avatar, so why mess with it?”Everybody wears masks, I point out, it’s just that Coogan wears one so publicly.“I am self-aware in a way that Alan isn’t,” he says. “Sometimes when I’m speaking to well-educated southerners, my northern accent will fade away. When I’m talking to horny-handed sons of toil from up north, it suddenly comes back. It’s either rank hypocrisy or it’s empathy. I prefer the latter.”Does that apply to subject matter too?“My daughter, Clare, says: ‘You’ve got to stop talking about your midlife crisis. You are way past that.’ Alan is lockstep with whatever will give him the least grief. He’s quite Starmer-esque in that respect. I get angry and sanctimonious. I get incensed and descend into slagging people off. I don’t trust myself in that regard. There’s a catharsis in doing Alan. Some of his world view I fundamentally disagree with. But there will be something that I’ll be glad to put the Alan wig on so I can say it out loud.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a catharsis in doing Alan’ … Coogan with Felicity Montagu as Lynn in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)./BBC/Baby CowDoes he ever seehimselfas a fictional character? For example, Lorraine Kellysuccessfully claimedfor tax reasons that she appears as “a chatty personality”?“Really? Wow!” This is news to Coogan. “I say things as Alan that are not true, like he had a fight in a car park with Noel Edmonds. The BBC lawyers say: ‘That’s slander.’ How am I slandering someone by saying they had a fight in a car park with a fictional character?”How long before the circles of the Venn diagram of Coogan/Partridge overlap completely?“Maybe they’ll eclipse before passing over each other.” He tells a story of arriving in his trailer to find a blue, checked Aubin and Wills shirt to wear while playing Partridge – which was identical to the one he was already wearing. “I did take mine off and put the other one on, even though there was no one to witness me. There was a time when I was writing with Armando and Pete when I’d say something as myself, and they’d just write it down as Partridge and it would irritate me. Now the Gibbons do it all the time. As you get older, you realise it’s all gravy.”What life lessons has Partridge taught Coogan?“To be kinder to people.”I glance at the clock: we’re coming up to 45 minutes, which seems like a good cut-off point for a pseudo therapy session. One last question. Will Coogan mind that, when he dies, his obituary will probably say: “best known for playing Alan Partridge?”“It would be nice if they filled in some of the other details,” he laughs. “I remember, as a child, watching Fawlty Towers. It would fill the house with laughter for half an hour, we’d switch off the TV, have a cup of tea and dissect it, to make sure it was imprinted on your memory. It was an event. I remember thinking: how amazing it would be to create something like that. I did that with Alan Partridge. If that’s what I’m remembered for, that’s fine with me.”How Are You?

This is the man who plays Mr Farouk, quite beautifully, in the phenomenally successful Netflix seriesHeartstopper. He’s an established stage actor and has featured in a number of director Jamie Lloyd’s recent blockbuster theatre productions, from memorable turns in Lloyd’s bold new versions ofCyrano de BergeracandRomeo and Juliet– where Taleghani’s skill as a rap artist helped him shine in the director’s stripped-back, miked-up productions.This month, Taleghani will be the very first playwright to have a debut play staged on the vast Olivier stage at London’sNational Theatre. To top it all off, the production – a ferociously original, rap-infused take on Euripides’ Greek tragedy The Bacchae – will open Indhu Rubasingham’s inaugural season as the National’s new artistic director.It’s a big deal. Yet as our conversation unfolds in a small side room at the complex, the 32-year-old writer-actor seems remarkably relaxed. There’s something about Taleghani, with his silver chain and twinkling sense of mischief, that seems to exist on the edge of things – a place where all that noise and fuss can’t reach him. “I’m quite a cool cookie really,” he says. “I’m not too tied to the idea that if something good happens, my life is good, and if it doesn’t, my life is bad.”View image in fullscreenUkweli Roach as Dionysus.Photograph: Marc BrennerTaleghani’s parents emigrated from Iran before he was born. He grew up on Elthorne estate in north London and, in his teens, very nearly got expelled from his comprehensive school. In a lovely quirk of fate, it was Taleghani’s drama teacher (who just happened to be the excellent playwright Vivienne Franzmann) who pulled her student back into the fold with the stern words: “You’re good at this. Take it seriously.” And so he did, focusing on his studies a little bit more and messing around in class just a little bit less. Through it all, Taleghani was always interested in rap and rhyme: rapping “badly” in the playground or on the street corner with his friends.After some decent GCSE results, Taleghani “hustled and rascalled” his way into sixth form and eventually landed a place studying English literature at Warwick University. He didn’t always feel comfortable at Warwick and turned to spoken word to help him fit in with a literary crowd: “It was my way of introducing myself to this community I wasn’t used to being around. Because I was different from them. And I knew it.”While studying at Warwick, Taleghani wrote one of his final Shakespeare modules in the form of rap. He was keen to test himself and see if he could do things the “traditional” way – but he also felt there were much more truthful ways to express himself. So Taleghani turned to rap, kickstarting a merging of classical content and contemporary form that has run like an electric thread through his early acting career.View image in fullscreenRoach and Reuben Johnson in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerAfter a master’s in English at University College London, there followed a flurry of acting work in the theatre. This included a particularly memorable Slung Low production ofThe White Whale,stagedon a floating platform at Leeds dock. “It was for 500 people a night and it was free,” he says. “It was for the people and to serve the community. That spirit has stayed with me.” The work made a strong impression, but it was Taleghani’s time atHaringey Shed, when he was still at school, that was truly formative. “That was my first experience of theatre: a bunch of underprivileged kids and young people with different types of disabilities. The whole ethos was: what can we do with who we are and what we have? It was really raw and honest.”If the play’s not good it’s a brutal experience, especially if you feel out of place in those environmentsTaleghani doesn’t raise his voice at this point – he’s far too relaxed for that – but his eyes gleam brighter still. “Watching that type of theatre always gets me so much more emotional and moved than 99% of supposed ‘theatre’. That type of theatre isn’t honest. It’s mannered. Trained. Sculpted. Whereas with Haringey Shed theatre, I believe it. It moves me more when you don’t hit the note perfectly.”Taleghani’s very first authored play nearly didn’t happen. During lockdown, a producer asked the actor – a rising star thanks to his sparkling turn in Heartstopper – if he’d ever considered writing for theatre. No, was his quick reply. “I wasn’t really interested. Being a playwright isn’t my thing. You have to care. There has to be a sense of love. Just because there’s an opportunity there, it doesn’t mean you should take it.”View image in fullscreenSharon Small playing Agave and Clare Perkins as Vida in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerIn fact, Taleghani still seems fairly sceptical about theatre in general. “Cinema’s cool because you can go and have your popcorn and Coke and even if the film isn’t good, you have a good time.” he says. “But if the play’s not good it’s a brutal experience, especially if you feel out of place in those environments. It’s just compounding the tragedy of theatre!”But the playwriting queries kept coming in from producers aware of Taleghani’s rising profile as an actor and talent with rap and spoken word. So Taleghani decided to take another look at The Bacchae – about Dionysus, the Greek god of theatre, wine and general excess, who travels from Asia to Thebes to prove his godliness – and something finally clicked. ‘“I connected with the idea that a god could be a refugee. What does it say about society’s tendency to other people, that even a god can be an outcast? And what kind of god moves from where they’re revered, to somewhere they’re treated like shit? I found that really moving.”Taleghani was determined to do something more with Dionysus’s chorus of followers, the Bacchae, who are “basically just backup dancers” in the original. Not so in Taleghani’s version, where each member of the female chorus has a sharply defined reason to leave their country. Their reasons for fleeing read like mini plays in their own right: one woman “chopped the left bollock off a touchy-feely priest”; another escaped a stoning orchestrated by her own brother; and a third sliced her husband’s face off with a razor after he tried to “rob her oesophagus of its oxygen”.As I sit in on rehearsals on a blazing summer afternoon, Dionysus (Ukweli Roach) is meeting with his band of Bacchae. The very first cue I hear director Rubasingham utter to her huge ensemble cast is: “Can we have a bigger reaction after the word ‘dickhead’?” This is swiftly followed by: “Can we go from, ‘Shut up you shitty little dentist?’” The air crackles with possibility. Everyone in the vast company, including DJ Walde on the decks in one corner and choreographer Kate Prince in the other, seems utterly at ease but excited, too, and buzzing with ideas.The flashes of dialogue I catch are vivid. Bold. Full of defiance and humour. The writing feels dynamic and instinctive, but Taleghani’s first attempt at playwriting didn’t always come easily. He laughs as he recalls his moments of doubt throughout the drafting process, but there’s vulnerability in there too. “I was getting really frustrated,” he says. “Feeling so stupid. Embarrassed. Ashamed. ‘Who do I think I am? Why am I trying to do this? I’m not the person for the job.’” He lets off another brittle laugh. “If I’d submitted my work and they’d said it was rubbish, I would’ve agreed with them. Of course it is! It’s my first draft and I haven’t even googled how to write a play!”At one point, deep into the playwriting process, Taleghani quit altogether. But thanks to support from Rubasingham and her team of dramaturgs, as well as a frenzied co-codamol-fuelled redrafting session while recovering from a minor operation at home – the play kept driving forward.Now, only a year after Taleghani and Rubasingham first met, Bacchae is landing on the Olivier stage with a bang. It comes amid promises of a “new chapter” for the National Theate. Fresh perspectives. An awful lot of press and pressure. Not that Taleghani is taking any notice of all that. “My friends from drama school have much more of a reverence for the NationalTheatre.” He lets out another cheeky chuckle: “I don’t have that. That heritage hasn’t been passed down to me. It isn’t in my body or my bones. So I can just get to work.”Bacchaeis at theNational Theatre: Olivier, London, 13 Septemberto1 November.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But whatever job next month’s Netflix documentary focuses on – details are scant, but it’s thought the early October series will end at her Paris catwalk show – she will always be scrutinised over how she looks. How to temper that? Wear a plain white shirt.View image in fullscreenThe Princess of Wales visits the Natural History Museum’s gardens.Photograph: WPA/GettyThe documentary poster released this week shows Beckham wearing a diamond tennis bracelet, open-collar white shirt – and nothing else. Last week, the Princess of Wales appeared in public at the Natural History Museum, also in a plain white shirt. Earlier this month, the Duchess of Sussex launched her Netflix series in a white shirt (one of seven in fact), and when Taylor Swift recently announced her new album she did so wearing a white shirt. Laura Dern wore hers twice at the Venice film festival, and the woman with the most enviable wardrobe in fashion – Sarah Jessica Parker – chose abillowingversion to promote her role as Booker prize judge.In a pleasing twist, Kate and Meghan’s shirts were from the same British brand, With Nothing Underneath, which has grown by 130% this year owing to a roaring trade in oversized three-figure poplin numbers. At the cheaper end, sales of white shirts shot up 33% this month at John Lewis. An open-back version is the big hit at Hush this week, while a more fitted version was among the bestsellers for the newly relaunched The White Company.View image in fullscreenLaura Dern sported a white shirt twice at this year’s Venice film festival.Photograph: Mark Cape Insidefoto/ShutterstockA relatively unappreciated garment redolent of boardrooms, the crisp white shirt briefly lost its place in the working woman’s wardrobe during the pandemic before returning in a new context. That is, “slightly oversized and worn without a jacket”, says Naomi Pike, commissioning editor of Elle and a white-shirt wearer.‘Print has become more powerful than ever’: Edward Enninful launches new magazineRead more“It’s classic back-to-school energy, however grown up you are, so I suppose that means the antithesis of summer dressing.” Whether you’re promoting a new TV show or a lifestyle guru making french toast, “it’s the easiest way to show you’re back – and back at it”.Beckham, who wore a white one throughout the 2023 Beckham documentary, has always deferred to shirts. Her 2019 collection featured at least five different styles. But as someone who has always understood image creation, she understands the difference between power dressing and soft-power dressing, says Pike, who describes white shirts as workwear that somehow hides in plain sight.“It’s completely background, it’s silent, but it does the heavy lifting with not much effort,” she says. Despite its formality, the white shirt relies on the whims of context: worn with a jacket, it feels staid. Worn on its own, it’s pulled together without being corporate. If you undo some buttons like Victoria, or roll up the sleeves like Meghan, or hide it under a jumper likeGwyneth Paltrowat the Michael Kors show this week, “there is no item of clothing which can be changed with so little effort”.Its power, says Pike, is in its nothingness. These are women who can afford to wear anything. But when men wear one, “they look like they’ve been dressed by their mums”.View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton with Woody Allen in Annie Hall (1977).Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyWhite shirts, the backbone garment of work leisure – that halfway house between uniform and not – hit the big time when women entered the workforce during the early 20th century and needed something loose to wear.

A new V&A exhibition exploring her style features a 1783 portrait byÉlisabethVigée Le Brun’s of the doomed queen wearing a white chemise, or shirt-style dress. Its neoclassical shape, “which was diaphanous while also somehow clingy, was an early example of power dressing, and very fashion forward”, says the senior curator, Dr Sarah Grant. “The most modern thing about it was how plain and loose it was – but that was also very seductive.”In 1782’s Les Liaisons Dangereuses, there’s a scene in which a woman is wearing a muslin shirt-style dress, and Valmont is thrilled because it’s easier to remove. “It’s basically underwear,” says Grant. Like most fashion, the chemise was a reaction to what came before it, which was something more formal. But combined with its sultriness and unpatriotic fabric (it was made of muslin rather than French silk) the portrait became so controversial it was removed from the Salon of 1783.View image in fullscreenCarolyn Bessette-Kennedy attends a gala at the Whitney Museum in New York in 1999.Photograph: Evan Agostini/GettyAn exercise in soft-power branding in which sales almost doubled last year, Victoria Beckham’s success has largely been built on creating clothes – and makeup – for women who want to look like her.

But sales have plummeted amid a surging pro-meat trend embraced by theTrump administration, raising a key question – willvegetarianismever take hold in the US?This year has been a punishing one for the plant-based meat sector, led by companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, with sales of refrigerated productsslumping17%. This follows a difficult 2024, during which salesfell7%, furthering a multi-year spiral – last year Americanspurchased75m fewer units of plant-based meat than they did in 2022.Despite hopes that burgers, sausages and chicken made from soy, peas and beans would curb Americans’ love of eating butchered animals – thereby reducing the rampant deforestation, water pollution and planet-heating emissions involved in raising livestock – these alternatives languish at just 1% of the total meat market in the US.Instead, a resurgent focus on meat has swept the US, pushed by industry lobbyists and online wellness influencers who advocate greater protein consumption via the carnivore diet and deride plant alternatives as overly processed.Accordingto the meat industry, since 2020 there has been a 20% drop in the number of Americans seeking to cut their meat consumption.The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again credo has embraced this push. Paul Saladino, a leading online meat proponent who hascalledplant burgers “garbage”, took a meat-based smoothie to a White House event in May and slammed a shot of raw milk withRobert F Kennedy Jr, the contrarian US health secretary. “I eat protein, a lot of protein,” KennedytoldSaladino of his own meat eating.“It’s not our moment, we recognize that, you’d be crazy to think it is,” Ethan Brown, chief executive of Beyond Meat, the plant-based business that was valued at $10bn a few years ago but has suffered a 97% drop in its share price since, said.“Meat consumption is on the rise, the political culture is different. We just need to get through this period.”The meat industry “did a masterful job, convincing people that there was something wrong with the products, or that they were ultra-processed or things of that nature”, Brown added.To try to keep pace with the culture shift, Beyond recentlydropped“Meat” from its name andunveileda new product that is primarily a protein-based food (made of fava beans) rather than mimicked beef or chicken. It has laid off workers,missedrevenue expectations and has had to deny it isstrugglingto pay its bills.Its big rival, Impossible, meanwhile has scrambled to align with meat rather than oppose it, even floating the idea of a hybrid plant-beef burger. “We’re not here to win over the salad eaters,” reads its website. “We’re here for the meat stans.”The meat industry’s attack upon veg competitors as unhealthy has been successful, if rather misleading – researchshowsthat a plant-based products generally have less saturated fat, more fibre and about the same protein as processed meat.Also, many of the increasingly popular high-proteinbars, milks and other products are very processed, without suffering any of the stigma that plant-based meat has. “If you walk into grocery store there is a protein enhanced version of almost every product, even though Americans are getting enough protein,” said Kate Stanley, a food researcher at Duke University.Crucially, studies havefoundthat while most Americans understand the benefits of eating more plants, only a quarter are willing to do so and the vast majority don’t view the environment as a priority when choosing meals.“There’s a disconnect between the mounting evidence on meat’s environmental footprint and what’s actually driving consumer behavior,” said Shauna Downs, who has studied Americans’ views at the Rutgers School of Public Health.Food remains a deeply personal and cultural part of our lives and for most people that involves meat – a fifth of all Americansstilleat red meat five times or more every week. Herbivore imitations may have improved from previous iterations of veggie burgers but remain more expensive than meat.“Sustainability is a consideration for only a very small portion of the population – taste and price are the biggest things and plant-based products need to deliver on those,” said Jody Kirchner, associate director of market insights at the Good Food Institute, which hasresearchedthe plant-based sector.“Inflation has had a big impact across the food sector and that’s a big challenge for plant products because they cost two to three times more than traditional meat. A lot of progress will need to be made on taste and cost to become feasible for customers – a lot of people just don’t see the need for these products.”Regardless of the ebb and flow ofvariousdietaryfads, and rising alarm over the destruction of the natural world, Americans have been immovable when it comes to becoming vegetarian or vegan. Just 4% of people in the US identified as vegetarian in 2023, a proportion that is actually down from the 6% that said the same in 2001,according to Gallup. A mere 1% are vegan.Inspiring a move away from meat, even if it just to cut back consumption, is seemingly far more difficult in the US than other comparable countries that havelarger, and growing, cohorts of vegetarians.“Certainly in the American fabric there is a relationship with cattle, the kind of pioneer, rugged individualism, John Wayne, and it’s all wrapped up with this kind of Manifest Destiny,” said Brown.Current cultural trends around masqueradingrustic pursuitsand traditionalhomesteadinghas helped elevate meat, Brown said, along with the macho political posturing of the Trump era where the US, for the first time in years,again has adepartment of war.“It’s just not a moment for altruistic kind of behaviors,” he said. “I think right now it’s about TikTok and tariffs, that’s what is on the consumer’s mind. It’s not the moment for any sort of broader concern, it’s a very self-interested moment.”“It’s a particularly difficult moment for movements like vegan and vegetarianism,’ he conceded. ‘“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to come back.”The plant-based problem: why vegan restaurants are closing – or adding meat to the menuRead moreThe cultural pendulum may have swung toward meat but the stresses upon the planet have only worsened. Vastdeforestation, in places like the Amazon, to clear land for cows is fueling ecological and climate breakdown, with the burps of cattle and the associated chemicals, machinery and land loss from feeding and raising livestock responsible for up toa third of all planet-heating emissions.Each year, billions of animals are crammed into giant American barns, fed a cocktail of vaccines and antibiotics and killed, with the pollution from such facilities oftenbefoulingwaterways. Grass-fed cows in rolling paddocks are often portrayed as a greener option,although this system involvesrazing biodiverse forests and grasslands and converting even more land for cattle feed.“I’ve been trying for 30 years to get people to eat less meat but the numbers just haven’t budged in the US,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University. “I think consumers are confused. They like what’s familiar to them.”Gardner said he finds hope inevidencethat a growing number of younger Americans are willing to reduce meat intake and that the culture will shift away from the celebration of the carnivore.“Not everyone has to become vegetarian but we will have to eat a lot less meat – at some point people will wake up and say ‘where have the rainforests gone?’” he said.“We are heading to the point we don’t have the land or water to support the amount of meat we want to eat. I hope people finally get it. They have to get it. We are facing an existential moment here.”Explore more on these topicsFoodVegetarianismVegetarian food and drinkTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Back in Hollywood, publicists are recalibrating campaigns and pundits are placing their bets on the big films and performances of the upcoming awards season.A few key contenders are still yet to be seen, but at this stage of the race, one thing seems clear: come next March, records will be broken. A victory for any of the three current frontrunners would mean unprecedented scenes on the podium.Venice’s big hit was ticking clock nuclear thrillerA House of Dynamite, whose director, Kathryn Bigelow, became the first woman to win the Oscar for best director back in 2009 with The Hurt Locker. Should she triumph for a second time, Bigelow would become the first woman to win the director Oscar twice in the awards’ 96-year history.A House of Dynamite review – Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear endgame thriller is a terrifying, white-knuckle comebackRead moreThe same would also be true of Chloé Zhao, whose drama Nomadland was nominated for six Oscars, in most of the key categories, and won three including best director and picture, in 2021. Zhao’s latest,Hamnet- the toast of both Telluride and Toronto - was adapted by Maggie O’Farrell from her own novel and stars Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal as Agnes and William Shakespeare, torn apart by the death of their son. The film mixes awards-friendly literary fittings with a keenly feminist narrative and passionate turns from hot young stars who also seem shoo-ins for nominations.View image in fullscreenPaul Mescal in a scene from Hamnet.Photograph: Agata Grzybowska/APZhao didn’t just become the second woman to win the best directing Oscar, but also the first woman of colour to do so. To date, no Black people, men included, have ever won that Oscar, with only six ever nominated (although Steve McQueen and Barry Jenkins have directed best picture winners).That would change should Ryan Coogler’sSinnerssustain the momentum of its cinema launch in April. A steamy horror starring Coogler’s frequent collaborator Michael B Jordan, Sinners has taken $366m (£270m) worldwide – a remarkable result for a non-franchise, original concept movie. Coogler is perceived as a talent too often passed over for recognition, whether for his Sundance debut, Fruitvale Station, or his Marvel smash Black Panther,the most lucrative film ever made by a Black director, taking $1.3bn (£960,000). And few bodies are more eager to celebrate movies that strike a chord with young, diverse and mainstream audiences than the Academy.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreSinners skipped a festival launch, but as the example of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023, seven Oscars) shows, that may no longer be an issue, provided the film can stay in the conversation for almost a year. The recent precedent for the latter feat was madcap genre-hopper Everything Everywhere All at Once, which debuted in early 2022 at South by Southwest festival in Texas before sweeping the 2023 awards.From 2007 to 2024, 13 of 18 best picture winners (72%) premiered at a festival, with Cannes indexing especially well, giving us the likes of Parasite, The Zone of Interest, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall, The Substance, Emilia Pérez and last year’s big Oscar victor, Anora. But this year things were quieter on the Croisette and only the Palme d’Or winner, Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident, looks set to really trouble Oscar voters outside the best international film category.This void leaves potential for other films to come into play, including those which might have otherwise been notable mostly for their splashy star turns. Wrestling biopicThe Smashing Machinemeans Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson is a definite in the best actor category, but there may also be nods for director Benny Safdie and co-star Emily Blunt. Sydney Sweeney also fights her way into the best actress race with a punchy turn in boxing dramaChristy; that film may also pick up some supporting star silverware.Jay Kellyis a star vehicle for George Clooney, but Noah Baumbach’s film is unlikely to only be up for best actor.View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAYet the feeling from both Venice and Toronto was that festivals as a whole have been muted so far this year. This means spots are also being held for those films still to premiere. Next week will see first reviews of Paul Thomas Anderson’s US freedom fighter comedy-drama One Battle After Another starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn – all three men are staples of the Oscars, though the film itself is not thought to be the same awards slam dunk as some of Anderson’s previous titles. Buzz is also building for Marty Supreme, starring last year’s Oscars bridesmaid Timothée Chalamet as a table tennis prodigy who has an affair with a gangster’s wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow.In early October, the New York film festival offers early looks at Is This Thing On?, Bradley Cooper’s fourth film as director, starring Will Arnett as an aspiring standup, as well as Daniel Day-Lewis’s comeback as a former British soldier in hiding in the woods, in Anemone, directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. And Emmy favourite Jeremy Allen White will be giving us his best Bruce Springsteen impression in a biopic co-starring Jeremy Strong and Stephen Graham.Meanwhile, only the foolish would write off James Cameron, king of the Oscars, the man responsible for three of the four highest-grossing films of all time, whose latest Avatar spectacular is being positioned as a Christmas treat. The first of those CGI eco-fables lost out in 2009 on all the big Oscars to The Hurt Locker – a film directed by his ex-wife.At the time, this unusual public face-off was the subject of extensive column inches – and was still being referenced in 2013, when Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty was nominated for four Golden Globe awards and host Amy Poehler memorably noted that, “when it comes to torture, I trust the lady who was married to James Cameron for three years.”Will Cameron have the last laugh, or will Bigelow once again triumph? Either way, a rematch between these big beasts of cinema should raise the stakes yet further on this already charged Oscar season.Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsAwards and prizesVenice film festivalToronto film festivalTelluride film festivalKathryn BigelowanalysisShareReuse this content"

At this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.” Then, the bombshell: “I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.”Reporters tapped up contacts, the pundit class speculated, United enthusiasts debated over pints and social media. Was Amorim suggesting his side “wanted” a new head coach? And did “we have time to think” after the weekend Premier League visit of Burnley (whichUnited won 3-2) mean he could walk?A first United defeat by League Two opposition in the second‑tier cup competition willalways be a big deal. But zoom out a smidgeon and the wider picture in the bread and butter of the league was two matches played and a point taken (not great but also no seismic disaster) and United motor across town for Sunday’s 197th derby with four points, one more than Pep Guardiola’s garlanded Manchester City, who are winless since the opening day.So is it reasonable to consider Amorim’s position under threat three league games into a season? Certifiably not. Is this simply life for the gent in the hottest of football seats? Certainly.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim’s position at Manchester United is under threat three league matches into his first full season in charge.Photograph: Mark Pain/AlamyOn one level the focus on Amorim is ridiculous – quasi-farcical. On another it is manna from heaven for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers, owners who are conscious the constant eyeballs on their manager is a massive feeder of the United cash machine. When Ed Woodward said in December 2013 the club could go trophyless and still “sell an incredible number of shirts” he voiced the prevailing commercial truth about this global behemoth.Fans and others who might term themselves football purists seized on the then executive vice‑chair’s comment as entitled, anti‑sport. Yet what it pointed to was United’s status as an institution of fascination akin to the British royal family and what it means for the bottom line: lucrative commercial deals and riches. However uncomfortable or exaggerated, the relentless spotlight translates into millions in revenues. In July 2014 an Amorim predecessor, Louis van Gaal, used his unveiling to say: “This club is guided in a commercial way and it is not always possible to meet commercial and football expectations.”Amorim, like Van Gaal, had to walk into the place to realise the scale of the job. Only Real Madrid are analogous as a club where the head coach is public property, his results not ranking as far ahead of matters such as off-field tittle-tattle and gossip, social media reaction and press releases trumpeting the latest sponsor as they should. This is the deal, and Amorim walked in with eyes open. But as David Moyes, Van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag found, in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, nothing can prepare for the realpolitik of piloting the club. Statesman, media performer, fan favourite, club cheerleader, players’ guru and, yes, the man who must win every game via an XI embodying the United way of “attack, attack, attack”.It is clear why the role is attractive. A sizeable paycheque (Amorim earns a cool £9m a year); the CV-burnishing status of being the club’s choice; and the sporting challenge: be the one who gets this right and wins a 21st top-division title, and the first sinceFerguson’s in 2013, and immortality is yours.But pulling the feat off is like an nth-degree Rubik’s Cube. Amorim is always being observed, analysed, dissected, judged – however significant or innocuous an act. Or, like the philosopher Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, it feels as if he is – which is the same thing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He remains in situ but how long before the inquests into his position start up again? Possibly about five minutes after the end of Sunday’s encounter if United lose.In The Truman Show, Truman Burbank unknowingly lives in a world that is a reality TV series. With his every move entertainment, he is dehumanised, a dollar sign only. Burbank’s catchphrase is: “In case I don’t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.” This may be Amorim’s fate too.A view may be, who cares? Amorim is a big boy. The point here is the sport: the task of returning the club to the top. He has to win while taming the hydra-headed monster that is United and this is not possible in the short term. So while he shares culpability in overseeing a £200m summer spend that came up short of an elite goalkeeper or No 6, Amorim should be able to make missteps such as the defeats against Grimsby and Arsenal and the draw at Fulham and not face end-of-times hysteria.The rebuild Amorim undertakes is bound to be messy at times because of the mess he inherited.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their highest T20 total was turbocharged by a brilliant opening stand of 126 between Phil Salt and Jos Buttler and by their highest individual score, Salt knocking himself off the top of that chart with an unbeaten 141. Within a week and against the same opponents they have set new national records for winning margins in both one-day internationals and now T20s, the final difference here an almost comic 146 runs.Salt described his evening as “really good fun” but the experience for Shukri Conrad, South Africa’s head coach, was anything but. He described a bowling performance that – having invited England to bat first – “was way off, bereft of ideas” as England were allowed to plunder 30 fours and 18 sixes en route to a score of 304 for two, with nearly twice as many boundaries (48) across the innings as there were dot balls (25).England v South Africa: second men’s T20 international – liveRead more“When there’s an onslaught we need to find different plans,” Conrad said. “I don’t think we bowled enough yorkers, didn’t use the short ball enough. We became one-dimensional. An abject performance, really not good enough. At the end of the day players have got to take a long look at themselves. What’s the saying? When all around you are losing their heads you’ve got to make sure you keep yours – and we weren’t able to do that tonight.”From the very start, with boundaries struck off each of the first three balls of the day, Salt tore into South Africa’s bowling much as he would in time tear up the record books. The result was the third highest team total in the history of international T20s, behind only Zimbabwe’s 344 against Gambia last year and Nepal’s 314 against Mongolia in 2023, and an implausible target for the visitors to chase.South Africa had no choice but to go hard from the start and for a while they managed to more or less keep pace with England, reaching 50 off the third ball of the fourth over, just one delivery later than their opponents had earlier. But if at that stage they were freewheeling, those wheels immediately came off.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler hits out on his way to a 30-ball 83.Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/ShutterstockRyan Rickelton pulled the very next delivery to Liam Dawson at midwicket and before that over had finished Lhuan-dre Pretorius had top-edged to Luke Wood at short third. Dewald Brevis followed in the next over, and with that what had appeared extraordinarily unlikely ticked gently into the realm of outright impossibility. From more or less matching England after 21 balls, the point when they reached 50, by the end of the powerplay just 15 deliveries later they were 36 behind and three wickets down, and the rest was a formality. They were eventually dismissed for 158, one ball into the 17th over.With the ascent of Jamie Smith, rested for this series along with Ben Duckett, Salt has become less central to this white-ball side, but at his best he is unrivalled in this format. No other Englishman has scored more than a single T20 century and the 29-year-old now has four, with his 119 in Trinidad at the end of 2023, previously the nation’s all-time best, left looking almost as sorry and ­underpowered by the end of this evening as South Africa’s bowlers. He took only 39 balls to reach triple figures, another national record, and scarcely slowed from there. It is a measure of how remarkable his innings was that it turned Buttler’s brilliant, 30-ball 83 into a footnote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair of them drove each other on and the ­bowlers to distraction, evidenced by the string of no-balls conceded by Kagiso Rabada. It was Lizaad Williams who received the harshest punishment, however, with his first two balls pinged into the crowd off the middle of Buttler’s bat and his night going downhill from there.With the series now level South Africa head to Trent Bridge for Sunday’s decider knowing they can only improve, while England ponder whether such a thing for them is even possible. On that front Harry Brook, who himself scored a frenetic, 21-ball 41, was typically optimistic. “With the batting lineup we’ve got,” he said, “there aren’t many heights we can’t reach.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s not necessary at our club, because we also trade players. If a player wants to leave and we get the right money for him, this club has shown so many years now that we then sell.“You can just keep on training here – Lucho [Luis Díaz] and Harvey [Elliott] get their transfers, Tyler Morton gets his transfer, all these players, I can come up with eight, nine, 10 I think in the last window, that just conduct themselves in the best possible way.”Isak featured for only 18 minutes during the international break due to his lack of match fitness. He had spent time training alone at former club Real Sociedad during the summer but did not feature during that time. Slot admitted it will take the player time to get up to speed but has no doubt he will eventually display his talents forLiverpool. “He is one of the best in the world,” said the head coach. “But for him to become the best, I think the best players in the world win trophies.”“It [the fee] might put pressure on him and me but nothing extra – if you have this [Liverpool badge] on your shirt there is always pressure,” Slot added. “We target a player and we want to have him. We decide what his value is, if that matches with what the club wants then we are not afraid to act.

For all of the brillianceSt Helensshowed in that run of unprecedented domination, this is now a very different side: underlined by the fact that for the first time in the summer era, they will finish outside the top four in consecutive seasons.Catalans Dragons deal major blow to Leeds’ hopes of top-two finishRead moreBut this night belonged to a side who are hoping of ending a much longer wait to become champions of England. Not since 1982 were Leigh last the dominant force in rugby league, and their only other title came all the way back in 1906. This is a town that has lived in the shadows of the sport’s big names, not least their local rivals from across the borough, Wigan Warriors.However, the Leopards are undoubtedly a club on the rise. This victory secured their highest-ever finish in Super League, no matter what happens next weekend. They will be at home in the opening round of the playoffs too after sauntering past the Saints with relatively little fuss to illustrate just how far they have come under Adrian Lam.With his son, Lachlan, the architect of everything they do well, Leigh will now finish as high as third should they avoid defeat to Huddersfield in the final round. Written off this year, they have proven their critics wrong. “It was a tough game, one that we needed,” Lam said. “But at times we were outstanding.”In truth though, this was not really so much of an acid test for Leigh’s title credentials. They were coming up against a St Helens side who are littered with problems: chief among them the fact that, with the playoffs just a fortnight away, they still do not know what their best side looks like in attack.For the fifth consecutive game, Paul Wellens rotated the spine of his team, this time opting to put the England fullback, Jack Welsby, at half-back having used him at loose-forward last week. Once again, it didn’t work. They have now lost to the top three in consecutive weeks and will likely travel to Leeds in the opening round of the playoffs. They do so as underdogs.“Quite clearly if you look at the last three results we’re not where we need to be,” Wellens lamented. “The reality here is that we’ve conceded 28 points and that’s not good enough.” Twelve of those came before half-time, with tries for Andy Badrock and Keanan Brand – both created by Lam, who passed 40 assists for the season in the process – putting the Leopards in control.In response, the Saints offered nothing. But when Leigh’s talismanic hooker, Edwin Ipape, was sin-binned as half-time approached, it gave the visitors a glimmer of hope. They duly took it too, scoring twice in the ten minutes when Ipape was off the field to bring it back to 12-10 shortly after half-time, with tries from Kyle Feldt and Harry Robertson bringing the game alive again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They almost seemed to return to type when the numerical advantage disappeared, and the hosts made them pay. Jack Hughes scored after a fine offload from Umyla Hanley to open up a two-score lead before Ipape atoned for his earlier error with a thunderous finish.By the time Owen Trout grounded a Lam kick in the final minutes, the game was already up for Saints, and the celebrations had already started in the terraces here among the home supporters. For the first time in more than a generation, this small Lancashire town has reason to believe it can go all the way once again.But for one of Super League’s most fearsome and dominant sides, just competing in the playoffs now seems to represent something of a positive outcome after another humiliating evening.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLeigh LeopardsSt HelensRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The old rivalry will reignite in Bristol on Sunday but the bragging rights between the two nations have not belonged to Scotland since 1999. They have lost to England in their last 27 meetings with an aggregate score of 1,351-117. You also have to go back to 2021 for the last time Scotland scored double digits against England in a single game.However, Scotland fans fear not. This is knockout rugby and as every player and coach this week has said: anything can happen. England are huge favourites to progress to the last four, where France or Ireland will be the opponent, but Scotland will hope to make more history in this tournament. They have reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2002 with a stunning win against Wales as well as a victory against Fiji. They also gave the world No 2 side, Canada, a proper fight in their final pool game but lost 40-19.‘I want to be the greatest’: New Zealand’s Jorja Miller on her limitless ambitionRead moreScotland’s performances have come in spite of contract negotiations blighting the buildup to the tournament. The wing Rhona Lloyd has said that half of the squad will not have contracts beyond this competition and in context it makes their results that much more impressive. The team are aiming for the win against the Red Roses but they are under no illusions about just how tough it will be to overcome their rivals.The defence coach, Tyrone Holmes, said: “It’s a huge challenge and they are the best team in the world. There are chinks in the armour though, no team is perfect. It’s not the first time we’ve been underdogs, and yes, it will have to be one of our best performances, but we relish that.”The teams last met during the 2025 Women’s Six Nations where England came out 59-7 winners. That victory was England’s 24th in a row but they have continued to win and are now on 30. A win over Scotland would break their own world record of consecutive victories.The Red Roses will have to get across the line without their star full-back, Ellie Kildunne, unavailable because of concussion protocol, opening the door for Helena Rowland. The 25-year-old, who has also played at fly-half this World Cup, said of their opposition: “We know them pretty well, there are a lot at Loughborough Lightning and the PWR as a whole so you are playing with or against them most weekends. It goes both ways in that we know exactly how they want to play but they know exactly how we want to play. It makes things slightly harder.View image in fullscreenZoe Aldcroft, the England captain, will return to the side against Scotland after recovering from her knee injury.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/Shutterstock“We had some things to solve of our own after Australia. It’s always a fun one when you are playing against your friends, there is a slightly different dynamic to it but it’s all about the team for the 80 minutes.”England will also be without the prop Hannah Botterman who is not included in the matchday squad after coming off against Australia with injury. Kelsey Clifford, who scored two tries last weekend, starts in Botterman’s stead.Some good news for England supporters comes with the captain, Zoe Aldcroft, coming back into the side after recovering from her knee injury. Sadia Kabeya and Alex Matthews are alongside the captain in the back row with Maddie Feaunati on the bench.Scotland make just two changes to their starting team with Jade Konkel coming in at No 8, which will potentially be her final international cap as she has announced she will retire from Scotland duty after this World Cup. Christine Belisle starts at loosehead prop with Elliann Clarke and Lisa Cockburn ruled out with injury.Rachel Malcolm will also captain the team for the 53rd time which is a new record across all Scotland representative teams. The Scotland head coach, Bryan Easson, who will depart his role after the World Cup, had high praise for his captain, saying: “She epitomises what we are about. She is a leader, has passion, pride. If you look at the progress this team has made over the years Rachel is at the heart of it on and off the pitch, the way she speaks and the way she plays … Honestly I just bow down.”This is the first quarter-final this Scotland squad have ever played and Malcolm says it is the biggest match of their careers. “It is a different type of pressure, no one expects us to win,” Malcolm said. “That is where we thrive. It is the biggest game of our career because we have a huge amount of belief in this team and the performances have built week-on-week while we have been here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France won 27-15 when the teams met in this season’s Six Nations but after losing centre Gabrielle Vernier to a 20th-minute red card, Ireland came within two points of them at one stage of the game.

Enquiries remain ongoing and no arrests have been made at this stage.”The alleged spiking is understood to have taken place at a cricket-themed pub in Chelsea, The ­Boundary, which is co-owned by England cricket’s head coach, Brendon McCullum and white-ball batter Jos Buttler, among other members of the England set-up.The 50-over World Cup winning captain Eoin Morgan, the former one-day international batter Sam Billings, the former South Africa captain Graeme Smith and the Ireland cricketer Paul Stirling are also shareholders, as is the England and ­British Lions rugby union hooker Jamie George.None of the sports star owners were present at the time of the alleged ­incident, which was said to have taken place on the first day of ­England’s one-off Test match against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge on 22 May.Due to the pub’s ownership, the England and Wales Cricket Board has been aware of the allegations for some time. When contacted by the ­Guardian it declined to comment.The Boundary opened in March and has quickly gained a reputation for attracting current and former cricketers for late-night drinks this summer. While not directly involved, the incident may invite awkward questions for the ECB, particularly ahead of this winter’s Ashes tour.English cricket has been troubled by numerous cases of sexual ­misconduct in recent years. An unnamed former county coach was suspended from the sport for nine months in August after admitting to sending sexually explicit ­pictures to two female junior members of staff.After being found guilty by the ECB’s independent Cricket Discipline Panel, his name was redacted on the grounds there would be a “serious risk of harm” if his identity were made public.The coach had admitted to five charges of professional misconduct, including sending explicit images to two colleagues, with the panel noting that one of the women “was much younger” and “he occupied a far more senior position than she did” at the club.In November last year a professional coach was suspended for six months for “inappropriate sexual behaviour” on a pre-season tour for an unnamed men’s and women’s county team.Explore more on these topicsCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

A 5-1 defeat of West Ham coming after their opening4-1 win over London City Lionessesonly added to the good vibes. They have shown they can beat the best, now they have to prove they can beat the best, the worst and those in between consistently.Grace Geyoro and Alyssa Thompson ready to take up Olivia Smith’s challenge in WSL’s £1m clubRead moreRenée Slegers’ side made it difficult for themselves for the second game in a row, though. This time it was an own goal from goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar that put them in trouble, before strikes by Frida Maanum, Stina Blackstenius, Caitlin Foord and two from Alessia Russo ensured the European champions maintained a 100% start to the season.“Very much,” said Slegers, when asked how keen she is for her side to iron out the mistakes that have put them behind in consecutive games. “They’re not the scenarios you want, not in your opening game at the Emirates with so many fans and everyone very excited, but also not when you go away and play West Ham, because we respect this ground and this opponent and we know they can make it really hard for us, and that’s what they did.”It took the Hammers five minutes to earn a shock lead, Shekiera Martinez’s teasing ball to the back post slipping through the hands of Van Domselaar and coming back off the post on to her head and in. It was weird, and unfortunate, but the goalkeeper should have reckoned with the ball being as slick as it was.Having had to come from a goal down against London City Lionesses on the opening weekend of the WSL season, when Kosovare Asllani converted from the spot after she was brought down by Katie Reid, there was a feeling of deja vu. Did Arsenal enjoy having their backs against the wall? Probably not, but there is something to be said for the grit and togetherness created by such situations.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Foord heads Arsenal’s third from a cross by Mariona Caldentey.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesArsenal were soon dominant in front of an away crowd to rival the home contingent and in the 21st minute were deservedly level. It was nice work from Russo on the left to hold on to the ball and find Beth Mead, who delivered her third assist of the season, slipping the ball through the legs of Finland’s Oona Siren to Maanum, who turned in past Megan Walsh.It was a goal that was a testament to Arsenal’s depth, Maanum one of three changes to the team that saw off London City.It was hardly a thriller, but once the rain stopped, play improved and Arsenal clicked into gear. It was the half-time substitution of Maanum for Champions League final goalscorer Blackstenius that helped Arsenal break the deadlock, Russo’s backheel rifled into the far corner by the Sweden forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ultimately, their season will not be defined by results against the top four, but having troubled those teams last season, with draws earned against Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, and Arsenal needing to come from behind against the Hammers to secure a 4-3 win in March, there will be disappointment that they weren’t able to do more.“If you look at the scoreline, it’s obviously not one that you want to walk away with,” said their manager, Rehanne Skinner. “They are European champions. It’s always going to be a big test and we’re trying to be a little bit braver in what we do, so sometimes we can get caught a ­little bit with that and they’ve got the capability to punish you.”Russo put the cherry on top with two goals in three minutes late on. First, substitute Olivia Smith set her up to lash into the top corner from the edge of the box. Then Smith was brought down on a tricky run into the area and up stepped Russo to convert the penalty. It was clinical and efficient and Arsenal sit top of the WSL.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWest Ham United WomenWomen's footballArsenal Womenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old claimed he hit certain shots on the West Course on Friday that “hurt my soul”.Hovland has been in a state of technical flux all year, with his driving a particular cause for concern. He is perfectly candid about that, despite rounds of 67 and 66 at this PGA Championship. Hovland’s next start will come as part of team Europe in theRyder Cup.‘It’s like the Olympics’: Patrick Reed against Ryder Cup player paymentRead more“It’s making the game a bit more stressful than it should be,” Hovland said. “It’s just frustrating as a golfer when this is my game. I step up and I have an intention of wanting to start the ball a certain height and start it left of the target and curve it, and then the ball starts high and right, complete opposite of what I’m trying to do. That’s just frustrating. But I know how to play. So I’m doing the best I can.“I shot 80 at the Players earlier this year and I won the next week. I would rather not play the game of golf that way because that is not how I used to do it. Obviously I like to focus on what I need to work on, but at the same time I need to be proud of myself that I’m still able to come around here and compete after two rounds when it doesn’t feel very good.“I’m super happy to be where I’m at and scoring-wise, it’s incredible to be honest. I really am struggling off the tee and I’m just trying to do whatever I can just to put it in the fairway. Trying not to hit it off line and in the trees. But I do want to play the game a little bit more stress-free.”Hovland will begin day three a shot behind Hideki Matsuyama after the Japanese’s 64. Justin Rose and Ludvig Åberg are alongside Hovland on 11 under.Hovland was far more upbeat on Europe’s chances at Bethpage as they seek a rare win on American soil. Hovland was a star for Europe in Rome two years ago, claiming three and a half points.“I think the record speaks for itself,” Hovland said. “All the guys have had great years. I think what’s really cool is that we have 11 out of the 12 same guys [from the last Ryder Cup] and we have the same captain. As a team, we’re a known commodity. We know that this is successful.“We don’t have to go to Bethpage and wonder if this is going to work versus maybe the American side, you know, there’s a lot of new guys and new captain. They maybe have some more insecurities, maybe. I think a strength that we have is we know our squad well and we know that it works.”Rory McIlroy’s turbulent day saw the Masters champion flirt with the cut line after dropping three shots in his opening five holes. McIlroy responded with five birdies but produced a painful double bogey at the last. This all added up to a level par 72, which leaves McIlroy eight shy of Hovland. Shane Lowry’s aggregate is the same as McIlroy’s at halfway after a 74. Jon Rahm is four under with Robert MacIntyre at minus two.More ominous in European Ryder Cup context were the struggles of Rasmus Højgaard. The Dane, who qualified for Luke Donald’s team automatically, exited Surrey at five over par.Marcel Siem suffered the embarrassment of disqualification after it emerged he played the wrong ball on the closing hole of his first round.Explore more on these topicsEuropean TourRyder CupGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn.“Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”View image in fullscreenSweet William, ridden by Robert Havlin, on his way to winning the Howard Wright Doncaster Cup Stakes.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAn impressive display of raw, front-running speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.“She’s a natural front-runner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”Lambourn to complete Derby-Leger doubleJust seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and sees the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second-favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable-companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner just three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip.

If there is any point to the upper chamber, it is to give the legislation the open debate we needSign up for our new weekly newsletterMatters of Opinion, where our columnists and writers will reflect on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading and moreFri 12 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 12.57 EDTShareThe House of Lords has a rare opportunity to prove its worth to the country today, as it begins to debate the assisted dying bill. Personally, I would be in favour of peers throwing out the whole idea, which is what this dangerous and badly written bill surely deserves. But it is unlikely that they will want to go so directly against the Commons, especially on such a controversial issue. So instead I must hope that they listen to disabled people’s groups, as well as legal and medical experts, and at least undo some of the lower house’s most egregious errors.Whether you are for or against the principle ofassisted dying(I am pro), we should be able to agree that the passage of this particular bill through the Commons has been haphazard, deeply unedifying and fundamentally flawed. The Lords should reject this precedent and, by adopting a better process, produce a much safer bill than the one they have been sent.Although peers can’t do anything about the fact that the bill is a private member’s bill, which somewhat limits the scrutiny it endures, it can allocate more time to debating it. The Commons did dedicate several days to its second and third readings, but on both occasions many MPs who wanted to speak did not get the chance to do so. The new home secretary (then the justice secretary), Shabana Mahmood, was among those who said there hadnot been enough timefor debate. Of course, MPs often don’t get to speak during a debate, but when a law fundamentally changes the nature of the state, limiting the voices that are heard cannot be a good thing. A shift this big should not be rushed. And given the failures of the Commons process, dissenting opinions should be prioritised. The Lords exist to provide scrutiny, especially when politics means MPs haven’t, so peers should slow down and give this bill as much debate time as possible. Everyone should be heard – especially the peers who are experts in disability rights, healthcare, and inequality.In a similar spirit, the Lords could bring in many more outside voices. One of the worst parts of the Commons process happens at committee stage. This is where interested and affected parties are invited to give evidence about a bill to a select group of MPs whose job it is to scrutinise itslanguage and propose amendments based on what they hear. For a private member’s bill, the members of the committee are chosen by the bill’s proponent, meaning the committee usually leans in favour of the bill. But, even with that natural bias taken into account, the committee made some extraordinary decisions with the assisted dying bill. The original lineup for oral evidence did not include a single disabled people’s organisation, and it was only after much clamour from within and beyond parliament that Disability Rights UK was added to the billing as the most affected community’s sole representative. Other disabled people who gave evidence spoke in favour of the bill, despite the fact that a coalition of 350 disability organisations have, in an unprecedented move,united to oppose it. This clearly represents a critical imbalance that the Lords should endeavour to correct. Disabled people are not a monolith, of course, but when a bill so directly affects our lives (and deaths), we deserve to be front and centre, with our views fairly represented. Hearing from us would, one can only hope, lead peers to add desperately needed safeguards into the bill.One way to do this would be to reintroduce amendments rejected by the committee, including those designed to exclude anorexic people from assisted dying, to protect prisoners and homeless populations, to give those with learning disabilities tailor-made information and to ensure that patients, not doctors, would be the first to raise the option of an assisted death. The rejection of these safeguards was horrifying, and made even worse by the fact that such important, literally life-and-death votes were taken by 23 hand-picked MPs rather than all of them. In an effort to make the bill safer, it is vital that when the Lords go through their own committee stage, as many crucial decisions are left to the whole House as possible.But it’s not just on procedure where the Lords could outdo the lower house. Throughout the bill’s Commons passage,MPs were (deliberately or not) misled. When the committee stripped out judicial oversight, MPs were told safeguards had been strengthened. They were repeatedly told that disabled people were excluded from the bill’s provisions, but anyone with a progressive condition and an unscrupulous doctor might qualify. They were even told that the medical royal colleges supported a change in the law, but the Royal College of General Practitionersis officially neutral, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists hasvoiced serious concernsabout the specifics of the bill. The best and simplest way the Lords could foster a better debate is by having an honest one, based on the bill before them, not a lofty ideal. The truth always matters; here, it is absolutely vital.It would be easy to ask peers to chuck out the assisted dying bill. But it would also be naive and perhaps counterproductive. Instead, I ask them to give it, and disabled people’s lives, the consideration and time they deserve, to strengthen its safeguards with the amendments MPs rejected (and add others), and to have an honest debate. If the Lords does so, it will have proven its worth, tenfold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they barely were covered upFri 12 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 12.02 EDTShareJeffrey Epsteinhad a lot of friends. When his girlfriend-cum-assistant and convicted fellow sex trafficker,Ghislane Maxwell, set out to compile letters, drawings and well wishes from friends in celebration of the pedophile financier’s 50th birthday in 2003, theresulting scrapbookwas 238 pages long.The book, titled The First 50 Years, included letters from prominent well-wishers such as former president Bill Clinton and the Bear Stearns executives James Cayne and Alan Greenberg, as well as from the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling scout and Epstein’s fellow pedophilic rapist.The lawyer and longtime Epstein friend Alan Dershowitz contributed a mock cover of the magazine Vanity Fair, which was working on a profile of Epstein at the time;Peter Mandelson, until this week the UK ambassador to the United States, wrote that Epstein was “my best pal!” The fashion designer Vera Wang compared Epstein to the contestant on the reality series The Bachelor, and the Microsoft executive and Bill Gates deputy Nathan Myhrvold included photos from a recent trip to Africa, writing that they were “more appropriate than anything I could put in words”. The photos included images of lions and zebras copulating, as well as of a zebra with a visible penis.Among the contributions was aletterwithDonald Trump’s signature, featuring a poem typed out in center alignment, alluding to things that the now president has in common with the pedophile, their “wonderful secret”, and a strange line noting that “enigmas never age”. Around the poem, an armless and headless female form has been drawn in black marker. Trump’s typical signature, angular and frantic in hishabitual black Sharpie pen, is positioned at the figure’s pubic area, reading, “Donald”.When the existence of this letter apparently from Trump – as well its contents and the nature of the drawing – was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in July, Trumpclaimedthat the document was both fake and also did not exist. Hefileda $10bn defamation suit against the paper. Now that the Epstein birthday book itself has been released by House oversight committee Democrats following a subpoena of Epstein’s estate, Trump and hisalliesclaim that the letter contained there is afake. “The White House says it’s not true,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to Lisa Desjardins of PBS, adding: “So.” Tim Burchett, a Republican representative from Tennessee,suggestedthat the president’s letter had been forged.Such a claim insults Americans’ intelligence – Trump’sfriendshipwith Epstein throughout the 1990s and early 2000s has been well-documented and was spoken of by Trump at the time. Trump’s tendency to comment on Epstein’s sex life, too, is well-established. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,” Trump said of Epstein in comments to New York Magazine in 2002, just a year before his contribution to the birthday book, “and many of them are on the younger side.”Trump has denied wrongdoing in his dealings with Epstein, just as he has denied allegations bymore than two dozen womenthat he committed sexual harassment and assault against them, allegations by his first wife, Ivana, made during their divorce proceedings that he raped her (a claim she later retracted), and allegations by the writer E Jean Carroll that he raped her in the dressing room of a department store in the early 1990s. (After Trump denied Carroll’s claim, a jury awarded her a sizable defamationsettlementon a finding that he in fact sexually abused her.) Trump has also denied that hewalked inon contestants of the Miss Teen USA pageant while they were undressing in a changing room in 1997. Trump does not deny the repeated sexualizedcommentshe made about his own daughter Ivanka during her teen years regarding her “hotness” and desirability; those, at least, he seems willing to stand by.There is no evidence suggesting that Trump personally partook in Epstein’s organized trafficking and sexual assault of teenage girls. But there is mounting circumstantial evidence that makes it hard not to speculate that Trump at least knew and approved of Epstein’s abuse of the girls – seeing the sexual assaults as evidence of Epstein’s cheeky virility and a luxurious prerogative of wealth.Indeed, what’s most striking about the birthday book, which was released to the public on Monday, is how little Epstein’s friends seem to know about him aside from the fact that he liked to surround himself with young women and teenagers. The sentiments expressed in the book are overwhelmingly bawdy; many allude directly to the young ages of Epstein’s sexual partners, as well as his penchant to transport the girls to his Caribbean island onboard his private plane.One illustration, attributed to Mar-a-Lago regular Joel Paschcow, shows women from what appears to be a clip art file in various risque poses – a dancer does a high kick, two women pose suggestively in swimsuits, a mermaid reclines on a rock – all arranged beneath a drawing of an airplane. Perhaps the most disturbing contribution is a drawing, not attributed, that shows Epstein giving a bunch of balloons to a group of three young girls in a panel labeled “1983”; beside it, a panel labeled “2003” shows Epstein reclining on a beach chair in a tropical locale – a plane bearing the tail numbers of his “Lolita Express” flying above – while four women in thongs massage him. One, crouched near his crotch, has Epstein’s initials tattooed on her rear end. The implication is that these are the same women – that Epstein gave the girls balloons in their childhood in order to encourage them to give him “massages” later on. “What a great country!” the sketch is captioned.There is no doubt that the contributors to Epstein’s birthday book will have different accounts of their time with the pedophile financier. But it is a horrifying document. An uncharitable reader will regard it as a collection of confessions of complicity: the relentlessly sexual nature of the contributions, and their frequent allusions to Epstein’s plane, makes it hard to avoid suspicion that many of them knew full well that there was something sexual about Epstein’s habit of regularly transporting young girls to a private island to spend time with powerful adult men. Knowing what we now know about Epstein, who was convicted for sex crimes against minors years after the book was compiled, it is hard to read the book charitably.Even the most generous reader – the one who was driven by an excess of caution or charity towards those who spent time with Epstein – would note that Epstein’s social circle, though highly elite, is also decidedly distasteful. The drawings and letters and various missives from Epstein’s well-wishers almost uniformly consist of the kind of crude, jocular misogyny and objectification of women that passes for friendship between men of little intellect and even less character.Clearly, they thought they were being funny; there’s a decent chance that to Epstein, his abuse of those girls and young women was hilarious. Sexual violence is often experienced as violence only by the victims: to the perpetrators, it is delightful fun – trivial and unserious – and it is the perpetrators, endowed as they so often are by maleness, age, money and status, whose view guides that of others. History, after all, is written by the winners, and in cases of sexual abuse, it is almost always the men who win.In the more fevered corners of the internet, conspiracists wonder about what Epstein and his powerful friends may have done to cover up and conceal his sexual abuse of teenagers. But maybe this sense of a vast effort of concealment is a bit too optimistic, even, for the banal avowedness with which so much of men’s actual sexual abuse of women and girls is conducted.More often, abuse of the kind that Epstein practiced does not have to be covered up at all: more often, it is conducted out in the open, before a group of indifferent onlookers who ignore it when they do not laugh. In such cases, it is wrong to say that there are “revelations” about an abusive man’s behavior. This conduct is not “revealed” so much as reinterpreted – found to be wrong, not due to an uncovering of facts but a change ofinterpretation.It is made objectionable, that is, to people who did not object before.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpGhislaine MaxwellPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

It’s never been more critical to challenge the misinformation that could turn a crisis into a catastropheSupport the Guardian’s independent, fact-based journalism todayFri 12 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 07.02 EDTShareAlittle over a decade ago I published a book,This Changes Everything, which explored the reality of the climate crisis as a confrontation between capitalism and the planet. For a few years after the book came out, it seemed like we might just win a breakthrough. A cascade of large and militant mobilisations pressed the case for keeping warming below 1.5C as globalcalls for a green new dealgrew louder and louder. Countries across the world announced long-term plans to reduce emissions and to hit net-zero targets; so did some of the largest corporations on the planet.And then … well, we all know what happened. A corporate-financed backlash on all fronts.In the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, his administration took more than 140 actions to roll back environmental rules and push for greater use of fossil fuels. He signed executive orders to ease restrictions on their extraction and export, filled his cabinet with oil industry supporters, gutted federal agencies on the forefront of the climate crisis, and cancelled life-saving environmental justice projects.Empowered by the world’s most powerful man’s assault on the planet, the banks and corporations that have financed our climate disaster – those with an apocalyptic fear of regulation eating into their super-profits – have let their masks slip,dropping their stated renewable ambitionsandploughing money into fossil fuels.Meanwhile, climate misinformation – amplified byfar-rightandrightwing populistpoliticians – is now so virulent online that one comprehensive study says it is likelyto help turn a crisis into a catastrophe.In 2020, the Guardian banned advertising from fossil fuel companies – the first major news organisation to do soI write for the Guardian because it continues to challenge and expose these forces – even as the financial conditions for producing this kind of work become more challenging by the day.For the past fortnight the Guardian has been reminding its readers about the role it is playing in exposing the threat to climate and environmental progress – and, as always, it has been naming names.The reason the Guardian is free to do this kind of vital work is simple: it is not beholden to corporations or billionaires.

He rejects science and must step downBernie SandersKennedy is unfit to be our nation’s leading public health official because he rejects the fundamental principles of modern scienceFri 12 Sep 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 11.18 EDTShareSince taking office,Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the health and human services department (HHS), has undermined vaccines at every turn. He has dismissed the entire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory panel, narrowed access to life-saving Covid-19 vaccines, filled scientific advisory boards with conspiracy theorists and fired the newly appointed CDC director for refusing to rubber-stamp his actions.But his rejection of vaccines is only part of the problem. Secretary Kennedy is unfit to be our nation’s leading public health official because he rejects the fundamental principles of modern science.For generations, doctors have agreed that germs – like bacteria or viruses – cause infectious diseases.In the 1850s, John Snow, known as the father of epidemiology, traced a cholera outbreak in London to water contaminated with human waste – not the “bad air”, or so-called miasma, that many at that time believed to be the cause.In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur, the French chemist, in a controlled experiment, injected one group of sheep with an anthrax vaccine while another group went without it. Then he injected all of the sheep with anthrax bacteria. The vaccinated sheep survived, the unvaccinated did not.The germ theory led to a revolution in public health and medicine which, over the years, has saved tens of millions of lives.Just a few examples.At a time when many women were dying during childbirth at hospitals, Dr Ignaz Semmelweis found that handwashing by doctors saved lives.Joseph Lister showed that sterilizing medical equipment before surgery prevented needless deaths.Florence Nightingale, considered the mother of modern nursing, substantially improved hygiene at hospitals and made healthcare much safer for patients.Pasteur made the food we eat and the milk we drink safer through a process of heating called pasteurization.And these are just a few examples.Yet, incredibly, in the year 2025, we now have a secretary of HHS who has cast doubt and aspersions on the very concept of the germ theory – the very foundation of modern medicine for over a century.In his book The Real Anthony Fauci, Kennedy absurdly claims that the central tenet behind the germ theory “is simply untrue”. Vaccines are not, Kennedy falsely asserts, responsible for the massive decline in deaths from infectious diseases. Instead, Kennedy falsely proclaims that “science actually gives the honor of having vanquished disease mortalities to sanitation and nutrition”.Kennedy’s rejection of science is endangering the lives of millions of children in the United StatesYes. No one disputes that proper sanitation, a nutritious diet and exercise can lead to healthier lives. But no credible scientist or doctor believes that alone makes a person immune from polio, measles, mumps, Covid, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. Otherwise healthy people can become sick, hospitalized or even die from these and other terrible diseases.Sadly, Kennedy’s dangerous rejection of well-established science is behind his wild conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns.It’s what led to Kennedy’s falseassertionthat “there is no vaccine that is safe and effective” despite peer-reviewed scientific studies finding that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives and reduced infant deaths by 40% in the past 50 years.It’s behind Kennedy’s bogusclaimthat the polio vaccine “killed many, many, many, many, many more people than polio ever did”, even though the scientific data has shown that the polio vaccine has saved 1.5 million lives and prevented about 20 million people from becoming paralyzed since 1988.It undergirds his history ofpromotingthe ridiculous idea that HIV does not cause Aids, despite rigorous studies finding the exact opposite. This type of outrageous HIV/Aids denialism is widely believed to have caused the deaths of at least 330,000 people in South Africa who did not receive the life-saving medicine they needed.It’s what led him to say that the Covid vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made”, that vaccines cause autism, and that the hepatitis B vaccine doesn’t work and should only be used for “prostitutes” and “promiscuous gay men” – lies that have been thoroughly debunked by scientific data and the medical community.Frighteningly, it’s what caused Kennedy to say: “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get him vaccinated.’ And he heard that from me. If he hears it from 10 other people, maybe he won’t do it.”As a private citizen, Kennedy is entitled to his views, no matter how misguided they may be.It’s time for the US to guarantee healthcare to all | Bernie SandersRead moreIf Kennedy would like to swim in water contaminated by raw sewage and fecal matter, as he hasdone recentlyin Washington DC’s Rock Creek Park, he is free to do that.But as our nation’s top health official, Secretary Kennedy’s rejection of science and the actions he has taken as a result of his bizarre ideology is endangering the lives of millions of children in the United States and throughout the world.Today, Kennedy is making it harder for people to get vaccines. Tomorrow, what will it be? Will he tell doctors they don’t need to wash their hands before surgery? Will he tell hospitals that they don’t need to sterilize their scalpels and other medical equipment?The American people need a secretary of HHS who will listen to scientists and doctors, and not conspiracy theorists.We need a secretary of HHS who will listen to medical experts who may disagree with him, not fire them summarily.Bottom line: we need an HHS secretary who will not engage in a war on science and the truth itself.Secretary Kennedy must step down.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

Kirk’s killing is also sending prominent conservatives on a warpath, setting the stage for a dangerous expansion of federal government repression.Kirk was a social media megastar and the founder of Turning Point USA, the foremost rightwing youth organization in the country. His political positions were to the far right, and his language was often combative, to say the least. HecalledMartin Luther King, Jr “awful” andsaid“we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s”. He believed in the so-called great replacement theory, which asserts that elites are encouraging mass migration to undermine white people in western countries. “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America,” hewroteon X the day before he was killed. He alsoblamed“Jewish dollars” for funding “cultural Marxist ideas and supporters”.Charlie Kirk’s death is a tragic marker of the indiscriminate nature of political violence | Margaret SullivanRead moreKirk said being “trans is a mental delusion”. He portrayed himself as a free speech champion while also running a “Professor Watchlist” against liberal professors. “Having an armed citizenry comes with a price,” hesaid, explaining his opposition to gun control. “I think it’s worth … [the] cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so we can have the second amendment.” And he alsosuggesteda “patriot” should pay the bail of therightwing conspiracy theoristwho attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, with a hammer, fracturing his skull.So, yeah. I find a lot of what Kirk peddled to be reprehensible, but he should still be alive to say it. Obviously, no one should be killed for their views. In an open society, people like Kirk should be able to say what they want, just as I should have the right to say what I want. And that includes the right to criticize. For example, when Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker,saysthat “political violence has become all too common in American society. This is not who we are,” I should have the right to point out that political violence founded this country and political violence has taken many of our most important leaders, including Abraham Lincoln and Malcolm X. That list is getting longer now. The Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman, the leader of the state house Democratic caucus, was assassinated along with her husband just this past June at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in apolitically motivated killing.As political violence is escalating in the country – what the University of Chicago professor Robert Pape has dubbed “violent populism” – it is being performed with a mix of motives. Sometimes this violence comes from the left;moreoftenit comes from the right, while the motives of some others, such as Thomas Crooks, the young man who shot Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania in 2024, remainunclear.But if you listen to the Maga-sphere, today’s political environment is made uniquely murderous only because of a mythically powerful and extremely organized radical left. (A passing familiarity with the disputatious US left will quickly cement how far-fetched such beliefs are.) The motives driving Kirk’s shooter, still at large as I write this, are unknown. But that doesn’t matter. Sensing an opportunity, some of the most influential Maga conservatives are now hellbent on completely destroying “the left” – which in practice is anyone who voices opposition to their agenda – with all the might the federal government holds.Christopher Rufo, an influential conservative activist with close ties to the Trump administration,postedon X that the “last time the radical Left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J. Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years. It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.” Hardly a call for lowering the temperature of the discourse.Jesse Watters, a Fox News host,toldhis audience: “We are going to avenge Charlie’s death in the way that Charlie wanted to be avenged.” He continued: “They are at war with us. Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us.” The Maga political strategist Steve Bannontoldhis audience that “Charlie Kirk is a casualty of war. We are at war in this country. We are.” Elon Muskwroteon X that “The Left is the party of murder.” The far-right activist Laura Loomer (who holdssignificant influencewith the president)wrote: “The best way President Trump can reinforce Charlie’s legacy is by cracking down on the Left with the full force of the government,” adding: “We can’t allow for these people to live among us in society. If you threaten people over their political views, you should be jailed for 25 years or more.” Loomer seemed oblivious to fact that she was in fact threatening people over their political views.Not to be outdone, Trump chimed in with astatement: “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity,” he said, “and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it … From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on Ice agents, to the vicious murder of a healthcare executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House majority leader Steve Scalise and three others, radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.”Trump makes no mention of, say, the assassination of Melissa Hortman or the attack on Paul Pelosi. He conflates public opposition to Ice’s militarized policing with extreme political violence, and he insinuates, without evidence, that a broad leftwing conspiracy is directing events behind the scenes. Fanciful in description, Trump’s words are utterly terrifying in their meaning.Why? Because despite what you might think, Trump is not saying that all political violence comes from the left. Rather, he is suggesting that all that comes from the left is political violence. And once that lie is accepted as true, the call to destroy any and all opponents, and by every means available, won’t lag far behind. Our collective commitment to democracy and the right to free speech, including Kirk’s, demands that we reject such destruction.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionFreedom of speechcommentShareReuse this content"

In May, as the president prepared to visit, the Qatari government donateda luxury Boeing jet, a “palace in the sky” valued at $400m, which is nowbeing refittedso Trump can use it as Air Force One.But none of that, including Trump’s exuberant promises of protection, stopped Israel from attacking Qatar on Tuesday. Israellaunched a brazen airstrikeagainst a group of Hamas leaders who were meeting in the country’s capital, Doha, to consider the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal submitted by Israel and the US. The senior Hamas officials, including its top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the attack but six others were killed.Israel has replaced Iran as the biggest security threat to the Gulf states | Sanam VakilRead moreThat Israel was trying to kill the negotiators – and to destroy Qatar’s role as a mediator between Hamas and western powers – is no surprise. For nearly two years, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has consistentlyobstructed ceasefire talksand torpedoed potential deals by adding new demands or changing his mind. And when that hasn’t worked, Netanyahu has resorted toassassinating Hamas leadersin an apparent attempt to stall negotiations.Under Netanyahu, Israel is now a rogue state posing the greatest danger to stability in the Middle East. With unconditional political support and an unlimited supply of US weapons (starting under Joe Biden’s administration and expanding under Trump), Israel can bomb virtually anyone and anywhere in the region, with impunity. Over the past few months,Israel has bombedIran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen – and now Qatar, with little consequence beyond tepid condemnation from some western powers. And that’s not to mention Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians andinstigated a faminein parts of the territory.Netanyahu seems to have succeeded in blowing up the latest negotiations and Qatar’s role as an intermediary. On Tuesday, the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani,called the Israeli attack“an act of state terrorism”, and vowed that the emirate would continue its work as a mediator. But he seemed resigned that the current talks had collapsed and Qatar would not be able to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas anytime soon. “When it comes to the current talks, I don’t think there is something valid right now after we’ve seen such an attack,”he said.Since the regional chaos unleashed by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Qatar’s ruling family has tried to position itself as a global mediator, using its enormous natural gas wealth to distinguish itself as a small emirate capable of keeping channels open between enemies. Over the years, Doha has hosted peace negotiations between the US and Taliban leaders, and talks for prisoner exchanges between Iran and Washington. But that muscular foreign policy also pushed Qatar into conflict with its two larger and more powerful neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which accused Doha of financing terrorism and being too close with Iran. In 2017, the two countries led a blockade against Qatar – and Trump initially supported the siege during his first term as president,claiming that Qatar“has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level”.Qatar survived the blockade, which was lifted in January 2021, partly thanks to mediation by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser during his first term. Qatar also doubled down on its regional efforts as a negotiator. Aside from investing $8bn to upgrade Al-Udeid airbase outside the capital, which houses more than 10,000 troops and is thelargest US military installationin the Middle East, Qatar tried to prove itself indispensable to Washington in other ways, especially by hosting non-state groups that are labeled as terrorists by western powers.Qatar has hosted several of Hamas’s top political leaders since 2012, when they were forced out of Syria by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Qatari officials insist they allowed Hamas leaders to settle and open offices in Doha only because, they say, Barack Obama’s administration asked the emirate toestablish an indirect channelthat would enable the US to communicate with Hamas, which Washington had designated as aterrorist organizationin the 1990s.Despite Qatar’s history of punching above its weight in international diplomacy, the Israel-Hamas negotiations have been the most high-stakes undertaken by Qatar’s emir, the 45-year-old Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. For nearly two years, Qatar’s leaders had exerted significant energy and political capital to negotiate a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, only to be repaid with an Israeli attack on their country. Qatar’s leaders also learned a hard lesson: Trump’s promises of protection are largely worthless, especially when it comes to Israel. Even Qatar’s extravagant donation of a luxury jet to Trump – possibly themost expensive giftfrom a foreign government in US history – did not make a difference.After Tuesday’s attack, Trump said he had assured Qatar’s ruler in aphone callthat “such a thing will not happen again on their soil”. But Israeli officials were quick to declare that they will not hesitate to target Hamas leaders in Qatar again. As Israel’s ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter,told Fox News: “If we didn’t get them this time, we’ll get them next time.” And Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations was evenmore blunt: “There will be no immunity for terrorists – not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, and not in Qatar.”Israel’s sense of impunity will continue to grow, as long as US presidents fail to restrain its rogue leaders from more brazen and lawless acts.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsQatarOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Other, more unusual habitats includemaerl beds, seagrass meadows and kelp forests. These biodiverse landscapes are home to 330 species of fish, as well as seals, seahorses and thousands of lesser‑known species – which share them with the offshore energy, fishing and shipping industries.Heightened awareness of pollution from sewage and plastics means that the public knows more about marine conservation than it used to. For his 99th birthday this year, the broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough made a film,Ocean, in which he described the seas as the planet’s “greatest life support system”, and urged people to get behind efforts to protect and renew marine nature.But despite an energeticcampaign against sewage dischargesby water companies, an issue that featured in last year’s general election, and valiant local volunteer efforts such as theseahorse surveyin Dorset’s Studland Bay, increased concern about the state of the seas has not delivered a robust, clearly understood national framework for underwater conservation. The government this weekrejecteda recommendation from parliament’s environmental audit committee that bottom-trawling by fishing boats should be banned in marine protected areas (MPAs). That was a mistake and a sign of how far there is still to go.The EU aims to ban bottom-towed fishing gear in MPAs altogether by 2030. Sweden and Greece have already gone ahead. These weighted nets damage flora as well as scooping up fauna when dragged across the sea bed. Sir David has likened their use to“bulldozing a rainforest”. Currently, their use is only prohibited by the UK government – which shares responsibility for marine conservation with the devolved administrations – inthree areas, including Allonby Bay off the coast of Cumbria. These were granted additional protections in 2023 and classified as “highly protected”.Emma Reynolds, the environment secretary, has only been in the cabinet for a week. She should revisit the decision to let this destructive form of fishing continue in MPAs. But the challenge for the government goes wider too. Fragmented leadership, a weak planning framework, and a lack of capacity to engage stakeholders mean that marine conservation in the UK is nowhere near where it should be, given what we know about the importance of the oceans in countering global heating and wildlife loss.Stronger governance and regulation of the marine landscape might sound dry and arcane. But the environment committee is right that one department should have overall responsibility for the tricky task of arbitrating between different interest groups – tourists, fishers, offshore wind. The current situation is chaotic and as Mike Cohen of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations put it, “everybody cannot have everything”. Funding to an ecological monitoring scheme in Lyme Bay should be restored so that research there can continue.While the goal of protecting 30% of UK waters by 2030 looks remote, marine areas are not the only ones where conservation efforts are faltering. New analysis by a wildlife charity suggests that ashrinking portionof England has effective protections in place. As the planning bill makes its way through parliament, nature protections should be strengthened. The new environment secretary must create some momentum around marine conservation too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A far-right mob stormed the country’s institutions in his support. Yet democracy prevailed. And then, on Thursday, Brazil’s supreme courtsentenced the former president Jair Bolsonaroto 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and “annihilate” democracy through a coup. The sprawling plot was both modern and crudely old school – extending from an onlinedisinformation campaignto undermine faith in the voting system, to aborted plans toassassinatethe newly elected presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, and the supreme court justice investigating Bolsonaro. It culminated in the riots in Brasília in January 2023.Four of the five judges on the panel found Bolsonaro guilty. Seven close allies from the military and security establishment were convicted alongside him for the same crimes – including his former defence and justice ministers, former spy chief, generals and the former navy commander. According to the prosecution, the plans for a putsch failed because the army and air force chiefs refused to take part.The conviction is a relief not only to defenders of democracy – many of whom celebrated in the streets in the hours after the verdict – but also groups targeted under Bolsonaro’s rule, including human rights activists, Indigenous peoples and the LGBTQ+ community. It also marks a hugely important moment for Brazil in challenging historical norms of impunity. Despite its lengthy history of coups, no member of the military had been convicted of coup-related offences in a civilian court until now. Thefirst convictionfor any of thehorrific abusescommitted during its 1964-85 military dictatorship came only four years ago.Bolsonaro, who is under house arrest, denied all charges and has won enthusiastic backing from the US, where his son Eduardo has lobbied relentlessly on his behalf. In July, Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, whichhe tied to the supposed “witch-hunt”against a man he describes as a friend. The alarming attempt to export this administration’s anti-democratic impulses backfired,boosting supportfor President Lula.Nonetheless, Bolsonaro’s conviction will probably fire up domestic supporters who see him as a martyr and may, more than ever, believe they are being politically persecuted. His supporters in congress are pushing for an amnesty bill, though it is thought more likely to win reduced sentences for those involved in 2023’s violence in Brasília than freedom for the ex-president. He may instead be placing his hopes in next year’s election – when the incumbent president is expected to run again – to boost support for him in the senate andinstall a rightwing president, possibly even a member of his family.Yet while Bolsonaro only narrowly lost 2022’s election, a clear majority of Braziliansaccept that he participated in plotting a coup: 52%, against 36% who said that he did not, in a recent poll. Securing this outcome for democracy will require continued commitment, but it is nonetheless remarkableThe conviction of Bolsonaro has sent a powerful signal heard not only in his country but more broadly: that leaders must be held accountable if they undermine democratic norms.Brazilhas successfully upheld the will of the people against the scheming of a populist would-be autocrat. This victory must be defended, but it shows others what is possible.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For instance, despite billions in military and counternarcotics assistance by successive US administrations,Colombianow produces more cocaine than ever before, flooding a rapidly growing market.Similarly, hard-hitting military responses in one country have pushed the problem across borders.Ecuadorand Brazil have experienced significant surges in drug trafficking and crime as a result of Colombia’s (unsuccessful) crackdowns.There is only one way to wrestle control from the criminal cartels: governments must shift focus away from law enforcement and treat drug misuse as a public health issue. They should also decriminalise personal use and possession and work towards creating legal and regulated drug markets. This will not completely eliminate the illicit market, but it will significantly reduce its share, while bringing choice, transparency and a safer supply to millions of people who use drugs.Alcohol and tobacco have seen consumption decline not because they were banned, but because they were regulated, taxed and accompanied by public education. It is hard to believe that these lessons have yet to be applied fully to currently illicit drugs.North America’s fentanyl crisis is heartbreaking, but repeating the mistakes of the past will deepen the loss. We need courage and honesty. The “war on drugs” has failed everywhere. Ending it now will save thousands of lives.Richard BransonMember, Global Commission on Drug Policy; founder, Virgin GroupI appreciated your article on Rand Paul’s response to the Trump administration’s escalation of its counterdrug policies in the Caribbean (Republican condemns Vance for ‘despicable’ comments on Venezuelan boat strike, 7 September). As a former military officer involved in US Southern Command’s counterdrug policies in Central and South America in the 1990s, I agree with Senator Paul’s concerns about this military action, which destroyed a suspected drug-running boat.Bypassing the normal law enforcement actions of the US Coast Guard in interdicting suspected drug shipments at sea, and only using deadly force when fired upon, sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to an attack on innocent civilians.Such an incident took place in 2001, when a Peruvian air force pilot shot down a small private aircraft suspected of running drugs, but was actually flown by US missionaries, killing US citizenVeronica Bowersand her infant child. TheCIA did reprimand 16 employeesin 2008 for the carelessness of the Airbridge Denial programme and lack of accountability, which led to the shootdown of 15 suspected drug-trafficking aircraft during a six-year period.Richard KilroyCharlottesville, Virginia, USAHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I live about half a mile outside it and I am regularly shocked by the Dickensian (sometimes more Hardy-esque) conditions that former acquaintances live in.The deprivation is alarmingly similar to what I saw as a child. I don’t understand how the inequalities in our society haven’t declined in the past 40 years. So much else has changed.I am reading The Parish of Myddle. It was published in 1701 and is considered one of the best primary sources describing the civil war. The author, Richard Gough, was proud of his family’s ties to the locale – like other ordinary people, his loyalty in the war was neither royalist nor parliamentary, but with his countrymen and environment.How little life has changed for the most vulnerable since then. Elderly people often became beggars, which could see them jailed or forced to work. Women and children were traipsed from village to village because no one (the parish councils) wanted to take responsibility. I’ve seen family members go through the exact same.

In a culture that too often celebrates relentless acquisition and action, her words offer timely encouragement towards another way of being.She observes: “Wedoto stay in the shallows, so we don’t have to be in the depths. But we know the way to a better life sits below the surface, not on it.” This image of the deep sea is an apt and illuminating metaphor for the hidden interior universe of currents and forces that shape us.My own decades-long pursuit of interior exploration has been the defining work of my later life. It is the one domain I can govern with any certainty, and I hope that it brings benefit to those around me. Some dismiss such inquiry as selfish or narcissistic, citing its apparent lack of visible contribution to community. Yet my experience suggests the reverse. By resisting the lure of superficial satisfactions, I find myself more attuned to others, less ruled by egoic need, and more capable of compassion and tolerance.To observe and engage with these inner dynamics is, I believe, a creative act of self-nurture that can enrich and fortify both self and society. It fosters resilience, encourages patience and provides inspiration. For me, poetry has become the means of charting such passages, grounding experiences that often defy language, and giving tentative form to the unseen movements of the unconscious. In writing, I seek not only to steady my own course but also to signal that such inner voyages, though demanding, can offer gifts of empathy, depth and renewal for the wider human community.Kate PetersHayling Island, HampshireAs a psychologist, I enjoyed Moya Sarner’s article on the unconscious. I agree that many of us stay busy, preoccupied and in the shallows, and that it depletes meaning from our lives. However, I would argue a few points. One is that although the unconscious certainly contains feelings, especially in cultures that disproportionately value intellect, feelings are actually just the tip of the iceberg. The unconscious also contains symbols, archetypes and creative inspiration, as well as internalised biases and beliefs about ourselves, others and the world.Second, I agree that exploring the unconscious makes a better life possible, but it also makes a better world possible. Carl Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious suggests that turning towards the deeper life and the personal unconscious can move the collective needle to help many social ills resolve more easily and peacefully. Finally, the approach of the article suggests working with the unconscious as a means to an end, and this reflects the transactional mindset of materialist western culture. It assumes that by investing our efforts in a personal process, we will reap specific benefits from it.However, I have found the unconscious more interested in building a relationship than allowing itself to be mined for resources. By cultivating this relationship with respect, patience, openness, and without expectation of deliverables, the unconscious may decide to teach us about a world that is possible but is far beyond the reaches of our current imagination.So, in sum – I agree wholeheartedly with Moya that our unconscious material is “capable of incredible force” but disagree that “everything that exists in our unconscious also exists in the ocean”. I believe our depths and potential – individually and collectively – are unfathomable, and working with the personal unconscious is just the beginning of understanding what is possible.Magda PermutPortland, Oregon, USMoya Sarner says that a better life is possible if you dive deep into your subconscious, but if your anxiety is triggered by continual money worries, poor housing and poor healthcare access, with no realistic hope of improvement in your life circumstances, then no amount of “digging deep” is going to change your life.Cognitive behavioural therapy and deep breathing may help, but that is not the same thing. “Deep” psychotherapy very rarely really considers the major impact of socioeconomic factors on the psyche. For those experiencing those anxieties, only improved finances and life options will help, and then perhaps allow space for an individual to open the door to deeper personal changes.Name and address suppliedMoya Sarner makes the argument that, in order to know what we really need, we must dive deep into our unconscious minds to reveal our hidden emotions. But is this really true? The happiest, most fulfilled people I know are characterised not by their ability to “look inwards”, but rather by their interest in, and capacity to connect with, others in varied ways.The article seems to suggest that “doing” is a distraction technique that keeps you in the “emotional shallows”, yet lots of busy people stay busy because they are enjoying life and want to fit one more thing in, whether it be a social activity, a hobby or something in service of others. We all need to reflect on our own thoughts and emotions from time to time, particularly when life is throwing challenges at us, but perhaps to achieve real fulfilment, we would do better to put aside the mental digging, and instead look outwards at our fellow human beings.Chris MarshallForest Row, East SussexThe author appears to presuppose a community of people who can afford to see a therapist or a psychoanalyst. A large portion of humanity will never be in a position to receive therapy. In addition, to speak of a meaningful life, what about people born into a community or region inundated with constant war, famine or genocide? Let’s focus more on ending hunger and war, and then talk about a more meaningful life.I volunteer at a homeless shelter weekly, cook food for a living and also regularly provide food free to my community. I certainly reflect on deeper parts of my consciousness and I’ll tell you what: it doesn’t require money and therapy. Get involved with your community and you will have found free therapy.Patrick WickettAustin, Texas, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While theSenateandHouse of Representativeshave made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.‘I don’t know how we would survive’: caregivers speak of fears over upcoming Medicaid cutsRead more“We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop,” said Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader.In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country.

He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed bythe One Big Beautiful Bill ActRepublicans passed in July.They have also pushed for an extension of subsidies for the premiums charged by Affordable Care Act plans, warning that millions of Americans will be forced to pay more for health coverage if they are not renewed.“They’re already feeling it,” said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. “In several states, notices have gone out already how your healthcare premiums and your insurance is going to go way up, hundreds of dollars.”Many unanswered questions remain in the appropriations process, including how long a short-term funding bill would last, and if it would encompass any spending bills that the parties have found agreement on. With Republicans able to pass most legislation through the House with a simple majority, the spending battle is likely to center on the Senate, where the GOP will need to win the support of at least seven Democrats to overcome the filibuster.In an interview with Punchbowl News on Friday, the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said he expected the House to pass, with Trump’s support, a short-term bill to stretch government funding for seven weeks to the Thanksgiving holiday, the goal being to give appropriators more time to finish their work. He accused Democrats of seeking confrontation for political reasons.“I think that they see it as politically advantageous to have a shutdown. I think that their base is clamoring for that,” Thune said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t have a good reason to do it, and I don’t intend to give them a good reason to do it.”Democrats are wary of a repeat of thefunding squabblethat occurred earlier this year, when Schumer and a handful of Democratic senators reluctantly supported legislation to keep the government funded, arguing that letting spending lapse so early in Trump’s term would undermine their ability to resist his attempts to remake the federal government.They are now facing pressure from activist groups such as MoveOn, which said in a memo sent to Democratic leadership earlier this week that the party should “refuse support for any funding bill that doesn’t reverse Republicans’ massive healthcare cuts”.“There is no denying that Democrats are left with little legislative power as Republicans control all three branches of government. But that is exactly why Democrats have to use every ounce of leverage we have surrounding the September 30 funding deadline to prove the Democratic party’s commitment to fighting like hell for the American people,” read the memo, which was first reported by Politico.Democrats hope to win back the House next year, which the GOP controls by a majority that is no larger than three seats. In an interview with NBC News, the congresswoman Suzan DelBene, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, said Republicans should be blamed for any shutdown.“If we’re heading for a shutdown, it’s because that’s where they’re leading us,” she said. “We’re ready to be at the table. Republicans don’t even know what they want to do. They’re in charge. They have all the levers.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdownMedicaidUS healthcareDonald TrumpHouse of RepresentativesTrump administrationUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”In Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 thatGen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military ruleduring which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.But on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.Yucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”Also at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expertBruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillipsduring Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”Beto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”Those festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.Describing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.Jail for Bolsonaro by no means signals the end of his political movementRead moreAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.Trump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”At the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”A carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Wearing a trim khaki-green jacket, the European Commission president smiled, shook hands and exchanged air kisses with some of the politicians, who had front-row seats for her annual state of the union address.The hour-longspeechon Wednesday had a stark message: Europe must fight for its place in an “unforgiving” world, facing major powers that are either “ambivalent or openly hostile” towards it.Only minutes after she sat down, she was hearing equally tough responses. “We are losing Europeans; we’re not taking them with us. We’re weak when they want protection,” Valérie Hayer, leader of the centrist Renew group, told her. “The summer was very painful,” said Green leader Bas Eickhout. “Europe has entered a world of power, yet we are still playing chess in a boxing match.”These were more than routine rhetorical flourishes. This summer was one of harsh realities for the EU. The UStrade dealvon der Leyen signed with Donald Trump in July was an unequal bargain, decried by right and left as a humiliation for Europe. Russia escalated its attacks on Ukraine, while EU leaders were left wincing at the spectacle ofTrump’s red carpet welcome for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska. Israel’s war on Gaza continued relentlessly, killing more than 64,000 people and bringing famine to the strip, while EU countries were unable to agree on modest sanctions against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Meanwhile,forest fires, exacerbated by the climate crisis, broke recordsas flames consumed 1m hectares across affected countries, an area equivalent to about one-third of Belgium.Surveying the season’s political news, Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister who is widely revered in Brussels, said events had“swept away any illusionthat economics alone could ensure geopolitical power”. Europe, he said, was “ill-equipped in a world where geo-economics, security and the stability of supply sources, rather than efficiency” shape international trade relations. He said the EU had to “adapt to the existential demands of its time”.Europe’s painful summer has dented von der Leyen’s reputation. She arrived in Brussels in 2019 promising to lead a “geopolitical commission”, making the EU a foreign policy player, rather than simply a market. This week, anopinion pollin the EU’s five largest member states (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland) showed that52% found her trade deal a “humiliation”, while 75% thought she had defended European interests “very” or “fairly” badly.Anna Cavazzini, a Green MEP who chairs the European parliament’s internal market committee, has also encountered such negative verdicts. The message that a “strong EU” would defend European interests against “a bully on the other side of the Atlantic” had “really resonated with my voters, who are in eastern Germany and not the biggest fans of the EU, usually”. The outcome left them disappointed, she told the Guardian.Cavazzini does not fix all the blame on the commission, saying that many EU governments shunned more assertive stances to Trump’s tariff threats, while seeking toprotect favoured industries. Member states “were holding the commission back”, industries had their own interests in mind and Europe was not “fully united behind the idea that you have to stand up to Trump,” she said.Under the deal announced at the US president’s Turnberry golf course, the EU agreed to eliminate tariffs on many US goods, while accepting 15% duties on its products and 50% on steel. Von der Leyen, who has long argued for more clean homegrown energy, promised Europe would buy $750bn (€640bn) of US liquified natural gas, oil and nuclear products by 2028.In Strasbourg, von der Leyen came out fighting for what she called “the best possible deal out there” that provided “crucial stability in our relations with the US at a time of grave global insecurity”. European officials argue that the deal was necessary to safeguard jobs, but alsoUS involvement in defending Ukraine. “[Is] what happened during the summer something that will make Europeans proud?” asked one senior EU official. “No. But this doesn’t mean that the reaction and the management of the situation was not intelligent. We are not yet the defence power that we should be. And that, of course, means that there are still vulnerabilities that we need to take into account.”In contrast, von der Leyen won support for herfirmer stance this week on the Gaza conflict– although critics also said it wastoo little,too late. The commission president said she would freeze European funds for Israel’s government and propose sanctions on extremist ministers. But she still has a lot of work to convince critics about her broader strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We cannot support Ukraine on our own in front of Putin. We do nothing against the Israeli government in Gaza.” She contrasted the management of recent months unfavourably withvon der Leyen’s first term, when the EU leader was widely seen to have taken bold decisions on Covid vaccines and climate action.The critique from the left is sharpened by a breakdown in trust between the Socialists and European People’s party, the two largest groups in the European parliament, who have a vital say over whether the commission can pass its legislation. Both accuse each other of undermining the parliament’s slender pro-European forces, at a time when nationalists and the far right hold greater sway than ever in the institution.In a further sign of pressure, von der Leyen faces two potential motions of censure in the European parliament: one from the far right, another from the radical left.Both groups said this week that they have the necessary 72 votes to table a motion of censure, which in theory could trigger the resignation of the commission. That outcome has been ruled out by the more numerous pro-EU groups, whose votes would be needed to oust the EU executive. But it is a sign of Europe’s deep polarisation in turbulent times.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionanalysisShareReuse this content"

It said the next phase of the protests represented a “major escalation” that would create an “unprecedented challenge” for the police, with 1,100 people already registered to take part and risk arrest.“There should be no confusion about where the blame lies: it sits squarely with the government for pursuing this authoritarian ban, plunging an overstretched police force and court and prison systems which are already in crisis, into further chaos,” a spokesperson said. “The power lies with the new home secretary to end this farce by listening to MPs, lords,UN experts, legal professionals, human rights advocates – and the majority of her own party’s members – and lift this dangerous, anti-democratic ban.”They accused the prime minister, Keir Starmer, of “grotesque double standards” formeeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, this week, while people had been arrested for holding cardboard signs in support of Palestine Action. They said it made people “even more determined to do whatever it takes to overturn this unjust ban, including by targeting Starmer’s upcoming conference”.Protests at the party conference, which begins on 28 September, will be an unwelcome distraction for the prime minister as he attempts to address Labour’s slump in the polls.Defend Our Juries launched a new call for people across the country to show their defiance by placing a sign saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” – the same wording people have brandished on placards at the demonstrations – in their front windows. It follows a viral video of a former Labour councillor, Keith Hackett, beingtold by policehe could legally display a poster in support of Palestine Action because it was “not in public”.Last Saturday’s demonstration was the second major protest organised by Defend Our Juries in defiance of the ban. Defend Our Juries claimed there were 1,500 people holding signs saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” and that the police’s failure to arrest everyone showed they were overwhelmed.At the previous demonstration, last month, 532 people were arrested,half of whom were aged 60 or above. A spokesperson claimed opposition to the ban, the first of a direct action protest group, was “growing at an exponential rate”.The then home secretary, Yvette Cooper,announced plans to proscribe Palestine Actionin June, three days after it claimed responsibility for a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, although it later emerged that she was advised to proscribe the group in March. She said the group, which targeted organisations it claimed were complicit in Israeli war crimes against Palestinians, had a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and was a threat to national security.Since the bancame into force on 5 July, more than 1,600 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, including vicars, priests, doctors, former government advisers, army veterans, and many elderly and disabled people. The figure is more than were previously arrested during the entire “war on terror”since 2001.Most have not been charged, although seven people appeared in court last week accused of being organisers of the demonstrations.On Wednesday, the Trades Union Congress annual congress unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to repeal the proscription of Palestine Action.The president of the civil servants’ union said the ban represented a “significant abuse of counter-terrorist powers and a direct attack on our right to protest against the genocidal Israeli regime”.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionProtestLabour conferenceUK security and counter-terrorismPoliceLiverpoolLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right.Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.In the letter, Nick Lowles said: “Hate breeds when those in power are silent. I implore you and other ministers to speak out urgently in defence of our migrant communities and our multicultural society more generally. It is imperative we all push back against the onslaught of racism we currently face because silence will only encourage our opponents more.”The challenge to No 10 speaks to many MPs’ fear that the party vacated the political playing field over the summer months as Farage, asylum hotel protests and rows over flags dominated. Several said they hoped that it would be a key theme of theLabourdeputy leadership race between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell on how the party could better defend its core values.MPs who have called for greater clarity in the fight against rightwing hatred include those who had stood for deputy leader as well as a number of candidates who had been urged to stand for the position.The former cabinet minister Louise Haigh said: “In recent months we’ve seen the far right allowed to set the terms of debate on migrants and minority communities, with too little challenge from those in power. That failure has whipped up tensions in communities right across the UK and risks embedding further division.“What’s crucial now is that we stand firm on our values – that means challenging the demonisation of migrants, exposing the hypocrisy of figures like Nigel Farage, and making the positive case for a politics that genuinely delivers change.”The communities minister, Alison McGovern, who dropped out of the race for deputy leader, said earlier this week she wanted Labour to make a far more emotional argument and that the progressive cause was “at risk of being lost” unless it could tell that story.“Now is the time for progressives to realise that it’s the Labour party that has this unique place in British society, bringing people together from different backgrounds on the things that they have in common, and showing that if we fight together, we can win.”Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who had been the Labour left’s candidate for deputy leader, said the party had a unique responsibility to halt a march towards the hard right.“Only the Labour party can stop this from happening,” the MP said. “That is an immense amount of pressure on us, but it’s also a huge opportunity, and we only meet that challenge if we do it in the way we know best, and that’s by not trying to ou- reform Reform and by being Labour.”Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said: “The history of this nation has been shaped by immigration and the future of it will be too – whether the skills it brings, the ideas we learn from, or even the taxes those who come here pay.“Telling the story of who we are and who we can be and how that is strengthened by diversity, rather than threatened by it, is not something any of us can sit out and is a leadership role for all of us, including the government.”Sarah Owen, the chair of the women and equalities committee, who had been the favourite of some MPs to run for deputy, said the party had to meet the challenge of other parties fuelling division.“Community cohesion has never been more important, and the risks of getting it wrong have never been more dangerous … Othering and demonising communities will not make anyone better off, except the people peddling easy answers to the country’s problems.”Polly Billington, the MP for East Thanet and a key supporter of Powell’s for the deputy leadership, said: “The vast majority of people know that Britain is made stronger by our diversity, tolerance, and respect – core Labour values that we should always defend.The far rightdespise modern Britain and everything it stands for, and it is essential that as a party we stand up to their poisonous agenda.”Among MPs and also within government, there is a growing feeling that Starmer himself is not doing enough to take the fight to Reform and the far right, and has been conceding too much ground in the language of understanding concerns about migration.A senior Labour source said: “It’s not just about narrative. It’s what is our purpose and how do we use power? The stakes are a shift to a radical right authoritarian government; as progressives, that’s an emergency.”Lowles said he had written to the prime minister to urge him to publish a new community cohesion strategy. “A year after racist rioting swept the nation, hostility and division are still growing,” he said. “From protests at asylum centres to rows over flags and growing anti-migrant demonstrations, our communities remain under pressure.“Known far-right groups have used local issues to stage protests outside hotels housing people seeking asylum. At the same time, the so-called flag campaign has emerged, led by people with a long history of far-right activism. A small minority is driving this division, but they do not represent the UK.”Explore more on these topicsLabourThe far rightRaceImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

But many toxic chemicals escape treatment, ending up in waterways or accumulating on fields. Currently all of England’s rivers fail to meet legal standards for chemical pollution.Analysis by the Guardian and Watershed Investigations shows about 3.5m tonnes ofleachateare generated each year, with more than 750,000 tonnes sent to sewage works unable to deal with chemicals found in leachate such asPfas“forever chemicals”, some of which are carcinogenic, as well as PCBs, dioxins, flame retardants, solvents, endocrine disruptors, microplastics and other hazardous chemicals.“Some of these wastes simply shouldn’t be going into sewage treatment works – it’s basically a form of laundering,” an Environment Agency source who did not wish to be named said. “You lose the leachate in bulkier material to dilute and disperse it.”Forensic scientist and Pfas expert Dr Dave Megson said he was “amazed that this was happening”, having assumed it was only “a relatively minor practice” under strict controls.“It seems like the whole system is out of control,” he said, saying that most sewage plants were designed for human waste, not chemical effluents, and that adding large volumes of leachate could “disrupt the efficiency of treatment sites” and make them less effective.The EA source said: “What you really need is an upfront treatment facility … the level of treatment just isn’t there at most works. Pfas and similar chemicals just pass straight through.”The analysis found about 1.7m tonnes of leachate received only basic biological treatment. Of the 750,000 tonnes sent to water company works and mixed with sewage, about 536,000 tonnes were treated this way. The volumes add strain to already overstretched plants, contributing toraw sewagespills into rivers and seas.Megson said his “main concern is the toxic chemical load … passing through those sites and then directly into our food chain”. He said landfill leachate “can contain thousands of toxic chemicals. They were buried for a reason … we don’t want them in our wider environment.”Instead of being “repackaged into fertiliser”, many chemicals survived treatment, were “reconcentrated into sludge and applied directly on to our food”, he added, calling the situation “an absurd series of events” needing urgent intervention.While leachate from some inert landfills may be harmless, others contain a toxic chemical mix. Operators do only basic monitoring, with no routine tests for Pfas and many other pollutants. Checks of the leachate when it arrives at the sewage treatment works are minimal, and sludge is still tested only for heavy metals underoutdated 1989 rules, leaving most contaminants unregulated.Leachate and sludge are locked in a cycle. It is sent to sewage plants as the cheapest disposal option – water companies are paid to take it and profit by selling the resulting sludge to farmers. Farmers accept it as cheap fertiliser; while the water sector relies on them because there are few alternatives.The dependency is so entrenched that farmers once threatened a “sludge strike” over inheritance tax, though it never materialised. An EA source said cutting off leachate to sewage works overnight would trigger an “absolute crisis”, overwhelming specialist treatment facilities and forcing government intervention.“Whichever policy government chooses to adopt, there’s going to be an impact somewhere,” they said. “It’s about trying to find a way through this, which doesn’t negate the fact that there is environmental harm being caused now.”Historicaland closed landfills are a significant problem because they generate leachate for decades, with the older ones leaching directly into the environment. Operators are supposed to set aside aftercare funds during the life of a site, but these pots are often limited. If disposal costs rise – for example if waste must be diverted to expensive hazardous treatment plants – funds could run out, leaving “orphan sites” with no one responsible for long-term management.The figures reveal a striking regional imbalance in the amount of leachate generated. Landfills in the south-west reported 1,264,563 tonnes, followed by the north-west at 719,405 tonnes and the south-east (excluding London) with 500,835 tonnes.Severn TrentWaterand United Utilities’ works treat the most permitted leachate, according to the analysis, with 447,000 and 156,000 tonnes reported received in 2023. Wessex Water (103,203), Southern Water (36,806), Northumbrian Water (16,484), South West Water (6,884) follow.The Environment Agency source said some plants accepted leachate without the necessary permits, meaning sludge volumes probably exceed official figures: “There was a degree of designed ignorance – some companies turned a blind eye and waited for us to come to them.” The agency is now drafting standard rules permits for tankered liquid wastes but lacks the resources to bring all sites into line quickly.Efforts are complicated by the five-year investment cycles of water companies, overseen by Ofwat. Even if ministers demanded tougher treatment standards tomorrow, water companies would not have the right technology in place for years.A Water UK spokesperson said companies “treat waste in line with rules set by the government and theEnvironment Agency… that specify the type and level of residual chemicals” to be removed. But they called for a ban on “forever chemicals like Pfas”, backed by a national plan for removal and a “producer-responsibility scheme” so manufacturers fund clean-up and restoration.The Environment Agency acknowledged that while some leachate was pretreated before going into the sewage system, some was directly discharged or tankered into sewage works, along with other industrial effluents and domestic sewage. A spokesperson said it was “working closely with the landfill industry and water companies to better understand the challenges these chemicals pose … including reviewing all tankered waste disposals at wastewater treatment works to ensure permit conditions protect the environment and are being met.”Georgia Elliott-Smith of campaign group Fighting Dirty said: “The fate of toxic liquids oozing out of old landfill sites is an enormous dirty secret between landfill owners, the EA, and water companies.” She said that if, as the group suspected, authorities were failing in their duty to protect health and the environment, the group would pursue high court action “to force them to do the right thing”.The sentiment is echoed by Dr Dan Drage of the University of Birmingham, who said much stricter upstream regulation was needed to ensure new chemicals were proved safe before mass production. Too often, he said, chemicals were marketed only for “their potential for harm” to emerge later, leaving “a complex and almost incomprehensible clean-up job” decades on.Leachate, Drage said, contained persistent and toxic substances that, when sent to wastewater plants, were “effectively re-released” into the environment, risking contamination of waterways and agriculture and chronic exposure through food and drink.Explore more on these topicsFarmingPollutionWaterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only is his home town, the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, prone to persistent power cuts, he also doubted the quality of his new vehicle.Four months on, Deghareg is pleased with his purchase since he no longer has to endure long lines at the petrol pump, caused by Ethiopia’s chronic fuel shortages.“I’d have to wait two to three hours, even if I got there in the early morning, and they often run out of petrol before it’s your turn,” he says. “Having an EV saves me lots of time. I have no regrets.”View image in fullscreenArchitect Deghareg Bekele at an EV charging station in Addis Ababa.Photograph: Fred HarterUntil recently, electric vehicles were almost unheard of in Ethiopia. But last year it became the first country to ban imports of combustion engine vehicles. Now, EVs are a common sight in the capital. The most prevalent brand is China’s BYD, which recently overtook Tesla as the world’s largest EV maker, although western vehicles are also popular.Roughly 115,000 EVs now ply Ethiopia’s roads, out of a total of 1.5m cars in the country, according to the transport ministry. It wants to increase the number to 500,000 by 2030.Ethiopia is an unlikely proponent of the transition to EVs. Roughly half of its 126 million people haveno access to electricity,only20% of households have access to it for at least 23 hours a dayand only a third of households have access through the grid. Power cuts mean many factories are not fully operational.These shortages will be alleviated to an extent following the opening of theEthiopian Grand Renaissance Damearlier this month, 14 years after construction began. With a maximum capacity of5,150 megawatts, it will double Ethiopia’s current electricity output – 97% of which already comes from hydropower.But problems remain with the national grid, which is prone to outages and will cost billions of dollars to expand to rural communities currently cut off from power.“We have massive potential in renewables,” says Bareo Hassen, state minister for transport. He says the decision to ban imports of diesel and petrol vehicles is part of Ethiopia’s push to promote green policies and reduce the pollution that chokes the capital during rush hour.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River in Guba, north-west Ethiopia, which came online this month.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBut the main motivation is economic, however. Ethiopia spends roughly $4.5bn (£3.3bn) a year importing fuel – a huge amount in a country where foreign currency is scarce and poverty is widespread. “It is one of our main expenditures,” says Bareo.By contrast, Ethiopia’s hydropower is cheap as well as green. This has helped to win over doubtful drivers in Addis Ababa, who have seen pump prices more than double in the past three years.Firew Tilahun, a taxi driver, estimates he used to spend 20,000 Ethiopian birr (£105) a month on fuel, a significant chunk of his earnings. Now he spends less than 3,000 birr a month recharging his Chinese EV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are still hugely expensive, with a BYD model costing roughly 2.2m Ethiopian birr (£11,000) in a country where doctors earn £60 a month on average. But combustion engine cars also fetch sky-high prices, the result of import levies of 200% in place before their ban, which wildly distorted the secondhand vehicle market.Ethiopia is also encouraging local production, but for now the scale is small. One of the main sites is run by Belayneh Kinde Group, an industrial conglomerate with a site on the western outskirts of Addis Ababa, where mechanics are assembling 150 Chinese minibuses in a large hangar.View image in fullscreenElectric vehicles are assembled at a plant on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.Photograph: Fred Harter“Our focus shouldn’t just be on importation,” says Bareo. “We wanted to create a local production capacity to create local skills and job opportunities for our citizens.”The abrupt transition to EVs has been uneven, however. Drivers complain they were given little time to prepare. Ethiopia only has just over 100 charging stations out of a target of more than 2,300, compared with 21,600 in London. Almost all of them are in Addis Ababa. This rules out road trips to the countryside, where power cuts are particularly frequent. It also makes owning an EV hugely impractical outside the capital.View image in fullscreenLema Wakgari charging his electric car. He says there needs to be more charging stations.Photograph: Fred HarterAt another charging station in Addis Ababa, Lema Wakgari, a coffee export manager, says he’s “really happy” with his BYD, but laments that he cannot drive to Hawassa, a popular lakeside resort a 177-mile (285km) drive south from Addis Ababa, without running the risk of getting stranded.“They need to build more charging stations – it’s a must,” he says. “Even in Addis there aren’t many available. No electric vehicles are driving outside the city right now. This car can go 420km. After that, what are you going to do?”Leading the charge: how a drive for electric vehicles is cleaning up NepalRead moreThere are also no plans to bring in electric versions of the heavy lorries that bring a large proportion of Ethiopia’s imports from the port in neighbouring Djibouti. As the fleet begins to dwindle from wear and tear, the economy may feel the effects.The chief executive of a large ride-hailing company in Addis Ababa says most of his drivers are sceptical about the durability of the vehicle’s batteries and how their value will hold up. But he has been won over after buying one himself and hopes the country’s EV infrastructure will catch up to meet demand.“When this policy was introduced, I thought it would be a spectacular failure because we don’t have good power infrastructure, we have a lot of power outages and not many charging stations,” he says.“Now, I’m cautiously optimistic.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentEthiopiaAfricaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, climate breakdown has made Nuku, the village he grew up in, a shadow of itself.“The trees from my childhood are no longer here, and the fruiting seasons are also off now,” he says.View image in fullscreenDestruction caused by Cyclone Yasa in Fiji.Photograph: Sheldon Chanel/The  GuardianIn 2020, the category five Cyclone Yasa hit Fiji, causing major damage and four deaths. It alsodisplaced tens of thousands of citizens and destroyed 800 homes.Qerewaqa still remembers the noise, smell, and adrenaline he felt during the cyclone, worried his roof could blow off or his walls might collapse, and listening for neighbours who could be calling for help.“You wait for a break in the winds to check on them,” he says. “It’s a lot of fear at different moments.”The Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term “ecoanxiety” to describe the chronic fear of environmental doom. A recent study foundnearly four in five children aged under 12 in the UK experience ecoanxiety, fearful of the state of the climate in the future. However, the term does not fully encapsulate the feelings of young people who endure natural disasters on the frontlines of climate breakdown.Qerewaqa’s experience of ecoanxiety is layered, he says. Within it is the pain from the loss of land, identity and ancestral knowledge, as well as a fear of what Fiji’s young people will face in the future.Qerewaqa works atAlliance for Future Generations (Fiji), a youth-led movement for sustainable development, and it is through this and his community that he finds optimism. “I have so much hope in my people,” he says. “They are so resilient, it escapes my vocabulary to find a word to describe how strong they are. It’s ancestral, in our blood, in our genes.”View image in fullscreenFlooding in Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in May 2024.Photograph: Daniel Marenco/The GuardianIn Brazil, Amanda Rossini Martins, 27, recounts the impact of the Rio Grande do Sul floods that struck southern Brazil in May 2024. It was the worst flooding Brazil had faced in 80 years.Towns were submerged underwater and hundreds died.“I remember walking through my home town after the water receded and feeling like I was in a postwar zone. It was shocking, surreal, and deeply painful,” Rossini says.Today, the climate crisis scares her and makes her “question everything about human nature”. After the floods, she told her psychoanalyst that she thought she had more time: “I truly believed that, by working for climate justice and doing my best, I could somehow delay the worst. I didn’t expect it to hit home so hard and so soon.”Her desire for motherhood has also been challenged as she “questions what it means to bring someone into a world filled with so much devastation and uncertainty.”Like Qerewaqa, Rossini still clings to hope using her roles as a lawyer and activist for the groupLatinas por el Climato fight for climate justice.“I see people fighting back,” she says. “I see biodiversity adapting and being resilient. I see joy, laughter, love, and children playing, and it reminds me of what we’re fighting for.”View image in fullscreenFloods in Adamawa state, north-east Nigeria in 2022.Photograph: Radeno Haniel/AFP/Getty ImagesTwo years before Brazil’s floods, a flood in Adamawa,Nigeria, would change Pwausoko Madayi’s life. In 2022, the smallholder farmer fulfilled his dream of becoming a soy farmer after investing nearly all of his savings into farm inputs and labour. The flooding would take that all away.“It destroyed all the farmlands and everything was ruined,” Madayi says. “There was a lot of grief because we are smallholder farmers and we farm to get food for our families. We farm to feed the hungry, not for commercial services.”After the “traumatising” flood, Madayi was left with minimal savings and tried to find a new job, but his searches were unsuccessful. With no other options, he returned to farming, but has given up trying to cultivate soy.“I am scared to farm soy now and want to stick to rice farming because it survives in swampy water,” he says.Madayi, who grew up by the Benin River, says flooding was a “once-every-10-year-occurrence” when he was a child but that now heavy flooding occurs every year.Each year of flooding there are farmers who lose the ability to work on their land but receive no mental health support to deal with the loss.“Till this day, I still have that fear,” Madayi, now 29, says. “When I think of venturing into any other thing I feel scared, even to venture into irrigation systems. What if the floods come and destroy everything again?”Madayi created theGreenNest Sustainability Hub, a social enterprise aiming to fight climate breakdown and support farmers in adopting climate-smart agricultural methods.As the climate crisis worsens, the range of people who experience ecoanxiety is growing. Some are tackling the feeling throughtherapy,prayeror byspending time in nature.Though such actions are often solitary, Rossini says being with one another can help people hold on to hope but also drive action, she says: “The small but meaningful acts of joy, whether that’s laughing with friends or creating something beautiful – these moments remind me of what we’re fighting for.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisExtreme weatherFijiBrazilNigeriaFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But surprisingly, despite its mild climate, the state is one of the places where sea levels are rising at the fastest rates in the world.For this week’s newsletter, I’d like to transport you to a serene ribbon of salt marsh there, to join the fight to save a species on the brink of extinction: the saltmarsh sparrow. Who is leading the fight? Septuagenarian and self-proclaimed “60s person”, Deirdre.In our latest Guardian Documentary, Between Moon Tides, we join Deirdre in the field alongside other citizen scientists hacking nature in the hope of saving this unassuming sparrow. When Deirdre learned that the saltmarsh sparrow the species is facing extinction before 2050 due to elevated high tides inundating nests and drowning fledgling birds, she knew this “unacceptable loss” had to be avoided. The idea? Installing a buoyant addition to nests susceptible to flooding, made from coffee filters.We live alongside more than 10,000 different species of bird in the world, of which around halfare declining in population, and 500 speciesmay face extinctionin the next century. In the US, Donald Trump’s administrationis carrying out an attackon the Endangered Species Act and federal wildlife agencies that, if successful, environmentalists warn will almost certainly drive numerous species closer to extinction. So this group of bird enthusiasts have decided that the DIY approach is best, in the hope they might inspire younger generations to think ahead and begin the work of saving other species less close to the brink.EnjoyBetween Moon Tides here. But before that, read on for a chat with the director, Jason Jaacks, about what the film means and why it matters.View image in fullscreenDeirdre, one of the stars of Between Moon Tides.Photograph: Jason Jaacks/The GuardianJason Jaacks is a film-maker, photographer and professor based in Rhode Island, whose work dives deep into the natural world through the lens of science, natural history and exploration. Guardian Documentaries asked Jason to make this beautiful film at a time that feels pivotal for American wildlife history; this isn’t the only species on the brink. This unassuming bird, and unassuming gaggle of characters, piqued my interest and struck me as unexpected. I asked Jason some questions about his approach to the story.How did you meet Deirdre and what made you want to tell her story?I learned about theSaltmarsh Sparrow Research Initiative(SSRI) while producing another film (Turtles on the Hill) about diamondback terrapins, another species that depends on salt marshes. What I find so unique about Deirdre and her team is the dedication – it takes an extraordinary amount of work to find and protect saltmarsh sparrow nests.I believe many people share her feelings towards species that are facing extinction, especially those in our back yard. But the fact that she has spent 10 years actualising that feeling is both incredible and inspirational. After I tagged along with the team in 2023, I was hooked: here was a story about three retirees and a plucky intern who were looking at extinction right in the face, and deciding to do something about it.Why did you decide on documentary film as the best format for this story?I’m drawn to visual stories. The salt marshes of coastal New England are beautiful places, especially up close. I was really drawn to the visuals of the marsh and how it changes with the tides twice a day. The saltmarsh sparrow (as well as the SSRI team) happen to be most active just after dawn, making the golden hour glow of the salt marsh particularly appealing.In addition to the visuals, I was drawn to the emotion of the story: Deirdre’s love of the sparrows and her passion to train the next generation. Documentaries have the power to transport an audience into someone else’s world, and my goal was to bring an audience into two: Deirdre’s, and the female saltmarsh sparrows as they cared for their nestlings.What stuck with you most from the shoot?I have two very memorable moments. Watching Cooper White, the SSRI’s intern, successfully find a nest and become a member of the Needle in the Haystack Society (which requires being thrown into the Warren River fully clothed) was particularly moving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To top off an emotionally tough evening, I lost my way in the dark and ended up sinking in an otherwise hidden hole in the marsh. I sank up to my chest and drenched a camera in the process.It’s easy to feel pessimistic about our planet. How hopeful do you feel that future generations will care about the environment?I’m actually very hopeful. I have two young children, aged five and eight, and their curiosity about the world is infectious. I was able to bring both of them into the field while shooting the film and they delighted in watching the sparrows, especially as the females entered the nest. While they have yet to find nests themselves, I have hope that they can join Deirdre in her search for nests in a couple of years.I also see the desire to take action in interns like Cooper and in the students I teach as a professor of journalism at the University of Rhode Island. Young people really do seem to grasp the challenges we face and I’m hopeful that they feel inspired by the film to find ways to act in their own back yards.Read more:In the most untouched, pristine parts of the Amazon, birds are dying.

Police say they believe one suspect had a shaved head and wore gloves.West Midlands police launched a major investigation and manhunt after the incident in Oldbury was reported on Tuesday morning.The woman who was attacked is in her 20s. Police and Sikh community groups said they were supporting her and her family.There has been a rise in racial tension across the UK and heated debate over immigration and asylum.Police said the incident took place just before 8.30am on Tuesday around Tame Road in Oldbury, close to Birmingham.The attack has caused fear and anger among local Sikhs. One Sikh group criticised national politicians who have been vocal recently about asylum issues for their lack of “public condemnation” of the Oldbury attack.A Sikh community group said it had spoken to the woman and her family and that the words the attackers said were: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”Sources with knowledge of the police investigation confirmed to the Guardian the attack was being treated as a hate crime. One confirmed it was because of words said during the attack.West Midlands police said: “We’re investigating after a woman reported to us that she had been raped in Oldbury in what we are treating as a racially aggravated attack.“We were called just before 8.30am on Tuesday after the woman, in her 20s, reported being attacked in the area around Tame Road, Oldbury.“We are keen to speak with anyone in the area who may have seen two men. The two men are described as being white. One had a shaved head, heavy build, and was reported to be wearing a dark-coloured sweatshirt and had gloves on.“The second man was reportedly wearing a grey top with a silver zip. The woman has told us that a racist remark was made to her during the attack.“We are currently treating it as an isolated incident.”Ch Supt Kim Madill, who leads local policing in the Sandwell area, said: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other inquiries well under way.“We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused, and I am speaking to people in the community today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to identify and arrest those responsible.“Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols in the area.”Dabinderjit Singh, of the Sikh Federation UK, said: “The attack took place in broad daylight on a busy road.“Politicians from all political parties should have zero tolerance for all violent racist attacks.“The current racist political environment is driven by populism and created by politicians playing the ‘anti-immigration card’ who are unashamedly exploiting those with rightwing and racist views.“We await the public condemnation by politicians on all sides of this brutal racist and sexual attack where a young Sikh woman has been viciously beaten and raped.”Another Sikh group, Sikh Youth UK, said it had alerted the wider community “to remain vigilant, ensure family members are safe and strengthen safeguarding measures in daily routines”.Police said anyone with information could contact them via 101 quoting log 798 of 9 September.Explore more on these topicsRaceWest MidlandsRape and sexual assaultBirminghamEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsRead moreDan Hurley, Universities UK’s deputy director of policy, said: “There is a real need for us to work with funders and government to address some of the risks here and get under the skin of what this might look like.“What we do know is that most charity funding is in the medical and health space, so it is definitely having an impact in that area.“We can’t pinpoint the degree to which this is impacting specific disciplines but the findings in this report are a warning that really difficult decisions are being taken on the ground and if we want to maintain the UK’s international competitiveness when it comes to research then we need to go further to support it.“While these headline findings are a strong warning in themselves, this is going to require ongoing monitoring.”The report, done in collaboration with the Campaign for Science and Engineering and the Association ofResearchManagers and Administrators using surveys of academic researchers, found that “sustained financial constraints” were likely to diminish the estimated £54bn annual contribution made by university research to the UK economy.The study found there had been a 4% decrease in research staff in the biological, mathematical and physical sciences in the last three years, while staff in medicine, dentistry and health have dropped by 2%, mainly in highly expensive clinical medicine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But what’s clear is that further efficiencies are not going to be enough on their own to address these broader risks to areas of research, with implications for our research system’s international competitiveness.“So we also need action from the government on the future of quality-related funding, which hasn’t kept pace with inflation for a decade. That’s going to be critical to restoring stability to areas of research,” Hurley said.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has been contacted for a response.Explore more on these topicsResearch fundingUniversity fundingHigher educationUniversitiesResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

Matt Taylor, a BBC broadcast meteorologist,posted a picture of him and Wynne together. He wrote: “This has hit us all hard. Jay was a great broadcaster, talented musician, enthusiastic golfer, and a good friend. Rest in peace mate.”Simon King, who is also a BBC weather presenter and meteorologist, said: “Really sad news about former colleague Jay Wynne. Such a lovely bloke and brilliant broadcaster. Always a joy to be on shift with him and his wicked sense of humour. Good memories. RIP Jay.”Thepresenter Jen Bartram posted: “Jay was such a lovely colleague and friend – we had such laughs at the weather centre in the good old days; and I’m shocked to hear of his death today.”Wynne’s brother Matthew said: “Jay had a gift for gentle clarity, making his forecasts for sometimes complex weather systems feel accessible and engaging.“A keen skier, golfer and musician, Jay enjoyed travelling to pursue his sporting interests. We will miss his wisdom, generosity and dry sense of humour.”Wynne studied environmental geography at the University of Aberdeen and went on to complete a master’s in applied meteorology at the University of Reading.When he joined the Met Office his training involved a 14-month secondment to RAF Northolt. Before forecasting he spent time as a technician on North Sea oil rigs and a stint teaching English in Fukuoka, Japan.In an interview with the Radio Times in 2011, he said: “I have been known to drive around after night shifts, waiting for the sun to come up.“At night, it’s difficult to tell what kind of cloud there is on satellite pictures, so I like to see if I was right.

Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.Christopher Atkinson, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has decided to prosecute Joshua Oliver with arson following a police investigation into a fire at the offices of Sharon Hodgson MP.“Our prosecutors have worked to establish that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings. We have worked closely with Northumbria police as they carried out their investigation.”Oliver, of no fixed address, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Saturday. The CPS urged people not to share information online that could prejudice the legal proceedings.A No 10 spokesperson condemned the attack: “There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our society. All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”Hodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. After the fire, a spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty-one civilians taking part in the demonstrations were killed on what became the bloodiest day of protest in Nepal’s history.By Tuesday, rage at the government had reached a fever pitch and the country’s parliament buildings, as well as the homes of the prime minister – KP Sharma Oli – president and other ministers were all set on fire and the capital, Kathmandu, resembled a burned out war zone. Oli, who had been airlifted out by the military, announced his resignation by Tuesday afternoon.The resignation of the 73-year-old – who was serving his fourth term as prime minister and was seen by many as authoritarian, corrupt and out of touch – was widely celebrated by the gen Z protesters out on the streets. However, the speed at which the protests had led to the toppling of the government also presented issues. They had not been part of a coherent, organised group and did not have a leader or group of representatives.After the president and the army chief invited the gen Z protesters to be part of the discussions on who should form the next government, a team of representatives were chosen. By Wednesday, they had put forward Karki as their choice to lead an interim government, and insisted that the current parliament should be dissolved.View image in fullscreenNepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed interim prime minister after KP Sharma Oli was forced to resign.Photograph: ReutersKarki had been appointed Nepal’s first female chief justice in 2016 and became known for delivering several high-profile judgments against ministers and senior police in corruption cases, coming into the crosshairs of the major political parties as a result. After retiring, she had established herself as a prominent figure in civil society, speaking out on issues of corruption and political malpractices in Nepal.Despite some divisions, by Wednesday the gen Z protesters rallied around Karki, who had been outspoken against the lethal force used against protesters, describing it as a “massacre”. She was also given the backing of the popular young mayor of Kathamandu, rapper-turned-politician Balendra Shah, who is widely revered among the younger generation.However, the country appeared to be heading towards deadlock after leaders of some of Nepal’s most established political parties initially refused to agree for parliament to be dissolved. But on Friday night, after the army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel warned that the military would be forced to declare a state of emergency if no political solution would be found, it was agreed by party leaders to dissolve the parliament, and for Karki to be appointed prime minister until fresh elections are called.The exact nature of the interim government that will govern Nepal under Karki has still yet to be made clear, though it was announced she would be leading a “council of ministers”.Many in the gen Z movement are pushing for her to immediately open corruption allegations into former prime minister Oli and his ministers and hold an inquiry into the protest deaths that took place.Dheeraj Joshi, 25, a gen-Z leader participating in discussions with the army and the president, said that he believed that Karki’s appointment would see the country “moving from a phase of destruction to a phase of construction”.“That doesn’t mean everything will immediately be fine once she takes office,” he said. “Initially, there will be a process to identify who weakened the country the most, and then set priorities accordingly. Over time, the deeply rooted corruption will be uprooted. Once that process begins, the ground will open up for better future.”Explore more on these topicsNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He has pleaded not guilty.In an unusual and awkward start to the trial, Routh spoke for less than five minutes before Aileen Cannon, the US district judge, ended his opening statement. She interrupted him three times to remind him of proper procedure and reprimand him to not make a “mockery of the court” as he mused about unexpected topics including human evolution, global conflicts and Adolf Hitler, rather than mount a meaningful defense.At one point, Cannon – a Trump appointee – excused the jury while she chastised him, before finally suspending his remarks entirely.Prosecutors urged jurors to focus on the evidence that they said they would present rather than on their political feelings.“This case is not about if you likeDonald Trumpor not,” John Charlton Shipley Jr, one of the prosecutors, told jurors on Thursday morning. Instead, it was about whether Routh plotted to kill Trump, then a presidential candidate. It was the second attempt on Trump’s life in under three months.Prosecutors told jurors that Routh, a building contractor from North Carolina, “carefully crafted” his attack for weeks before aiming a rifle from just outside the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on 15 September 2024.They allege that Routh put together a methodical plan which included purchasing a military-grade weapon, “obsessively” researching Trump’s movements, and utilizing a dozen burner phones, to kill Trump based on political grievances. Cellphone data, security footage, a handwritten note by Routh stating an intention to kill Trump, as well as eyewitness testimony would prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, Shipley said.Robert Fercano, a US Secret Service agent, testified that he was on a golf cart screening the course a hole or two ahead of Trump, who was playing on the 5th hole, when from about five feet away, he saw one or two inches of a rifle peeking through the brush near the sixth hole.Fearing for Trump’s life, the agent said he called out to the person holding the rifle, saw the person take aim at him and fired his pistol. Jurors in the courtroom then heard a recording of the frantic radio traffic after Fercano fired.“Mogul on five green,” Fercano said, referencing Trump’s call sign. “Shots fired, shots fired, shots fired. Individual … with a … AK-style weapon.”Prosecutors said the shots caused Routh to drop his semi-automatic rifle and flee. Fercano held up the SKS semi-automatic rifle in court for jurors to see.During his cross-examination, Routh asked the agent if it was “good to be alive” and appeared to acknowledge that he was the person Fercano had spotted on the course. After Routh attempted to suggest that the rifle Fercano spotted was not held in a threatening manner, or that he lacked the mindset to actually fire the weapon, the agent replied: “I don’t know your mindset that day, but I know you pointed [your rifle] at my face.”Another witness, Tommy McGee, testified that he was out furniture shopping when he heard gunshots, saw a “disheveled, unkempt and frantic man” flee, and chased his car. He wrote down the license plate number and later identified Routh to the police. During cross-examination, Routh praised McGee as “an American hero”.Prosecutors called another three witnesses: another US Secret Service agent who responded to the assassination attempt, and two FBI agents involved with holding and processing Routh. Routh’s cross-examinations were so brief that the court adjourned early on Thursday.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFloridaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

They were using water from standpipes in a part of Hampshire where a hosepipe ban is in place, and doing so was not in breach of any local water regulations. However, residents complained that he was doing so during such a ban, and the water company said it was “appalled” by this behaviour.Schwarzman, the founder of the investment fund Blackstone, is one of the world’s richest men with an estimated net worth of over £30bn. Hebacked Trumpin the 2024 election and hasspoken in approvalof the president’s controversial tariff policy.The water company has recently applied for a drought order to ban businesses from filling lakes and swimming pools, and to ban the cleaning of business buildings and vehicles with a hosepipe. It has alsoapplied to the governmentto be allowed to take water from a rare chalk stream, the River Test, even if that takes it past its ecologically safe flow rate.While households have been banned from filling paddling pools with a hosepipe during the drought this summer, these tankers had been allowed to take the water from the standpipes because construction work is not, under the law, counted as “domestic use”. A spokesperson for Schwarzman said the water was being used to fill in a new lake as part of renovation of the grounds of his estate.They added that the billionaire was committed to restoring the estate “with the highest regard to local laws and planning regulations”. They said: “For the majority of the construction period, until approximately the last three weeks, water purchased and transported to the site by tankers was used principally to support the building works and associated personnel” and that a “proportion of transported water has been used in connection with irrigation and the lake”.The spokesperson concluded: “Following yesterday’s request from Southern Water that water is not directed to the lake, the estate has readjusted the supply of water accordingly.”Tim Mcmahon, Southern Water’s managing director, said he was “appalled by this use of water” and said the tankers had been banned from taking water from the standpipes.Mcmahon added: “While this disappointing occurrence is highly unusual and rare, I would like to reassure customers that I am leading a thorough review into how this happened, and how we can tighten up both our internal monitoring processes and any legal loopholes so that this cannot happen again.”Southern Water told the BBC that it was first alerted by residents in Andover, who had spotted the tankers coming and going from the standpipes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study covered developments since 2014.North Korea’s Geneva diplomatic mission and its London embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said in response to UN rights investigators that it rejected a UN human rights council resolution authorising the latest report.Sometimes children are made to work in forced labour, including “shock brigades” for tough sectors such as coal mining and construction, Heenan said from Seoul.“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t bribe their way out of it, and these shock brigades are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.The report also found some limited improvements, such as reduced use of violence by guards in detention facilities, and new laws that appear to strengthen fair trial guarantees.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Such was to be the fate of the Pretty Things in the mid-60s: to be a band who embodied all that was a threat to bourgeois values, to an extent that rather overshadowed the music they were making. The biggest threat of all was Viv Prince, the band’s drummer, whose death at 84 was announced on Instagram on Friday by, fittingly, Jack White.After his sacking he joined the Hells Angels, and was duly thrown out for bad behaviour“Viv was an incredible drummer, wild and full of abandon,”White wrote. “He played for the band the Pretty Things, and he influenced many other musicians like Keith Moon. I was lucky enough to meet Viv some years ago who was working on his farm in Portugal at the time. He was an inspired and eccentric rock and roller and maybe I’ll have to put together a team to work on a documentary about this man one day.”Indeed, so wild was Prince that he lasted barely 18 months before the wildest band in Britain could no longer cope with him. You get a taste from his response to reports in the New Zealand press about the group’s appalling behaviour touring the country in 1965. Returning to the UK, he went through the allegations one by one with Record Mirror’s Norman Jopling.Did they break chairs? “One chair.” Light fires. “Complete lie.” Abuse officials? “We had a go at them because they didn’t make any attempt whatsoever to stop the kids coming through the stage door and into our dressing room.” Ruin heartthrob Eden Kane’s act by laying carpet onstage while he performed? “Everyone was digging it.” Do the same to Sandie Shaw’s act? “I was cleaning up from our act when she came on early.” Drink meths? “We’ve got a great big bottle of water we carry around labelled ‘meths’. It’s a private joke.”The list continued until Jopling reached “the incident at the airport”, about which he offered no detail. “Those bits about the crayfish running around the airport lounge that were printed. The fish were dead when we bought them. They always are. How on EARTH can dead fish run around? And when I was turned off the plane … The captain said straight away, ‘There’ll be no liquor on my plane. You pop groups have been on my plane before.’ As I sat down, a bottle of bourbon I was carrying dropped out. Instantly everyone appeared from nowhere and were upon me, and threw me out of the plane.”Eat your heart out, Spinal Tap.View image in fullscreenThe Pretty Things in 1964 … from left: John Stax, Dick Taylor, Brian Pendelton, Phil May and Viv Prince.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBefore the Pretty Things, Prince’s career reads like an exemplar of the British musician as rock’n’roll established its own commercial and artistic identity, and the young musicians who had picked up instruments in the 1950s tried to work out their place in it. Just look at the names of Prince’s groups – one can almost see the faded photos in one’s mind from reading them: the Viv Prince Skiffle Group, Brian Woolley’s Jazzmen, Lennie Baldwin’s Dauphin Street Six, the Trevor Jones Jazzmen, Carter-Lewis and the Southerners, the Jazz Cardinals.He had joined the last of those in Copenhagen, but then “had to leave Denmark in a hurry”. Back in London he played sessions, and songwriter Jimmy Duncan recommended him to the Pretty Things, who were looking for a new drummer.Prince played only on the first two Pretty Things albums – The Pretty Things and Get the Picture? – but those were the records that established the group as the hardest of the British R&B bands: their debut single, Rosalyn, was wilder than anything the Stones or the Yardbirds were doing at the same time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The full craziness of the Pretty Things was only revealed live. Often, there is no way to verify those claims, but with the Pretty Things there is. There’sa 15-minute clip of the band performing in 1965, and they are unhinged. Viv Prince is the most unhinged of all.The second song is You Don’t Love Me, You Don’t Care, and with the crowd in front of them a seething mass, having to be restrained by men in suits who try to put barriers in place, the band bring the song down to a break of just guitar and harmonica. Which should calm things down, except Prince has come out from behind his kit and is crawling around the stage, drumming on his bandmates, on the ground, turning everything into a circus. It’s wild and thrilling and violent.Prince’s musical career after the Pretty Things didn’t amount to a great deal, but his life took a while to calm down: after his sacking he apparently joined the Hells Angels, and was duly thrown out for bad behaviour. For 18 or months or so, though, the drummer of a moderately successful R&B band from the home counties was the greatest rock star in the world.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

The genius screenwriter behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind andSynecdoche, New York, the devastating Buñuelian comedy of mortality that he also directed, can’t get a movie off the ground. “I’m having great difficulty,” he sighs. “I’m not a person that people want to trust with their money. It’s very frustrating.”Earlier this year, production of a film he was preparing to make – Later the War, starring Eddie Redmayne as a manufacturer of dreams who diversifies into nightmares – was shut down in Belgrade; he hopes it will resume. To make matters worse, he sorely needs some shut-eye. “Not to get into it, but I’m not a great sleeper,” he says, reaching out of frame for his coffee. The webcam is angled in such a way that his bearded, bespectacled face is shunted into the bottom half of the screen, leaving ample space above him where a big, fluffy thought-bubble might go.View image in fullscreenKaufman, right, with Michel Gondry and Kate Winslet at the Academy Awards in 2005.Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/ReutersHe has just arrived back home in New York from the Venice film festival, where he was presenting How to Shoot a Ghost, the second of two lyrical shorts he has directed, both written by the poetEva H.D. This one features Jessie Buckley, star of Kaufman’s 2020 filmI’m Thinking of Ending Things, in which she shuffled through an entire Rolodex of different identities as she was driven through a blizzard to meet her new boyfriend’s parents. Now she plays a recently deceased photographer wandering around Athens in a blue wig, armed with a Polaroid camera and accompanied by a queer translator (Josef Akiki) who is also newly dead. Together, they savour life from the afterlife. ThinkWings of DesireGoes to Greece.View image in fullscreenJosef Akiki, Eva H.D. and Charlie Kaufman at the Venice film festival this month.Photograph: Doreen Kennedy/AlamyThe short is poignant and oddly consoling. “I like what the ghosts come to feel and see about their lives and their deaths,” says 66-year-old Kaufman. “I think it’s a hopeful film. Maybe that has more to do with Eva, since she wrote it. I think she sees beauty as well as pain, and sees that they are not mutually exclusive.” I ask whether he can see beauty, too. “Ican,” he says after a long pause. “I have a lot of anxiety. And I think that gets in the way of the experience of being alive.”View image in fullscreenJosef Akiki and Jessie Buckley in How to Shoot a Ghost.Later this month, Kaufman will bring How to Shoot a Ghost to Bristol’sEncountersfilm festival, where he will also appear on stage with Michel Gondry before a screening of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which Gondry directed. That 2004 gut-punch of a love story, which won Kaufman an Oscar for best original screenplay, stars Jim Carrey as a woebegone soul undergoing a cerebral deepclean to erase all memory of his ex-girlfriend (played by Kate Winslet, beating Buckley to the blue hair by two decades).Kaufman and Gondry spent several days in 1998 driving around Hollywood, pitching the idea for Eternal Sunshine to studio executives. “I had an infected tooth,” Kaufman grimaces. “I’d never been in such pain. But I didn’t have time to go the dentist because we were doing this.” Positive responses offset his agony. “Everybody was, like, ‘It’s a new way to tell a love story’. They knew how to sell it and that was exciting to them.”Once the idea for Eternal Sunshine was sold, Kaufman had to set about writing it, which took time (“It always does”). Gondry wanted to get cracking on a film, so Kaufman pulled an earlier unproduced script from the drawer for him to make in the meantime. The result,Human Nature, starred Patricia Arquette as a hirsute writer, Tim Robbins as a repressed scientist with a “minuscule penis” and Rhys Ifans as his laboratory subject, who was raised as an ape. Full of unruly charm, it flopped and is hard to find these days. “Is it?” asks Kaufman. “I haven’t looked for it.”View image in fullscreenTim Robbins, Rhys Ifans and Patricia Arquette in Human Nature.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyEternal Sunshine, though, was a breakthrough: the most sincere and effective marriage of mainstream and avant-garde ingredients sinceGroundhog Day, and a hit to boot. “Though the people who own the rights report back to me regularly that it’s still in the red,” he says dubiously. “‘Hollywood accounting’ is what it’s called.”Wobbles along the way were mostly to do with the coincidental resemblance of other movies to Eternal Sunshine. Kaufman has said previously that the release in 2000 ofChristopher Nolan’s memory-loss thriller Mementogave him pause during the writing process. Perhaps that’s why the bloviating fictional film critic B Rosenberger Rosenberg, who narratesKaufman’s 2020 novel Antkind, has several digs at Nolan, referring to Starbucks at one point as “the smart coffee for dumb people. It’s the Christopher Nolan of coffee.”John Woo’s 2003 science-fiction thriller Paycheck, released before Eternal Sunshine but now fittingly forgotten, also gave Kaufman a fright. “The trailer showed Ben Affleck with this memory-erasing machine on his head,” Kaufman recalls. “Michel and I were, like, ‘Holy shit!’ We called one of our producers and said, ‘We can’t put the movie out now.’”View image in fullscreenJim Carrey and Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyPerhaps the success of Eternal Sunshine was a mixed blessing for both men. WhenGondry was asked in 2023why he hadn’t made more films in Hollywood, he said: “It’s very hard to work after having worked with Charlie Kaufman.” Other writers’ scripts, he reflected, “all seem very dull”. Maybe those first five spectacular years of being a screenwriter also skewed Kaufman’s expectations of how the rest of his career would pan out. “Well, I’d spent much of my adult life not being successful,” he says. “But, yes, there was this brief moment – beginning when Malkovich opened and ending with Synecdoche – where I was, you know …” He pauses, and I wonder if he is going to say “hot”, a word I can’t imagine ever crossing his lips. “In demand,” he says finally. “Or something.”In 2008 came the global financial crisis – “From which I still don’t think the film business has recovered,” he says – and the release of Synecdoche, New York. The movie, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as an anxiety-riddled and insanely ambitious theatre director mounting a replica of his own life inside a vast warehouse, made no money. “I don’t care,” says Kaufman defiantly. “I’m very happy with it.” Yet, its box-office failure had clear consequences. “My films are well regarded and yet I’m constantly up against this wall of not being able to get financing. And I’m not asking for a lot.” How will the situation ever change? “I guess if I directed something that made a fortune,” he suggests.Would it be intolerable for him to take on a movie he didn’t believe in just to get the clout for his own projects? “I think the world is in a terrible, terrible situation right now,” he says, his tone suddenly grave. “I don’t think that Hollywood has nothing to do with it. I could argue that Hollywood haseverythingto do with it. And I have a responsibility, as I see it, not to put garbage in the world. I’m not going to do that. If you start trying to figure out what it is that people want, you are doing whatAIdoes. The idea of AI precedes AI itself because that’s the Hollywood machine. It’s why they remake the same five movies every 10 years. It’s why they have a formula for what a movie is.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyThe looming horror of AI is much on his mind today. “The most valuable thing to me in terms of my mental health is to read a poem or see a painting or listen to music which speaks to me, which breaks me open for a moment, and where I feel an experience honestly and delicately portrayed. That’s another reason AI can never create anything artistically. It can trick us into thinking it has, but it doesn’t have the experience of being alive. It doesn’t know loss and joy and love and what it feels like to face mortality.I’m very worried about the future in so many ways, and if we don’t allow ourselves to connect with other humans who have the experiences that we have, then I think we’re lost.”The evidence is already around us, he argues. “That’s where the greed and acquisitiveness and all of this garbage comes from. It’s people who are really lost and don’t have anything, so they’re desperately trying to make themselves feel better by acquiring, by lording it over people, by being powerful and wealthy. They’re damaged people doing so much damage.”He throws up his hands. “I’m a damaged person too!” he says. “But I’m trying, you know? I’m trying to be truthful about it.”Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and How to Shoot a Ghost will screen at the Encounters film festival, Bristol on 24 and 25 September respectively.Explore more on these topicsCharlie KaufmanAIArtificial intelligence (AI)interviewsShareReuse this content"

Petty gangsters do the work of the authorities amid a violent debate about anational security law. Supporters of Hong Kong independence are jailed.In 2015, a scrappy group ofHong Kongfilm-makers imagined what their semi-autonomous city could look like under the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist party (CCP).“Any resemblance to actual events or persons is entirely coincidental,” reads the first scene in the opening credits. But decade on, many of the predictions made inTen Yearshave, in some form, come to pass.The directors “saw the social environment of Hong Kong, especially after the Occupy movement in 2014”, says Ching Wong, the director of the Hong Kong film festival UK (HKFFUK), which isshowing the film in London on Sunday, co-hosted by Amnesty International.Wong, who wrote and stars in one of the film’s five short vignettes, says that the film-makers “wanted to reflect the zeitgeist of Hong Kong at that time”.The Occupy protests in 2014 saw tens of thousands of protesters, many of them students, occupy the streets of central Hong Kong for weeks to demand fully democratic elections. Although the protests failed, they awakened a political consciousness in a generation of Hongkongers who would take to the streets again five years later, in even greater numbers, prompting an even bigger crackdown.Made on a shoestring budget of HK$500,000 (£47,400), Ten Years was an instant hit when it was released in late 2015, packing out independent cinemas and community screenings, even after commercial theatres pulled the film, most likely because of its sensitivity. Despite being slammed by Chinese state media, it won the best film prize at the Hong Kong film awards. The film tapped into “the anxiety of what the city would become”, says Wong, now based in London.This year is the third edition of HKFFUK, an annual arts and culture event showing 52 titles at venues across the country. It is part of the wave of people and culture that have arrived in the UK from Hong Kong in the past five years, driven largely by the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong. In particular, the years since the2019-2020 pro-democracy protests, in which around two million people took to the streets in the biggest challenge to CCP rule in modern history, have seena harsh response from Beijing, which has fuelled a wave of emigration of hundreds of thousands of people.The aim of the festival is to help Hongkongers and other migrant communities communicate with each other, a dialogue that has “formed the fabric of UK society”, says Wong. The festival’s organisers are keen to stress the event’s celebration of Asian diasporas in the UK, as well as its showcase of east and south-east Asian culture.But with Hong Kong, it is hard to escape the politics. The screening of Ten Years in London, as well as being a celebration of the energetic new diaspora that has arrived in the UK, reflects the fact that the film could not be shown in the city that birthed it.View image in fullscreenProtesters flood the streets of Hong Kong in 2019.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APIn the decade since the film was first released, Hong Kong has been remoulded by the CCP, which crushedthe 2019-20 pro-democracy protestswith a force that shocked the world. In 2020, Beijing imposed a national security law on the territory, an event that is imagined in Extras, the opening short film in Ten Years. Last year, Hong Kong’s own legislature – now devoid of any meaningful opposition since pro-democracy legislators have been jailed, dismissed or have resigned – passed another national security law, known as Article 23, bolstering the authorities’ ability to quash dissent.The criminalisation of anything that could be interpreted as being seditious, subversive or otherwise falling under the vaguely worded provisions of the national security laws has chilled Hong Kong’s once vibrant arts sector. Independent bookshops haveclosedor been hit withburdensome tax investigations. Cultural events have beencancelled. The government has specifically taken aim at “soft resistance”, a seeming reference to arts and educational activities that are critical of the authorities.At least one of the directors of Ten Years has left Hong Kong for the UK, while several others prefer not to disclose their locations because of security concerns.Ten Years review – a smoke grenade lobbed down Hong Kong’s corridors of powerRead moreBut even in the UK, challenges remain. Wong says that, from today’s vantage point, one of the most relevant themes from Ten Years is the loss of language. As Beijing seeks to increase its footprint in Hong Kong, the authorities havepromoted the use of Mandarin, the dialect spoken in the mainland, over Cantonese, which is spoken by most local Hongkongers. That is a future explored in a section called Dialect, which follows the life of a Cantonese-speaking taxi driver who feels increasingly lost in a world that demands him to speak and understand Mandarin.Although many Hongkongers have found greater freedom in the UK, the struggle to preserve their mother tongue continues. “Either staying in Hong Kong or staying in the UK, they face the marginalisation of their culture,” Wong says. “That really hits me personally”.TheHong Kong film festival UKopens on 12 September. Ten Years will be shown atPicturehouse Central, London, on 14 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsHong KongChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Vince has a target on his back: he owes money to bad people and Jake is his last resort.

The calibre of these contenders is beyond dispute – one has already worked in 11 Michelin-starred restaurants, for example – and the prize ($500k) is hefty. Accordingly, its tone is a lot less collegial and its vibe a lot more cut-throat than any equivalent UK contest. Still, at least there’s no Gregg Wallace.Netflix, from Wednesday 17 SeptemberGen VView image in fullscreen‘Make America Super Again’ … Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau in Gen V.Photograph: Jasper Savage/PrimeThisentertaining series– both a backstory toThe Boysand an oddball teen drama in its own right – returns for a second season. Marie (Jaz Sinclair) has talked her way back into Godolkin University of Crimefighting, where the next generation of superheroes are learning the ropes. But, as per the polemical undercurrent always evident in The Boys, the atmosphere has changed: the place is festooned with banners proclaiming “Make America Super Again”. As the university’s dark secrets bubble to the surface, our gifted teens face stark moral choices.Prime Video, from Wednesday 17 SeptemberThe Reluctant Traveler With Eugene LevyView image in fullscreenImpressive … The Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy.Photograph: AppleGiven that he nominally hates travelling, it’s impressive that actorEugene Levyhas managed to tolerate prolonging this gently enjoyable series into a third season. Still, he soldiers bravely on. This time his bucket list sees him attempt to play cricket in India, take an open-top bus tour around London (more tourist than traveller really), get stuck into some St Patrick’s Day action in rural Ireland, and celebrate the Day of the Dead in Oaxaca, Mexico. He’s avuncular, curious, patient and open-minded, in fact showing every sign of being anything but reluctant.Apple TV+, from Friday 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingJude LawfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The connections can be genuine, and the feelings often real, but the situations are contrived and manipulated, a pioneering brand of deliberately saccharine, hokey and ridiculous in the name of love and for the sake of entertainment. Watching The Bachelor and its spinoffs, as I occasionally have over its two-plus-decade run, is to be baffled, frustrated, annoyed and ultimately hooked. The show, with its in-group rituals and shocking sincerity, casts a strange spell over its contestants and its viewers; if you stick through one episode, you’re liable to start caring about what happens.The Man in My Basement review – Willem Dafoe is an unsettling guest in eerie psychodramaRead moreNo such spell exists for The Wrong Paris, Netflix’s latest attempt to build an in-house Hallmark Channel, in which Miranda Cosgrove plays a single woman who goes on a reality dating show for what Bachelor Nation would call “the wrong reasons”. No offense to the Hallmark Channel, which at its best can be laughably unserious fun. But The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor, nor the drop of derangement – like, say, ahot snowman brought to life– required to beat the Netflix allegations of low-quality, lowest-common-denominator stuff.The setup, at least, is promising, like a fluffier and sillier UnReal. In an almost daringly utilitarian first scene, the stakes are set: Cosgrove’s Dawn, a Girl With Tools in a Small Town With Dead Parents, achieves her dream of getting into art school in Paris. But her “Paris fund” cash jar cannot cover the $30,000 tuition, especially after she personally paid the healthcare costs for her grandmother/guardian (Frances Fisher). Her sister Emily (Emilija Baranac), an avid fan of a show called the Honeypot – The Bachelor, if at the very end the lucky lady has the option to choose money instead of engagement – has an alternative plan: go on the show, conveniently set in Paris, for the $20,000 appearance fee and plane ticket, then get herself eliminated ASAP.A ludicrous invisible hand of plot should be part of the enjoyment, so I’ll keep it brief: Dawn, a master of all non-city skills – welding, farming, kicking the ass of creepy, sniveling out-of-towners – gets on the show. But thanks to a plucky producer (Insecure’s Yvonne Orji, too good for this), the competition is set in Paris, Texas. Specifically, at the Yellowstone-aspiring ranch of one Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fodé, doing a budget impression of Matthew McConaughey), with whom Dawn had a brief meet-cute at a local bar before filming. (True to the spirit of the movie, British Columbia stands in for Texas ranch country.) The fact that the preposterously ripped Trey is frequently shirtless and good with horses, and that Dawn also low-key really loves horses, complicates her secret plan to take the money and run. Not even the drives-a-truck and makes-her-own-spurs Dawn is immune to the power of a six-pack, especially if it’s wearing tight jeans.Which is all well and smooth-brained good, with a couple of satirical shots at The Bachelor via archetypes of its contestants: the princess (Madeleine Arthur), the muscly badass (Veronica Long), the awkward nerd (Christin Park), the baby-fevered Christian girl (Hannah Stocking), the influencer (Madison Pettis, rounding out a cast that is almost entirely alums of Disney or theNetflixromcom To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before). Unfortunately, the film’s basic construction fails to clear the requisite low bar – shoddy editing that nearly cuts off lines, camera work so front-focused that it looks filmed in iPhone Portrait Mode, framing that warps inexplicably into near-fisheye.Hot Frosty review – Netflix’s sexy snowman romance is as silly as expectedRead moreEven worse, there is barely a spark between the two fated lovers. Despite some limp sparring, the only friction between Dawn and Trey is the quality of their hair – she has the perfect curl waves natural only to television, and he has the crispiest ends I’ve ever seen on a man. Cosgrove, a former child actor and veteran of Nickelodeon’s millennial YA staple iCarly (and its far less successful adult reboot), is much better suited to handle the overdrawn slapstick comedy of this genre – pigging out on wings, tripping and falling into a pool – than the attempts at genuine romantic beats.Neither Cosgrove nor the mechanical script sells Dawn’s pivot from betting it all on art school to love, which is irksome, if expected. Maybe I’m being overly sensitive – this is, after all, not meant to be taken too seriously. But it’s hard not to detect a whiff of regression in, to borrow a term beloved by reality television, Dawn’s journey from fiercely independent student to willing to sacrifice her big dream for a guy (who has money and will pay for things). That that’s the fantasy – in a movie aiming broadly for middle America, amid a great rightward lurch in culture – feels less like a happy ending than a bummer sign of the times. Those seeking a feelgood romcom should keep looking.The Wrong Paris is now out on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the risk paid off. Eggers has captured both the pervading sense of dread and stylish production design of the original, while deepening the mythology to make it more palatable for modern viewers. It’s a true horror, with every frame filled with foreboding. And now, after playing both Pennywise in It and Count Orlock, surely Bill Skarsgård qualifies as the world’s scariest actor. But it is Lily-Rose Depp’s tortured, possessed performance as Orlock’s victim Ellen that really impresses.Stuart HeritageThe Wrong Paris (Janeen Damian, 2025), NetflixA romcom with a premise that, depending how you view these things, is either the most genius or stupid ever put to film: Miranda Cosgrove plays a woman who enters a dating show in the belief that it will be filmed in Paris. It is but, get this, it’s the one in Texas not the one in France. Can she learn to fall in love with a tanned rural beefcake rather than the existential Frenchman of her dreams?

Though the Amsterdam-based group have only released two EPs and maintain an elusive online presence, they have developed a steady cult following in guitar and dance music circles alike.Formed around 2022 by Nushin Naini and Nic Mauskovic (who also releases music under the alias Nicolini), the mutating band draw on a range of influences dating from the 70s: the percussion, sax and funky bass recall New York no wave and post-punk, and the skulking tempo and echo have their roots in dub. These elements combine with punk’s DIY approach. Much of the instrumentation on their debut EP Tambal comes from undisclosed “miscellaneous objects” and their short, scrappy tracks have the production quality of some hazy late-night jam between friends: vocalist and bassist Naini likens their bedroom recording set-up to a “fun playground to experiment with sounds”.They add exciting surprise elements into the mix: the spliced samples and turntablism add a chaotic edge to the otherwise groove-heavy tracks, and Naini’s self-described “fried Farsi” – a semi-improvised version of the language – is delivered through pitch-shifted yips and nursery-rhyme chants. It suits the wackiness of the Devon Rexi lore: these self-appointed “diasporic human snacks are vibrating their sonic manipulations in tribute to the lonely and oblivious Mr Naster” – which might give an insight to their headspace, if not their approach.Safi BugelThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenDebit.Photograph: Monse GuajardoDebit – La Ronda y el SonideroMexican producer Delia Beatriz stretches and smears 90s selector Gabriel Dueñez’s slackenedcumbia rebajada(slowed cumbia) sound so the beat becomes a twitch, the horns and yells lurching like TV static in search of a signal.Jessy Lanza – Slapped by My LifeWritten to make her husband smile when he was undergoing chemotherapy, this Lanza loosie is characteristically bright, bubbling club pointillism that flickers like a hummingbird wing – then shifts surprisingly bassy.Kali Malone and Drew McDowall – The Sound in My MindIntricate yet fathoms deep, the drone doyen and former Coil member McDowall’s monophonic modular synth experiment evokes observing the intricate grain and monumental scale of a Richard Serra sculpture at the same time.George Riley – RainFrom a new mixtape, Riley mixes chattering UK garage with the sweetness of Janet Jackson’s All for You and a real earworm chorus about being deluged by romance.Stella Donnelly – Feel It ChangeWishing on a satellite “that you still love me”, the Australian songwriter reckons with a relationship’s looming demise, her hymnal composure faltering over an appropriately rainy trudge of drums and guitar.Casey Dienel – SeventeenJettisoning the shivery synths of their old moniker White Hinterland after eight years away, Dienel’s comeback bridges the lush 70s studio upholstery and jittery rhythms of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours and Tusk.Tortoise – Layered PresenceTense bass, intricate pulse, a little proggy dissonance: who else could it be?

Chausson’s Poème de l’Amour et de la Mer has more often been recorded with orchestra; with piano it unavoidably loses some of its oceanic glitter and heft, but Middleton plays this sweeping, Wagner-inspired music in full colour, and Connolly is a powerful narrator, her rich tone subtly hollowed out for the fleeting moments of bleakness. In Debussy’s Chansons de Bilitis she’s not the usual ingenue, but she and Middleton make a worldlier-sounding interpretation work, paying attention to every word and every sensual harmonic shift.View image in fullscreenSarah Connolly and Joseph Middleton: The World Feels DustyThe recording’s title comes from one of Copland’s Emily Dickinson settings, put across here with appealing immediacy. Barber’s Op 10 Three Songs bring longer, more expansive lines from Connolly, and a slight American accent – which broadens for the second song of Night Thoughts, a song cycle byErrollyn Walleninspired by the artistHoward Hodgkinand written for Connolly and Middleton in 2023. It’s admittedly hard to imagine this particular song done in cathedral English given that its narrator, singing Wallen’s own words, is Ella Fitzgerald. Connolly, who sang jazz early in her career, is surely one of few singers who could be convincing in both this and the angular settings of Dickinson and Shakespeare with which Wallen frames it.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Judging by their in-house record label’s first signing, this isn’t a model they’re bringing to their music ventures: it’s very hard to imagine the gritty, lugubrious, bathos-steeped tunes of south-east Londoner Mark William Lewis lassoing the zeitgeist, let alone lending themselves to a quirky product tie-in. (A vial of filthy Thames water, perhaps?)View image in fullscreenMark William Lewis: Mark William LewisYet one spin of Tomorrow Is Perfect, the lead single from Lewis’s second album, and it’s instantly obvious why any corporate arbiter of cool would trip over themselves to sign him. An exquisitely beautiful dirge that unites the Durutti Column’s bright, sad slashes of guitar with the plodding, cleanly produced indie of Parachutes-era Coldplay under Lewis’s almost spookily sonorous baritone, it is narcotically familiar and ineffably fresh, a combination of post-ironic simplicity and hyper-sophisticated taste.There is something fashion-adjacent about his ability to make unexpected nostalgic references (see also: Still Above’s muted dinner party funk) feel avant garde. That said, he does sound like a Blur tribute act on Seventeen, a tale of teenage addiction delivered via an uncanny impression of Damon Albarn’s estuary croon and falsetto backing vocals. One thing Lewis doesn’t pilfer is Blur’s sense of humour: occasionally the vibe is a little po-faced. Yet from his guttural sprechgesang to his haunting harmonica and poetic evocations of bleak banality (“another deathly shiver from your restless phone”), this is reliably spine-tingling stuff.Explore more on these topicsIndiePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their village is on the Sussex Downs, overlooked by an ancient face carved into the chalk, reputed to protect inhabitants from a hungry spirit. But since the death of the last member of the family traditionally bound to look after it, the face is fast disappearing beneath the grass, and something frightening is stirring in the land. Atmospheric, psychologically astute and beautifully realised, this is a brilliantly original literary take on folk horror.View image in fullscreenExilesby Mason Coile (Baskerville, £16.99)In 2030, three astronauts arrive on Mars, on a one-way mission to prepare for full-scale colonisation. They find their robot-built base, the Citadel, severely damaged, and one of the robots missing. The remaining two offer different explanations: the missing robot malfunctioned and caused the damage before fleeing, or the Citadel was attacked by an unseen, hostile alien force, and the third robot went in pursuit and has not returned. A taut, terrifying thriller, sadly the last work from Mason Coile, a pseudonym of award-winning author Andrew Pyper, who died in January.View image in fullscreenAlchemisedby SenLinYu (Michael Joseph, £25)This big fantasy debut had its first incarnation as Manacled, an online fan-fiction serial with shades of The Handmaid’s Tale and starring Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy as tormented lovers, a sub-genre of Harry Potter fanfic known as “Dramione”. Now the author has created their own fantastic world, driven by various occult sciences. The story is set around a long brutal war between religious believers who insist god-given gifts should be used for good, and necromancers obsessed with gaining power and immortality at any price. As the book begins, Undying necromancers are in control of the city. Helena, a healer who had helped her friends in the Resistance, wakes from a nightmarish stasis with no memory of the final years of the war. She’s shackled, so cannot use her powers, and is made a prisoner of the High Reeve, one of the most feared of the Undying, set on finding out what secrets are hidden beneath her amnesia. This is a violent tale and the author advises reader discretion. The Undying are fond of ripping out the organs of living victims and there are other horrors, including the love match between a caring healer and a violent mass-murderer. This very readable grim-dark fantasy left me feeling queasy.View image in fullscreenSaltcropby Yume Kitasei (HarperVoyager, £18.99)Set in a near-future world ravaged by climate change, pollution and the effects of mass starvation caused by a crop-destroying blight, the author’s third novel focuses on three sisters. Skipper and Carmen leave their small seaside village to search for their older sister, Nora. She had withdrawn from them after moving to the city to research ways of making crops more resilient, but they hear from her landlord that she hasn’t paid her rent, and learn she has also left her job, and they are concerned. When they get a coded message asking for help, they embark on a long and perilous ocean voyage in the small boat they had built together. An absorbing, compelling tale of love, loyalty and danger, and a frightening look at what we’re doing to our planet.View image in fullscreenBig Timeby Jordan Prosser (Dead Ink, £10.99)The Federal Republic of East Australia is a new authoritarian state determined to impose old-fashioned values by rejecting the rest of the world and keeping its citizens under tight control. It is also the only country where a new drug, F, exists. Dispensed as eye drops, it allows glimpses of the near future. Illegal, of course, but musician Julian and his bandmates can’t resist this new high. In the rest of the world, certain “extreme coincidences” and near-death experiences revealing the afterlife as a giant shopping mall may be connected to the temporal meddling down under. This debut is a wonderfully wild, funny, fast and furious trip.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

As extreme weather events become the new normal, we still hear from “sceptics” who think the energy transition is unnecessary, a massive leftwing plot. Hannah Ritchie, a global development data scientist and the author ofNot the End of the World, has followed that work up with a book that addresses 50 objections to the adoption of greener technology.To start with, we need some tough love. It’s time, Ritchie insists, to abandon the slogan “Keep 1.5 alive”, referring to an aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. “The 1.5C target is dead,” she announces flatly. “The public – who are repeatedly told that 1.5C is still within reach – will start to lose trust when we pass that target.”And then there is the good news. “Since peaking in 2008,” Ritchie reports, “the amount of fossil fuels being burned for electricity in the UK has fallen by almost half.” Battery technology has vastly improved and continues to do so. The solar panels China installed just in May of this year would meet the electricity needs of the whole of Poland.There is similar hope, Ritchie explains, for the prospects of mineral recycling, low-carbon cement, electrified ferries and hydrogen as a fuel for airliners. Meanwhile, most of the objections to increasing our use of solar, wind and nuclear energy are bogus.One route to bogosity is to dazzle the reader with large dollar costs for the rollout of greener technology, but Ritchie recommends always asking: “Is that a big number?” Compared with decades of fossil fuel subsidies and the health costs of pollution from coal plants, probably not. Always ask, too, “How old is the data?”: as Ritchie points out, the cost of solar power has fallen by more than 90% in the last decade. Beware undated graphs on X.This is a refreshingly pragmatic and undoomy book, which dismantles a lot of dubious arguments, including those made by deep-green degrowthers. Yes, electric cars take a little more carbon to build than petrol cars, but they pay off that debt quickly. No, nuclear power is not dangerous. No, carbon capture is not going to work on a planetary scale. Don’t wind turbines “kill all the birds”, as Donald Trump has said? Yes, they do kill some, but buildings kill 500 times as many just by standing there, and no one is proposing we demolish Trump Tower to save the birds.Ritchie is particularly good on air conditioning, which some activists deplore. “If someone living in heat can’t afford air conditioning, they’re living in fuel poverty,” she argues. Plus, if your air conditioning is solar powered, you are using the sun to counteract the sun, which has a pleasing symmetry. Instead of shaming coolness, we could rethink our other priorities. According to a graph Ritchie reproduces, datacentres are forecast to require more global electricity in 2030 than desalination plants – you know, the things that make clean drinking water.

You can go vegan, stop taking aeroplanes and wear a hair shirt for the rest of your life in an ecstasy of virtuous self-denial, but that won’t make the slightest bit of difference to the planet’s climate. What we need is collective action.Collective action is often anathema to conservatives, of course, and near the end the author does leave an opening for those who believe talk of climate action is just a subterfuge for enforcing leftist policies. “This transition is not a sacrifice,” Ritchie writes, “it’s an opportunity to build a better, fairer and more sustainable world.” Wait, I thought we were talking about mitigating risks from global warming, not building a fairer world. Many people might agree that we should smuggle in a more egalitarian politics under cover of environmental concern, but opponents will just point to such talk as evidence of a  greenwashed conspiracy.Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change – in 50 Questions and Answers by Hannah Ritchie is published by Chatto & Windus (£20).

Lloyd approaches her subject obliquely, via a complex mise-en-scène in the semi-darkened main gallery. There are screens all round. Some you can sit at, others are hung mid-air from wires or mounted on stands or fixed to the walls. High above, a mirror ball twirls, dimly reflected in a shiny black-painted slab that sits low on the floor in front of a translucent hanging curtain. It is a room of interruptions and diversions. What’s that black slab about? A reference to the seams of coal in Potter’s birthplace in the Forest of Dean on the border between England and Wales? I think of the glossy black of a grand piano, and a dance-orchestra backing Al Bowlly, Potter’s favourite 1930s crooner. Does the slab intimate a darkness haunting Potter’s life and work? Moving around is a constant negotiation. Potter’s past collaborators appear and disappear, re-enact moments from his work, reminisce and get sidetracked.Annotated pages of his scripts, not always easy to read, appear on a screen high above our heads. On another, the Berry Hill Silver Band (in which the youthful Potter once played) practise As Time Goes By. On another screen, sitting at home and speaking with Lloyd, the now 85-year-old broadcaster and authorMelvyn Braggremembers hisfamous last television interviewwith Potter in 1994, and gets waylaid by a memory of a New York sidewalk encounter with Lauren Bacall. High Frequency is full of delays and diversions.View image in fullscreenInstallation view of Hilary Lloyd’s Very High Frequency at Studio Voltaire, London.Photograph: Dominique CroshawWearing headphones and standing before the screen on its raised lectern, I struggle to listen. Behind me, Henry Hall and the BBC Radio Orchestra strike up the familiar, swaggering bars of The Teddy Bear’s Picnic. “If you go down to the woods today you’re in for a big surprise,” goes the song. Two young men are fucking in the bracken. Avid and bucolic, the bodies are pale in the dappled green woods as they kiss and wrestle, in a situation devised by Lloyd. Potter’s 1968 television playA Beast With Two Backsfictionalised an incident in the 1890s, when an itinerant troupe of French Travellers, accompanied by some dancing bears, were waylaid in the forest and their bears killed, in retaliation for an entirely unrelated attack on a local young girl. Potter’s work is filled with memory and secrets, sex and death, and the forest itself is a protagonist as much as a setting.Here’s footage of the sections of the rail tracks that led into now defunct little forest coal mines, bits of rusting equipment, piles of decaying pit-props and sealed-up entrances to pits which Potter described as being like great black sows buried in the trees. Going from screen to screen, headphones come on and off. Now a supermarket trolley clatters along a street. Then there’s talk of iron and coal and charcoal burning, and the history of the region, and phone-footage of cats donated by a staff member at the gallery. Lloyd gets everyone involved.Richard E Grant has a jolly lunch at Quo Vadis in Soho with Studio Voltaire curator Nicola Wright. We get a sneak glimpse of the day’s menu, a look at Grant’s wine glass, his watch, his Adidas pumps, his winning appeals to the camera. Zinnnnnnng! Grant was in Potter’sKaraoke(one of his last works, posthumously produced in 1996) and now he’s miming to Zing Went the Strings of My Heart, and lip-syncing to Pennies from Heaven. Elsewhere there are interviews with actors Janet Suzman, Alison Steadman, John Belcher, Potter’s location scout and “fixer”, and Kenith Trodd, who produced much of Potter’s work.But there’s lot here that feels superfluous and extraneous. Videos of cats and grasshoppers, a phone camera zooming back and forth, the phrase Wow What a Shit Show sequinned on to a shirt, closeups of baubles on a Christmas tree. I guess it is all texture, and might allude to tiny details in Potter’s fictions or his life.View image in fullscreenSecrets on show … A still from The Singing Detective by Dennis Potter (1986).Photograph: undefined/© BBC Archive.Lloyd likes losing us in detail. Perhaps it all comes back to Potter’s remarks, when he was dying, about living in the moment, when “things are both more trivial than they ever were, and more important than they ever were, and the difference between the trivial and the important doesn’t seem to matter”. This could easily be the motor of Lloyd’s own art.Thirty years after his death, Potter isstill being talked about, and his one-off television plays and longer series, which came to include fantasy segments, lip-synced song and dance routines, sex, murder and autobiographical allusions to his own childhood abuse by an uncle, have a continuing resonance. One series,Pennies from Heaven, was remade as a critically well-regardedHollywood film, though it bombed at the box office. Another,The Singing Detective, starred Michael Gambon, who spent much of the work in a hospital bed, suffering the same chronic and debilitating psoriatic arthropathy as Potter.View image in fullscreenDetailed stories … Hilary Lloyd, work in progress, 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistDivisive, contrarian and enormously creative, Potter was an outspoken and complex figure, both as a man and as a playwright. The complexities of Lloyd’s own art, and her approach to Potter make for a rich, allusive but sometimes frustrating exhibition. You have to work at it. Potter’s interview with Bragg, recorded just a month after the playwright’s diagnosis with terminal cancer, has been called the writer’s final great work. The interview was unscripted and uncensored. “This is my chance to say my last words,” says Potter towards the end.Filmed in a darkened studio, with Potter smoking and drinking champagne and swigging from his hip-flask of morphine as he talks with Bragg, the conversation is full of life, even in death’s ante-room (he would die a few weeks later). Potter is funny, serious and unafraid. Shown in a room away from the main gallery, it demands our attention. Nowadays, this interview is referred to more often than Potter’s television plays, which are rarely screened. For one thing, their production values often work against them. But Bragg’s interview is as present as ever it was. Ed Atkins’ 2021 film The Worm, recentlyscreened in his Tate Britain show, builds on the physical situation of that interview, which is also the key work here, not least for Potter’s fortitude and candour about death and dying, and his years of debilitating illness.View image in fullscreenCashback … Bob Hoskins  and Cheryl Campbell in the BBC play Pennies from Heaven (1978).Photograph: © BBC Archive. Photograph by Christopher RidleyAs we watch, high on the wall in the corner behind us, Lloyd’s silent, looped film Blossoms plays. Out-of-focus pink and white blossom sways silently in a light breeze against a blue sky. You know it is there but you can’t see it when you are looking at Potter’s amused smile and listening to his soft accent, as he talks about the blossom on the plum tree beyond his window in Ross-on-Wye.Lloyd’s exhibition gives us an opportunity to think about Potter again. There will be screenings of many of his television plays, and of other archive television interviews with Potter. All this is more than period flavour, and we get a sense of Potter’s originality, his belief in the possibilities of television as a medium, and its vitality and openness during the period in which he was working. What Lloyd brings to Potter, and Potter’s work to Lloyd, is less clear. Perhaps it is all about the slipperiness of life, and how hard it is to capture significance, or to know what or where it is.Hilary Lloyd: Very High Frequency is at Studio Voltaire, London, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsInstallationDennis PotterArtVideo artreviewsShareReuse this content"

Much as Tom Stoppard’s Travesties, spotting that James Joyce, Lenin and the artist Tristan Tzara coincided in Zurich in 1917, audaciously fantasised their interactions, Marks and Gran even more boldly posit that, if Adolf Hitler had seen a shrink in Vienna in the early 20th century, it might plausibly have beenSigmund Freud.Beginning with a title-explaining scene in which an Austrian mother seeks advice on her young son’s nocturnal bedwetting and nightmares, Dr Freud Will See You Now, Mrs Hitler contrives encounters across three decades: with Hitler as a patient; house-painter; hiker near the Freuds’ summer house in Berchtesgaden (giving, it is implied, ideas to Hitler); war-wounded corporal; and, ultimately, Führer.This is, especially latterly, very dark material and those who know Marks and Gran only for the sitcom Birds of a Feather might be surprised to find them going here. In fact, their time-slip sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart (BBC, 1993-99) – in which a man was in effect committing adultery with a dead woman – might have interested Freud, and The New Statesman (ITV, 1987-94), with the character of Alan B’Stard MP, presciently lampooned the possibilities of rightwing populism.Though always making clear its “what if?” nature, the play (a much-truncated chunk was broadcast on Radio 4 in 2007) feels historically and psychologically plausible in dialogue between Hitler and Freud that fizzes with intelligence and dangerous jokes. The psychoanalyst is fascinated by Patient A’s relationship with his cruel, dead father and his tendency, as an artist, to erase people from scenes. Patient A is engaged by the ideas Freud is developing about the “group mind” and the exercise of power. Chillingly, the patient is openly antisemitic to the doctor and his family but they tolerate it because words can’t hurt and these Viennese politics are a blip.View image in fullscreenTension … Sam Mac as Hitler and Ruby Ablett as Anna Freud.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianSam Mac as Hitler convincingly charts Adolf’s growth from pathetic to psychopathic and suggests the Freudian connection between the two states. Ruby Ablett, portraying Anna Freud from 13 to her 30s, is given the most daring hypothesis – that sexual tension between Freud’s daughter and Patient A exacerbates his pathology and even antisemitism – but plays it strikingly and touchingly.Jonathan Tafler gives a vivid sense of Freud’s questing intelligence but radiates such charm that it risks weakening the balance between protagonist and antagonist. There is a severe attack on the psychoanalyst’s sometimes contentious methods and assumptions but it comes from Hitler, in brown shirt and swastika, who by this point is clearly not to be trusted in the play or history. It can be argued, though, that the whole conceit is a critique of Freud, who catastrophically misunderstands Patient A.A structure of short scenes in multiple locations is fine for radio or screen but Isaac Bernier-Doyle’s production too often needs the cast as furniture removers. But the props department should get an award for Freud’s ever-held cigar, which is very clearly not just a cigar.AtUpstairs at the Gatehouse, London,until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSigmund FreudAdolf HitlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

The latter is Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, and a fictional director, based on a real-life director, is producing it when Russia declares war on Ukraine. If that sounds like meta leaps within somersaults, Russian director Alexander Molochnikov does a heroic job of making it enjoyable, if antic.It begins with rehearsals at the Moscow Art theatre and travels to New York where fictional director Kon (Daniel Boyd), loosely based on Molochnikov, lives in exile after his public criticism of Putin’s war.The stronger first act powerfully reflects on the role and responsibility of theatre to voice protest, albeit too briefly. There is initial disbelief among the company of actors, then trauma, guilt and anger. Chekhov’s play itself transposes well in its preoccupations around artists and artistic creation.Kon carries shades of Chekhov’s Konstantin, not least because of his relationship with his mother (Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė), who also plays Arkadina, the actor-mother in Chekhov’s play. She initially tries to persuade him to apologise to the government and resume his life as a director inRussia. He refuses, meeting bohemian actor Nico (Stella Baker) in New York and experiencing his own Seagull-style tortured love story. These meta convolutions are made easy to follow with the help of MC cum narrator (Andrey Burkovskiy, very charismatic).View image in fullscreenShades of the original … Daniel Boyd and Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė in Seagull: True Story.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThere are dressing room lightbulbs around the proscenium arch and Alexander Shishkin’s set is surrealist, playful and innovative. The production as a whole, arriving from a season Off-Broadway, fizzes with imagination and high-octane energy – pumping beats, rap and arresting visuals. There is a fabulous dream sequence with Putin arriving shirtless on a horse, one actor swishing its tail.But it is exactly this playful whimsy that dilutes the focus and comes to feel self-indulgent. The switches from drama to satire do not quite work either, especially when Kon arrives in the US and finds his creative vision straitjacketed again, this time by commercialism. Again this reflects Konstantin’s original war against his mother’s commercial sensibilities, but it also sets up a kind of false equivalence between creative freedoms in the US and Russia. It also takes us further away from questions around dangerous dissidence and how artists live – and work – through a war.The play is, in a sense, undone by its own cleverness and determination to speak about everything at once – Chekhov, autobiography, Russia and the US’s confines around creativity. But Molochnikov raises important questions around the cost of conscientious objection that go beyond Putin’s war, and apply, ever disturbingly, closer to home. What action do you take when a war is fought in your name and when various kinds of protest around it become outlawed? What action can a theatre take? These questions linger.AtMarylebone theatre, London, until 12 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAnton ChekhovRussiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Some, standing amid yellow and blue flags, simply held placards. “Art is not neutral,” read one. And indeed it isn’t, though opera’s entanglements in international geopolitics are rarely as visible as at Covent Garden in recent months. “It feels like crossing a picket line,” a colleague muttered grimly.But modern opera houses are well soundproofed. By the first interval of Oliver Mears’ new production of Puccini’s Tosca with Russian soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, the protesters had dispersed.Controversial as Netrebko’s casting has proved, the only disturbances inside the auditorium were roars of approval at the end of the opera’s best-loved numbers.As the first collaboration between Mears – the organisation’s director of opera – and its new music directorJakub Hrůša, as well as RBO’s first new production of Tosca in almost 20 years, this was always going to be a high-stakes season opening. The house lights were dimmed only a fraction of a second before Hrůša landed Puccini’s opening orchestral chords, gleaming and bottom-heavy. The curtain rises on a monumental chapel interior: walls of white marble, a heap of rubble and broken pews on one side, Cavaradossi’s painting-in-progress on the other. There is more marble in Scarpia’s palace (forbiddingly cavernous, dominated by a vast wall clock) while the white tiling of Act 3’s torture-chamber-with-a-view is stained from punishments past.View image in fullscreenHorribly believable … Gerald Finley and Anna Netrebko.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMears’ Rome is a 20th-century war zone. The chapel’s sacristan clears rubbish into a plastic bin bag; Cavaradossi is part of a restoration effort. The police chief Scarpia is an oleaginous CEO (1970s double-breasted suit, combover and a constant, fidgeting need to wipe his hands) with late-20th-century surveillance equipment and a team of thugs. Tosca the diva provides a flash of glamour amid so much drab. The only other colour pop is the blood splattered across Acts 2 and 3.These are striking, harshly drawn tableaux.Freddie de Tommaso’s Cavaradossi arrived with all guns blazing and maintained a steady flow of vocal power throughout.Anna Netrebko’s Tosca – her covered soprano now hard and occasionally reedy – could compete with his wattage, but was at her most compelling in extremis, distraught as she negotiated with Scarpia. As the latter,Gerald Finleyprovided something altogether subtler and more insidious, his voice terrifyingly appealing, his bullying presence horribly believable. Holding it all together from the pit, Hrůša drove forwards and pulled back with absolute musical confidence, making space for moments of beauty but mining from the darkest, grittiest passages of Puccini’s score a performance of tremendous emotional force.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 7 October.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

I thought that was going to go swimmingly,” Spielberg told an audience of journalists at the Academy Museum inLos Angelesthis week, where an exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of Jaws is opening on Sunday.“I thought my career was virtually over halfway through production onJaws, because everybody was saying to me, ‘You are never going to get hired again,” Spielberg recalled.Jaws, the Academy Museum’s first exhibit focused on a single film sincethe museum opened in 2021, traces the film’s colorful struggles, including the many mechanical failures of the titular prop shark, along with the artistic collaborations that led to its ultimate success. Film editor Verna Fields won an Oscar for her work shaping the film’s legendary scenes of suspense. So did composer John Williams, whose ominous “dun-dun” theme song has become one of the most recognizable movie soundtracks. The$260.7m successof the film with domestic audiences also launched Spielberg’s career as one of the most influential American directors.But in 1974, as the production was filming on Martha’s Vineyard, it was far from clear that the movie would secure a place in Hollywood history – or even that the film would actually be finished at all. Spielberg’s attempt to shoot on the actual ocean soon put the production massively over budget and behind schedule, he said, due to constant problems with “the shark, the weather, the currents, the regattas”.“I’ve never seen so much vomit in my life,” Spielberg said of people’s queasiness at sea, to laughter. “I haven’t! In the six months out to sea, I have never seen so many people getting sick.”Spielberg himself “never got seasick”, he said – “and I think that is only because I had the weight of this production on my shoulders and I didn’t have time to get sick.”View image in fullscreenThe sole surviving full-scale model of Bruce, the shark from the film, at the Academy Museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APFilming on the ocean caused non-stop challenges, many of which are highlighted in the new exhibit, which focuses on the value of artistic problem-solving. At one point, a speedboat pulling the Orca, the small boat the main characters use to hunt the great white shark, went too fast and pulled out the boat’s planking, sending John Carter, the film’s Academy Award-winning sound director, into the water, his recorder still in his hands.While the Amity Island Regatta is a key plot point in the film, the actual boat races around Martha’s Vineyard caused endless headaches for Spielberg’s wide-lens ocean shots.“I cannot tell you how nerve-racking it is to get the cameras in position. The tides are slack. We don’t have currents dragging our anchors. The picture boat moves away from the Orca, moves away from the electrical barge, and we’re finally ready to shoot. Everybody’s ready. And all of a sudden, the first white sail appears on the horizon, followed by another one, followed by 25 white sails, little regattas going through the frame,” Spielberg said.Because it was 1974, there were no simple tools to erase the sails from the film post-production. “So, most of the time, we just waited,” Spielberg said. “People played cards. A lot of people vomited.”Then there were all the technical problems with the three animatronic sharks, which Spielberg nicknamed Bruce, afterhis lawyer, Bruce Ramer.View image in fullscreenA replica of the Orca fishing boat at a press preview at the Academy Museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APView image in fullscreenA woman seen through a set of great white shark jaws used for research and set decoration.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe sharks, which were powered by pneumatic and hydraulic systems, had to be assembled on a very rapid timeline after the film studio moved up Jaws’s production schedule to better capitalize on the bestselling success of the novel on which it was based, exhibit curator Jenny He told the Guardian. Many special effects experts refused the assignment, saying the sharks would take years to create.“The special effects team who designed and constructed the shark never had a chance to test it in salt water,” He said. “The first time they put it in the ocean was in Martha’s Vineyard.”As she noted, wryly, “mechanics and salt water really didn’t mix”. The pressurized air systems designed to manipulate the sharks used long underwater tubes, which sometimes got unplugged, or filled with oil, or simply malfunctioned because of the distances they had to snake through the sea.As the filming dragged on, “I was offered, actually, several times, a chance to gracefully bow out of the film, not to be replaced by another director, but for the film to be shut down,” Spielberg said. He refused.The rest of his production team, crucially, stood by him, even as the long delay put a strain on the whole crew: “Every week, I’d have five or six people come over to me to say: ‘I haven’t seen my family. I’ve been here for five months. Just give me an incentive to keep working on your movie. Give me a date, a guarantee of when you’re going to wrap.’ And I didn’t know when we were going to wrap.”What got the cast and crew through it all, Spielberg said, “was being in the company of each other … the camaraderie that happens when you’re just trying to survive something.”View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at a wall of photographs at the museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APWhile it would probably have been easier to film the prop sharks in a controlled tank environment, the curator said, Spielberg’s choice to shoot on location in Martha’s Vineyard was crucial to the film’s artistic power: “He made you feel that you could encounter Bruce in the ocean,” she said. “Even though there were challenges, without those challenges, I don’t think Jaws would have been as successful.”Spielberg, who has since been nominated for nearly two dozen Academy Awards, praised the new exhibit and said he was amazed to see the more than 200 objects the museum curators “have so ingeniously assembled” from a film that finished production more than a half century ago.“Why would anybody, when we shot the opening scene of Chrissie Watkins being taken by the shark, and we had a buoy floating in the water – how did anybody know to take the buoy and take it home and sit on it for 50 years and then loan it to the Academy?”“How did they know? I didn’t know!” Spielberg said.Jaws: The Exhibitionruns at the Academy Museum through 26 July 2026Explore more on these topicsSteven SpielbergJawsLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Singing about sex on her new album, she says, is a way to mask the painFri 12 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 10.21 EDTShareLast November, Lola Young was finally having her moment. Messy, a track from her second album, This Wasn’t Meant for You Anyway, was blowing up on TikTok. Celebrities such as Kylie Jenner were using the track in their clips, and it had quickly permeated the barrier to the real world, becoming a staple of Uber rides and Christmas shopping trips in a matter of days. Even if you wouldn’t recognise Young if she passed you on the street, you’d know the song and its ironclad hook: “Cause I’m too messy! And then I’m too fucking clean … ”Other stars might have taken a moment to enjoy the spoils, or strategise on how best to capitalise on the newfound success. But as Messy was rising in the charts, Young was checking into a rehab facility to deal with a cocaine addiction that had dogged her for “a long time”. By January, she was back doing Pop Star Things: performing on Graham Norton and Jimmy Fallon, performing a cover of a Cure song for an Australian radio station, and so on.“It’s been a struggle – I’ve definitely had to work on some internal healing while grappling with touring and stuff,” she says quietly on a muggy afternoon in late August. “I’ve had to be away for a bit while battling with things. But it teaches you a lot, being addicted to substances. It makes you more empathetic about other people that have gone through that. It’s just a constant journey.”View image in fullscreen‘Sex was my way of masking pain and aggression’ … Young at Coachella in Indio, California, earlier this year.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for CoachellaSitting across from me in a private room at Hide, a fancy restaurant in Mayfair, London, Young is an endearing mess of contradictions: she is timid, stuttering through the occasional phrase, and slightly combative, abruptly asking to change the subject whenever she feels she has said too much about a topic, even if she has barely spoken on it. She pairs her grey hoodie and gigantic camo cargo pants with a face that’s luminously made-up and studded in places I didn’t know you could get pierced. It is oddly fitting that we have met at a restaurant that plays Television’s 70s punk classic Marquee Moon over the speakers and serves a £90 prawn starter – and that, despite the restaurant’s Michelin star, we both stick to coffee.If a man can say he’s only here for one thing, so can IThis kind of contradiction is the lifeblood of Young’s third album I’m Only F**king Myself (asterisks hers). Released next week, it is a raw and raucous coming-of-ager that finds Young, 24, in a darkly comic battle with her vices: drugs, sex or simply talking too much shit. The frank sexuality of songs such as One Thing – a gentle, ribald afrobeat number – clashes with more raw fare such as D£aler, a skeletal road song about the alienation of addiction. Young says writing so openly about sex “was my way of masking” the hurt in the record. “It’s kind of, this is my alter ego, the sex thing – but underneath it is pain and aggression and things I was going through that were more difficult,” she says.The result is a set of barnstormers such as the second track F**k Everyone, about wanting to “fuck guys who don’t like me”, that could set pop radio alight even as they touch on intense fear and self-loathing. “It can take you on a journey of like, OK, so she’s fucking everyone, but really, what does that entail? What does that really mean?”Young grew up in Beckenham, south London. She played piano and guitar from her early years, and remembers “writing songs from a really early age”. She found school difficult, in part because of a schizoaffective disorder that she would be diagnosed with at the age of 17, and in part because of her time at her school, which she describes as “pretty, really, actually,reallyrough”. Young’s mother is white and her father is Jamaican-Chinese, and she was one of the only white-passing kids in her class. “I would fight to be like, ‘Look, I’m mixed-race,’” she says. “It’s complex being mixed race anyway, because you feel conflicted, and I’m very much aware of my privilege, not appearing as a person of colour. But it’s just been weird navigating it – I went through periods of hating my hair texture and being embarrassed of the food I was eating at home. It was a journey.”View image in fullscreenYoung at the MTV awards in New York this month.Photograph: Leonardo Muñoz/AFP/Getty ImagesA lot of that journey was informed by Young’s sister Becky, a campaigner with the music industry environmental charityEarthPercentwho runs an anti-fatphobia Instagram page calledAnti-Diet Riot Club. “She inspired me in every way – in like, what is feminism? What does it mean to be mixed race? What does it mean to be a woman living in London? I used to get my hair braided, and she was like, ‘No, you can’t do this,’” Young says. “I’ve learned a lot from her.”In the past, Young says, she has felt the need to “prove” her mixed-race identity, which she doesn’t feel any more. “This is something that is so ingrained in me that I don’t feel the need to necessarily shout about it, you know? I’m Jamaican-Chinese. I’m very proud to be that,” she says. “Being aware of someone and noticing the difference is different to not accepting them, you know? I don’t give a fuck who you are, where you come from, what size, shape, colour you are. But I am aware of it, and what that means to them in society.”In her teens, Young was accepted into the Brit school, the famed performing arts school attended by FKA twigs and Adele among others. She says it “had an incredible community and sense of friendship” that she had never experienced before. “I was coming from a school that was very like, the bullies were there: I was a bully, I’d been bullied. And I was walking into a school where that wasn’t an option,” she says. Even so, she still struggled with the formal environment. “I think people have this idea of Brit where it’s like, you’re standing on stage, it’s like Fame, and it’s just not like that. I still did all my regular subjects and was still shit at all of them and still fucking fought with teachers.”At this point, Young had been busking and performing at open mic nights from the age of 14, but at the Brit school she realised that she loved being in the studio and working behind the scenes. For a moment, she thought she might want to be a songwriter rather than a performer. “I was like, you know what? I could do this – I could create and I could make people feel things through music,” she recalls. “If I can record a take 1,000 times, maybe this is me.”Part of that desire, she realises now, comes down to the fact that it was the late 2010s, when it was woefully uncool to suggest that you wanted to get famous. “It was almost a bit arrogant, and growing up in London, British culture is quite like, you’ve got to dumb yourself down a bit. When I go to America, it’s like ‘Yeah, bro, I want to be famous’, and you see a nice car and it’s not a wanker [driving it],” she says. “But then I was like, you know what? Being famous is a byproduct of doing something well, in any field. Obviously, it’s been different than what I expected it to be, but I continue on the journey because I love doing what I do.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s hard to be a female, let alone be a female in the industry.’Photograph: Conor CunninghamYoung seems hyper aware of this kind of stigma: she answers certain questions, including the ones about the Brit school, with the semi-defensive pose of an internet-born star who’s become used to receiving criticism about anything and everything. She says she “got loads of slander” about going to Brit even though “it’s in Thornton Heath! You just get in if you audition!” She’s realised that, as she becomes more famous, “You’re still just you, and nothing actually changes apart from online scrutiny.”Coming out as ADHD and being diagnosed has been hard to deal withEarlier, I had asked how she felt about being called a “nepo baby” because her aunt Julia Donaldson wrote The Gruffalo. She declined to speak about it initially, but now she brings it up. “[People are] calling me a nepo baby even though they have no fucking clue who I am, they don’t know who I am, they don’t know what level of wealth I’ve come from, just because my aunt wrote The Gruffalo. I don’t think that’s a reason that I’m a nepo baby.”Young was spotted by manager Nick Shymansky when playing open mic nights, and signed to Island in 2019. Shymansky managed Amy Winehouse until 2006, when “mental health wasn’t a conversation, addiction wasn’t a public conversation, and so people end up dying because they’re not open, they’re not able to seek help,” says Young. She says she feels “very grateful and appreciative” of the fact that she was able to work through her addiction with the help of a team that wasn’t judgmental of her, and with treatment facilities she could easily access. “A lot of people don’t have the privilege of being able to do that. A lot of people suffer from addiction, and a lot of people are in that personal journey [to recovery]. Anyone who knows that feeling will know it’s not linear, it’s always up and down, but it’s down to dysregulation of dopamine … coming out as ADHD as well and being diagnosed, that’s been hard to deal with,” she adds.I suggest that casual drug use is normalised in the music industry. “Yeah, even more so it’s normalised in big cities – I don’t even think it’s just within the music industry,” she says. “It depends who you surround yourself with – you can always find [drugs], you know? It can be dark, it’s not always fun and party.”Young says that the industry “can be a really dangerous place” for women. “It’s hard to be a female, let alone be a female in the industry … being in the spotlight, and having people, A&Rs or label execs wanting to mould you,” she says. She brings up Chappell Roan, who has faced criticism for trying to set boundaries around the way she expects to be treated by fans and paparazzi. “Everything she’s doing is perfectly feasible and right, and she got a lot of hate for being like, ‘Actually, you know what? I don’t want to do that, that’s not OK.’ People will respond by going, ‘Well, you wanted to be in the limelight’. But you don’t sign up to have cameras in your face 24/7.”David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreAs well as addiction, I’m Only F**king Myself is preoccupied with sex – Young sings about hookups with a witty bluntness that feels more indebted to bawdy rappers such as CupcakKe or the hornbag producer Cash Cobain than any of her British pop peers. On One Thing, a skeletal earworm that’s vastly different from anything she’s made previously, she treats a man like her plaything, but in an endearingly casual way. “It was like, if a man can say ‘I’m only here for one thing’, so can I. But I also wanted to embody that feeling of not being constrained and constricted within sex,” she says. “It’s kind of me exploring things within myself and feeling sexy, but then also finding it hard to just have casual sex and it be brushed off.”Right now, Young isn’t dating – she has just come out of a long-term relationship and is far too busy to consider it. She has already started working on the deluxe edition of I’m Only F**king Myself. After this bloodletting, fearless album – especially for an artist who’s in such an early stage of her career – she is “very excited to start talking about things that feel slightly more metaphorical” rather than stories that come directly from her diary. “I want to flip it on its head for the next one and create something that feels back to my roots of being a singer-songwriter,” she says, setting up her next contradiction.I’m Only F**king Myself is released via Island Records on 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, he plans to release its ‘mother film’, to expose the ‘huge danger’ the world faces todayFri 12 Sep 2025 06.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 10.19 EDTShareIn late July this year, a few days before his 50th birthday, the exiled Russian film-maker Ilya Khrzhanovsky was landed with a 50,000 rouble (£450) fine by the Presnensky District Court of Moscow. This punishment was ostensibly for a Kafkaesque administrative offence relating to “procedures for the activities of foreign agents”. Khrzhanovsky himself thinks it was a symbolic birthday warning from the Russian authorities that he is still on their radar.“It’s clear it is absolute nonsense,” Khrzhanovsky says. “I will not pay it. I am not a Russian citizen and I don’t want to pay any money to the Russian state.” He renounced his Russian citizenship last year, and is now a British, German and Israeli citizen.Also last year,Andrei Lugovoi, a former KGB agent turned politician who became deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, called Khrzhanovsky a “master traitor”, and accused him of “sabotage against Russia”. That’s when Khrzhanovsky was first given the status of “foreign agent” – a label widely used to target critics of the Putin regime.View image in fullscreenIlya Khrzhanovsky.Photograph: Geoffrey MacnabLugovoi specifically objected to the XZ Foundation that Khrzhanovsky and journalist Mikhail Zygar set up in 2023 to counter propaganda in Russia. Lugovoi didn’t much like Khrzhanovsky’s mocking attitude toward Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine either.On the September afternoon that I meet him in the cafe of the tennis club on Venice’s Lido, Lugovoi isn’t much on his mind. He is in town forThe Quantum Effect, an exhibition at the San Marco Arts Centre (SMAC) where he is presenting material from his never-ending project Dau. The excerpts he is showing feature scientists debating quantum and string theory.Khrzhanovsky is relaxed but exudes a certain weary fatalism. You can’t blame him, given the huge debts he has amassed since embarking on Dau, and the widespread opprobrium directed toward the project. It is a series of films – 14 features in all – art installations, performances, debates and books about Soviet Russia under Stalin that Khrzhanovsky started working on 20 years ago.When one of the first films to be unveiled,Dau: Natasha, screened in competition in the Berlin film festival in February 2020, it won an award for its veteran German cinematographer, Jürgen Jürges, but generally caused uproar in east and west alike. The film was promptly banned in Russia as“pornographic propaganda”. A grim late scene in which its protagonist Natasha (Natasha Berezhnaya) is being interrogated by a KGB investigator who forces her to insert the neck of a bottle into her vagina provoked particular fury, although the scene was clearly staged. The director was accused of rampant misogyny and bullying.“It was published that I found Natasha inside a masochistic brothel, which is absolutely not true – and then it was translated to Russian,” the director complains, bitterly, about how he and his project have been misrepresented.View image in fullscreenFury-provoking … Natasha Berezhnaya in Dau. Natasha.Photograph: Phenomen FilmIt irks him that he was accused of secretly recording his actors in their most intimate moments, including when they were having drunken sex. For one thing, Dau was shot on 35mm – and you can’t help but notice a 35mm movie camera, especially when there is a big crew standing behind it.The Dau project started in modest fashion, as a small, European-funded arthouse movie inspired by theNobel prize-winning Soviet scientist Lev Landau(who died in 1968). But somewhere along the way the project “mutated”, as Khrzhanovsky puts it. He secured support from the oligarch Sergei Adoniev and instead of making a feature film, he embarked on what turned into a massive multimedia experiment designed to submerge audiences – and those who participated in making it – in the horrific, phantasmagoric world of the Stalin-era Soviet Union.He worked with three cinematographers: Lol Crawley (who last year won an Oscar for The Brutalist) shot the Saint Petersburg parts of Dau; then there were Jürges (best known for his work with Rainer Werner Fassbinder) and Manuel Alberto Claro (who has shot several Lars von Trier films including Nymphomaniac).The maverick director largely made the Dau films in Kharkiv in Ukraine, where he built a re-creation of a Soviet-era scientific compound that is claimed to be the largest film set in European cinema history. Rumours suggested he had gone crazy, like Kurtz in Heart of Darkness. He was working with vast armies of actors and extras, artists and scientists (among them Marina Abramović and opera director Peter Sellars), all of whom had to stay entirely in character, as if they really were back in the USSR.View image in fullscreenIn character … artist Marina Abramović in Dau.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhen he gave a masterclass at the Sarajevo film festival earlier this summer, one detail stood out: the 70 tons of cabbage he requisitioned for a single scene. When I ask why he needed quite so many greens, he responds: “It’s an unusual project and I did it in an unusual way. I tried to create a feeling of a different time. I tried to find precise faces, precise body language for characters, even in the extras …”I recognise people from the ex-USSR. There is something about the look in their eyes“I recognise people from the ex-USSR. It doesn’t matter how they dress. It’s kind of the Soviet smell. Not literally a smell, but there is something in the body language, something about how people look in the eyes. This was one of the reasons I wanted to try to make this movie, to understand the nature of this Soviet DNA,” he says.A fateful decision was not to release what he now calls the “mother film” first. This was the conventional, narrative-driven feature that, judging by the trailer, was close to a Doctor Zhivago-style epic, complete with massive crowd scenes.“I felt that if I came first with this movie, it would take all the attention, and the other Dau movies would be just like leftovers,” he says. Instead, the experimental and confrontational work, in which he goes “really deep in human relations and behaviour”, was shown to the public first, and there was a big Dau exhibition at the Théâtre du Châtelet and Théâtre de la Ville in Paris in early 2019.View image in fullscreen‘The nature of totalitarianism and the nature of life is that you don’t know’ … Dau. Degeneration.Photograph: DauThe timing was against him. Thanks to Covid, distribution opportunities for the first batch of films were severely curtailed. Some were made available on a website (currently under reconstruction) but Dau seemed destined to turn into one of those tantalising projects that would never properly be completed. Back in 2019 and 2020, its grim warnings about the true nature of contemporary Russian totalitarianism were largely ignored. So were the discussions about art, philosophy, religion and quantum physics. Instead, critics focused on the sex and the violence, or grumbled about the teething problems. Visitors to the exhibition in Paris were given “visas”, not conventional tickets. They had to answer questions about themselves in order to be allowed in. When they looked for guidance from staff about what was showing where, Khrzhanovsky explains, “the answer they got is that they [the staff] didn’t know – because the nature of totalitarianism and the nature of life is that you don’t know”. This may have made for heightened Soviet-style realism but it didn’t always contribute to customer satisfaction.In 2019, the private financing ran out. “Then it was my responsibility,” Khrzhanovsky says. He admits there were times he wanted to abandon the Dau project altogether and “to do something else”. In 2020, he was appointed artistic director of the Babyn Yar memorial centre in Kyiv, commemoratingthe 34,000 Jews murdered in a ravine in Kyiv by the Nazisin September 1941. He also worked as an associate producer on Sergei Loznitsa’s 2021 film about the massacre, Babyn Yar. Context, and its 2022 follow-up The Kiev Trial.View image in fullscreenA commemoration … The Kiev Trial.Photograph: Atoms VoidThen came the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the summer of 2023, the director stepped down from the Babyn Yar project; he is now living in Berlin and is picking up the pieces of Dau. He has 700 hours of film, 4,000 hours of sound, enough material to fill 247 books, each 500 pages long, and an estimated 1,500 terabytes of data. He has hired a massive storage space to house the “40,000 pieces of costume, art installations, props and elements that we prepared for the release”.Much of this was previously kept in a huge mansion in Piccadilly owned by property magnates the Reuben brothers. “The Reubens gave us the building almost for free. I offered our company to be live-in guards. It was a time when they were waiting for planning permission.”Khrzhanovsky is back editing material he shot almost two decades ago – and he believes that Dau has a new relevance and urgency. “When Dau was presented six or seven years ago, there were many questions as to why I was touching this strange story about the Stalin era. At that time, it was not such a big topic. Nowadays, I think it has another meaning. I hope that, through this project, it is possible to understand something more about the nature of totalitarianism. We have to understand where we are, and what kind of huge danger the world is facing now, and that this evil has different faces.”Inside Dau, the ‘Stalinist Truman Show’: ‘I had absolute freedom – until the KGB grabbed me’Read moreThe plan is to release the “mother film” next year. In the meantime, the never-before-seen Dau physics films on show in Venice depict real contemporary scientists – including the Dutch physicist Erik Verlinde and Nobel prize winner David Gross – debating quantum theory within the historic conditions of Lev Landau’s Soviet laboratory. This, at least, is one small part of Khrzhanovsky’s gargantuan and hugely contentious project that shouldn’t leave any controversy trailing in its wake.The Dau physics films screen as part of The Quantum Effect, an exhibition curated by Daniel Birnbaum and Jacqui Davies, which is atSan Marco Art Centre, Venice, until 23 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmRussiaInstallationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2024, he dida world record swim across Lac Léman (Lake Geneva), completing 45 miles in 22 hours and nine minutes. But that was not enough. “I love the lakes and the scenery and came up with the idea of the 10 largest lakes in Switzerland because it just sounded like a big, exciting challenge.”Gilson, who runs the family’s hotel, trains at a leisure centre (dawn in the pool and night-time in the gym after the children have gone to bed) and the sea off the northDevoncoast.View image in fullscreenNeil Gilson has already swum two of the Swiss lakes – Lugano and Constance – with a support boat on hand.Photograph: Liam TancockBut he said the lakes were much more demanding than the sea. “They’re more unpredictable. With the sea you know the tide times so you can calculate your swim to get the tidal push, but you can’t do that in the lakes.“You can get some really choppy conditions because of the wind. These lakes have almost got their own climates because they’re such big bodies of water. There could be bright sunshine a mile away but over the lake there’s thunderstorms,” he said.The water temperature of the Swiss lakes at this time of year is broadly comparable to the sea off north Devon – about 20C – but Gilson said the problem was that you could hit “walls” of cold water. “The cold patches can get you – places where the water is cold because of runoff from the Alps. It’s not a consistent temperature.”Gilson has already swum two of the lakes: Lugano (18 miles) and Constance (39 miles). This month he will take on Neuchâtel (23 miles, about 10 hours of swimming) and Biel (nine miles, five hours). He plans to do the other six next year.On Constance, the biggest challenge was the effect of the Rhine. “The current flow is huge there,” said Gilson. In Léman – one of next year’s targets – there is a whirlpool effect to negotiate. “We’ll try to loop around that.”While he needs to be super fit, being mentally prepared is even more important. “I would say it’s 30% physical fitness, 70% mental. I don’t think about the swim as a whole. I won’t think I’ve got a 70km swim. I’ll just be thinking I’m going to go in and swim, stroke after stroke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I also tell myself, ‘I’m in here by choice’, and the reason why is to help people like my son so that gives you a bit of a superpower.”It can also be meditative. “You just relax, try not to overthink and just be in the moment. The phrase I use is ‘time is timeless’. I also have these chants – each stroke I’ll repeat the names of my family members. You need these techniques because it is lonely. Though you’re in these beautiful settings, really all I’m looking at is the support boat. I breathe to the same side and the support boat is on my right every time so it’s just the same view.”Gilson is raising awareness and funds for children affected by Pans and Pandas, conditions that affect the brain. People with Pans or Pandas experience a variety of symptoms,ranging from mental health symptoms to changes in behaviour and difficulties with movement.His son was diagnosed with Pandas after catching tonsillitis. “He went to bed a happy, healthy little boy, and woke up as someone we didn’t recognise – he was gripped by aggression, OCD [obsessive-compulsive disorder], tics and intense fear; he refused to eat, wouldn’t leave the house or even speak. It was terrifying.”Jack is now nine and doing well. “I’m sharing our story through this challenge to help other families still searching for answers,” Neil said.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingSwitzerlandFitnessChildren's healthDevonEuropeFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Am I going to be covering Betamax and MiniDisc players next?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.No, this isn’t a retro piece from the Filter. You may be reading this at least three years afterApple decided the iPod business was too niche to be worth bothering with, but MP3 players – or digital audio players, as they should more accurately be called – are seeing a small resurgence, despite the domination of Spotify, Apple Music and the like.“In the past few years, since Covid, we’ve seen way more people looking to get a new MP3 player,” says Chris Laidler, office manager ofAdvanced MP3 Players, an Edinburgh store specialising in audio equipment.The reasons are, essentially, threefold. First, there’s the pleasure of using something tangible: a nostalgia for devices with a single purpose, devoid of notifications and apps. More importantly, though, there’s a desire to have a music collection again – something led by the music-loving algorithm in your brain, rather than one outsourced to technology. “It’s their collection, rather than a playlist they’ve subscribed to,” says Laidler, and they own the music and aren’t simply “leasing it from Spotify”.Finally, there’s a sound-quality aspect. Yes, your phone can play music, but it’s a pretty insignificant part of its daily tasks, and for audiophiles, it shows.“When you think about it, the DAC [digital-to-analogue converter] that’s in [your phone] is only going to be one tiny component of the thing,” says Laidler. In modern high-end MP3 players, on the other hand, “the entire infrastructure is designed for [delivering] as accurate music recreation as possible.”These arguments won’t be compelling to everyone, but if you do take your music seriously and feel like you’ve been listening too much on autopilot, getting a new MP3 player could be just what you need to get out of a musical rut.At a glanceBest MP3 player overall:Activo P1£399 at ActivoBest budget MP3 player:Snowsky Echo Mini£49.99 at AMP3Best mid-range player:FiiO JM21£179 at Peter TysonBest high-end player:iBasso DX180£499 at AMP3Why you should trust meMP3 players and me go way back. Ahead of starting university, I bought a 20GB Archos Jukebox. With its blue bumpers on every corner, it wasn’t an iPod-style looker, but it made all the 32MB (yes, megabytes!) players at the time look flimsy (even if it did little for my already limited campus cool factor). When those bumpers failed to protect the internal hard drive from one too many falls, I switched to a Creative model, before finally accepting Apple’s dominance of the market with an iPod nano.I’m also the proud(ish) owner of an imported Microsoft Zune. That might not make the case for me on grounds of taste, but it does at least show that I’ve put the hours in. More importantly, I’ve been reviewing tech for more than a decade now, most of it more complex than an MP3 player. I probably should have started with that point, but it tells its own story: I’m quite geeky when it comes to my digital music collection.How I testedView image in fullscreenListen up: the MP3 players were tested with in-ear monitors and over-ear headphones.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianI sourced 15 modern MP3 players from the likes of Sony, Agptek, Majority, Shanling, iBasso and FiiO – which may not all sound that familiar, such is the niche we’re dealing with. While players can go for more than £1,000, I was keen to test mainstream devices, with the highest priced at £649 and the lowest at £30.I supplemented this with twoold Apple models via Backmarket, where preowned tech can get a second life rather than becoming e-waste. Neither made the list, however, for reasons I’ll get to later.I listened to a lot of music in different environments. I became familiar with my old collection (out and about, and while connected directly to my Cambridge Audio AXA25 hifi). To get the most out of the high-end players, I borrowed a couple of high-end FiiO headsets from Advanced MP3 Players: the FH75 wired in-ear monitors, and the over-ear FT7 headphones. These offered a considerable improvement over my own somewhat tired headphones.All the while, I diligently made mental notes about the look, feel, battery life and usability of each device, relative to its cost. File quality is also a factor, of course, and to that end, I not only played MP3s, but lossless Flac versions of the same track.The best MP3 players in 2025View image in fullscreenMusic to his ears? Alan prepares to tune in.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest MP3 player overall:Activo P1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£399 at Activo£399 at AmazonIf you’ve done enough reading on the topic of digital audio players, you’ll have undoubtedly come across the Astell & Kern brand … and then possibly realised its products are out of your price range. Enter Activo: a sub-brand from the company, which promises to deliver a lot of what audiophiles want for considerably less cost.Why we love itWhile £399 represents a significant outlay, it’s nowhere near as pricey as some models and still offers a lot of bang for your buck. The dual-DAC structure provides high-resolution audio, aided by its Digital Audio Remaster upsampling tech, plenty of pre-programmed filters and a built-in EQ to modify 20 frequencies to your tastes.File support is strong, and it has 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced audio ports for wired connections, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless playback. It can even work as an external DAC for your computer if you like.It comes with 64GB of internal storage, and you can expand it with microSD cards of up to 1.5TB. It uses Android – which I always worry detracts from the point of a dedicated MP3 player – but it’s a highly pared-back version focused on music. The Google Play Store is here, but it’s really only present to allow you to install Spotify, Tidal or whatever your streaming poison is. It’s intuitive, smooth enough, and not trying to mimic your phone: you won’t find yourself distracted by social media nonsense.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have more dedicated physical playback buttons. That and its chunky size almost made me give the cheaper£346.80 Sony NW-A306the nod, but Activo’s smoother, pared-back version of Android and additional 4.4mm output gave it the edge.Capacity:64GB internal, expandable up to 1.5TBScreen:4.1in LCD, 720 x 1,280Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.3Weight:155gSupported file types:WAV, Flac, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, DFF, DSF, MQABattery test (wired earbuds):15hrs 30minsBest budget MP3 player:Snowsky Echo MiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£49.99 at AMP3£68.99 at eBayI tested quite a few budget players, and in most cases there was an element of getting what you pay for, with iffy interfaces, truncated filenames and thin, reedy audio. For about £50, the FiiO Snowsky Mini avoids all these traps while leaning into the charm of retro rather nicely, even if its design may go over the heads of those under the age of 35. That’s right, it looks like a cassette tape, and the colour screen will even show one playing when you’re listening to music, if you like.Why we love itYou may not be familiar with the Snowsky brand, but you might have heard of its parent company, FiiO, which is one of the bigger names in modern portable digital audio. The Echo Mini has clearly learned from its sister products, providing a far richer soundscape than that offered by any other budget device I tested. It’s also the only cheap offering to include a 4.4mm balanced port along with the standard 3.5mm one.The interface is basic but reasonably intuitive, with physical buttons along the top to control playback. You can choose from a handful of EQ presets and filters in the settings, too. Navigating via physical controls and a largely text-based interface may feel dated in the age of smartphones, but it fits in with the retro vibes and ensures a distraction-free environment – unless you become transfixed by the tape player animation, that is.For the price, I only really have two complaints. The first is that because it’s not connected to the internet, you have to update its software the old-fashioned way: by downloading the firmware to your desktop, to drag and drop. The second is that, while it has a microSD slot to supplement the 8GB of internal storage, it maxes out at 256GB, which may be too little for indecisive music fans.It’s a shame that …its text-based interface may not be to your taste.Capacity:8GB internal, expandable up to 256GBScreen:1.99in IPS, 170 x 320Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.3Weight:55gSupported file types:MP3, DSD, WAV, Flac, APE, M4A, OGGBattery test (wired earbuds):10hrs 30minsBest mid-range player:FiiO JM21View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£179 at Peter Tyson£179.99 at AmazonIf you want good sound quality but resent paying smartphone prices for a dedicated audio player, the FiiO JM21 is a great compromise, as it comes in at just £179.99. For that price, it’s remarkably fully featured, and it sounds great.Why we love itFiiO knows how to make a good MP3 player, and it’s impressive how much of the brand’s high-end quality filters down to its entry-level product. The JM21’s dual-DAC chipset delivers a nice detailed sound, whether you’re listening via 3.5mm cable or balanced 4.4mm connection. And while it runs Android, you can switch to a more basic audio-only view via a drop down, giving you the choice between a distraction-free environment and something more fully featured.The build is delightful, too. Its slim profile means it weighs a light 156g, and the physical buttons are evenly split between the left and right sides, making it easy to play, pause and skip tracks and adjust volume without looking. If you’re curious about dedicated portable music players, but don’t want to spend a fortune, this is an inexpensive but impressive way to find out what all the fuss is about.It’s a shame that …the 32GB of internal storage won’t go far, especially as lots of that is gobbled up by Android.Capacity:32GB internal, expandable up to 2TBScreen:4.7in TFT, 750 x 1,334Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.0Weight:156gSupported file types:ISO, DST, MQA, DSD, DXD, APE, ALAC, AIFF, Flac, WAV, MP3, OGG, WMA, AACBattery test (wired earbuds):11hrs 30minsBesthigh-end player:iBasso DX180View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£499 at AMP3£499 at AmazonThe term “high-end” is obviously relative, but given most people don’t want to break into four figures for portable audio, I’ve chosen to pitch it between £400 and £650. And, of all the players I tested in that bracket, the iBasso DX180 offers the best balance of features, sound quality, price and design.Why we love itThe DX180 sounds great, with its quad-DAC chip providing a lovely sound via 3.5mm or 4.4mm balanced. On top of that, it’s simply a nice player to hold and play with: substantial, but not hefty. Pleasingly, you can open the back to replace the battery, should you find it’s not lasting as long as it used to – a big plus for sustainability.It runs Android 13 and has a chip capable of doing so without slowdown. I’d prefer something more bespoke, but it’s really only used for picking out an album or playlist. After that, the buttons on the side take over, letting you play, pause, skip or adjust the volume via a volume wheel. The advantage of Android is that you can download whatever music streaming apps you like to accompany your own collection.It was a close call between this and theShanling M5 Ultra, which costs the same but doesn’t come with any onboard storage (you supply your own microSD card). I had a minor preference for the sound of the M5 Ultra (and I preferred its music-first implementation of Android), yet the DX180 is lighter, runs cooler and lasted almost three hours longer in my battery test, giving it the edge.It’s a shame that …its UI is pure Android, making it seem like a phone (minus the phone!).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Shanling makes a great alternative for the 2020s, complete with a tiny 1.54in touchscreen to navigate however many songs you can fit on a microSD card of up to 2TB in size (there’s no internal storage).Considering its tiny frame, the sound quality is superb, although you’re limited to either 3.5mm wired or Bluetooth 5 headphones. Weighing just 36.8g, it’s the definition of portable – though if navigating a device so small sounds like a nightmare, that’s because it kind of is. The 240 x 240 screen is easy enough to read, and adjusting volume via the wheel is actually a little fun, but moving between menus isn’t intuitive – it’s the definition of fiddly. Still, if portability is your ultimate aim, you won’t find better than this.It didn’t make the final cut because …the size and shape remain too fiddly to recommend to most people.Capacity:no internal storage, expandable to 2TB;screen:1.54in LCD, 240 x 240;connectivity:3.5mm, Bluetooth 5, 4.4mm adapter available separately;weight:36.8g;supported file types:WAV, Flac, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIF, DSD, M3U, CUE, AC3, DXD, DTS, M4A;battery test (wired earbuds):11hrs 6minsMajority MP3 GoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£29.99 at Currys£29.95 at AmazonBest for:workoutsYou may decide that the Shanling M0 is perfectly suited for workouts, but here’s an option that improves on it in two crucial ways: price and physical buttons.The former is an obvious bonus, and £30 is quite the bargain for this player. While it won’t blow anyone away sound wise, it punches above its weight, and it’s priced so competitively that you won’t be too devastated if it doesn’t make it out of a particular intensive gym session alive.More importantly, it has tactile buttons rather than a touchscreen, meaning you can pause and jump between tracks without sweat getting in the way. The sports clip means it will stay firmly attached to your clothes, though do note that it doesn’t have any kind of waterproofing, so it’s best to keep it covered if you’re an all-weather runner.It didn’t make the final cut because …while its sound is great for the price, this isn’t the player to turn Spotify streamers into believers.Capacity:16GB internal, expandable up to 128GB;screen:1.54in IPS, 240 x 240;connectivity:3.5mm, Bluetooth 5;weight:33g;supported file types:MP3, Flac, WAV;battery test (wired earbuds):33hrs 30minsWhat about the iPod?View image in fullscreenSound advice: be careful when buying refurbished iPods …Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianAs mentioned above, I sourced a couple of iPods from Backmarket. The iPod Nano was beaten by the Shanling M0 Pro above, while the iPod Classic ran into a different problem: it had been modified.Apple never produced a version larger than 160GB, but the model supplied by Backmarket had a backplate labelled 256GB. A check of the serial on Apple’s website revealed it was originally 160GB. When asked about how a modified piece of hardware could have been available for unsuspecting buyers to purchase, the company explained that it “rigorously vet[s] sellers” with just one in three applicants approved.“We have zero tolerance for counterfeit items. When sellers first start selling on our platform, they are limited to just five sales per day. Everything is meticulously checked, including their customer feedback, comments, and delivery performance. Once they are allowed to sell without restrictions, they continue to be closely monitored. At the slightest issue, their sales are limited again, and if they don’t improve after the problem is identified (with help from our lab), they will be excluded from the platform.”The company added that “if customers suspect that they have purchased a counterfeit device, they are encouraged to contact Customer Care”.Obviously, we couldn’t publish our findings about an MP3 player we believe to have been modified here. And there are reasons you might want to stay away from iPods, regardless of this cautionary tale.There are too many compromises with an iPod, from the difficult reliance on iTunes to the need to convert into Apple-friendly file formats such as AAC and ALAC. Plus, of course, you’re relying on a 3.5mm headphone jack, with most iPods not supporting Bluetooth connections. The final iPod Nano did, if you can find one, as did the iPod Touch range, although the latter is too close to an iPhone for my liking.If you’re dead set on an iPod Classic, one option is to buy a deliberately souped-up version with the features that we all wish Apple would provide.Player Modsspecialises in upgrading iPod Classics with optional Bluetooth, more storage, larger batteries, USB-C charging and even an AirTag, so it won’t get lost. Each of these upgrades costs a pretty penny, of course, but if you want to live in the past with the mod-cons of the present, there’s no better way to do so.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenDisc to data: audio file download cards are often found in new vinyl releases.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianWhat are lossless and lossy audio files?Back in the days when music player capacities were measured in megabytes rather than gigabytes, file size was all important, leading to the popularity of the MP3. By reducing audio fidelity, the recording size could be slashed from 600–6,000 megabytes per hour to 14.4–144 (depending on sample rate).Lossless audio files – such as Flac or ALAC – retain all information about a track, playing the music as originally recorded. However, if you have a big music collection, your limited storage space will fill up faster.So is lossless better if you have the space? Objectively, yes, but in truth, you may not actually be able to tell the difference between a high-quality MP3 file and a lossless track, despite the difference in file size.Don’t believe me? Ask Apple’s own Eddy Cue. “The reality of lossless is: if you take 100 people and you take a stereo song in lossless and you take a song that’s been in Apple Music that’s compressed, I don’t know if it’s 99 or 98 can’t tell the difference,” he said in an interview withBillboard. “For the difference of lossless, our ears aren’t that good.”You could be within that 1%-2%, of course, andNPR created a quiz where you can test yourself. But even if you have magic ears, you’ll most likely need to use wired headphones, asonly a handful of devices support lossless audio over Bluetoothat the time of writing.What’s the difference between a cheap MP3 player and an expensive one?If you’ve shopped around, you’ll know that MP3 players can cost anywhere between £30 and several thousand pounds. So what’s the difference?It chiefly comes down to obvious things such as build quality, the DACs powering them (manifested in sound quality) and the variety of outputs supported. Cheaper ones are usually limited to Bluetooth and 3.5mm outputs, while more expensive ones will cater for more exotic outputs.“We sell players that have XLR outputs on them, so a hell of a lot more powerful output on these things,” says Advanced MP3 Players’ Laidler. “You couldn’t put something like that into a cheap player, because they just wouldn’t drive it.”But don’t despair: according to Laidler, after a certain point, pricing becomes less about sound quality and more about finding the tuning that suits you and your personal taste. He compares them to high-end cameras: “They all cost a lot of money, but they’re not capturing the exact same image.” Naturally, as a retailer, he doesn’t use the phrase “diminishing returns”, but I feel comfortable using it here.Beware how easy it is to get stuck chasing that perfect sound. “At the audio trade shows, people come in with their little notebooks, and they go around each room making notes about the character of each player and the price,” says Laidler. “But then you see these same people come back the next year, and you ask them, ‘Oh, which one did you end up going for?’ and they’re still deciding.”3.5mm vs 4.4mm balanced: what’s the difference?While 3.5mm ports are ubiquitous, some players on this list have an additional 4.4mm balanced input. Generally speaking, 3.5mm cables aren’t balanced, while 4.4mm cables are. Unbalanced cables deliver a full stereo sound image on a single signal wire, but balanced provides two signal wires, both carrying a copy of the sound. This means less interference and, as a result, theoretically cleaner playback.The difference is subtle, so it’s not essential for everyone. The bottom line is that either usually sounds better than Bluetooth, taking advantage of the MP3 player’s built-in DAC. The obvious drawback is that you’ll be back to the bad old days of untangling cables from time to time.MP3s vs smartphone streaming: which is better for audio quality?In theory, lossless streaming over Apple Music, Tidal or – as of this week, Spotify – beats an MP3.That’s because, as outlined above, MP3 is an inherently lossy format. A streamed lossless file compared with a local Flac, however, should be a dead heat, assuming you’re using the same audio equipment. “It comes down to ownership of your own music, rather than quality,” says Laidler.There’s a “but”, however. The question is specifically about “smartphone streaming”, and smartphone makers no longer include a headphone jack for wired output, nor stress too much about the quality of the onboard DAC. High-end MP3-player makers do.In other words, while the files may sound the same in identical conditions, a smartphone will generally reproduce the audio worse than a high-end MP3 player with a quality DAC included. Some MP3 players also include streaming software, so you can have the best of both worlds.Buying a refurbished MP3 playerGiven that MP3 players aren’t as popular as they used to be, there are plenty of preowned models to buy, but you should be aware of the risks. First off, there’s the counterfeit and modification problem. If even a legitimate company like Backmarket can inadvertently sell a modified iPod Classic, then buying from individual sellers on eBay, Vinted and the like is clearly a gamble.However, even if you bring a legitimate retro MP3 player out of retirement, there are things to bear in mind. “A lot of those devices from the original MP3 player boom are going to only play MP3 files and don’t have the capacity for playing high-res audio or lossless files,” says Laidler. “The vast majority are going to be out of warranty, so the company that originally built them won’t touch them if something goes wrong.“But as a nostalgic thing, I think they’re great. We still have an iPod Classic rattling around in the office because we just can’t bring ourselves to part with it. Really, it’s just nice to have it around.”Alan Martin is areviews writer who has been putting products – including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces for more than a decade.

And, when they’re nestled into soft almond cream and scented with star anise, they make a delicious tart for any time of day. Serve warm with pouring cream as pudding or cold with a cup of tea.Plum and star anise frangipane tartPrep15 minChill1 hr 30 minCook1 hr 45 minServes8-10For the pastry300g plain flour,plus extra for dusting90g icing sugar¼ tsp salt200g cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus an extra 10g, melted, for greasingFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 large egg yolk20ml ice-cold waterFor the plums4-5 medium plums(about 100g each), halved, stoned and sliced into 1cm-wide wedges1tbsp caster sugar3 whole star anise(about 3g), finely ground in a mortar to get 1½ tspFor the filling125g unsalted butter, at room temperature125g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange¼ tsp fine sea salt½ tsp almond extract, or vanilla extract2 eggs, at room temperature40g plain flour125g ground almondsIcing sugar, to finishTo make the pastry, put the flour, icing sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine and aerate. Add the butter and lemon zest, then process to the consistency of fresh breadcrumbs.Lightly whisk the egg yolk and water, then add to the flour mix and pulse until it begins to come together. Tip out the dough (it will be quite soft and slightly sticky) on to a lightly floured worktop and pat gently to bring it together. Divide the pastry in two with one piece slightly larger than the other, then wrap each loosely in clingfilm. Press gently to form discs and put the larger piece in the fridge for at least an hour (and up to three days); freeze the other piece of pastry for another use.To make the tart, grease a 23cm x 2½cm tart tin with a removable base with butter. Unwrap the pastry disc (if it is very firm, soften it slightly by tapping all over with a rolling pin), then roll out on a lightly floured worktop to about 4mm thick. Line the tart tin with the pastry, then trim the overhang and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Line the chilled pastry case with a sheet of baking paper and fill with baking beans. Blind bake for 20 minutes, then lift out the beans and paper. Return the tart to the oven, turn down the temperature to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and bake for another seven or eight minutes, until light golden brown. Remove, and leave the oven on.Meanwhile, mix the plums, sugar and a half-teaspoon of the ground star anise in a small bowl.For the almond cream, put the butter, sugar, orange zest, remaining teaspoon of ground star anise and the salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high until light and creamy. Add the almond extract, then the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn down the speed to low, add the flour and ground almonds, and mix thoroughly. Scrape into the pastry shell, then smooth the top. Arrange the plum wedges in a neat, tight concentric circle on top, then bake for 40-45 minutes, until the filling is set.Remove, leave to cool a little in the tin, then ease out and on to a serving plate. Dust lightly with icing sugar and serve warm or cold.Explore more on these topicsPastryThe sweet spotDessertFoodBakingFruitPieAutumn food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

After getting pregnant early on in our relationship, at 34, I had a flash of doubt that my partner Alex and I weren’t ready to be parents. Then, a few weeks later, the pregnancy was over.My second early loss, just a few months later, hit me harder. We went to a fertility specialist, and the tests on both of us came back clear, but then I couldn’t get pregnant at all.By the time we married in December 2018, Alex and I had been on a relentless treadmill of fertility interventions for three years. I’d held my breath during my third pregnancy in May 2017, devastated when it ended, only to be followed by a fourth loss a year later, at 10-and-a-half weeks.Infertility affected every part of my life. I struggled to hang out with girlfriends going through pregnancy and early parenthood. Hearing their valid complaints and worries, when it was all I wanted for myself, was almost physically painful.It was after my fifth miscarriage, in mid-2019, and with one embryo left in the freezer, that my doctor suggested surrogacy. I felt so many conflicting emotions – hope that it might work, sadness that I was giving up on my body, and relief that the entire responsibility of a pregnancy’s success wouldn’t be on my shoulders.In Canada, where I live, surrogacy is altruistic, although, as in the UK, expenses are paid. We went through an agency, and when I saw Trish’s photo I felt an incredible connection.The fact that she lived in New Brunswick, an 18-hour drive away from us in Ontario, didn’t faze us. We developed a deep bond after spending five days together for her medical clearance tests.Then, in August 2021, I became inexplicably angry with Alex. Aware that pregnancy and PMS felt the same to me, I stomped off to take a test.People assume they’re twins – I explain that, no, they’re ‘twiblings’Seeing the second line appear, I thought: “Oh my God.” Trish was due to start her fertility medication two weeks later. I assumed that this meant I’d be going through a miscarriage at what should be a happy time. There was no joy or hope that my pregnancy would stick, just devastation at the inevitability of it ending.When we told Trish, her response was immediate and amazing. Of course she wanted to go ahead, she said, whatever happened with my pregnancy. Watching our embryo being transferred two months later was incredibly emotional. I couldn’t believe what this amazing woman was doing for us. When we heard the pregnancy test was positive, we were all in tears.We told our thrilled family and friends about Trish when she was seven weeks pregnant, but I couldn’t bring myself to share my news until I reached 17 weeks. Even then I was terrified, although seeing their shocked joy was lovely.Trish was seven weeks away from her due date when I gave birth to Wilkin in April 2022. Holding my beautiful son was both amazing and surreal. I felt a wave of relief, like I finally knew everything was going to be OK.Unfortunately, Wilkin’s severe colic made an 18-hour drive impossible, and the pandemic made flying tricky, so I waited at home while my sister went with Alex to be at Trish’s delivery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We only had €10 [£8.70] in cash but some people gave us a bit of money so we could get on a bus,” he says.“If the same were to happen in Newcastle, even without physical cash there’s no language barrier so I think it’d be fine.

It’s about control as I don’t want to be too reliant on my phone. I remember when you used to have to ask people if they take cards, but now you need to ask if they take cash.

I’m totally delighted for him, and am enjoying the new dimension of our relationship, in which we discuss compost and seed sowing over WhatsApp, and he sends me photographs of the “lotty”. It reminds me of when someone has a newborn – you get to marvel at the progress with none of the hard work.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Recently he texted me a screen grab from my Instagram stories, of a photo of my old garden. “What is this plant? There’s loads on the abandoned plot next to mine.” Sedum, I replied. Well, hylotelephium, technically.Some sedum varieties were reclassified in 1977, long before I existed, let alone started gardening, yet I still know them as sedums.Hylotelephium spectabilerefers to the herbaceous, bushy variety that offers so much bang for its buck in borders, dry gardens and pots – a rare plant to do all three so well – for months on end. Particularly good at this time of year isH. herbstfreude(the name translates as “autumn joy”).It thrives in borders, dry gardens and pots – a rare plant to do all three so well – for months on endI still remember picking one up for my first balcony garden about this time of year, not knowing what it was or what to do with it, but being happily astonished when tight green leaves started to appear at its crown at the start of spring. Before then, you have a mass of colour that is both brilliant and somehow subtle: rich pigments of deep pinks and reds, perfect for autumn days and beloved by bees, which fades into structural umbellifers that dry nicely for vases. Most of the ones in my old garden were divisions of one my mother had in our childhood garden, which now also proliferate in her small townhouse garden and my sister’s patch not far from me (I’ll be taking a division for my new garden when the time is right.)But I also had the softer-huedH. telephium subsp. ruprechtii‘Pink Dome’, which I fell for in Beth Chatto’s nursery (its gravel garden demonstrates just how drought-tolerant sedums can be), which blends maroon foliage with palest pink flowers. Chatto says sedums are “peacemakers”, offering “interest for almost every month of the year” while showier specimens throw a strop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But in truth you have to try pretty hard to kill one: they thrive on dry, poor soil, and do better with some sunshine. A “Chelsea chop” – cutting back the stems by a third or ven a half in late May or early June – can prolong flowering, but you’ll still get a good showing until October or even later without.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”In Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 thatGen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military ruleduring which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.But on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.Yucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”Also at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expertBruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillipsduring Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”Beto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”Those festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.Describing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.Jail for Bolsonaro by no means signals the end of his political movementRead moreAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.Trump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”At the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”A carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Are you going to cancel the game?” the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraes’s home in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.“Abort,” replied “Germany”, according to a federal police report.The cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this week’s historic trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursdaysentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coupafter he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.“[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,” said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.View image in fullscreenJair Bolsonaro’s supporters at a protest this month.Photograph: Luis Nova/APMoraes said hitmen had planned to “neutralise” him using “extremely powerful weapons” capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.“I’m someone who should be really thankful to be alive,” Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.Bolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims “a little story”.But Moraes said there was “ample evidence” indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.Police investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a “clandestine operation” with “terrorist hallmarks” was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called Mário Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaro’s administration.“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government … at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,” Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaro’s trial reached its conclusion.View image in fullscreenAlexandre de Moraes and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said he was ‘someone who should be really thankful to be alive’.Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters“The planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,” added Moraes.A copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “These are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,” the police report says.According to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed – and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaro’s coup plot.Brazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.Jail for Bolsonaro by no means signals the end of his political movementRead moreThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.Pedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was “shocking, but not so surprising”. The historian, who studies Brazil’s brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a “necessary and legitimate response” to a supposed communist threat.Quick GuideBrazil's dictatorship 1964-1985ShowHow did it begin?Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.What happened during the dictatorship?Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”.It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay.But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.How did it end?Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“And this is particularly true in the case of the special forces,” he said, referring to the army group to which the men accused of plotting to kill Moraes, Lula and Alckmin belonged.Police believe the men involved in the Moraes murder plot were special forces operatives known as the “kids pretos” or “black cap boys” because of the black caps they wore. Pedretti said the group, set up during the cold war, still maintained the same “enemy elimination mindset”.“In Bolsonaro’s attempted coup, spearheaded by him and his generals, they simply put that logic and the expertise of the ‘kids pretos’ at the service of the coup-mongering political project,” Pedretti said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A majority of Brazil’s supreme court judges found the 70-year-old guilty on Thursday of masterminding a failed military coup designed to stop the leftwing winner of the 2022 election,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office.“Nowhere in the world … has complete immunity against the virus of authoritarianism that creeps in insidiously, distilling its poison to contaminate freedoms and human rights,” Justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha told a courtroom in the capital, Brasília, as she cast the deciding vote.Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. Seven co-conspirators were also convicted, including the former head of the navy, Adm Almir Garnier Santos, three four-star army generals, and the former head of Brazil’s answer to MI6.The historic verdict – the first time a former Brazilian presidenthas been found guilty of trying to overthrow the country’s democracy– appears to have extinguished Bolsonaro’s hopes of one day reclaiming the presidency of South America’s largest democracy.But experts and politicians from across the spectrum agree the former paratrooper’s political movement, Bolsonarismo, will continue to thrive despite the incarceration of its creator.Bolsonaro received more than 58m votes in the 2022 electionand, despite his conviction, remains wildly popular with certain sectors of society, including the fast growing evangelical community, in Brazil’s agricultural heartlands and among members of the security forces and well-educated middle-class conservatives who loathe the left. Pro-Bolsonaro protestsstill draw tens of thousands of citizens on to the streets.“It might be the end of Bolsonaro but it is not the end of Bolsonarismo … Bolsonarismo will live on with or without Bolsonaro,” predicted Thaís Oyama, a columnist for O Globo newspaper and the author of a book about the former president.Guilherme Boulos, a leading leftwing congress member, said Bolsonaro’s downfall was an undeniable blow to the Brazilian right ahead of next year’s presidential election in which Lula will seek a fourth term.But would it snuff out Bolsonaro’s movement?“No,” Boulos replied emphatically during an interview in his congressional office overlooking some of the buildings vandalised by Bolsonaro supporters duringtheir January 2023 rampage through Brasília. “The far right – in Brazil and around the world – has built a solid social base which goes well beyond the figure of Bolsonaro.“Bolsonaro is the leader of this movement in Brazil. But to claim his imprisonment will put an end to a certain kind of fascism of the masses that has been built on the defence of authoritarian,prejudiced, intolerant, xenophobic ideas, wouldn’t be true. That wouldn’t be reading the Brazilian reality as it is.”Boulos, 43, is widely viewed as an heir to the 79-year-old Lula.Bolsonaro is unlikely to be taken into custody for several weeks. It is unclear whether he will be sent to a regular prison or be jailed in a police or military installation.Already, though, minds are turning to which politician will inherit his votes in next year’s presidential election. Contenders include his senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, and the former first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, a charismatic born-again Christian popular with evangelical voters and conservative women.“People were electrified when Michelle came out to speak [at a recent rally in São Paulo]. She’s already a political celebrity,” said Camila Rocha, a political scientist who studies Brazil’s new right. “I’d say Michelle could turn out to be an Evita Perón of the Brazilian extreme right. She has the potential.”Others believe the smart money is onSão Paulo’s rightwing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, a former army captain who was infrastructure minister in Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. On the eve of this week’s verdict, Freitas lashed out at the judicial “tyranny” of the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes – a move clearly designed to appeal to orphaned Bolsonaro voters seeking a new leader.Oyama said that by radicalising his rhetoric, Freitas was trying to seduce those orphans and stop the right fragmenting after Bolsonaro’s incarceration, with hardcore Bolsonaristas siding with one of his relatives or another populist successor, and members of the conservative establishment backing another, less radical name. “Lula will without doubt win re-election if the right splits,” she predicted.Whoever emerges as Bolsonaro’s successor, Boulos expects next year’s election to be a gruelling battle for the left against a rightwing movement he believes will receive support from Donald Trump and US big-tech firms.Trump unsuccessfully tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, claiming the prosecution was “a political execution” and a “witch hunt” designed to destroy his ally’s career.In the lead-up to this week’s judgement, Trump hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and sanctioned Moraes. Asked about the situation in Brazil on Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters Trump was “unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world”.Boulos believes US pressure will continue in the lead-up to the 2026 vote, even with Bolsonaro behind bars. “We’re talking about the richest companies on the planet,the planet’s biggest billionaires, and the president of the most powerful nation on earth taking direct action in Brazil to favour the extreme right,” he said. “It’s going to be war.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Did they have, I don’t know, a chip? Did they have a QR code and [the US military] read it from above in the dark?” Cabello said.The Venezuelan government said after the incident that a video post by Trump of the strike was artificial intelligence.US national security officials acknowledged during a closed briefing this week on Capitol Hill that the boat was fired on multiple times by the US military after it had changed course, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.The emerging details came as several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, indicated dissatisfaction with the administration’s rationale and questioned the legality of the action. They view it as a potential overreach of executive authority in part by using themilitary for law enforcement purposes.In a letter to the White House, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and two dozen other Democratic senators said the Trump administration has provided “no legitimate legal justification” for the strike.“Our armed forces are not law enforcement agencies,” said Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech this week. “They are not empowered to hunt down suspected criminals and kill them without trial,” Reed said.Reed said in his speech that the administration has offered “no proof that this vessel was engaged in an attack, or even that it was engaged in drug trafficking at the time.” He also said the administration has provided “no positive identification that the boat was Venezuelan, nor that its crew were members of Tren de Aragua or any other cartel.”Republican Senator Rand Raul has said it was unlikely the boat was headed to US shores, which would be a lengthy trip for such a vessel.Paul – a libertarian-leaning Republican with a long history of challenging executive overreach, particularly in national security matters – has argued the US cannot simply kill people suspected of wrongdoing without due process.In response, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said “These were evil Tren de Aragua narco-terrorists trying to bring illegal drugs into our country and kill Americans” and that the “president acted in line with the laws of armed conflict”.Kelly also said Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of Venezuela and that he was a “fugitive”.The Pentagon added that drug cartels will find “no safe harbor.”“This strike sent a clear message: If you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our disposal to stop you cold,“ chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said.The Trump administration has ratcheted up the US military presence in the southern Caribbean as part of what it says is a crackdown on drug smugglers, and ordered the deployment of 10 F-35 fighter jets to a Puerto Rico airfield.Maduro said early on Thursday his country would deploy military, police and civilian defenses at 284 “battlefront” locations across the country, his latest show of military capacity.“We’re ready for an armed fight, if it’s necessary,” Maduro said from Ciudad Caribia, on the country’s central coast, in a broadcast on state television flanked by his defense minister.“Along all the Venezuelan coasts, from the border with Colombia to the east of the country, from north to south and east to west, we have a full preparation of official troops,” he said.Reuters witnesses in several cities around Venezuela did not note an increase in troop presence.The US last month doubled its reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro to $50m over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.Maduro has always denied the accusations and his government says Venezuela is not a drug producer.With Reuters and Associated PressQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The study covered developments since 2014.North Korea’s Geneva diplomatic mission and its London embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said in response to UN rights investigators that it rejected a UN human rights council resolution authorising the latest report.Sometimes children are made to work in forced labour, including “shock brigades” for tough sectors such as coal mining and construction, Heenan said from Seoul.“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t bribe their way out of it, and these shock brigades are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.The report also found some limited improvements, such as reduced use of violence by guards in detention facilities, and new laws that appear to strengthen fair trial guarantees.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Most wore face masks and carried only small bags; many looking worn out but bearing the weary relief of people whose ordeal had finally ended.Addressing reporters, the presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, said he had come to offer words of encouragement. “We did our best, but I’m sorry we couldn’t bring them back to their homeland sooner,” he said.View image in fullscreenSouth Korean workers freed after days of detention in the US arrive at Incheon.Photograph: AP“We’re in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,” Kang said. “The standard changes every time and constantly there has to be deal-making, not only on tariffs, but it’ll also be the case with security issues.”The workers had been building a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) battery plant, which is crucial to Hyundai’s electric vehicle ambitions in the US. Most were employed by LG Energy Solution or its subcontractors.The detention stemmed from workers using B1 business visas and the 90-day visa waiver programme (Esta) for what US authorities deemed actual employment rather than permitted activities such as meetings or training.Korean companies have long relied on this “grey zone” because the official H-1B work visas take months to obtain and South Korea lacks the dedicated quota allocations that other US trade partners enjoy. Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice.The South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, delivered his sharpest warning yet to Washington on Thursday, stating that Korean businesses would “hesitate to make direct investments” if the US failed to resolve visa issues quickly.View image in fullscreenA television at Incheon airport on Friday, showing South Korean detainees lined up against a bus after the raid by US federal agents.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty“Korean businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious bewilderment,” he said. “This isn’t long-term permanent employment, but to establish facilities and equipment for factories; we need technicians to install machinery and equipment. The US doesn’t have such personnel, and they won’t give visas for [our workers] to stay and work.”The workers’departure from Georgia was delayed by a dayafter President Donald Trump offered to let them stay and train Americans, but only one person chose to remain.South Korea’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, flew to the US to meet his counterpart, Marco Rubio,securing assurancesthat workers would not be restrained while being transported.Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees in limbo after deportation from USRead moreThe concession addressed a particularly sensitive grievance after ICE’s release of video footage showing Korean workers being led away in chains, evoking historical experiences of subjugation by foreign powers.The episode has generated unprecedented public anger. Asurvey by the local broadcaster MBCfound 68% of respondents believed the US government “did not show consideration for South Korea as an ally” in handling the situation.Korean media responses were scathing across the political spectrum. Seoul Economic Daily described workers beingtreated like “prisoners of war”; the conservative Chosun Ilbocalled it a “merciless arrest operation”representing a “breach of trust”; whilethe progressive Hankyoreh asked: “Is this what you do to an ally?” and described Koreans feeling “backstabbed” after Lee’s recentmeeting with Trump.At the airport, a 75-year-old protester, Hong Jung-sik, reflected a nation’s anger when he said the detention of fellow citizens had left him feeling betrayed. “Trump, who do you think you are?” he shouted, describing the episode as a “national humiliation” and “evil behaviour”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)South KoreaAsia PacificUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The hardest hit areas included Makinohara and Yoshida, where vehicles were overturned and more than 1,200 structures were damaged. Since records began in 1961, Japan has experienced 13 level 3 tornadoes, but none have reached level 4.The tornado occurred as a result of unstable conditions from Tropical Storm Peipah, which made landfall in Japan’s Kōchi prefecture on the same day, striking near the city of Sukomo. The storm unleashed torrential rain and powerful winds, causing damage across the region. Peipah injured 24 people, damaged or destroyed more than 40 homes and knocked out power to nearly 14,000 residents.Before the storm, authorities issued evacuation orders affecting more than 600,000 residents, urging caution against flooding and landslides. Shimokitayama, a village in Nara prefecture, recorded 80mm of rain in one hour, while in the city of Kumano 63mm of ran fell within the same timeframe.View image in fullscreenHurricane Kiko gathers steam north of Hawaii.Photograph: APMeanwhile,Hurricane Kiko, once a powerful category 4 hurricane in the eastern Pacific, weakened to a tropical storm as it skirted past Hawaii this week. Kiko, which formed on 31 August, had sustained wind speeds of 110mph on Sunday as it dropped to category 2 strength. By Tuesday, the system was officially downgraded to tropical storm status.Kiko veered north of the Hawaiian islands and by Wednesday its remnants hovered near the northern tip of Kaua’i, with sustained winds falling by about 40mph as the storm continued to lose strength. Kiko’s presence is still being felt across the state, though, with forecasters predicting large storm swells, locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds and dangerous rip currents. These hazardous conditions still pose serious risks to surfers and beachgoers alike.Explore more on these topicsJapanWeather trackerTornadoesAsia PacificExtreme weatherHawaiinewsShareReuse this content"

Some groups advocate against trans rights, with one that calls for “an immediate cease to radical gender theory… being taught in the school system”.The division exposed by the March for Australia was a test for our politicians. They failed it – and put the nation last | Zoe DanielRead moreIndigenous and Palestinian activist groups have planned a separate National Day of Action against racism and fascism, in many of the same cities, which they say is in response to neo-Nazis allegedly raiding an Indigenous camp, Camp Sovereignty, inMelbourneon 31 August.“This attack was not just on a camp - it was an attack on Aboriginal sovereignty, on the fight for justice, and on every community that stands against racism and fascism in this country,” said the organisers.Organisers of both rallies say they will be peaceful.The Uniting Australians rally has said on its website that “Neo-Nazis are not welcome – no racism or any acts of hate or violence will be tolerated in any capacity.”However, police inVictoriaanticipate troublemakers among far-left and far-right groups may use the protests as an excuse to pick a fight.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailViolent brawls broke out between anti-immigration protesters and anti-fascism groups at protests in August in Melbourne, which led to police deploying pepper spray to separate demonstrators.A group of men dressed in black had clashed with people at Camp Sovereignty in King’s Domain on 31 August, after the anti-immigration March for Australia rally in the city.The camp is a burial site with the remains of Indigenous people from 38 clans. It was first created in 2006 to coincide with the Commonwealth Games and re-established in 2024.Ten men, some with links to neo-Nazi groups, have been arrested and charged in relation to the alleged assaults and affray.Victoria police said among the four groups set to turn out, those with far-right and extreme ideologies, as well as far-left and opposing views, would seek conflict and confront each other.They could not discount the chance neo-Nazis would again take to the streets while a leader in the group remains behind bars.The Victorian attorney general, Sonya Kilkenny, said the government supported peaceful protest but rebuked any protesters who planned to engage in harm and violence.“Do not ever use the cloak of protest to go out there and cause crime,” she said.“There is no place for protests that spread harm, that spread hate, that spread fear and violence, and there is certainly no place in Victoria for neo-Nazis.”Rallies will also occur inSydney, Hobart, Canberra and Brisbane but their state police forces have not warned of similar clashes.Officers deployed in Melbourne will have extra powers to search people for weapons and can direct people to remove face coverings.Mary-Joan Liddicoat and Michael Simms, two of the organisers of the Australia Unites rally, said they expected between 5,000 and 20,000 people to attend in Sydney and that the route had been coordinated by police so as not to cross paths with the Indigenous march.Liddicoat and Simms said they had also spoken with organisers of the Sydney Indigenous march to make clear their peaceful intentions.Organisers of the Sydney Indigenous march said they had concerns about a counter-protest being organised in Hyde Park. Liddicoat and Simms said they had also heard of this planned this counter-protest, but it was being organised by another group, unaffiliated with them.Explore more on these topicsProtestMelbourneSydneyVictoriaNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t want to let this major international opportunity slip us by.”Choosing a Cop host requires consensus of the members of the group of nations whose turn it is to stage the event, which draws together world leaders, diplomats, NGOs and industry lobbyists for a fortnight of climate negotiations.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGovernment sources said Australia has the backing of as many as 25 of the 29 countries in its Western European and Others group, which includes Turkey.But even though Australia has overwhelming support, unless the rival bidder withdraws the hosting rights would automatically revert to Bonn, Germany, under Cop conventions.The deadlock must be resolved before Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, wraps up in late November.Senior government sources, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, believe the prospect of Australia missing out is a genuine possibility amid dwindling hopes that Turkey will relent, even though it does not have the international support to win in its own right.They confirmed that one of the main reasons Turkey was fighting so hard was Erdoğan’s wife, Emine Erdoğan, who is an outspoken environmentalist.Turkey is adamant its time has come to host the annual eventafter withdrawing from the race to host Cop26, which ultimately went to Glasgow.Albanese pointed to that second factor this week as he conceded it would be an “unfortunate outcome” if Australia’s bid was unsuccessful.The federal government has been privately arguing that Turkey withdrawing this time was different to the Cop26 race because rather than clearing the path for a large western nation – in that case the UK – it would be giving a global platform to Pacific nations on the frontline of the climate crisis.If the bid fails, the federal government will move to quickly reassure Pacific nations about its ongoing commitment to climate action, including with the 2035 emissions reduction target it plans to unveil next week before Albanese travels to New York.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The nowKeir Starmer-led Labour governmenthas since publicly backed Australia’s bid.Richie Merzian, a former Australian climate negotiator, said the Albanese government would need to “sweeten the deal” to encourage Turkey to step aside.“It’s unclear what the Turkish government actually want,” Merzian, who is now the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, said. “But it could be supporting Turkey at other UN events and for other UN positions, support for Turkish aid projects or for trade deals that might not even involve Australia.”Government sources confirmed there would be no financial deal with Turkey but would not be drawn on other types of offers that might be put forward.Guardian Australia understands the idea of splitting some of the preliminary Cop event between Turkey and the Pacific was floated at one stage as a possible compromise.Merzian expected the deadlock would be broken at the Belém conference.“Much like litigation, it will probably settle before it gets to the plenary floor (for a vote at Cop30). You need everyone to meet at Cop30, at Brazil, to nut this out.”The Turkish embassy in Canberra was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsCop31Australian politicsAnthony AlbaneseRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

This is impossible. I always wear my seatbelt,” Isabel recalled.On viewing the picture a detection camera had snapped of her, she realised that she had in fact been fined for wearing it incorrectly – she’s only 157cm and often puts the seatbelt under her arm so it doesn’t irritate her neck.“I have since learned that is an offence,” Isabel said.She is among tens of thousands of people inNew South Waleswho have been fined since July 2024, when the state government significantly expanded its ability to peer into cars to detect if someone was wearing their seatbelt correctly.In 2024-25, the first year of the new technology being rolled out, revenue raised via seatbelt fines rose by 1,400% – to almost $59m from 132,698 penalties.Australians are obsessed with SUVs and huge utes, but experts say they are making our roads deadlierRead moreIn the previous financial year, before the cameras were active, $3.7m was raised from 9,529 penalties.The government says the money raised from the fines – which are more than $400 each and come with three demerit points – is invested back into road safety.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOut of the 140m cars scanned in 2024-25, most people were found to be doing the right thing. Only 0.09% of drivers or passengers were found to have committed a seatbelt offence.The vast majority – 88% – of that small portion of offenders were wearing their seatbelts, but incorrectly.However, people appear to be learning their lesson, with offences down 60% in July 2025 compared with July 2024, when the cameras were first introduced.The suspect images of drivers and passengers are flagged by artificial intelligence, and the photos are then reviewed by Revenue NSW staff before any fine is issued.Isabel requested a review of her three fines, given the camera had snapped her again before she had a chance to receive her first fine and learn her lesson. She was forgiven the last two notices.“I went to Supercheap Auto and I got my bejewelled seatbelt cover, so I can wear it properly and it doesn’t irritate my neck,” she said. “I never understood why people had seatbelt covers, but now I do. So, lesson learned.”Kris Savic recently applied to get his fine reviewed after he was caught wearing his seatbelt under his arm. He explained in his application that he’d had surgery on his chest and could seek a medical certificate if necessary.But he was denied – for not providing a medical certificate.“I actually didn’t realise it was against the law to wear it like that,” Savic said. “I get now it’s wrong, but also it’s different getting caught by a police officer and being able to explain and show I have stitches, it might have helped me get a warning.”Governments are increasingly using AI technology to catch people committing road offences. As of July 2025, AI-powered surveillance cameras which can detect when drivers are holding or using mobile phones were also rolled out across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s unclear how many involved seatbelt non-usage.Peter Khoury, a spokesperson for NRMA, said there was a benefit to using AI technology for road safety but “the tip of the spear always has to be police”.“We still think the most effective way to change bad behaviour is by having more police on the roads all the time [in] clearly marked, visible, highway patrols.”When asked about potential downsides to AI technology, Khoury said: “We always encourage government to ensure that privacy isn’t breached.”Camilla Pandolfini, the chief executive of the Redfern Legal Centre, said she had concerns about “any kind of automation around issuing fines and picking up offences”.“People can have perfectly legitimate explanations, but disadvantaged people in particular might not think to challenge the fine or access legal assistance,” she said.The NSW roads minister, Jenny Aitchison, said the seatbelt cameras were introduced to encourage people to buckle up.“Well over 99% of motorists [were] found to be doing the right thing,” she said on Friday.“Police have an incredibly important role to play in keeping NSW roads safe, however, they cannot physically check more than 100m vehicles for seatbelt offences in one year.“Our cameras check every vehicle that passes under them, effectively checking every vehicle on NSW roads about 20 times a year.“Whenever enforcement is increased, such as it has been with the rollout of our camera program, it is to be expected that more penalties will be issued initially and then decrease over time as people get the message. Our data shows that this is happening.”Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyNew South WalesAustralian police and policingArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

It started with Trump’s alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book,” shared by the Democrats on social media on Monday and leading to the discovery of a name not widely recognised in the US but of intense interest in the UK –Peter Mandelson. The British ambassador to the US had proffered an undiplomatically warm birthday message to the late child sex offender financier, starting a press scramble that ended, on Thursday, with Keir Starmer firing him.That was just the beginning. As Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Nato jets, forecasts of a third world war gained pace and in the US, Charlie Kirk, a rightwing political activist, was assassinated in front of a crowd in Utah. Another firing followed: at MSNBC, the analyst Matthew Dowd was swiftly booted for suggesting that Kirk, who had a history of making racist and sexist remarks, had learned the hard way that, “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”. On the Christian right, meanwhile, Kirk instantly rose to the status of an American martyr.If it was a week in which America looked, once again, like an increasingly dysfunctional and unhappy place and Europe slid towards darker days, it was left to Australia to cheer us, which it did with – what else? – the discovery of a new marsupial: a tiny, previously unknown relative of the kangaroo, a sort of mouse-wallaby hybrid species of “bettong”, identified by its fossil remains because, in keeping with the general state of the world and because we can’t have nice things, it turns out it is already extinct.TuesdayAlso extinct (almost): that species of lovable eccentric billionaire who stays out of politics and spends his cash on decommissioned Soviet fighter jets and a luxury car collection. In other words, Larry Ellison, the 90s playboy and founder of Oracle with the lustrous, tan-coloured mane to make Elon Musk weep. At the turn of the millennium Ellison was the world’s richest man, long since eclipsed by the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos, but like all things from the 90s he’s back with a vengeance and this week, after Oracle’s stock price soared, once again took the top spot.Per the business pages, Oracle’s shares soared owing to a “rosy outlook for [the company’s] cloud infrastructure business and AI deals”. I’m more interested in revisiting the greatest hits of a billionaire whose biographer, Mike Wilson, once described as “a one-man amusement park, Larryland.” To wit: Ellison flying his Marchetti S.211 fighter plane in mock dog fights over the Pacific with his son, David; winning the Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 with a young Lachlan Murdoch onboard; and my favourite Ellison flourish, what was said to be his favourite chat-up line of the 90s – “Can I buy you a car?”View image in fullscreen‘This job would be fantastic if it was like this all the time.’Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAWednesdayMore news from Australia that is almost as charming as a marsupial: Russell Crowe (I know, he’s originally from New Zealand), gussied up in a Nazi uniform and gone the full Brando in the trailer for Nuremberg. Crowe plays Hermann Göring, who at the time of his capture apparently weighed 280 pounds and was described by an allied soldier who witnessed it as a “huge bulk”, an acting challenge to which Crowe appears to have magnificently risen. The forthcoming movie co-stars Rami Malek, Michael Shannon and Leo Woodall, but clearly this is Rusty’s picture. His German accent – “I vill have, as you say, my day I court” – is worth the ticket price alone and appears to be a combo of ‘Allo ‘Allo!’s Gestapo corps and, as Crowe once said of his accent in Gladiator, “Royal Shakespeare Company three pints after lunch.” Bravo!ThursdayThe huge bulk of Emily’s saggy old cat, Bagpuss, is coming back in a new film to make gen X cry. For those not born in the 20th century, Bagpuss was an old cloth cat with pink stripes and piercing blue eyes, who lived in a shop for lost and found items with his friends Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the doll and the mice on the mouse organ (“Heave! Heave!). News of the reboot this week sent me straight to YouTube to watch the opening sequence of Oliver Postgate’s TV show, broadcast in the mid- to late-70s on repeat and almost unbearably poignant, not least because it’s narrated in an accent that no longer exists.Bagpuss (“The most important, the most beautiful, the most magical, saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world”) is embedded in the earliest TV memories of those of us who were kids at the time and, having a moment at my screen, I called over my 10-year-old to share in the magic. She watched for 20 seconds, said, “Boring!”, patted me sympathetically on the arm and walked off. “Baggy and a bit loose at the seams,” I murmured in unison with Postgate, “but Emily loved him.”FridayPrince Harry met the king in London this week after an apparent estrangement of 19 months and, according to those monitoring the arrival and departure of the prince’s car, the audience lasted 54 minutes. But that’s a generous interpretation of the actual face time involved in the “private tea”, which, allowing for entrance and egress through Clarence House, settling in and waiting time, surely came out closer to half an hour. Did Harry whip out his phone and show his father photos of the two grandchildren he’s spent almost no time with? Did the king ask about Meghan? Was it all about money? Was there ever a more pitiful sight than, generation after generation, the royal family’s cold and strained filial relations?Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

But then I grew up to learn through military service the impact and responsibility that comes with service. It’s the purpose of serving others that has saved me.”View image in fullscreenPrince Harry embraces Oksana Ilnytska, whose husband, Serhii Ilnytskyi, the team captain at the Invictus Games in Sydney 2018, was killed in 2023.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHarry said he had come to Kyiv to show his support for the country and all the veterans who were now recovering and rehabilitating from their injuries.“We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.“We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”Earlier this year it was estimated that theUkrainewar had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry lays flowers in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, where a missile strike in June killed more than 20 people.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and chief executive of the Superhumans trauma centre in Lviv, which treats wounded amputees. He visited the centre in April, but met Rudnieva by chance a couple of months ago in the US.“I bumped into Olga in New York,” he said. “It was a chance meeting and I asked her what I could do to help. She said: ‘The biggest impact you could have is coming to Kyiv.’ I had to check with my wife and the British government to make sure it was OK. Then the official invitation came.“In Lviv, you don’t see much of the war. It is so far west. This is the first time we will see the real destruction of the war.”The prince has toured Kyivsince arriving this morning, meeting veterans and visiting areas bombed by Russian drones and missiles.In the afternoon, he laid a wreath at a flower and flag memorial to the war dead that has sprung up, and continues to grow, in Kyiv’s Maidan Square.One of those waiting to meet the prince was the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarína Mathernová, whose embassy was bombed last month.View image in fullscreenHarry holds a division flag given him by a war veteran at Kyiv’s National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMathernová said the prince had become very popular in Ukraine, despite having visited the country only once before. “I think he is associated with veterans and the Invictus Games,” she said. “It’s not easy to come here during the war. People appreciate the personal time he has taken and the attention it brings.”Ukraine first took part in the Invictus Games in 2017, but Ukrainians’ enthusiasm for the competition, which was founded by the prince in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events, has grown dramatically since the conflict with Russia began.Harry remembered the reception Ukraine’s team received at the games in The Hague two years ago.“It was remarkable. Every one of the participants had a journey to get to those games, but nobody from any of the other competing nations was going back to war. That is why the Ukrainians stood out.“Everyone felt an immense connection to them. Some of the competitors were being pulled off the battlefield and were going back to the battlefield.“It means so much to us, because it means so much to them,” he said.View image in fullscreenPrince Harry on the train from Poland to Kyiv. Ukraine.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDuring the trip, the prince was due to visit the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War. He was also due to meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko.Travelling to Kyiv would give him the chance to see some of the destruction first-hand, he said.While the biennial Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work, it has been increasing its sports recovery programmes to help provide opportunities for rehabilitation beyond the main games, including by providing sports equipment in Ukraine.Natalia Kalmykova, Ukraine’s minister for veterans affairs, said sport had become a key function in veterans’ healthcare.“It’s thanks to our relationship with the Invictus Games Foundation that we established, and continue to develop, the role of sports in recovery in Ukraine and why it’s included in the veteran policy strategy,” she added.Explore more on these topicsUkrainePrince HarryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Only three or four were said to have be shot down and one drone flew 160 miles into the country, forcing the closure of four airports.At the time, Donald Trump said the incursion “could have been an mistake”, but he added: “Regardless, I’m not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation.”Polish leaders were more certain. Donald Tusk, the country’s prime minister, posted on social media in English: “We would also wish that the drone attack onPolandwas a mistake. But it wasn’t. And we know it.”Rutte, however, remained on the fence. He said on Friday that Nato’s “assessment of the incidents on Wednesday is ongoing”, though he stressed that “whether or not Russia’s actions were deliberate, Russia violated Nato airspace”, necessitating a response.“Russia’s recklessness in the air along our eastern flank is increasing in frequency,” Rutte added. “We have seen drones violate our airspace in Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – whether intentional or not, it is dangerous and unacceptable.”Standing alongside him was Nato’s most senior military chief, Gen Alexus Grynkewich, who said Nato engaged in “a highly successful operation” intercepting the drones with F-35 fighters from the Netherlands – but added: “We always learn something in the debrief.”Drones in Poland are another unsettling post-Alaska escalation by RussiaRead moreThe American commander suggested it was the number of Russian drones that raised questions. The “scale of the incursion” was “obviously larger than previous incursions that we’ve had” and that “bringing additional resources to bear on this problem will help solve that”.Denmark will contribute two F-16 jets and an anti-air warfare frigate to the effort, France three Rafale figthers andGermanyfour Typhoons. Nato military planners said the UK “has also expressed its willingness to support” the effort.On Wednesday, the UK defence secretary, John Healey, said he had asked the British military to look at options for enhanced support for Poland amid hints from officials that the deployment of up to six Typhoons was under consideration.Russia, meanwhile, said that peace talks had stalled. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “Our negotiators have the opportunity to communicate through channels. But for now, it is probably more accurate to talk about a pause.”In Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no sign that Russia’s ambitions to dominate its neighbour had changed.“Putin’s goal is to occupy all ofUkraine. And no matter what he tells anyone, it is clear that he has set the war machine in motion to such an extent that he simply cannot stop it unless he is forced to fundamentally change his personal goals.”The Ukrainian leader also welcomed Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Kyiv and said he was willing to offer him citizenship because Russia does not bomb the capital when he is visiting. Some believe this follows direct requests made by the White House to the Kremlin.“When Keith Kellogg is in Kyiv, the residents of Kyiv can sleep soundly. Thank you. I would like you to visit all cities in Ukraine,” Zelensky said. “I am ready to grant Gen Kellogg citizenship. We can give him an apartment – anything he needs, if it will prompt Russia to cease fire.”Yvette Cooper, the UK foreign secretary, was also in Kyiv on Friday, her first foreign trip since she was appointed last week during a cabinet reshuffle. Cooper said her visit, which was accompanied by an announcement of a new package of British sanctions on Russia, was intended to reiterate British support for Kyiv.“The UK will not stand idly by as Putin continues his barbaric invasion of Ukraine,” she said. “International action to increase economic pressure on Russia and to cut off critical cash flows which he desperately needs to pay for this illegal war is vital.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineNatoRussiaGermanyFranceDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After countless complaints from residents, exasperated by the thick layer of guano covering the building’s interior and the public areas below – not to mention the parked cars – local authoritiesissued an order banning her from feeding the pigeons.Reached by intercom bythe local news site Roma Today, the woman replied: “I’m an animal rights activist with the Italian League for Bird Protection – a major environmental organisation in Italy dedicated to wildlife conservation. I rescue animals in distress; I don’t feed them for a hobby. I rescue pigeons and other animals like cats and dogs,” she said. “I put out the food in order to save them. Obviously, if I put food out for one pigeon, others were bound to come. But there have been so many lies, slanders and threats against me.”Asked about the filth caused by the birds’ droppings, she added: “I’ll fix it – for myself, for the people living here, and for the poor pigeons who are the real victims. In the meantime, I’ve stopped putting out feed; I hope they’ll go away. They get run over here.”Neighbours have repeatedly filmed the woman allegedly feeding the birds, placing food on the ledge of her window – “the lady doesn’t care at all about our discomfort,” one residenttold the popular programme La Vita in Diretta on the national broadcaster Rai. “She keeps feeding them seeds, bits of ham and chicken, making our lives hell.”Another neighbour told Rai that the pigeons “keep breeding and laying eggs”, while others described to Roma Today howthe street was “entirely covered in guano”, the pavements “impassable and the stench nauseating”, cars “systematically soiled” and balconies abandoned. Every attempt to persuade her to stop failed despite a municipal bylaw explicitly forbidding the systematic feeding of pigeons anywhere in Rome.One woman told the news site FanPage: “We are prisoners in our own homes, hostages to a ridiculous situation that has made daily life unbearable. After years of putting up with this and trying to talk, we can’t take it anymore.”Rocco Ferraro, a city councillor and environment delegate for Rome’s metropolitan area, said the droppings and the birds’ presence had “devalued the homes and made them difficult to sell”.While Rome’s city government said there was “no direct evidence yet of health problems”, it did warn of the potential risk.The mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, has therefore ordered “a ban on feeding pigeons and other wild birds, explicitly forbidding the throwing of feed or food scraps on the ground”. In addition, residents of the third-floor flat must, “at their own expense, within 10 days of receiving the order, carry out cleaning, sanitation, pest control and disinfection of the affected areas, restoring appropriate hygiene, safety and health conditions”.After an alleged complaint from a man who claimed the woman had continued feeding the pigeons despite the mayor’s order, a municipal police patrol was dispatched to the site. But according to media reports, since Thursday no one had actually seen her feeding the birds.In case of non-compliance, the authorities of Rome’s VII municipality have been instructed to “prepare an intervention plan for the forced execution of the order, using law enforcement if necessary”.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeBirdsWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

A motion by Sabeti’s lawyers to dismiss the case for breaching the statute of limitations was rejected by district court judge Gregory Presnell of the central district of Florida on 12 August. A trial could take place early next year.According to the lawsuit, Sabeti “has spent the last four decades out of the public eye, concealing his whereabouts and identity”. He and his wife, Nasrin, 75, might even have remained incognito had he not been inadvertently “outed” by one of his daughtersin a February 2023 tweetshowing him at a rally in Los Angeles denouncing Iran’s Islamic government.While the disclosure may have been inadvertent, and directly led to the plaintiffs’ attorneys being able to locate him and file the lawsuit, some believe it was part of a campaign by the Iranian diaspora in the US to help “sanitize” the history of the former shah’s deposed government and build momentum and support for a new pro-western regime.Reza Pahlavi, sometimes called the “crown prince” of Iran as son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, told the Guardianin a 2023 interview, at the height of anti-Tehran protests, that he was working with allies to draw up a charter of democratic principles for any new Iranian government to follow. He has since portrayed himself as ready to replace the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, andbecome interim head of state.Sabeti, meanwhile, has worked as Pahlavi’s “security adviser”, according to a2023 articleposted to the website of the National Council of Resistance to Iran, a coalition of Iranian political figures portraying itself as a parliament in exile.Efforts by the Guardian to reach Sabeti were unsuccessful, including emails and calls to his home, and messages seeking comment to all four of his attorneys listed in court documents.View image in fullscreenParviz Sabeti at a press conference on 4 April 1971.Photograph: Ettela’at (newspaper)Not in question is how well Sabeti and his family have lived in the US since arriving in Florida in 1978, having fled Tehran just weeks ahead of the1979 Islamic revolution.The Sabetis, who according toleaked state department documentswere able to transfer a sizable sum of money from Iran – said by one source to be above $20m – westernized their first names to Peter and Nancy after their arrival.Using those aliases, Sabeti set up what was to become a successful real estate development company in central Florida. Sabeti, his wife and two daughters are listed as directors of several still-active companies on the state of Florida’s business database.Public records seen by the Guardian show that the Sabeti family own at least eight properties in Orange county, including the five-bedroom, six-bathroom Windermere mansion purchased for $3.5m in August 2005.The state department and the CIA did not respond to questions about the Sabetis’ immigration status in the US, or the grounds on which they were first admitted in 1978. Both Parviz and Nasrim Sabeti, however, hold active voter registrations in Florida, and records show they voted in the 2024 presidential election, meaning both are US citizens.A neighbor said she would often see the couple, particularly Nasrim, out walking, but that the Sabetis mostly appeared to value their privacy. Their house was almost always quiet, apart from occasional visits by their daughters.Neither daughter responded to a request for comment.Florida’s Republican attorney general, James Uthmeier, did not respond to a question about whether he would launch a criminal investigation into Sabeti’s activities, as he previously has for other people in Floridaaccused of nefarious crimesoverseas.Sara Colón, an attorney for the plaintiffs, welcomed Presnell’s orders to deny Sabeti’s request for dismissal, and to preserve the anonymity of her clients, who said they had been subjected to death threats and intimidation since filing the lawsuit.View image in fullscreenAn Iranian dissident, hiding his face for fear of identification, lies on one of several three-level grids with burners underneath found in the cellar of a house of a senior Savak official that was stormed and set alight by demonstrators, on 31 December 1978.Photograph: Derek Ive/AP“These decisions are a positive result for survivors of torture who are seeking accountability and justice. This case is not only about ending impunity, it is about affirming that survivors have the right to pursue justice and reclaim their dignity without fear,” she said.The Iranian Collective for Justice & Accountability, an advocacy group for victims of torture and their families, said it hoped the Sabeti case would help end a “cycle of violence” seen in Iran during the shah’s regime and the Islamic fundamentalist government that succeeded it.“The message should be clear and simple: all victims deserve justice, and everyone engaged in torture and repression should be held accountable,” a spokesperson for the group said in a statement.“The roots of the brutal policies being carried out today by the Islamic Republic of Iran are connected to the torture methods enacted by Sabeti and Savak. [The case] should stand as a rejection of a future Iran that re-establishes Savak, or seeks to provide blanket amnesty to current security forces who have been involved in torture and repression.“It is only through justice and accountability that we can overcome the horrific violence and repression that has ruled Iran for decades.”This story was corrected on 12 September 2025 to clarify the status of the litigation.Explore more on these topicsIranFloridaTortureMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They say they also found a systematic campaign to strangle humanitarian aid, which they call “using food as a weapon of war”.“The Netanyahu government has gone far beyond targeting Hamas to imposing collective punishment on all the people ofGaza,” Van Hollen said at a Thursday press conference. “What they’re doing, and what we witnessed, is putting those goals into action.”At least one hundred people have died from famine in Gaza, the United Nationssaid this week, citing the Gaza health ministry.View image in fullscreenRelatives of one-and-a-half-year-old Palestinian Ayman Muhammad Abd al-Ghafur, who died from severe malnutrition, oxygen deprivation and muscle wasting, mourn as the body is taken from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdallah Fs Alattar/Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe senators, who visited Egypt, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan, argue that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a deliberate strategy to ethnically cleanse the local population rather than collateral damage from the war against Hamas. Their report is titled The Netanyahu Government Is Implementing a Plan to Ethnically Cleanse Gaza of Palestinians. America is Complicit. The World Must Stop It.During their visit to the Egyptian-Gaza border, they observed Rafah, the southern Gaza city – once home to 270,000 Palestinians – reduced to rubble. Van Hollen described how both lawmakers climbed an outside fire escape from the Egyptian side of the border to get a clear view of the destruction.The lawmakers also met with former Israel Defense Forces soldiers who described participating in “systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure”. Their report noted first-hand accounts of “how this was a part of an intentional pattern of using explosives to blow up whole city blocks, houses, schools and other civilian sites”.The senators documented arbitrary restrictions that have left aid groups unable to predict what will be denied entry. Jordanian officials told them that peanut butter, honey and dates had been suddenly banned from convoys, with entire trucks turned away for carrying a single restricted item. Each truck, the report says, is subject to a new $400 customs processing fee, and when the truck is not able to make it through the screening process, the $400 has to be paid again to join a later convoy. Because of those and other restrictions by the Israeli government, humanitarian aid coming in from Jordan was currently operating under 10% of its capacity, according to the report.In Egypt, the senators report, the UN’s fleet of trucks have “sustained severe damage”, with United Nations organizations showing the senators video of their convoys coming under fire from the IDF, “a regular occurrence”. The senators also toured a warehouse run by the Egyptian Red Crescent and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) with goods that had been banned by Israel, including solar-powered water pumps, tents, wheelchairs and even spare parts for trucks under “dual-use” restrictions, according to the report.At the Israeli port of Ashdod, WFP officials told the senators that 2,200 shipping containers of food – enough to feed everyone in Gaza for three weeks – sit delayed by screening procedures requiring each pallet to be checked individually.Merkley described the strategy’s two components: “One is to destroy homes so that they cannot be returned to … That second strategy is to deprive Palestinians of essentials to live, food, water, medicine.”Israel replaced the UN’s hundreds of distribution sites with just four aid points for 2 million people, three located only in southern Gaza. The senators heard accounts of malnourished mothers unable to walk miles to distribution sites while carrying children and then lift 40lb food boxes for the return journey. From 22 May to 31 July, 1,373 people were killed in the vicinity of these sites,according to the UN.That Israel and the United States are callingplansfor the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza a “voluntary exodus” is one of the “most fraudulent, sinister, and twisted cover stories ever told”, the report reads.“There is nothing voluntary about wanting to depart when your home is gone, when your agricultural fields are no longer accessible,” Van Hollen said at the press conference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent Senate vote on arms sales to Israel saw 27 Democratic senators – more than half the caucus – oppose weapons transfers.“The same values that made me a champion for Israel compel me to say what they are doing to the Palestinians, both in West Bank and in Gaza, is absolutely wrong,” said Merkley.Both lawmakers called for immediate action to secure a ceasefire, noting that Israeli hostage families had told them Netanyahu “has prioritized his political survival over the survival of our loved ones”.“The world has a moral and legal obligation to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing,” their report concludes. “Strong words alone will not be sufficient. The world must impose penalties and costs on those carrying out this plan.”Explore more on these topicsUS SenateGazaUS foreign policyUS CongressIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Flanked by officials in white thobes, he prayed over six caskets – one draped in a Qatari flag and five bearing Palestinian flags.Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha on Tuesday, which also killed a Qatari officer, marked an unprecedented moment for the Gulf kingdom. The attack undercut the assumption that has underpinned Qatari foreign policy for three decades and reverberated across the Arab region: be useful to the United States, and it will protect you.Qatar has been useful. It has facilitated peace talks between Israel and Hamas, did the same with the Taliban and the US during the war in Afghanistan, and hosts the Al Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the Middle East.Israeli airstrikes ‘killed any hope’ for hostages in Gaza, says Qatari prime ministerRead moreFor decades the arrangement has held. The US supplied arms, parked its aircraft carrier in the Gulf and provided political cover internationally. The support has helped spare Gulf nations from the unrest that has consumed much of the Middle East, despite the rivalry with Iran.That changed when the US failed to stop the strike on Qatar this week, despite Israel being one of its closest allies. Donald Trump said he tried to give warning, but Qatar said it was only notified after the strike.Doha strongly condemned the strike, with al-Thani calling it “state terror” in an interview with CNN.“I have no words to express how enraged we are from such an action … This is state terror. We are betrayed,” he said.Although Trump tends to view international relationships as transactions, diplomats say that the strike has wounded the trust between the Gulf and the US that has existed since the 1930s.“This has real repercussions for the relationship,” said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar who helped build the Al Udeid base.“The Gulf states, beginning with Saudi Arabia, believe that their security and stability still depend on America. For them, preventing an Israeli attack on Qatar was a no-brainer – the US could have done it without barely lifting a finger,” he added.The message taken from the strike was not that Washington cannot control Israel, which it arms and equips to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but it does not want to rein it in. Trump’s ability to call back Israeli jets on their way to bomb Tehran showed he has leverage when he chooses to.“The perception in the Gulf is that at worst is that the US didn’t want to stop Israel and gave it a green light, or at best, that it doesn’t care about the sovereignty of its Gulf allies,” said Yasmine Farouk, project director at the International Crisis Group.The reaction among Gulf states has been immediate. Despite past rifts with Qatar, its neighbours viewed the attack as an assault on all of their collective sovereignty.A flurry of diplomacy has followed, much of it spearheaded by the UAE. Qatar has welcomed Jordan’s crown prince, the UAE president and Egypt’s foreign minister. On Sunday, Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit.“The repercussions of Israel’s war in Gaza and its military campaigns across the region have been bringing the gulf states closer together,” said Farouk. “I think this will be a moment where they try to move from solidarity to action.”In the short term, there will likely be little change in Washington relations. The US still underpins security and economic order in the Gulf and a hasty breakup is not in the cards.But Gulf states may quietly start turning down American requests.Getting more Arab states to sign up for the Abraham Accords – Trump’s major initiative in the region – is farther off than ever. The relationship between the UAE and Israel is already on the rocks, with the former summoning the Israeli ambassador. US access to Gulf capital could also be in jeopardy.If the US has stopped holding its side of the quid pro quo, the Gulf could quietly re-evaluate the return it is getting on its investments. By the time the US notices, it might be too late.“It will be the little things being turned down, but they will accumulate. We won’t notice at first, but Qatar will stop taking chances on our behalf,” said Theros.Explore more on these topicsQatarMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelanalysisShareReuse this content"

That estimate is notable as it is close to the current figures provided by Gaza’s health ministry, which Israeli officials have frequently dismissed as Hamas propaganda, though the ministry figures have been deemed reliable by international humanitarian agencies.The current official toll is 64,718 Palestinians killed in Gaza and 163,859 injured, since the start of the war on 7 October 2023. Many thousands more are feared dead, with their bodies buried in the rubble. At least 40 people were reported killed on Friday in Israeli strikes, mostly around Gaza City.The Gaza ministry statistics do not distinguish between civilians and fighters, butleaked Israeli military intelligence dataon casualties until May this year suggested that more than 80% of the dead were civilians.UN general assembly votes to back Hamas-free government for PalestineRead moreAbout 1,200 people were killed in the original 7 October Hamas attack, which ignited the war, of whom 815 were Israeli and foreign civilians.“This isn’t a gentle war. We took the gloves off from the first minute. Sadly not earlier,” Halevi said, suggesting the Israel should have taken a tougher line in Gaza before the 7 October attack.The former commander was talking on Tuesday night to residents of Ein HaBesor moshav (agricultural cooperative), who succeeded in repelling the Hamas attackers two years ago. A recording of his remarks was published by theYnet news website.“No one is working gently,” Halevi said, but insisted the IDF operates within the constraints of international humanitarian law. That claim has been repeated throughout the war by Israeli officials, who have said that military lawyers are involved in operational decisions.However, Halevi denied that legal advice had ever affected his or his immediate subordinates’ military decisions in Gaza or across the Middle East.“Not once has anyone restricted me. Not once. Not the military AG [advocate general Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi] who, by the way, hasn’t the authority to restrict me,” he said.In a quote that was not on the recording but was cited by Ynet, Halevi appeared to suggest that the main importance of Israel’s military lawyers was to convince the outside world of the legality of the IDF’s actions.“There are legal advisers who say: We will know how to defend this legally in the world, and this is very important for the state of Israel,” he is quoted as saying.The IDF was approached for comment on Halevi’s remarks about the death toll and the role of military lawyers, but had not replied by Friday evening.Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said Halevi’s remarks “confirm that the legal advisers serve as rubber stamps”.“The generals see them as ‘regular’ advisers whose advice one can adopt or dismiss, not as professional lawyers whose legal positions present the boundaries of what is permissible and what is prohibited,” Sfard said.On Wednesday,the Haaretz newspaperreported that Halevi’s successor as IDF chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, had ignored Tomer-Yerushalmi’s legal advice. The advocate general had reportedly said that the displacement orders to an estimated 1 million Gaza City residents to leave before an IDF offensive should be postponed until there were facilities in southern Gaza to receive them.Many of the 40 Palestinian victims of Friday’s Israeli strikes appeared to have been people who were unable to move south, or unwilling to abandon their homes or shelters to risk of going somewhere in Gaza where there was no shelter or protection against Israeli bombing.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sisi welcomed the UK decision to recognise a Palestinian state.The Downing Street readout also referred to steps to strengthen bilateral ties in the future. The release of Abd el-Fattah is a Foreign Office priority. The two leaders last spoke in July.Hopes of a pardon were ignited by Egypt’s official National Human Rights Council making a call this week for his release and that of six other named prisoners, arguing a pardon would contribute to the stability and psychological balance of his family.It is expected a decision will be taken in a few days. The move represents the most optimistic development in his ordeal since he was arrested six years ago for endorsing a social media post about the death of a prisoner. He was charged with broadcasting false news.His mother, Laila Soueif,a Cairo University professor and herself active politically, started a hunger strikein September 2024 in the UK before being twice hospitalised in London.Close to death in July and facing desperate appeals from her family not to leave them, she relented after the Foreign Office gave assurances that it was making progress towards his release.On 21 July the first terrorism chamber of the Cairo criminal court agreed to remove Abd el-Fattah’s name from the list of terrorists, his lawyer Khaled Ali said on Facebook.Mohamed el-Baqer, Abd el-Fattah’s former lawyer, was one of many to urge Soueif to end the strike, not because her efforts were futile but out of the “horror of losing” her.Abd el-Fattah is widely regarded as one of Egypt’s most articulate human rights activists and the British government has hit a brick wall in trying to persuade Sisi to release him on the basis that he has served his five-year sentence.His family claim that the two years he spent in jail in detention from September 2019 before his five-year sentence imposed in December 2021 should have counted as part of his sentence. He has served nearly a full extra year.His release would enable him to see his teenage son, who lives in Brighton, as well as his two sisters, who have campaigned tirelessly for his release.The family, anxious not to disturb what may unfold, or to raise their hopes, have highlighted the prospect of a family reunion as they wait to see if Sisi will grant the pardon.The National Human Rights Council is nominally an independent body in Egypt and did propose Abd el-Fattah’s release once before, according to sources close to the family.In its statement asking for a pardon, the council said it was making the appeal “due to the critical family circumstances faced by their relatives. Such a decision would represent a deeply significant moral incentive for the families of those mentioned and would substantially contribute to restoring their stability as well as their psychological and social balance.”The statement added that “in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by those families which require the presence of their loved ones – the council emphasises that the exercise of the right of presidential pardon falls within your excellency’s constitutional prerogatives. It is a power that embodies the humanitarian dimension of the state and reflects your excellency’s personal concern for the integrity of the Egyptian family, especially vulnerable groups (children, persons with disabilities, women and the elderly).”In a further development, it was reported that the Egyptian attorney general, Mohamed Shawki Ayad, and separately the interior ministry had completed their judicial reports to Sisi setting out the validity of the original sentence and whether Abd el-Fattah was eligible for a pardon.The initial indications were positive.Earlier this year Abd el-Fattah was on hunger strike in solidarity with his mother. It is believed he now knows that the request for a pardon has been made.Explore more on these topicsEgyptAbdel Fatah al-SisiForeign policyKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty-one civilians taking part in the demonstrations were killed on what became the bloodiest day of protest in Nepal’s history.By Tuesday, rage at the government had reached a fever pitch and the country’s parliament buildings, as well as the homes of the prime minister – KP Sharma Oli – president and other ministers were all set on fire and the capital, Kathmandu, resembled a burned out war zone. Oli, who had been airlifted out by the military, announced his resignation by Tuesday afternoon.The resignation of the 73-year-old – who was serving his fourth term as prime minister and was seen by many as authoritarian, corrupt and out of touch – was widely celebrated by the gen Z protesters out on the streets. However, the speed at which the protests had led to the toppling of the government also presented issues. They had not been part of a coherent, organised group and did not have a leader or group of representatives.After the president and the army chief invited the gen Z protesters to be part of the discussions on who should form the next government, a team of representatives were chosen. By Wednesday, they had put forward Karki as their choice to lead an interim government, and insisted that the current parliament should be dissolved.View image in fullscreenNepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed interim prime minister after KP Sharma Oli was forced to resign.Photograph: ReutersKarki had been appointed Nepal’s first female chief justice in 2016 and became known for delivering several high-profile judgments against ministers and senior police in corruption cases, coming into the crosshairs of the major political parties as a result. After retiring, she had established herself as a prominent figure in civil society, speaking out on issues of corruption and political malpractices in Nepal.Despite some divisions, by Wednesday the gen Z protesters rallied around Karki, who had been outspoken against the lethal force used against protesters, describing it as a “massacre”. She was also given the backing of the popular young mayor of Kathamandu, rapper-turned-politician Balendra Shah, who is widely revered among the younger generation.However, the country appeared to be heading towards deadlock after leaders of some of Nepal’s most established political parties initially refused to agree for parliament to be dissolved. But on Friday night, after the army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel warned that the military would be forced to declare a state of emergency if no political solution would be found, it was agreed by party leaders to dissolve the parliament, and for Karki to be appointed prime minister until fresh elections are called.The exact nature of the interim government that will govern Nepal under Karki has still yet to be made clear, though it was announced she would be leading a “council of ministers”.Many in the gen Z movement are pushing for her to immediately open corruption allegations into former prime minister Oli and his ministers and hold an inquiry into the protest deaths that took place.Dheeraj Joshi, 25, a gen-Z leader participating in discussions with the army and the president, said that he believed that Karki’s appointment would see the country “moving from a phase of destruction to a phase of construction”.“That doesn’t mean everything will immediately be fine once she takes office,” he said. “Initially, there will be a process to identify who weakened the country the most, and then set priorities accordingly. Over time, the deeply rooted corruption will be uprooted. Once that process begins, the ground will open up for better future.”Explore more on these topicsNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.The officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”The claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.The force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.An IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.The Met’s handling of the scandal,with one officer being promoted, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed totransform the cultureof Britain’s biggest police force.Stephen Lawrence’s mother makes plea for witnesses as review beginsRead moreThe new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.The IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.Sadiq Khan, the mayor ofLondon, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”Twist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policePoliceLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In January,AstraZeneca scrapped plans to invest £450m in its vaccine manufacturing facilityin Speke, Merseyside, citing a cut in government support, after months of negotiations.An AstraZeneca spokesperson said on Friday: “We constantly reassess the investment needs of our company and can confirm our expansion in Cambridge is paused. We have no further comment to make.”The latest UK setback contrasts with the company’s moves in other jurisdictions. In July the company announced itwould invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030, as part of a string of pledges by pharmaceutical companies as Donald Trump’s threats to impose sector-specific tariffs loom over the industry.The British drugmaker, which is headquartered in Cambridge, said its US investment would fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia, and expand its laboratories and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas.The news from AstraZeneca caps a week of negative announcements and warnings from a crucial UK industry.Keir Starmer’s government has described life sciences as “one of the crown jewels of the UK economy”, while the previous Conservative government had vowed to turn the country intoa “global science and technology superpower” by 2030.Yet on Wednesday, the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe,scrapped a £1bn London research centreas well as laying off 125 scientists in the capital this year.Its planned new lab, called the UK Discovery Centre, opposite St Pancras and King’s Cross stations was already under construction and scheduled to open in two years’ time. It had been expected to employ about 800 people.A day later, Sir John Bell, a prominent scientist and former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, warned thatother big pharmaceutical companies were going to stop investingin the UK.He told BBC Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.Then on Friday, Paul Naish, the UK head of market access for the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi,told the GuardianBritain needed a “proper plan from the Treasury” for life sciences, arguing the country had become “not a good place” to develop or sell drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials at the department of health, concerned after MSD’s move to pull out of research in the UK, reportedly want to reopen those talks.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry wants the clawback rate – at which drugmakers pay back a chunk of their UK revenues to the NHS – reduced from nearly 23% to single digits, similar to levels in other European countries.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.“Personally, I think the clock is ticking,” one MP said. “It sometimes happens to people who are incredibly well meaning, but you can pass that tipping point and can’t recover.”It came as Lucy Powell, who was sacked from the cabinet in the reshuffle after Rayner’s departure and who is standing to replace her as deputy leader, called for a “change of culture” in a Downing Street she described as overly factional and error-prone.“We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views,” Powelltold the Guardian.The only MP to go public in saying Starmer should go is Clive Lewis, a regular critic of the government from the left of the party.The Norwich South MP told BBC’s The Week in Westminster programme that Starmer had “lost control within the first year”, adding: “We don’t have the luxury of carrying on this way with someone who I think increasingly, I’m sorry to say, just doesn’t seem up to the job.”Allies of Starmer are urging a sense of proportion. “No one is oblivious to the scale of the challenge or the need to be better, least of all Keir,” one said. “We know it’s a difficult time and MPs are worried about their own majorities. We’re more aware than anyone that things are very febrile.”It comes ahead of another potentially tricky week for Starmer, which includes the state visit to the UK for Donald Trump, who is both hugely unpredictable and unpopular withLabourMPs. The US president and his wife, Melania, will arrive on Tuesday evening, and be greeted by James Roscoe, Mandelson’s interim replacement as UK ambassador to the US.With morale described as very low in the parliamentary party, some of the anger has centred around Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, who has been blamed for No 10’s initialdefence of Mandelson– something one government source denied – and for being central to a narrow, clique-based ruling faction.One minister said: “The one person who is the constant through every bad decision since 24 July [last year] is Morgan. Maybe the PM keeps getting rid of the wrong people.”But other MPs, including some who are normally loyal, are increasingly questioning whether Starmer can lead the party out of its current slump in the polls.“The problem is Keir,” one normally loyal MP said. “He doesn’t have any judgment, he doesn’t make an effort to speak to MPs, let alone ministers. Unless Keir has a personality transplant and majorly changes things, I don’t know how he is going to improve. For the first time I’ve begun to wonder if he is going to be the leader at the next election.”Another backbencher said: “So far this has been Keir on his own terms, with us doing everything that he wants, other than welfare reform, and it’s driven our poll ratings absolutely into the toilet.“He’s replaced everyone, at every level, and everything keeps going the same direction. The only conclusion can be that the PM just has terrible judgment.”One MP from the usually loyal contingent of 2024 entrants said: “It’s not a happy parliamentary party at the moment.The only person less popular than Keir Starmer in my constituency is Rachel Reeves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And earlier this week Ed Balls said on his podcast that his wife, Yvette Cooper, had found her move from home secretary to foreign secretary “frustrating”.“He’s moved all the people who are loyal to him into ministerial or PPS roles, with the end result being that he’s now got no one really left in the backbenches fighting his corner, and put a load of pissed-off ex-ministers there instead,” one minister said“If we were 20 points ahead in the polls, people would probably suck it up. But if we bomb next May, I can’t really see Keir surviving that without at least a challenge.”For many MPs, the next key moment will be this month’s Labour conference in Liverpool, where they are hoping for signs of change. “I’ve never known the mood in the parliamentary Labour party to be this bad,” one said. “The normally loyal are furious.”“We know that things like this knock you off course. It’s bad and we have to get back on track,” a Downing Street source said.The ally of Starmer said the prime minister was well aware of the task he faced: “He knows we need to do a huge amount of work to rebuild relations with the party, and to do a better job of conveying what he wants to do to the public. We think that conference will help with that.”TheScotland secretary, Douglas Alexander, told BBC Breakfast on Friday morning that he understood why Labour MPs were “despondent”, saying that “nothing justifies” Mandelson’s appointment “in light of what has now emerged”.He added: “These are not the headlines any of us in government or in parliament would have chosen or wanted. But the fact is when the evidence emerged, action had to be taken and we are looking forward, therefore, to moving on.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourAngela RaynerPeter MandelsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsRead moreDan Hurley, Universities UK’s deputy director of policy, said: “There is a real need for us to work with funders and government to address some of the risks here and get under the skin of what this might look like.“What we do know is that most charity funding is in the medical and health space, so it is definitely having an impact in that area.“We can’t pinpoint the degree to which this is impacting specific disciplines but the findings in this report are a warning that really difficult decisions are being taken on the ground and if we want to maintain the UK’s international competitiveness when it comes to research then we need to go further to support it.“While these headline findings are a strong warning in themselves, this is going to require ongoing monitoring.”The report, done in collaboration with the Campaign for Science and Engineering and the Association ofResearchManagers and Administrators using surveys of academic researchers, found that “sustained financial constraints” were likely to diminish the estimated £54bn annual contribution made by university research to the UK economy.The study found there had been a 4% decrease in research staff in the biological, mathematical and physical sciences in the last three years, while staff in medicine, dentistry and health have dropped by 2%, mainly in highly expensive clinical medicine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But what’s clear is that further efficiencies are not going to be enough on their own to address these broader risks to areas of research, with implications for our research system’s international competitiveness.“So we also need action from the government on the future of quality-related funding, which hasn’t kept pace with inflation for a decade.

It claimed that Joell-Deshields’s conduct since being put on a leave of absence risked “irreparable damage” to the prospects of future parades.The suspended chief executive “is known to have breached a number of contractual obligations owed by him in his capacity as an employee in relation to company property/confidential information and threatens to continue to do so unless restrained”, it was claimed in legal documents.During a hearing, Marc Brittain, representing Joell-Deshields, said that his client would consent to an order forcing him to hand over company property but that this did not prejudice his defence against Pride’s legal claim for breach of contract or any other wrongdoing, which he denies.A separate legal claim is being pursued by Pride against its suspended chief executive.London’s annual Pride parade is the largest LGBTQ+ event in the UK and attracts about 30,000 participants. Joell-Deshields has been chief executive since 2022.The Guardian revealed earlier this month thatJoell-Deshields had been suspendedat the end of August over a series of allegations of impropriety, including that he had bought luxury perfumes with food and drink vouchers donated by a sponsor for use by Pride volunteers.He is currently under internal investigation. Pride had claimed that Joell-Deshields had refused demands to hand over company property. It claimed that this included “the passwords, usernames and access information required to operate the applicant’s bank accounts, social media accounts and other digital or electronic facilities”.The court ordered that Joell-Deshields hand over his mobile phone and laptop to an independent investigator examining allegations against him as well as the passwords cited in the application.According to Pride, Joell-Deshields is accused of “misuse of company funds for his own personal benefit; financial mismanagement of the company’s funds (including misreporting of its financial activities and lack of oversight of expenditure)” as well as “bullying and safeguarding failures in relation to volunteers who provide services to the applicant and a fundamental attempt to conceal, and evade accountability”.Joell-Deshields’s lawyer did not submit a skeleton argument to the court as he had been hired just 24 hours before the hearing.Pride in London is financed by a £625,000 five-year grant from the London mayor as well as its own fundraising.Concerns about governance and the conduct of the chief executive were raised in June. This was followed by a formal whistleblowing disclosure by a group of volunteer directors at the end of last month. A new board was set up at the end of August.Among the allegations was the potential misuse of some of the £30,000 worth of food and drink vouchers provided by an unnamed sponsor for volunteers.According to the volunteer directors, the sponsor’s head of ethics and compliance had written on 18 February to the legal director at Pride in London to say that the company’s fraud systems had detected that two accounts had used £7,125 of the vouchers on luxury items.The items included an Apple HomePod, Apple AirPods and cologne, including Creed Aventus, which has a retail price of at least £165, and Burberry Hero, which starts at £118 a bottle.According to the whistleblowers, the sponsor advised the legal director that “the pattern and nature of the transactions strongly suggested personal – rather than organisational – benefit”.One of the two accounts flagged was that of Joell-Deshields.Pride in London commissioned external lawyers to investigate, according to the directors’ letter, and an interim report was written.According to the letter, the report states that Joell-Deshields claimed the vouchers were used for gifts and prizes for raffles and that the HomePod was used in the office and at “pop up” events.Joell-Deshields’s barrister said he denied any wrongdoing.A spokesperson for Pride for London said: “Today’s outcome will ensure that our staff and volunteers can continue to carry out their invaluable work without undue obstruction. We remain focused on our service of the LGBTQ+ community of London, and working towards a successful Pride in London 2026.”Explore more on these topicsPrideLondonLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

So too, we must speak out now against the harm done to the Palestinian people. We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanization, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression.”In a statement, Paramount, which was recently acquired by the family of billionaire Larry Ellison and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners, said “the global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world”.“We believe in the power of storytelling to connect and inspire people, promote mutual understanding, and preserve the moments, ideas, and events that shape the world we share,” said a statement provided to the LA Times and attributed to the company. “We do not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli film-makers. Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace.”The artists who signed the pledge said they were inspired by the “Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, whorefusedto screen their films in apartheid South Africa”.“We pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies – that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people,” the pledge reads.Explore more on these topicsFilmParamount PicturesParamount+IsraelGazanewsShareReuse this content"

Both the officer and subject immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”It continued: “The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital, the officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition, viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”The target of the stop in Franklin Park, to the west of Chicago, was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of reckless driving,accordingto the Department of Homeland Security.Rightwing influencer accompanied Ice agents during raids in ChicagoRead more“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary. She then echoed the statement by Ice regarding the dangers of social media videos.The incident involved a traffic stop to check on what Ice said was an undocumented immigrant. It happened about six miles from where, separately, a day-long protest had been unfolding outside an Ice processing center in Broadview,Illinois, where demonstrators clashed with federal government agents on Friday morning. There were reports a demonstrator was shot in the leg with a pepper ball by enforcement officers.A worker at a tire shop across the street from where Villegas-Gonzales was killed spoke toBreakThrough News, according to the outlet, saying: “I thought it was your run-of-the-mill car crash, because car crashes have been here all the time, so I thought nothing of it. That’s when my boss came out and told me, ‘Hey, something happened here.’ And I saw a huge police presence, military presence and FBI presence.“So right now, the community is a bit scared about Ice and the military operations here inChicago,” he added. “Franklin Park is heavily Latino and Polish, so I didn’t know that they were going to come here one day. It’s just, once it happens, you’re in shock, like you can’t believe your eyes.”He also provided reporters with security footage from outside the shop, which included audio of what sounds like gunshots.Police taped off the area and behind patrol vehicles a grey sedan could be seen that the man had been driving. It had crashed into a parked truck, and it could be seen that the driver’s side window was open.A video taken by a bystander and uploaded toChitown Crimechaserson Facebook shows Ice agents trying to get into Villegas-Gonzalez’ car. Yanking the car handle and eventually breaking the glass and unlocking the car from the inside.In a statement, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) denounced the fatal shooting, saying: “We grieve for Silverio’s family and neighbors. His killing at the hands of ICE is a display of the extreme, aggressive tactics that ICE has been carrying out in its operations across Chicagoland this week ... This killing is the latest in a mounting pile of evidence that Trump’s mass deportation machine is completely out of control.”The activist group further called out Ice’s immigration crackdown: “ICE’s operations, which today resulted in ICE killing Mr Villegas-Gonzalez, jeopardize the safety of everyone, citizens and non-citizens alike, and disrupt the very fabric of our communities … In a moment like this it is critical that we all exercise our rights and look out for our neighbors.”A neighbor who did not want to be identified spoke highly of Villegas-Gonzalez with a small group of reporters and mentioned that Villegas-Gonzalez was a hard worker and a good neighbor.One time, the neighbor recalled, Villegas-Gonzalez scraped the neighbor’s car, came over and offered to fix it. The neighbor said it’s been distressing to see social media posts about Villegas-Gonzalez.“It’s such a sickening world that everybody’s celebrating his death,” the neighbor said. It’s just wrong, you know? He’s a human being.”When asked about Ice’s arrest of Villegas-Gonzalez and the agency having said Villegas-Gonzalez tried to drive into officers, the neighbor said Villegas-Gonzalez “was scared 100%” and didn’t speak English.Meanwhile, in nearby Broadview, demonstrations began at dawn and were set to continue until the evening. By late morning, several dozen people had assembled outside the facility, according toCBS News Chicago.These incidents and some others are part of a surge of immigration enforcement into parts of the Chicago area in the last week as part of a crackdown pledged byDonald Trump, as neighborhoodshave braced. He has threatened to send in troops to dealwith crimein the kind of unilateral action taken by the administration inWashingtonDC, ongoing, and Los Angeles earlier in the yearfollowing proteststhere againstIce raids.This would be expressly against the wishes of Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the stategovernor, JB Pritzker, both Democrats, who have condemned the saber rattling andcalledfor resistance. By Friday troops had not been sent.Crowds in Broadview could be heard and seen on video shouting “shame on you” towards officers and the facility.At one point, a reporter observed Ice officers forcing protesters back while clearing the way for agency vehicles to pass through the crowd. Tensions escalated further as protesters and Ice officers began facing off directly.Another reporter shared avideofrom that scene, writing: “I am at Broadview Village ICE detention center where demonstrators just chased Chicago US Army Special Reaction Teams (SRTs) as they were leaving the building.” The footage shows Ice personnel retreating as demonstrators pursue them, shouting.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoIllinoisProtestTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the latest in a series of major regulatory rollbacks undoing previous US efforts to combat climate crisis.Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to repeal the “endangerment finding” that enabled the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and stationary sources.If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites.The Trump administration has also said it will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.The Trump administration has also taken steps to end the collection of key environmental databases at the EPA as well as other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and end greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites operated by Nasa.The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually. The agency will still require submission of methane emissions data for large oil and gas operations for companies subject to a waste emissions charge.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

But sales have plummeted amid a surging pro-meat trend embraced by theTrump administration, raising a key question – willvegetarianismever take hold in the US?This year has been a punishing one for the plant-based meat sector, led by companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, with sales of refrigerated productsslumping17%. This follows a difficult 2024, during which salesfell7%, furthering a multi-year spiral – last year Americanspurchased75m fewer units of plant-based meat than they did in 2022.Despite hopes that burgers, sausages and chicken made from soy, peas and beans would curb Americans’ love of eating butchered animals – thereby reducing the rampant deforestation, water pollution and planet-heating emissions involved in raising livestock – these alternatives languish at just 1% of the total meat market in the US.Instead, a resurgent focus on meat has swept the US, pushed by industry lobbyists and online wellness influencers who advocate greater protein consumption via the carnivore diet and deride plant alternatives as overly processed.Accordingto the meat industry, since 2020 there has been a 20% drop in the number of Americans seeking to cut their meat consumption.The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again credo has embraced this push. Paul Saladino, a leading online meat proponent who hascalledplant burgers “garbage”, took a meat-based smoothie to a White House event in May and slammed a shot of raw milk withRobert F Kennedy Jr, the contrarian US health secretary. “I eat protein, a lot of protein,” KennedytoldSaladino of his own meat eating.“It’s not our moment, we recognize that, you’d be crazy to think it is,” Ethan Brown, chief executive of Beyond Meat, the plant-based business that was valued at $10bn a few years ago but has suffered a 97% drop in its share price since, said.“Meat consumption is on the rise, the political culture is different. We just need to get through this period.”The meat industry “did a masterful job, convincing people that there was something wrong with the products, or that they were ultra-processed or things of that nature”, Brown added.To try to keep pace with the culture shift, Beyond recentlydropped“Meat” from its name andunveileda new product that is primarily a protein-based food (made of fava beans) rather than mimicked beef or chicken. It has laid off workers,missedrevenue expectations and has had to deny it isstrugglingto pay its bills.Its big rival, Impossible, meanwhile has scrambled to align with meat rather than oppose it, even floating the idea of a hybrid plant-beef burger. “We’re not here to win over the salad eaters,” reads its website. “We’re here for the meat stans.”The meat industry’s attack upon veg competitors as unhealthy has been successful, if rather misleading – researchshowsthat a plant-based products generally have less saturated fat, more fibre and about the same protein as processed meat.Also, many of the increasingly popular high-proteinbars, milks and other products are very processed, without suffering any of the stigma that plant-based meat has. “If you walk into grocery store there is a protein enhanced version of almost every product, even though Americans are getting enough protein,” said Kate Stanley, a food researcher at Duke University.Crucially, studies havefoundthat while most Americans understand the benefits of eating more plants, only a quarter are willing to do so and the vast majority don’t view the environment as a priority when choosing meals.“There’s a disconnect between the mounting evidence on meat’s environmental footprint and what’s actually driving consumer behavior,” said Shauna Downs, who has studied Americans’ views at the Rutgers School of Public Health.Food remains a deeply personal and cultural part of our lives and for most people that involves meat – a fifth of all Americansstilleat red meat five times or more every week. Herbivore imitations may have improved from previous iterations of veggie burgers but remain more expensive than meat.“Sustainability is a consideration for only a very small portion of the population – taste and price are the biggest things and plant-based products need to deliver on those,” said Jody Kirchner, associate director of market insights at the Good Food Institute, which hasresearchedthe plant-based sector.“Inflation has had a big impact across the food sector and that’s a big challenge for plant products because they cost two to three times more than traditional meat. A lot of progress will need to be made on taste and cost to become feasible for customers – a lot of people just don’t see the need for these products.”Regardless of the ebb and flow ofvariousdietaryfads, and rising alarm over the destruction of the natural world, Americans have been immovable when it comes to becoming vegetarian or vegan. Just 4% of people in the US identified as vegetarian in 2023, a proportion that is actually down from the 6% that said the same in 2001,according to Gallup. A mere 1% are vegan.Inspiring a move away from meat, even if it just to cut back consumption, is seemingly far more difficult in the US than other comparable countries that havelarger, and growing, cohorts of vegetarians.“Certainly in the American fabric there is a relationship with cattle, the kind of pioneer, rugged individualism, John Wayne, and it’s all wrapped up with this kind of Manifest Destiny,” said Brown.Current cultural trends around masqueradingrustic pursuitsand traditionalhomesteadinghas helped elevate meat, Brown said, along with the macho political posturing of the Trump era where the US, for the first time in years,again has adepartment of war.“It’s just not a moment for altruistic kind of behaviors,” he said. “I think right now it’s about TikTok and tariffs, that’s what is on the consumer’s mind. It’s not the moment for any sort of broader concern, it’s a very self-interested moment.”“It’s a particularly difficult moment for movements like vegan and vegetarianism,’ he conceded. ‘“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to come back.”The plant-based problem: why vegan restaurants are closing – or adding meat to the menuRead moreThe cultural pendulum may have swung toward meat but the stresses upon the planet have only worsened. Vastdeforestation, in places like the Amazon, to clear land for cows is fueling ecological and climate breakdown, with the burps of cattle and the associated chemicals, machinery and land loss from feeding and raising livestock responsible for up toa third of all planet-heating emissions.Each year, billions of animals are crammed into giant American barns, fed a cocktail of vaccines and antibiotics and killed, with the pollution from such facilities oftenbefoulingwaterways. Grass-fed cows in rolling paddocks are often portrayed as a greener option,although this system involvesrazing biodiverse forests and grasslands and converting even more land for cattle feed.“I’ve been trying for 30 years to get people to eat less meat but the numbers just haven’t budged in the US,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University. “I think consumers are confused. They like what’s familiar to them.”Gardner said he finds hope inevidencethat a growing number of younger Americans are willing to reduce meat intake and that the culture will shift away from the celebration of the carnivore.“Not everyone has to become vegetarian but we will have to eat a lot less meat – at some point people will wake up and say ‘where have the rainforests gone?’” he said.“We are heading to the point we don’t have the land or water to support the amount of meat we want to eat. I hope people finally get it. They have to get it. We are facing an existential moment here.”Explore more on these topicsFoodVegetarianismVegetarian food and drinkTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium, the $2bn (£1.47bn) home of the NFL’s Raiders,Saúl “Canelo” Álvarezwill defend his undisputed super-middleweight crown againstTerence Crawfordin front of more than 70,000 spectators, by far the largest boxing crowd the city has ever seen.Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredRead moreMillions more will watch on Netflix, which is carrying the card at no extra cost to subscribers – a first for a fight of this magnitude and a reminder of how the business of boxing is being remade in real time. For decades, the sport depended on pay-per-view. Now it is betting that reach and spectacle can replace a buckling model. The timing is no accident: Mexican Independence Day weekend, when this neon-lit metropolis in the Mojave desert becomes a second home for Álvarez and his flag-draped supporters.Quick GuideCanelo Álvarez v Terence CrawfordShow•Canelo  v  Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredWhat's happening?Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line?Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Where can I watch it?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers.

Thursday’s final press conference at the T-Mobile Arena was open to the public but drew little more than a thousand fans. It’s expected the crowds will arrive en masse on Friday and the live gate will be eye-watering in the end, but ticket sales have been on the sluggish side, prompting whispers of theTrump slumpthat has affected local tourism. The likelier theory is that while most of boxing’s more recent super-fights have required years of wrangling – Mayweather v Pacquiao, Álvarez v Golovkin, Crawford v Spence – this one materialized practically overnight. A year ago, Álvarez v Crawford was more a bar-room flight of fancy than plausible matchup given the weight gulf. Now, suddenly, here it is.Álvarez, 35, is the emperor at 168lb: granite-chinned, a four-weight champion from 154 to 175, boxing’s most bankable name. Crawford, 37, is America’s best fighter since Floyd Mayweather Jr, a champion in four divisions spanning 135 to 154 who has spent more than a decade making elite opponents look ordinary. The switch-hitting Nebraskan is the quiet craftsman who unified 140, then 147 witha dismantling of Errol Spence Jrso complete that it felt like a mismatch. That he hails from a fistic outpost better known for the production of corn than elite prize-fighters only lends to the lore.View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez is boxing’s most bankable name and one of Mexico’s most recognizable faces.Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images for NetflixThis weekend also doubles as the maiden promotion of Zuffa Boxing under TKO Holdings, the company formed by the merger of UFC’s parent group and WWE. It is the first boxing show promoted by Dana White, backed by an ampleTurki al-Sheikhinvestment, and seen as the opening salvo inan attempt to build a rival system of rankings and titlesunder Saudi control. Behind the scenes, that project is already colliding with Washington politics. A new Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act has been introduced in Congress, legislation critics say could gut longstanding protections for fighters and hand promoters the power to control titles. That a potential hostile takeover can hide in plain sight the way it has during the equivalent of boxing’s Super Bowl week is a testament to the allure of the main event. When one journalistdid raise valid questionson the subject during Thursday’s press conference, White deftly parried before going ad hominem.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead moreThe oddsmakers have leaned toward Álvarez. He has campaigned at 168lb or above for nearly seven years, his chin stress-tested by heavier men. Crawford has spent most of his career at 147 or below, with only a brief reconnaissance at 154. Size matters, and so does age. Yet the intrigue lies in Crawford’s record of problem-solving. Time and again, he has spent the early rounds downloading an opponent’s rhythm before flipping the geometry in the middle of the fight. Against Spence two summers ago, Crawford produced a masterclass: three knockdowns and a ninth-round stoppage. Notably, the odds against him have shortened materially since the fight was announced in June.For Álvarez, victory is legacy maintenance. He has already hoovered up titles across four weight classes, headlined stadiums in two countries and confirmed himself as the sport’s biggest star and one of Mexico’s most recognizable faces. Beating Crawford would add another bullet to the résumé and reaffirm his supremacy at 168. For Crawford, it is legacy transformation. He is already the first man in the four-belt era to become undisputed champion in two divisions, a feat since matched by Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. A third, against Álvarez, on Netflix’s global platform and before the largest fight crowd in Las Vegas history, would vault him from generational talent into the all-time realm of lionhearted weight-jumpers like Harry Greb, Henry Armstrong, Roberto Durán and Manny Pacquiao.Everything about this fight is oversized and breathless: the venue, stakes and TV audience. What happens inside the ropes on Saturday night, though, will come down to the smallest of margins: timing, angles, choices made in the blur of three-minute rounds. It’s in that public accounting where boxing, for all its bloat, still finds its purity.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsCanelo ÁlvareznewsShareReuse this content"

Ruben Amorim, like those before him, blinks in the glare of the endless fascination with Manchester United’s leading man, and may wonder whether this is the impossible job.Three games into a first full campaign the 40-year-old seemed to believe so. The desultory 12-11 Carabao Cuppenalty shootout defeat at Grimsbyfollowed a1-0 loss to Arsenaland1-1 draw at Fulham.Three matches, zero wins, and the executioner’s song began to wail for the Portuguese’s job security.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreEspecially when he said of the Grimsby result: “This is a little bit the limit. Something has to change. At this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.” Then, the bombshell: “I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.”Reporters tapped up contacts, the pundit class speculated, United enthusiasts debated over pints and social media. Was Amorim suggesting his side “wanted” a new head coach? And did “we have time to think” after the weekend Premier League visit of Burnley (whichUnited won 3-2) mean he could walk?A first United defeat by League Two opposition in the second‑tier cup competition willalways be a big deal. But zoom out a smidgeon and the wider picture in the bread and butter of the league was two matches played and a point taken (not great but also no seismic disaster) and United motor across town for Sunday’s 197th derby with four points, one more than Pep Guardiola’s garlanded Manchester City, who are winless since the opening day.So is it reasonable to consider Amorim’s position under threat three league games into a season? Certifiably not. Is this simply life for the gent in the hottest of football seats? Certainly.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim’s position at Manchester United is under threat three league matches into his first full season in charge.Photograph: Mark Pain/AlamyOn one level the focus on Amorim is ridiculous – quasi-farcical. On another it is manna from heaven for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers, owners who are conscious the constant eyeballs on their manager is a massive feeder of the United cash machine. When Ed Woodward said in December 2013 the club could go trophyless and still “sell an incredible number of shirts” he voiced the prevailing commercial truth about this global behemoth.Fans and others who might term themselves football purists seized on the then executive vice‑chair’s comment as entitled, anti‑sport. Yet what it pointed to was United’s status as an institution of fascination akin to the British royal family and what it means for the bottom line: lucrative commercial deals and riches. However uncomfortable or exaggerated, the relentless spotlight translates into millions in revenues. In July 2014 an Amorim predecessor, Louis van Gaal, used his unveiling to say: “This club is guided in a commercial way and it is not always possible to meet commercial and football expectations.”Amorim, like Van Gaal, had to walk into the place to realise the scale of the job. Only Real Madrid are analogous as a club where the head coach is public property, his results not ranking as far ahead of matters such as off-field tittle-tattle and gossip, social media reaction and press releases trumpeting the latest sponsor as they should. This is the deal, and Amorim walked in with eyes open. But as David Moyes, Van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag found, in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, nothing can prepare for the realpolitik of piloting the club. Statesman, media performer, fan favourite, club cheerleader, players’ guru and, yes, the man who must win every game via an XI embodying the United way of “attack, attack, attack”.It is clear why the role is attractive. A sizeable paycheque (Amorim earns a cool £9m a year); the CV-burnishing status of being the club’s choice; and the sporting challenge: be the one who gets this right and wins a 21st top-division title, and the first sinceFerguson’s in 2013, and immortality is yours.But pulling the feat off is like an nth-degree Rubik’s Cube. Amorim is always being observed, analysed, dissected, judged – however significant or innocuous an act. Or, like the philosopher Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon, it feels as if he is – which is the same thing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He remains in situ but how long before the inquests into his position start up again? Possibly about five minutes after the end of Sunday’s encounter if United lose.In The Truman Show, Truman Burbank unknowingly lives in a world that is a reality TV series. With his every move entertainment, he is dehumanised, a dollar sign only. Burbank’s catchphrase is: “In case I don’t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.” This may be Amorim’s fate too.A view may be, who cares? Amorim is a big boy. The point here is the sport: the task of returning the club to the top. He has to win while taming the hydra-headed monster that is United and this is not possible in the short term. So while he shares culpability in overseeing a £200m summer spend that came up short of an elite goalkeeper or No 6, Amorim should be able to make missteps such as the defeats against Grimsby and Arsenal and the draw at Fulham and not face end-of-times hysteria.The rebuild Amorim undertakes is bound to be messy at times because of the mess he inherited.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimanalysisShareReuse this content"

Denmark’s Mads Pedersen was the first to make his move but could not hold off Philipsen and he crossed the line in second place with Venezuela’s Orluis Aular third.Vuelta a España: Ganna wins time-trial stage shortened after pro-Palestine protestsRead moreVisma-Lease a Bike’s Vingegaard finished safely in the bunch after picking up an unexpected four bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint in Salamanca, 60km from the finish, when Almeida was caught napping.Saturday’s penultimate stage is a brutal mountainous route featuring more than 4,000m of climbing, offering the last realistic chance for Almeida to catch Vingegaard.With no chance for the sprinters to battle it out since he won stage eight in Zaragoza, Philipsen seized his opportunity with a lung-bursting sprint on an uphill drag to the line after being perfectly set up by his team.“It was a really tough finish and after 11 days not going this deep it hurts,” Philipsen told TNT Sports. “The final 250m was more flat but before that the team did amazing. I was struggling in the middle but I pushed through and when I saw the finish line it was really nice. We will try to repeat on Sunday. It’s been a tough three weeks.”Vingegaard, closing in on his first Vuelta triumph after twice winning the Tour de France, lost some seconds in Thursday’s time trial but extended his lead over Almeida with a sneaky attack in the centre of Salamanca.With Almeida’s UAE Team Emirates-XRG failing to notice his move, Vingegaard pounced to lead the peloton across the intermediate sprint line behind Jakub Otruba, who spent half the race alone after an early solo breakaway.Vingegaard has looked comfortable in the red jersey but the four extra seconds will give him a boost ahead of Saturday’s 165km stage that ends at the Bola del Mundo at the top of the Navacerrada mountain pass and features five categorised climbs.Britain’s Tom Pidcock retained third place overall for Q36.5 ProCyclingon Friday and will start the penultimate stage 2min 43sec back and seeking to seal his first general classification podium finish in a Grand Tour.

Both athletes had previously won world championship medals.The 21-year-old Knighton, who won a world championship bronze over 200m in 2022 and silver in 2023, had blamed his failed drugs test last year on contaminated oxtail imported from abroad. However on Friday the court of arbitration for sport rejected Knighton’s defence. A press release said: “There is no proof that would support the conclusion that oxtail imported into the USA would be likely to contain trenbolone residues at the level required to have caused the athlete’s adverse analytical finding.”As a result the star, who finished fourth in the men’s 200m at the Paris Olympics, was banned until 2029.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On Friday Cas also ruled that Welteji, who is the third fastest woman in the world over 1500m this year, would be ineligible to compete in Tokyo while she awaited a ruling on a drug-testing case. The 2023 world 1500m silver medallist was initially cleared by Ethiopia’s national anti-doping agency after refusing to take an out-of-competition drug test without justification on 21 May.However, theAthleticsIntegrity Unit, which combats doping in international track and field, reviewed the case and appealed against that ruling to Cas this week along with World Athletics. The AIU also asked the court to rule Welteji ineligible to compete pending the case outcome, which it did on Friday.“The request for provisional measures has been upheld and Ms Welteji is suspended for the duration of the Cas arbitration procedure,” Cas said. “The parties are exchanging written proceedings and with their ­agreement, a hearing will be scheduled. Proceedings whilst ongoing are confidential and Cas is unable to ­provide additional information until the alleged anti-doping rule violation is further examined.”View image in fullscreenDiribe Welteji finished fourth in the women’s 1500m at the Paris Olympics.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APWelteji, who was fourth in the 1500m at the Paris Olympics, was due to compete over the same distance in Tokyo.

The 27-year-old claimed he hit certain shots on the West Course on Friday that “hurt my soul”.Hovland has been in a state of technical flux all year, with his driving a particular cause for concern. He is perfectly candid about that, despite rounds of 67 and 66 at this PGA Championship. Hovland’s next start will come as part of team Europe in theRyder Cup.‘It’s like the Olympics’: Patrick Reed against Ryder Cup player paymentRead more“It’s making the game a bit more stressful than it should be,” Hovland said. “It’s just frustrating as a golfer when this is my game. I step up and I have an intention of wanting to start the ball a certain height and start it left of the target and curve it, and then the ball starts high and right, complete opposite of what I’m trying to do. That’s just frustrating. But I know how to play. So I’m doing the best I can.“I shot 80 at the Players earlier this year and I won the next week. I would rather not play the game of golf that way because that is not how I used to do it. Obviously I like to focus on what I need to work on, but at the same time I need to be proud of myself that I’m still able to come around here and compete after two rounds when it doesn’t feel very good.“I’m super happy to be where I’m at and scoring-wise, it’s incredible to be honest. I really am struggling off the tee and I’m just trying to do whatever I can just to put it in the fairway. Trying not to hit it off line and in the trees. But I do want to play the game a little bit more stress-free.”Hovland will begin day three a shot behind Hideki Matsuyama after the Japanese’s 64. Justin Rose and Ludvig Åberg are alongside Hovland on 11 under.Hovland was far more upbeat on Europe’s chances at Bethpage as they seek a rare win on American soil. Hovland was a star for Europe in Rome two years ago, claiming three and a half points.“I think the record speaks for itself,” Hovland said. “All the guys have had great years. I think what’s really cool is that we have 11 out of the 12 same guys [from the last Ryder Cup] and we have the same captain. As a team, we’re a known commodity. We know that this is successful.“We don’t have to go to Bethpage and wonder if this is going to work versus maybe the American side, you know, there’s a lot of new guys and new captain. They maybe have some more insecurities, maybe. I think a strength that we have is we know our squad well and we know that it works.”Rory McIlroy’s turbulent day saw the Masters champion flirt with the cut line after dropping three shots in his opening five holes. McIlroy responded with five birdies but produced a painful double bogey at the last. This all added up to a level par 72, which leaves McIlroy eight shy of Hovland.

Mishra, who is already a world record-holder as the youngest ever grandmaster, at 12 years four months, set another landmark when, aged 16 years seven months, hedefeated Gukeshin round five to become the youngest player to win against a reigning world champion, breaking the record set 33 years earlier by Gata Kamsky of the US, then 17 years 10 months,against Garry Kasparovat Dortmund 1992.Mishra was modest about the game: “Even though I won, it doesn’t feel pleasing, because I had a winning position but just threw it away. Later he made some mistakes and I got it back, but overall it wasn’t a very clean game.”View image in fullscreen3989:Vladimir Shulman v Vladimir Feldman, Riga Open 1986. White to move and win.The second historic game was in round four, when Turkey’s Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus overwhelmed India’s ­Mittal Aditya by a barrage of brilliancies. The “Turkish Immortal” allowed two white queens on the board, then sacrificed the black queen for a pawn, followed by checkmate by a previously unmoved black pawn. It was even more brilliant than Bobby ­Fischer’s 1956 “Game of the Century” against Donald Byrne.Aditya v Erdogmus is given here twice: first withthe bare moves, then with theChessbase India videoof the game as it actually happened, with the moves sped up as if they were playing blitz. Magnus Carlsen, commenting onTake Take Take, paid Erdogmus a huge compliment: “Erdogmus is really, really good, at almost unprecedented levels at that age.”The young Turk impressed again with a difficult defence against ­Abdusattorov, who tried for eight hours and 190 moves to win with queen and rook pawn against queen. In round seven Erdogmus was well beaten by Niemann, but in round eight he defeated the US star Levon Aronian to advance to five points, with an outside chance of qualifying.Meanwhile, India’s Gukesh, who is competing at Samarkand hors de concours, continues to have a truly disastrous tournament. Following his round five age record loss to Mishra, Gukesh was beaten in round six by the little-known Greek GM Nikolas Theodorou, after the champion’s claim for a draw by threefold repetition was rejected by the arbiter.In round seven, Gukesh lost for the third time in a row, as Turkey’s other teenage star Ediz Gurel, 16, became the second youngest after Mishra to defeat a reigning world champion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again Gukesh stood worse, but Divya was satisfied to draw and equal the record result for a woman against a reigning world champion, while Gukesh has now dropped out of the world top 10.Overall in the Grand Swiss, the small group of elite GMs who monopolise invitations to valuable all-play-all tournaments have failed so far to demonstrate any clear superiority to lower ranked opponents.

It’s not necessary at our club, because we also trade players. If a player wants to leave and we get the right money for him, this club has shown so many years now that we then sell.“You can just keep on training here – Lucho [Luis Díaz] and Harvey [Elliott] get their transfers, Tyler Morton gets his transfer, all these players, I can come up with eight, nine, 10 I think in the last window, that just conduct themselves in the best possible way.”Isak featured for only 18 minutes during the international break due to his lack of match fitness. He had spent time training alone at former club Real Sociedad during the summer but did not feature during that time. Slot admitted it will take the player time to get up to speed but has no doubt he will eventually display his talents forLiverpool. “He is one of the best in the world,” said the head coach. “But for him to become the best, I think the best players in the world win trophies.”“It [the fee] might put pressure on him and me but nothing extra – if you have this [Liverpool badge] on your shirt there is always pressure,” Slot added. “We target a player and we want to have him. We decide what his value is, if that matches with what the club wants then we are not afraid to act. We get that money from trading players and winning the league after we didn’t spend anything at all.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Change has come quickly, but Frank is confident that the transition will be smooth over the next few months.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“I’ve spoken to a few from the Lewis family and Peter Charrington, the new non-exec chairman,” said the head coach. “I also spoke to him before – he was on the board. So there’s been good, constructive conversations and I feel the backing and they’re happy.“I think it’s fair to say things have gone quite quickly, so I’m also quite convinced that the next couple of months I will be more aware of the future plans. Hopefully we will make them together. I think that’s the best way to do it. Everything I sense, I feel and I’ve been told is positivity and backing.”Frank was only appointed by Spurs in June, meaning he had little experience of working with Levy. “It’s not that Daniel was out there on the training pitch or in the meeting rooms,” the former Brentford manager said. “It is basically business as usual for me. I don’t think it has changed too much for me personally so far. Of course there are people who have worked with Daniel for so much longer. It is most likely more different for them.”Members of the Lewis family are expected to be in attendance when Spurs visit West Ham on Saturday evening. There has been talk of greater transparency from the board and a bigger focus on sporting success. “It’s very important to be transparent and to be clear,” Frank said. “What we are dealing with, what is the ambition, can we adjust expectations, are we on the same page, what is the strategy, are we aligned – that’s absolutely crucial.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank was appointed when Daniel Levy was still executive chair of Tottenham.Photograph: Nigel French/PA“That was pretty clear since I’ve been appointed and through the transfer window, what are the targets, how did we want to do things, so that’s been good and I expect it to be good.“I think we all want to win as much as possible. I’d say we had a fine window and I’m pretty sure we know where we are in the food chain and what we’re competing against. From now we need to build and compete.”Frank said there could be debuts in attack for Randal Kolo Muani and Xavi Simons against West Ham. He added that Kolo Muani has not been signed because of concerns over the ankle issue that will prevent Dominic Solanke from making the trip to the London Stadium.Frank also backed Mohammed Kudus to deal with a hostile reception from the home crowd when the winger faces West Ham for the first time since leaving them last summer.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

A 5-1 defeat of West Ham coming after their opening4-1 win over London City Lionessesonly added to the good vibes. They have shown they can beat the best, now they have to prove they can beat the best, the worst and those in between consistently.Grace Geyoro and Alyssa Thompson ready to take up Olivia Smith’s challenge in WSL’s £1m clubRead moreRenée Slegers’ side made it difficult for themselves for the second game in a row, though. This time it was an own goal from goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar that put them in trouble, before strikes by Frida Maanum, Stina Blackstenius, Caitlin Foord and two from Alessia Russo ensured the European champions maintained a 100% start to the season.“Very much,” said Slegers, when asked how keen she is for her side to iron out the mistakes that have put them behind in consecutive games. “They’re not the scenarios you want, not in your opening game at the Emirates with so many fans and everyone very excited, but also not when you go away and play West Ham, because we respect this ground and this opponent and we know they can make it really hard for us, and that’s what they did.”It took the Hammers five minutes to earn a shock lead, Shekiera Martinez’s teasing ball to the back post slipping through the hands of Van Domselaar and coming back off the post on to her head and in. It was weird, and unfortunate, but the goalkeeper should have reckoned with the ball being as slick as it was.Having had to come from a goal down against London City Lionesses on the opening weekend of the WSL season, when Kosovare Asllani converted from the spot after she was brought down by Katie Reid, there was a feeling of deja vu. Did Arsenal enjoy having their backs against the wall? Probably not, but there is something to be said for the grit and togetherness created by such situations.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Foord heads Arsenal’s third from a cross by Mariona Caldentey.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesArsenal were soon dominant in front of an away crowd to rival the home contingent and in the 21st minute were deservedly level. It was nice work from Russo on the left to hold on to the ball and find Beth Mead, who delivered her third assist of the season, slipping the ball through the legs of Finland’s Oona Siren to Maanum, who turned in past Megan Walsh.It was a goal that was a testament to Arsenal’s depth, Maanum one of three changes to the team that saw off London City.It was hardly a thriller, but once the rain stopped, play improved and Arsenal clicked into gear. It was the half-time substitution of Maanum for Champions League final goalscorer Blackstenius that helped Arsenal break the deadlock, Russo’s backheel rifled into the far corner by the Sweden forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ultimately, their season will not be defined by results against the top four, but having troubled those teams last season, with draws earned against Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, and Arsenal needing to come from behind against the Hammers to secure a 4-3 win in March, there will be disappointment that they weren’t able to do more.“If you look at the scoreline, it’s obviously not one that you want to walk away with,” said their manager, Rehanne Skinner. “They are European champions. It’s always going to be a big test and we’re trying to be a little bit braver in what we do, so sometimes we can get caught a ­little bit with that and they’ve got the capability to punish you.”Russo put the cherry on top with two goals in three minutes late on. First, substitute Olivia Smith set her up to lash into the top corner from the edge of the box. Then Smith was brought down on a tricky run into the area and up stepped Russo to convert the penalty. It was clinical and efficient and Arsenal sit top of the WSL.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWest Ham United WomenWomen's footballArsenal Womenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hirst’s goal came after 61 minutes and Clarke added the fifth 12 minutes from full time. Ipswich climb to 11th as a result of the victory but Sellés’s Blades remain rooted to the bottom of the table without a point.The hosts had a great chance to take the lead in the 11th minute when a cross from Leif Davis just evaded Chuba Akpom, as United goalkeeper Michael Cooper got a hand to the ball. A wonderful through-ball from Swedish midfielder Jens Cajuste then found Kasey McAteer wide on the right and his shot was parried away by Cooper.Ipswich took the lead when Philogene collected the ball wide on the left and cut inside into the penalty area to rifle a shot into the far corner of the net. Philogene was creating havoc for the visiting defenders, setting Akpom away but his cross failed to find a blue shirt in the six-yard box.Philogene made it 2-0 soon after the restart. Hirst and Akpom combined in midfield to set the winger free down the left and his mesmerising run across the penalty area ended with another fine shot beyond Cooper.An effort from Tom Cannon had Ipswich’s keeper, Alex Palmer, scurrying across his goal to palm the ball to safety but the hosts extended their lead further when Hirst challenged for the ball in the penalty area and his tame shot went through Cooper’s legs and in.Hirst had the ball in the net again soon after but was adjudged to be offside, before Philogene completed his hat-trick with another wonderful strike.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manager said on Friday that had not been the case but said he had concerns about whether the arrival of Jaydee Canvot, a 19-year-old who cost an initial £21m from Toulouse after 14 Ligue 1 starts, would leave them short in defence.“At the end of the many discussions, the chairman asked me, ‘Oliver, do you think we can manage the season when we sell Marc?’ And I said, ‘Steve, honestly, I think we can’t manage it in the short term,’” said Glasner.“If we buy a 19-year-old fantastic player with about 1,000 minutes in Ligue 1 and sell our captain with about 15,000 minutes in the Premier League, I think we can’t manage it in the short term. And then we have three centre-backs. With our schedule, and if we have an injury in the back three, I think it’s very, very risky.“If you want this scenario for Crystal Palace, and you are fine with it, sell Marc. If you don’t want to have this for Crystal Palace, then we have to keep him. And then he decided we keep him. So, big credit to the chairman. I didn’t have to threaten anybody. There was no tensions between the chairman and myself. It was really just a discussion about sports.”It is understood that Guéhi, who has less than a year on his contract, was extremely unhappy with Palace’s U-turn and considered whether to continue as captain. Glasner confirmed Guéhi had been disappointed at first but said he had no doubts about the commitment of a player whoimpressed on England dutyover the past week.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi put the disappointment of his failed transfer behind him during the international break with England.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“Not any more,” he said. “He signed the contract for Crystal Palace many years ago. Nobody forced him to sign this contract. And it was clear for him that he sticks to his contract. And that was a credit to Marc. He never [went on] strike, he never threatened to do this. Because he’s a very honest person. And that’s why I never worried about this situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool broke their transfer record twice this summer,signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusenin a deal which could rise to £116m, beforespending £125m on Isak on deadline day.The champions spent more than £400m, though their net outlay was slightly less than that of Arsenal, who recruited eight players. Liverpool have won their first three games and signed off for the international break with a1-0 win over Arsenalat Anfield.Amorim says United are ‘a better team’; Wissa, Ramsey and Delap face injury layoffs – liveRead moreArteta, asked how the arrival of Isak atLiverpoolcould shape the title race, said: “They are the strongest for sure. They have recruited the two most decisive players that were in Europe in the market [Isak and Wirtz], and they did really well to do that. They were very, very strong, and we need to look at ourselves and what we have to do in terms of our abilities to be better than them.”Arsenal finished 10 points behind Liverpool last season. Pressed as to how hard it could be to stop Liverpool, theArsenalmanager said: “It is not about Liverpool but the league in general and how difficult it will be with the level that it is to be so consistent and win the amount of matches you need to earn the right to win the title. That is going to be a really long run for all of us.”Arsenal host Nottingham Forest on Saturday lunchtime and will again be without Bukayo Saka, who sustained a hamstring injury in the5-0 win over Leedslast month. Arteta allayed fears that the key defender William Saliba could be absent for a prolonged period, saying the France international – who went off in the fifth minute at Liverpool – had trained on Friday and was in contention to face Forest.Explore more on these topicsMikel ArtetaLiverpoolArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

He should be a promising prospect at the age of 17 to 20; occupy a clear position on the pitch; be one of the five most important players in a team; perform consistently over many years; prove himself in international competition; and be physically strong. This applies to virtually all those players in this price range: Kylian Mbappé, Neymar, Ronaldo, Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Ousmane Dembélé.Two German footballers moved to the Premier League for such a sum in the summer. One of them meets these criteria. Florian Wirtz’s career has been impressive. He caught the football’s attention as a teenager. It was only a matter of time before he made his breakthrough.Barcelona in Miami; Milan in Perth? Welcome to the league of anywhere | Jonathan LiewRead moreHaving just turned 17, Wirtz made his mark in theBundesligaand immediately became a key player. He played for Germany at 18 and was the decisive player in Bayer Leverkusen’s first league title at 20.Every time he takes to the pitch, you can see how Wirtz interprets his No 10 role. He solves difficult situations, sets up new ones and, as an individualist who puts himself at the service of everyone else, is the ideal team player. His actions and performances are reliable for coaches and teammates.He chose his new club for sporting reasons.Liverpool, the English champions, have specifically strengthened their stable formation with him.It takes time to fit into a team. This is especially true for a player who makes a difference. So far, he is getting into his groove and adapting to the pace and intensity of the Premier League. He passes the ball early, which gives him increasing confidence and allows him to gradually take more risks.In the first half against Arsenal, what caught the eye was Wirtz as a team player, and in the second half, his brilliance. He played razor‑sharp passes, took the ball superbly with his right foot in the penalty area and shot with his left. With him, his team became stronger and won. Wirtz’s qualities are becoming increasingly apparent at Liverpool.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s Anthony Gordon is tackled by Liverpool’s Florian Wirtz.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersThe case of Nick Woltemade is different. He is 23, a good year older than Wirtz, but became a regular player in a first division team only after scoring two goals against Heidenheim nine months ago. At the age when Wirtz won the double with Leverkusen, Woltemade was playing on loan in the German third tier for a season.It is unclear how well he will perform in the Champions League. He has not played in the competition because Stuttgart did not include him in their squad for it last season. He has not yet scored against big teams, his most important goal coming in the cup final against the third-tier side Arminia Bielefeld.He is a player with virtually no track record. At the European Under-21 Championship this summer, he was the top scorer – one of the oldest players in one of the oldest teams. The best footballers, such as Lamine Yamal, Bellingham, Jamal Musiala and Wirtz, do not take part in such tournaments having long since outgrown the level.Woltemade is unpredictable, his dribbling, passing and shooting are not found in the textbooks; they are unique, with no international comparison. Unlike other top players, his centre of gravity is rarely at the centre of the movement. He thrives on his free spirit and self-confidence and seems to want to reinvent the game at No 9.But he has not yet developed any consistency or patterns – not in his first touch, not in his combination play, not in his timing on headers, not in his shooting. His goals are not the logical consequence of excellent actions and skills. His excellence is not repeatable. And he still has to prove that he can last 50 games in a season, because he is tall but not robust.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade celebrates scoring a goal for Stuttgart. The German had wanted a move to Bayern Munich before signing for Newcastle.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersThe €85m (£73.5m) that Newcastle are paying for Woltemade is therefore a gamble. For the player, the new contract is a once-in-a-lifetime project. He wanted to go to Bayern Munich, and when someone else paid the asking price, he went there. The owners from Saudi Arabia and the club’s management are new to the business. In a gold rush atmosphere, mistakes are made and miracles are believed in.That is the difference between the two transfers. Liverpool want to develop a successful team through the principle of selection. At Anfield people don’t mind that Wirtz costs €125m because they know that this is sports business at the highest level, whose market value can be compared only to art, film or pop music. This has nothing to do with club life and voluntary work any more. When investments are made according to a strategy, paying customers accept it.Under the caring guidance of Arne Slot, something interesting seems to be emerging in Liverpool. Something you want to be a part of. I can well understand why Wirtz was convinced. I experienced it myself at Bayern from 2010 to 2017 and with Germany from 2004 to 2014. Both teams went through a long process, becoming stronger through transfers or new players coming through. In the end, the sum was greater than the individual parts.I will draw on this community for the rest of my life. Wirtz can now experience something similar, at least at club level. It will be exciting to see whether Liverpool will be a really great team and whether he will be the final piece of the puzzle. As a fan, I hope so, and I am happy to identify with that.Philipp Lahm’s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch atDie Zeit, the German online magazine.

Enquiries remain ongoing and no arrests have been made at this stage.”The alleged spiking is understood to have taken place at a cricket-themed pub in Chelsea, The ­Boundary, which is co-owned by England cricket’s head coach, Brendon McCullum and white-ball batter Jos Buttler, among other members of the England set-up.The 50-over World Cup winning captain Eoin Morgan, the former one-day international batter Sam Billings, the former South Africa captain Graeme Smith and the Ireland cricketer Paul Stirling are also shareholders, as is the England and ­British Lions rugby union hooker Jamie George.None of the sports star owners were present at the time of the alleged ­incident, which was said to have taken place on the first day of ­England’s one-off Test match against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge on 22 May.Due to the pub’s ownership, the England and Wales Cricket Board has been aware of the allegations for some time. When contacted by the ­Guardian it declined to comment.The Boundary opened in March and has quickly gained a reputation for attracting current and former cricketers for late-night drinks this summer. While not directly involved, the incident may invite awkward questions for the ECB, particularly ahead of this winter’s Ashes tour.English cricket has been troubled by numerous cases of sexual ­misconduct in recent years. An unnamed former county coach was suspended from the sport for nine months in August after admitting to sending sexually explicit ­pictures to two female junior members of staff.After being found guilty by the ECB’s independent Cricket Discipline Panel, his name was redacted on the grounds there would be a “serious risk of harm” if his identity were made public.The coach had admitted to five charges of professional misconduct, including sending explicit images to two colleagues, with the panel noting that one of the women “was much younger” and “he occupied a far more senior position than she did” at the club.In November last year a professional coach was suspended for six months for “inappropriate sexual behaviour” on a pre-season tour for an unnamed men’s and women’s county team.Explore more on these topicsCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

His strike-rate for each-way backers is 85%.Sweet William was bumped leaving the stalls, took a few strides to find his balance and was then ridden by Havlin to make up the lost ground before tacking himself on at the back of the field. And there he stayed until leaving the turn for home, when Havlin stoked him up for one relentless run down the straight that carried him nearly four lengths clear at the line.Havlin is a long-serving No 2 at the Gosden stable but he is the only jockey to have ridden Sweet William and he thanked Philippa and Nick Cooper, the gelding’s owners, for their loyalty after the partnership’s sixth career success. “Loyalty can be a dirty word in this game but they’ve been unbelievable to me,” Havlin said. “There’s no right or wrong way to ride him. He’s a real character, but he’s got a lot of ability.”There are potential Group One targets for Sweet William in the weeks ahead but John Gosden suggested afterwards that the Coopers have already decided instead to plan towards a return to Town Moor next autumn.“Philippa wants to go out on a high and we’ll build up to the Doncaster Cup next year via a few interesting races,” Gosden said. “They are great, these Cup horses, and people enjoy them. They are exciting for the crowds as a lot of our Flat horses disappear too quickly.”View image in fullscreenSweet William, ridden by Robert Havlin, on his way to winning the Howard Wright Doncaster Cup Stakes.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAn impressive display of raw, front-running speed secured the main supporting race on the card as Tim Easterby’s Revival Power, a sister to the stable’s Group One-winning Winter Power, led throughout in the Group Two Flying Childers Stakes.“She’s a natural front-runner and she’s got that bit of kick,” Easterby said. “She is definitely going to improve at three.”Lambourn to complete Derby-Leger doubleJust seven runners will go to post for the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, the final Classic of the Flat campaign, but it is a race with real depth in terms of quality and sees the first appearance of a Derby winner in this historic contest since Camelot’s narrow failure to land the Triple Crown in 2012.Camelot, inevitably, was a red-hot favourite when he succumbed to Encke by three-quarters of a length 13 years ago. Lambourn, though, is only second-favourite for the Leger behind Scandinavia, a stable-companion at the Aidan O’Brien yard, despite having taken the Epsom Classic by nearly four lengths in June before following up in the Irish equivalent three weeks later.Had Lambourn been sent straight to the Leger after his win at the Curragh, he would surely head the market, but he was well below his best when fifth, at odds-on, in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, while Scandinavia can boast an eight-length win in the Bahrain Trophy and a Group One success in the Goodwood Cup on his last two starts.Saturday’s race is far from a two-horse contest, though, as Paddy Twomey’s Carmers was in front of Scandinavia when successful in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, and around two lengths ahead of Lambourn when second in the Voltigeur.All seven runners, in fact, have a glimmer of a chance – even the 40-1 outsider, Rahiebb, was within a length of Carmers at Royal Ascot – but Lambourn was a convincing Derby winner just three months ago and very much looked as though the race would bring him on when he was beaten at York.He is also completely unexposed at 14 furlongs and a strong-travelling galloper who could well improve for the step up in trip. Scandinavia and Carmers will offer strong opposition, butLambourn (3.40)has been edging ever close to the top of the betting in recent days and still looks fairly priced at around 5-2.Doncaster 1.15Easier ground could be whatTreble Teeneeds to return to winning form after excellent efforts in defeat on his last two starts.Doncaster 1.50Gewanshowed a good attitude to maintain his unbeaten record at York last month and is narrowly preferred to Oxagon, a wide-margin winner last time out.Chester 2.05There is little to choose between Hamish, the warm favourite, andMilitary Academyon their form at Goodwood in June, so a 3lb swing in favour of John & Thady Gosden’s gelding makes him a logical pick at the likely odds.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowDoncaster1.15 Treble Tee 2.50 Gewan 2.25 Apollo One (nap) 3.00 Shadow Of Light 3.40 Lambourn 4.15 Mr Wonka 4.50 Fantasy BelieverLingfield1.25 One Million Dreams 1.58 Beccadelli 2.33 Rogue Dynasty 3.13 Kingsclere 3.55 Summertime Blues 4.30 Parish Councillor 5.00 ClearpointChester1.35 Wild Dahlia 2.05 Military Academy 2.40 Ndaawi (nb) 3.23 Hanney Girl 4.00 Glistening Nights 4.35 Giant 5.05 Heathen 5.35 Sir Edward LearBath3.28 Somebodycomegether 4.05 Cloudbuster 4.40 Under Curfew 5.10 Goodwood Mogul 5.40 Tamzan 6.13 Baynoona 6.45 Blue Point Express 7.15 Mrs MeaderMusselburgh4.10 Martin’s Brig 4.45 Welbury 5.18 Straight Ahead 5.50 Penn Avenue 6.22 Maghlaak 6.52 Red Mirage 7.22 SixcorWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doncaster 2.25Apollo Onehas been operating below his best so far this season but he was an unlucky loser of this race 12 months ago, behind a subsequent Group One winner in American Affair, and is 1lb lower in the ratings this time around.Chester 2.40Gordon Elliott’sNdaawitrailed home in last place in the Cesarewitch on his latest start on the Flat but two big runs in ultra-competitive handicap hurdles since that setback suggest that he remains well-handicapped on the level.Doncaster 3.00A slight ease in grade could seeShadow Of Light,last year’s Dewhurst winner, gain a confidence-boosting win.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Until last year he’d never fought above 147lb and in his most recent outing last August he weighed 153.4lb inedging Israil Madrimov. Now, after months of adding bulk, he stands one night away fromchallenging for all four of Álvarez’s belts at 168lb.Quick GuideCanelo Álvarez v Terence CrawfordShow•Canelo  v  Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredWhat's happening?Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line?Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Where can I watch it?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.Who else is fighting?The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweightMain card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championshipWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Álvarez, a four-division champion who has campaigned at 168lb or above for nearly seven years, also came in at 167½lb, looking at ease and unfazed in his latest trip to the scales.The official weigh-in, held behind closed doors at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, was notable less for drama than for its secrecy. The headliners stepped on the scale in separate rooms away from the assembled media and the 18 other fighters on Saturday’s card. Organizers offered no explanation. A ceremonial weigh-in open to the public at T-Mobile Arena was scheduled for Friday evening.View image in fullscreenSaúl “Canelo” Álvarez, left, and Terence Crawford each came in at 167½lb on Friday morning ahead of their super-middleweight title fight.Photograph: Zuffa BoxingThe fact both men hit the same number belied the disparity in questions each faces.For Álvarez, 63-2-2 with 39 knockouts, the issue is whether at 35, and having gone nearly four years without stopping an opponent inside the distance, he can rediscover the destructive form that made him boxing’s biggest attraction.For Crawford, 37, the doubts circle around whether his sharpness and timing can offset Álvarez’s natural size and granite chin. The durable Nebraskan has never been knocked down or seriously hurt but neither has Álvarez, a fact that looms large as they prepare to meet in front of more than 70,000 fans on Mexican Independence Day weekend.Should Crawford succeed, he will become the first male boxer of the four-belt era to reign as undisputed champion in three separate weight classes, adding to his clean sweeps at junior welterweight and welterweight. The oddsmakers list Álvarez as a slight favorite but the odds against Crawford have shortened materially in recent weeks, indicating heavy action on the American.The scheduled 12-round bout is the main event of a 10-fight card taking place at the $2bn home of the NFL’s Raiders, which can hold more than 70,000 spectators. It will easily shatter the attendance record for boxing in Las Vegas, set in 1982 when 29,214 watched Larry Holmes batter Gerry Cooney in a purpose-built outdoor arena built in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The fighters on Saturday’s televised undercard also made weight: Ireland’s Callum Walsh (153.5lb) against Fernando Vargas Jr (153lb), Christian Mbilli (167lb) against Lester Martinez (167lb), and Serhii Bohachuk (155lb) against Brandon Adams (156lb).Explore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Crawford, 37, isattempting the jump of a lifetime: moving up two full divisions to that weight for the first time after winning his fourth world title last year in his 154lb debut. That size gap is at the heart of Saturday’s intrigue. And because the fight will be carried globally on Netflix at no extra cost to subscribers, it could draw the largest audience ever for a major championship bout.But is that all you really need to know? What about the rules, how much they’re getting paid and why it’s even happening in the first place? Read on for all the answers ...Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead moreThe main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ring walks until around 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line in Canelo v Crawford?Canelo’s undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Around that core, the promoters have piled on the trimmings: The Ring magazine’s specially commissioned strap said to cost $188,000, the WBC’s ornate Nahui Huey Altepemeh commemorative belt and a new ‘Crown Series’ championship ring designed in Los Angeles and valued at more than $100,000, set with nearly 10 carats of stones.How much are tickets?A sellout is expected, though some seats were still available at press time. The cheapest tickets started around $400 plus fees, while lower-bowl seats were going for several thousand dollars.High-end packages include premium floor spots near the ring, VIP access to the weigh-in and post-fight party, backstage hospitality and concierge services – bundles that run well into five figures.Where can I watch Canelo v Crawford?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this signficance will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with undercard bouts leading into the main event.Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and German. Unlike traditional pay-per-view – which often costs US fans around $90 – this one is included in a standard subscription.Why Netflix?In a media landscape where TV ratings are falling off across the board,live sports continue to buck the trend. That’s caught the attention of media and tech giants like Amazon (whobought into the NFL) and Apple (whobought Messi), among other billion-dollar bets on sports programming as a driver for subscriptions.Netflix has aggressively moved into live sports, seeing big fights and special events as a driver for subscriptions and global buzz. After testing the waters with the Netflix Cup (a golf pro-am with F1 drivers) and the Netflix Slam (a tennis exhibition between Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal in Las Vegas), it has since added NFL games on Christmas Day and staged the Jake Paul–Mike Tyson card earlier this year.Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break recordsRead moreWith more than 280m subscribers worldwide, Netflix is betting Canelo v Crawford can deliver unprecedented viewership for boxing, bringing in casual fans who wouldn’t otherwise buy a pay-per-view.Who is Turki al-Sheikh and what’s his role?Turki al-Sheikh, the Saudi adviser and chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, has become one of boxing’s most influential power brokers. Over the past two years he has staged mega-cards in Riyadh featuring Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk, reshaping the sport’s economics with Saudi backing.Al-Sheikh was instrumental in reviving Canelo v Crawford after talks of the dream matchup collapsed, securing the bout for Las Vegas as part of a broader partnership with Dana White’s new Zuffa Boxing venture. He also pushed for a multi-day festival around fight week – from public workouts at the Fontainebleau to a WWE-AAA wrestling show and a UFC card – ensuring the event doubled as a Mexican Independence Day weekend spectacle.Why is this fight happening?Since each man is already a first-ballot Hall of Famer beyond any credible dispute, it’s less of a legacy-defining fight that a legacy-enhancing one.Álvarez, boxing’s biggest star who has won titles in four divisons from 154lb to 175lb, has spent the last few years consolidating and defending the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles at 168lb while generating a series of record-breaking gates. Terence Crawford, long viewed as the sport’s most complete technician, unified the 147lb division withhis demolition of Errol Spence Jr in 2023before taking his first and only fight above welterweight, winning an alphabet title at 154lb. Both men are running out of opponents that make sense around their natural weights as they near the end of their careers, so a blockbuster summit meeting like this suddenly made a lot of sense.For Crawford, it’s a chance to become a three-division undisputed champion after previously unifying all the major world titles at 140lb and 147lb, something no male fighter has accomplished in the four-belt era. For Álvarez, it’s an opportunity to silence critics who say he’s avoided the toughest challengers in recent years and add yet another Hall of Fame name to his résumé.What are the rules for the fight?The fight is a standard, fully sanctioned 12-round championship bout for Álvarez’s undisputed super middleweight title. Both men will be required to come in at or under the division limit of 168lb at Friday’s weigh-in in under the limit. The Nevada Athletic Commission will appoint three judges to decide the fight if it goes the distance.Should we be worried about the weight difference?Unlike the Paul–Tyson spectacle, Canelo v Crawford poses no questions about safety or sanctioning. Both fighters are active, elite and ranked on most pound-for-pound lists.The main concern here is competitive balance. Álvarez is the naturally bigger man, unbeaten at the 168lb division where he’s campaigned for nearly seven years. Over that span Crawford has fought almost exclusively at 147lb, save forone fight at 154lblast year. So while Crawford is officially climbing two weight classes to face Álvarez, it’s more like three divisions from where he’s demonstrated he’s comfortable.Still, across a combined 765 rounds fought in their careers, neither fighter has ever been knocked down or seriously hurt.How much are they getting paid?Canelo is expected to earn around $150m for the fight, including at least $80m as part of his deal with Riyadh Season. Crawford revealed that he will receive $10m in a May episode of the Ring Champs with Ak & Barak podcast.Who is on the undercard?The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The order of play is as follows:Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweightsIvan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweightsReito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweightsSultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweightsSteven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweightsMarco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweightMain card (Netflix, from 9pm ET/2am BST on Sunday)Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweightsChristian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweightsMohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweightsWhat time is the ringwalk?It’s hard to pin down an exact time for the main event, but Canelo and Crawford will not make their entrances before 12am ET (5am BST).Who will win Canelo v Crawford?Bookmakers narrowly favor Canelo, citing his experience at super middleweight, his granite chin and his record under the Las Vegas lights. But Crawford’s ability to switch stances, adapt mid-fight and finish opponents makes him the most dangerous challenger Álvarez has faced since Floyd Mayweather.If Canelo’s size and strength prevail, it will cement his dominance at 168. But if Crawford can shock the Mexican icon, he may go down as the most accomplished fighter of his generation – and perhaps the best pound-for-pound boxer of this era.Explore more on these topicsBoxingTurki al-SheikhCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordUS sportsNetflixMexicoexplainersShareReuse this content"

We only had €10 [£8.70] in cash but some people gave us a bit of money so we could get on a bus,” he says.“If the same were to happen in Newcastle, even without physical cash there’s no language barrier so I think it’d be fine. Maybe I’d think differently if I was travelling further or on holiday abroad.”‘I don’t want to leave the window wide open for misuse of my sensitive information’View image in fullscreenRoger, who still uses a physical wallet, says he feels vulnerable taking his phone out of his pocket.Photograph: Roger/Guardian CommunityIn Buckinghamshire, Roger, a retired IT worker, still carries a wallet and a separate coin purse. “Putting my cards on my smartphone would mean having all my eggs in one basket and becomes a single point of failure,” he says.Apart from having some cards that have no electronic equivalent and are necessary for him to carry, the 69-year-old says he feels vulnerable taking his phone out of his pocket. “Flashing it to pay for something in a shop strikes me as a dangerous thing to do and I risk dropping it too.“I worked in IT and security and I recognise that there are windows of opportunity for misuse when it comes to sensitive information.

Not only is his home town, the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, prone to persistent power cuts, he also doubted the quality of his new vehicle.Four months on, Deghareg is pleased with his purchase since he no longer has to endure long lines at the petrol pump, caused by Ethiopia’s chronic fuel shortages.“I’d have to wait two to three hours, even if I got there in the early morning, and they often run out of petrol before it’s your turn,” he says. “Having an EV saves me lots of time. I have no regrets.”View image in fullscreenArchitect Deghareg Bekele at an EV charging station in Addis Ababa.Photograph: Fred HarterUntil recently, electric vehicles were almost unheard of in Ethiopia. But last year it became the first country to ban imports of combustion engine vehicles. Now, EVs are a common sight in the capital. The most prevalent brand is China’s BYD, which recently overtook Tesla as the world’s largest EV maker, although western vehicles are also popular.Roughly 115,000 EVs now ply Ethiopia’s roads, out of a total of 1.5m cars in the country, according to the transport ministry. It wants to increase the number to 500,000 by 2030.Ethiopia is an unlikely proponent of the transition to EVs. Roughly half of its 126 million people haveno access to electricity,only20% of households have access to it for at least 23 hours a dayand only a third of households have access through the grid. Power cuts mean many factories are not fully operational.These shortages will be alleviated to an extent following the opening of theEthiopian Grand Renaissance Damearlier this month, 14 years after construction began. With a maximum capacity of5,150 megawatts, it will double Ethiopia’s current electricity output – 97% of which already comes from hydropower.But problems remain with the national grid, which is prone to outages and will cost billions of dollars to expand to rural communities currently cut off from power.“We have massive potential in renewables,” says Bareo Hassen, state minister for transport. He says the decision to ban imports of diesel and petrol vehicles is part of Ethiopia’s push to promote green policies and reduce the pollution that chokes the capital during rush hour.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River in Guba, north-west Ethiopia, which came online this month.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBut the main motivation is economic, however. Ethiopia spends roughly $4.5bn (£3.3bn) a year importing fuel – a huge amount in a country where foreign currency is scarce and poverty is widespread. “It is one of our main expenditures,” says Bareo.By contrast, Ethiopia’s hydropower is cheap as well as green. This has helped to win over doubtful drivers in Addis Ababa, who have seen pump prices more than double in the past three years.Firew Tilahun, a taxi driver, estimates he used to spend 20,000 Ethiopian birr (£105) a month on fuel, a significant chunk of his earnings. Now he spends less than 3,000 birr a month recharging his Chinese EV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are still hugely expensive, with a BYD model costing roughly 2.2m Ethiopian birr (£11,000) in a country where doctors earn £60 a month on average. But combustion engine cars also fetch sky-high prices, the result of import levies of 200% in place before their ban, which wildly distorted the secondhand vehicle market.Ethiopia is also encouraging local production, but for now the scale is small. One of the main sites is run by Belayneh Kinde Group, an industrial conglomerate with a site on the western outskirts of Addis Ababa, where mechanics are assembling 150 Chinese minibuses in a large hangar.View image in fullscreenElectric vehicles are assembled at a plant on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.Photograph: Fred Harter“Our focus shouldn’t just be on importation,” says Bareo. “We wanted to create a local production capacity to create local skills and job opportunities for our citizens.”The abrupt transition to EVs has been uneven, however. Drivers complain they were given little time to prepare. Ethiopia only has just over 100 charging stations out of a target of more than 2,300, compared with 21,600 in London. Almost all of them are in Addis Ababa. This rules out road trips to the countryside, where power cuts are particularly frequent. It also makes owning an EV hugely impractical outside the capital.View image in fullscreenLema Wakgari charging his electric car. He says there needs to be more charging stations.Photograph: Fred HarterAt another charging station in Addis Ababa, Lema Wakgari, a coffee export manager, says he’s “really happy” with his BYD, but laments that he cannot drive to Hawassa, a popular lakeside resort a 177-mile (285km) drive south from Addis Ababa, without running the risk of getting stranded.“They need to build more charging stations – it’s a must,” he says. “Even in Addis there aren’t many available. No electric vehicles are driving outside the city right now. This car can go 420km. After that, what are you going to do?”Leading the charge: how a drive for electric vehicles is cleaning up NepalRead moreThere are also no plans to bring in electric versions of the heavy lorries that bring a large proportion of Ethiopia’s imports from the port in neighbouring Djibouti. As the fleet begins to dwindle from wear and tear, the economy may feel the effects.The chief executive of a large ride-hailing company in Addis Ababa says most of his drivers are sceptical about the durability of the vehicle’s batteries and how their value will hold up. But he has been won over after buying one himself and hopes the country’s EV infrastructure will catch up to meet demand.“When this policy was introduced, I thought it would be a spectacular failure because we don’t have good power infrastructure, we have a lot of power outages and not many charging stations,” he says.“Now, I’m cautiously optimistic.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentEthiopiaAfricaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Am I going to be covering Betamax and MiniDisc players next?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.No, this isn’t a retro piece from the Filter. You may be reading this at least three years afterApple decided the iPod business was too niche to be worth bothering with, but MP3 players – or digital audio players, as they should more accurately be called – are seeing a small resurgence, despite the domination of Spotify, Apple Music and the like.“In the past few years, since Covid, we’ve seen way more people looking to get a new MP3 player,” says Chris Laidler, office manager ofAdvanced MP3 Players, an Edinburgh store specialising in audio equipment.The reasons are, essentially, threefold. First, there’s the pleasure of using something tangible: a nostalgia for devices with a single purpose, devoid of notifications and apps. More importantly, though, there’s a desire to have a music collection again – something led by the music-loving algorithm in your brain, rather than one outsourced to technology. “It’s their collection, rather than a playlist they’ve subscribed to,” says Laidler, and they own the music and aren’t simply “leasing it from Spotify”.Finally, there’s a sound-quality aspect. Yes, your phone can play music, but it’s a pretty insignificant part of its daily tasks, and for audiophiles, it shows.“When you think about it, the DAC [digital-to-analogue converter] that’s in [your phone] is only going to be one tiny component of the thing,” says Laidler. In modern high-end MP3 players, on the other hand, “the entire infrastructure is designed for [delivering] as accurate music recreation as possible.”These arguments won’t be compelling to everyone, but if you do take your music seriously and feel like you’ve been listening too much on autopilot, getting a new MP3 player could be just what you need to get out of a musical rut.At a glanceBest MP3 player overall:Activo P1£399 at ActivoBest budget MP3 player:Snowsky Echo Mini£49.99 at AMP3Best mid-range player:FiiO JM21£179 at Peter TysonBest high-end player:iBasso DX180£499 at AMP3Why you should trust meMP3 players and me go way back. Ahead of starting university, I bought a 20GB Archos Jukebox. With its blue bumpers on every corner, it wasn’t an iPod-style looker, but it made all the 32MB (yes, megabytes!) players at the time look flimsy (even if it did little for my already limited campus cool factor). When those bumpers failed to protect the internal hard drive from one too many falls, I switched to a Creative model, before finally accepting Apple’s dominance of the market with an iPod nano.I’m also the proud(ish) owner of an imported Microsoft Zune. That might not make the case for me on grounds of taste, but it does at least show that I’ve put the hours in. More importantly, I’ve been reviewing tech for more than a decade now, most of it more complex than an MP3 player. I probably should have started with that point, but it tells its own story: I’m quite geeky when it comes to my digital music collection.How I testedView image in fullscreenListen up: the MP3 players were tested with in-ear monitors and over-ear headphones.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianI sourced 15 modern MP3 players from the likes of Sony, Agptek, Majority, Shanling, iBasso and FiiO – which may not all sound that familiar, such is the niche we’re dealing with. While players can go for more than £1,000, I was keen to test mainstream devices, with the highest priced at £649 and the lowest at £30.I supplemented this with twoold Apple models via Backmarket, where preowned tech can get a second life rather than becoming e-waste. Neither made the list, however, for reasons I’ll get to later.I listened to a lot of music in different environments. I became familiar with my old collection (out and about, and while connected directly to my Cambridge Audio AXA25 hifi). To get the most out of the high-end players, I borrowed a couple of high-end FiiO headsets from Advanced MP3 Players: the FH75 wired in-ear monitors, and the over-ear FT7 headphones. These offered a considerable improvement over my own somewhat tired headphones.All the while, I diligently made mental notes about the look, feel, battery life and usability of each device, relative to its cost. File quality is also a factor, of course, and to that end, I not only played MP3s, but lossless Flac versions of the same track.The best MP3 players in 2025View image in fullscreenMusic to his ears? Alan prepares to tune in.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianBest MP3 player overall:Activo P1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£399 at Activo£399 at AmazonIf you’ve done enough reading on the topic of digital audio players, you’ll have undoubtedly come across the Astell & Kern brand … and then possibly realised its products are out of your price range. Enter Activo: a sub-brand from the company, which promises to deliver a lot of what audiophiles want for considerably less cost.Why we love itWhile £399 represents a significant outlay, it’s nowhere near as pricey as some models and still offers a lot of bang for your buck. The dual-DAC structure provides high-resolution audio, aided by its Digital Audio Remaster upsampling tech, plenty of pre-programmed filters and a built-in EQ to modify 20 frequencies to your tastes.File support is strong, and it has 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced audio ports for wired connections, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless playback. It can even work as an external DAC for your computer if you like.It comes with 64GB of internal storage, and you can expand it with microSD cards of up to 1.5TB. It uses Android – which I always worry detracts from the point of a dedicated MP3 player – but it’s a highly pared-back version focused on music. The Google Play Store is here, but it’s really only present to allow you to install Spotify, Tidal or whatever your streaming poison is. It’s intuitive, smooth enough, and not trying to mimic your phone: you won’t find yourself distracted by social media nonsense.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have more dedicated physical playback buttons. That and its chunky size almost made me give the cheaper£346.80 Sony NW-A306the nod, but Activo’s smoother, pared-back version of Android and additional 4.4mm output gave it the edge.Capacity:64GB internal, expandable up to 1.5TBScreen:4.1in LCD, 720 x 1,280Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.3Weight:155gSupported file types:WAV, Flac, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, DFF, DSF, MQABattery test (wired earbuds):15hrs 30minsBest budget MP3 player:Snowsky Echo MiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£49.99 at AMP3£68.99 at eBayI tested quite a few budget players, and in most cases there was an element of getting what you pay for, with iffy interfaces, truncated filenames and thin, reedy audio. For about £50, the FiiO Snowsky Mini avoids all these traps while leaning into the charm of retro rather nicely, even if its design may go over the heads of those under the age of 35. That’s right, it looks like a cassette tape, and the colour screen will even show one playing when you’re listening to music, if you like.Why we love itYou may not be familiar with the Snowsky brand, but you might have heard of its parent company, FiiO, which is one of the bigger names in modern portable digital audio. The Echo Mini has clearly learned from its sister products, providing a far richer soundscape than that offered by any other budget device I tested. It’s also the only cheap offering to include a 4.4mm balanced port along with the standard 3.5mm one.The interface is basic but reasonably intuitive, with physical buttons along the top to control playback. You can choose from a handful of EQ presets and filters in the settings, too. Navigating via physical controls and a largely text-based interface may feel dated in the age of smartphones, but it fits in with the retro vibes and ensures a distraction-free environment – unless you become transfixed by the tape player animation, that is.For the price, I only really have two complaints. The first is that because it’s not connected to the internet, you have to update its software the old-fashioned way: by downloading the firmware to your desktop, to drag and drop. The second is that, while it has a microSD slot to supplement the 8GB of internal storage, it maxes out at 256GB, which may be too little for indecisive music fans.It’s a shame that …its text-based interface may not be to your taste.Capacity:8GB internal, expandable up to 256GBScreen:1.99in IPS, 170 x 320Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.3Weight:55gSupported file types:MP3, DSD, WAV, Flac, APE, M4A, OGGBattery test (wired earbuds):10hrs 30minsBest mid-range player:FiiO JM21View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£179 at Peter Tyson£179.99 at AmazonIf you want good sound quality but resent paying smartphone prices for a dedicated audio player, the FiiO JM21 is a great compromise, as it comes in at just £179.99. For that price, it’s remarkably fully featured, and it sounds great.Why we love itFiiO knows how to make a good MP3 player, and it’s impressive how much of the brand’s high-end quality filters down to its entry-level product. The JM21’s dual-DAC chipset delivers a nice detailed sound, whether you’re listening via 3.5mm cable or balanced 4.4mm connection. And while it runs Android, you can switch to a more basic audio-only view via a drop down, giving you the choice between a distraction-free environment and something more fully featured.The build is delightful, too. Its slim profile means it weighs a light 156g, and the physical buttons are evenly split between the left and right sides, making it easy to play, pause and skip tracks and adjust volume without looking. If you’re curious about dedicated portable music players, but don’t want to spend a fortune, this is an inexpensive but impressive way to find out what all the fuss is about.It’s a shame that …the 32GB of internal storage won’t go far, especially as lots of that is gobbled up by Android.Capacity:32GB internal, expandable up to 2TBScreen:4.7in TFT, 750 x 1,334Connectivity:3.5mm, 4.4mm, Bluetooth 5.0Weight:156gSupported file types:ISO, DST, MQA, DSD, DXD, APE, ALAC, AIFF, Flac, WAV, MP3, OGG, WMA, AACBattery test (wired earbuds):11hrs 30minsBesthigh-end player:iBasso DX180View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£499 at AMP3£499 at AmazonThe term “high-end” is obviously relative, but given most people don’t want to break into four figures for portable audio, I’ve chosen to pitch it between £400 and £650. And, of all the players I tested in that bracket, the iBasso DX180 offers the best balance of features, sound quality, price and design.Why we love itThe DX180 sounds great, with its quad-DAC chip providing a lovely sound via 3.5mm or 4.4mm balanced. On top of that, it’s simply a nice player to hold and play with: substantial, but not hefty. Pleasingly, you can open the back to replace the battery, should you find it’s not lasting as long as it used to – a big plus for sustainability.It runs Android 13 and has a chip capable of doing so without slowdown. I’d prefer something more bespoke, but it’s really only used for picking out an album or playlist. After that, the buttons on the side take over, letting you play, pause, skip or adjust the volume via a volume wheel. The advantage of Android is that you can download whatever music streaming apps you like to accompany your own collection.It was a close call between this and theShanling M5 Ultra, which costs the same but doesn’t come with any onboard storage (you supply your own microSD card). I had a minor preference for the sound of the M5 Ultra (and I preferred its music-first implementation of Android), yet the DX180 is lighter, runs cooler and lasted almost three hours longer in my battery test, giving it the edge.It’s a shame that …its UI is pure Android, making it seem like a phone (minus the phone!).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Shanling makes a great alternative for the 2020s, complete with a tiny 1.54in touchscreen to navigate however many songs you can fit on a microSD card of up to 2TB in size (there’s no internal storage).Considering its tiny frame, the sound quality is superb, although you’re limited to either 3.5mm wired or Bluetooth 5 headphones. Weighing just 36.8g, it’s the definition of portable – though if navigating a device so small sounds like a nightmare, that’s because it kind of is. The 240 x 240 screen is easy enough to read, and adjusting volume via the wheel is actually a little fun, but moving between menus isn’t intuitive – it’s the definition of fiddly. Still, if portability is your ultimate aim, you won’t find better than this.It didn’t make the final cut because …the size and shape remain too fiddly to recommend to most people.Capacity:no internal storage, expandable to 2TB;screen:1.54in LCD, 240 x 240;connectivity:3.5mm, Bluetooth 5, 4.4mm adapter available separately;weight:36.8g;supported file types:WAV, Flac, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIF, DSD, M3U, CUE, AC3, DXD, DTS, M4A;battery test (wired earbuds):11hrs 6minsMajority MP3 GoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Martin/The Guardian£29.99 at Currys£29.95 at AmazonBest for:workoutsYou may decide that the Shanling M0 is perfectly suited for workouts, but here’s an option that improves on it in two crucial ways: price and physical buttons.The former is an obvious bonus, and £30 is quite the bargain for this player. While it won’t blow anyone away sound wise, it punches above its weight, and it’s priced so competitively that you won’t be too devastated if it doesn’t make it out of a particular intensive gym session alive.More importantly, it has tactile buttons rather than a touchscreen, meaning you can pause and jump between tracks without sweat getting in the way. The sports clip means it will stay firmly attached to your clothes, though do note that it doesn’t have any kind of waterproofing, so it’s best to keep it covered if you’re an all-weather runner.It didn’t make the final cut because …while its sound is great for the price, this isn’t the player to turn Spotify streamers into believers.Capacity:16GB internal, expandable up to 128GB;screen:1.54in IPS, 240 x 240;connectivity:3.5mm, Bluetooth 5;weight:33g;supported file types:MP3, Flac, WAV;battery test (wired earbuds):33hrs 30minsWhat about the iPod?View image in fullscreenSound advice: be careful when buying refurbished iPods …Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianAs mentioned above, I sourced a couple of iPods from Backmarket. The iPod Nano was beaten by the Shanling M0 Pro above, while the iPod Classic ran into a different problem: it had been modified.Apple never produced a version larger than 160GB, but the model supplied by Backmarket had a backplate labelled 256GB. A check of the serial on Apple’s website revealed it was originally 160GB. When asked about how a modified piece of hardware could have been available for unsuspecting buyers to purchase, the company explained that it “rigorously vet[s] sellers” with just one in three applicants approved.“We have zero tolerance for counterfeit items. When sellers first start selling on our platform, they are limited to just five sales per day. Everything is meticulously checked, including their customer feedback, comments, and delivery performance. Once they are allowed to sell without restrictions, they continue to be closely monitored. At the slightest issue, their sales are limited again, and if they don’t improve after the problem is identified (with help from our lab), they will be excluded from the platform.”The company added that “if customers suspect that they have purchased a counterfeit device, they are encouraged to contact Customer Care”.Obviously, we couldn’t publish our findings about an MP3 player we believe to have been modified here. And there are reasons you might want to stay away from iPods, regardless of this cautionary tale.There are too many compromises with an iPod, from the difficult reliance on iTunes to the need to convert into Apple-friendly file formats such as AAC and ALAC. Plus, of course, you’re relying on a 3.5mm headphone jack, with most iPods not supporting Bluetooth connections. The final iPod Nano did, if you can find one, as did the iPod Touch range, although the latter is too close to an iPhone for my liking.If you’re dead set on an iPod Classic, one option is to buy a deliberately souped-up version with the features that we all wish Apple would provide.Player Modsspecialises in upgrading iPod Classics with optional Bluetooth, more storage, larger batteries, USB-C charging and even an AirTag, so it won’t get lost. Each of these upgrades costs a pretty penny, of course, but if you want to live in the past with the mod-cons of the present, there’s no better way to do so.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenDisc to data: audio file download cards are often found in new vinyl releases.Photograph: Alan Martin/The GuardianWhat are lossless and lossy audio files?Back in the days when music player capacities were measured in megabytes rather than gigabytes, file size was all important, leading to the popularity of the MP3. By reducing audio fidelity, the recording size could be slashed from 600–6,000 megabytes per hour to 14.4–144 (depending on sample rate).Lossless audio files – such as Flac or ALAC – retain all information about a track, playing the music as originally recorded. However, if you have a big music collection, your limited storage space will fill up faster.So is lossless better if you have the space? Objectively, yes, but in truth, you may not actually be able to tell the difference between a high-quality MP3 file and a lossless track, despite the difference in file size.Don’t believe me? Ask Apple’s own Eddy Cue. “The reality of lossless is: if you take 100 people and you take a stereo song in lossless and you take a song that’s been in Apple Music that’s compressed, I don’t know if it’s 99 or 98 can’t tell the difference,” he said in an interview withBillboard. “For the difference of lossless, our ears aren’t that good.”You could be within that 1%-2%, of course, andNPR created a quiz where you can test yourself. But even if you have magic ears, you’ll most likely need to use wired headphones, asonly a handful of devices support lossless audio over Bluetoothat the time of writing.What’s the difference between a cheap MP3 player and an expensive one?If you’ve shopped around, you’ll know that MP3 players can cost anywhere between £30 and several thousand pounds. So what’s the difference?It chiefly comes down to obvious things such as build quality, the DACs powering them (manifested in sound quality) and the variety of outputs supported. Cheaper ones are usually limited to Bluetooth and 3.5mm outputs, while more expensive ones will cater for more exotic outputs.“We sell players that have XLR outputs on them, so a hell of a lot more powerful output on these things,” says Advanced MP3 Players’ Laidler. “You couldn’t put something like that into a cheap player, because they just wouldn’t drive it.”But don’t despair: according to Laidler, after a certain point, pricing becomes less about sound quality and more about finding the tuning that suits you and your personal taste. He compares them to high-end cameras: “They all cost a lot of money, but they’re not capturing the exact same image.” Naturally, as a retailer, he doesn’t use the phrase “diminishing returns”, but I feel comfortable using it here.Beware how easy it is to get stuck chasing that perfect sound. “At the audio trade shows, people come in with their little notebooks, and they go around each room making notes about the character of each player and the price,” says Laidler. “But then you see these same people come back the next year, and you ask them, ‘Oh, which one did you end up going for?’ and they’re still deciding.”3.5mm vs 4.4mm balanced: what’s the difference?While 3.5mm ports are ubiquitous, some players on this list have an additional 4.4mm balanced input. Generally speaking, 3.5mm cables aren’t balanced, while 4.4mm cables are. Unbalanced cables deliver a full stereo sound image on a single signal wire, but balanced provides two signal wires, both carrying a copy of the sound. This means less interference and, as a result, theoretically cleaner playback.The difference is subtle, so it’s not essential for everyone. The bottom line is that either usually sounds better than Bluetooth, taking advantage of the MP3 player’s built-in DAC. The obvious drawback is that you’ll be back to the bad old days of untangling cables from time to time.MP3s vs smartphone streaming: which is better for audio quality?In theory, lossless streaming over Apple Music, Tidal or – as of this week, Spotify – beats an MP3.That’s because, as outlined above, MP3 is an inherently lossy format. A streamed lossless file compared with a local Flac, however, should be a dead heat, assuming you’re using the same audio equipment. “It comes down to ownership of your own music, rather than quality,” says Laidler.There’s a “but”, however. The question is specifically about “smartphone streaming”, and smartphone makers no longer include a headphone jack for wired output, nor stress too much about the quality of the onboard DAC. High-end MP3-player makers do.In other words, while the files may sound the same in identical conditions, a smartphone will generally reproduce the audio worse than a high-end MP3 player with a quality DAC included. Some MP3 players also include streaming software, so you can have the best of both worlds.Buying a refurbished MP3 playerGiven that MP3 players aren’t as popular as they used to be, there are plenty of preowned models to buy, but you should be aware of the risks. First off, there’s the counterfeit and modification problem. If even a legitimate company like Backmarket can inadvertently sell a modified iPod Classic, then buying from individual sellers on eBay, Vinted and the like is clearly a gamble.However, even if you bring a legitimate retro MP3 player out of retirement, there are things to bear in mind. “A lot of those devices from the original MP3 player boom are going to only play MP3 files and don’t have the capacity for playing high-res audio or lossless files,” says Laidler. “The vast majority are going to be out of warranty, so the company that originally built them won’t touch them if something goes wrong.“But as a nostalgic thing, I think they’re great. We still have an iPod Classic rattling around in the office because we just can’t bring ourselves to part with it. Really, it’s just nice to have it around.”Alan Martin is areviews writer who has been putting products – including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces for more than a decade.

A far-right mob stormed the country’s institutions in his support. Yet democracy prevailed. And then, on Thursday, Brazil’s supreme courtsentenced the former president Jair Bolsonaroto 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and “annihilate” democracy through a coup. The sprawling plot was both modern and crudely old school – extending from an onlinedisinformation campaignto undermine faith in the voting system, to aborted plans toassassinatethe newly elected presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, and the supreme court justice investigating Bolsonaro. It culminated in the riots in Brasília in January 2023.Four of the five judges on the panel found Bolsonaro guilty. Seven close allies from the military and security establishment were convicted alongside him for the same crimes – including his former defence and justice ministers, former spy chief, generals and the former navy commander. According to the prosecution, the plans for a putsch failed because the army and air force chiefs refused to take part.The conviction is a relief not only to defenders of democracy – many of whom celebrated in the streets in the hours after the verdict – but also groups targeted under Bolsonaro’s rule, including human rights activists, Indigenous peoples and the LGBTQ+ community. It also marks a hugely important moment for Brazil in challenging historical norms of impunity. Despite its lengthy history of coups, no member of the military had been convicted of coup-related offences in a civilian court until now. Thefirst convictionfor any of thehorrific abusescommitted during its 1964-85 military dictatorship came only four years ago.Bolsonaro, who is under house arrest, denied all charges and has won enthusiastic backing from the US, where his son Eduardo has lobbied relentlessly on his behalf. In July, Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, whichhe tied to the supposed “witch-hunt”against a man he describes as a friend. The alarming attempt to export this administration’s anti-democratic impulses backfired,boosting supportfor President Lula.Nonetheless, Bolsonaro’s conviction will probably fire up domestic supporters who see him as a martyr and may, more than ever, believe they are being politically persecuted. His supporters in congress are pushing for an amnesty bill, though it is thought more likely to win reduced sentences for those involved in 2023’s violence in Brasília than freedom for the ex-president. He may instead be placing his hopes in next year’s election – when the incumbent president is expected to run again – to boost support for him in the senate andinstall a rightwing president, possibly even a member of his family.Yet while Bolsonaro only narrowly lost 2022’s election, a clear majority of Braziliansaccept that he participated in plotting a coup: 52%, against 36% who said that he did not, in a recent poll. Securing this outcome for democracy will require continued commitment, but it is nonetheless remarkableThe conviction of Bolsonaro has sent a powerful signal heard not only in his country but more broadly: that leaders must be held accountable if they undermine democratic norms.Brazilhas successfully upheld the will of the people against the scheming of a populist would-be autocrat. This victory must be defended, but it shows others what is possible.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Things are different now: anger and division ruleSign up for our new weekly newsletterMatters of Opinion, where our columnists and writers will reflect on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading and moreFri 12 Sep 2025 13.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 13.10 EDTShareThekilling of Charlie Kirkhas left the US and those who care about it on edge. Thearrest of a suspect, Tyler Robinson, has hardly settled the nerves, not when the revelation of any supposed political allegiances could touch off a fresh round of recriminations. The fear is that the country is about to descend into a new era of political violence, becoming a place where differences are settled not with words and argument but by guns and blood. After all, it has plumbed those depths before.The US was born in violence, fought a civil war less than a century after its founding and in living memory seemed to be on the brink of another one – with a spate of assassinations in the 1960s that took the lives of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Medgar Evers and John and Bobby Kennedy. That should provide some consolation, the knowledge that the country has been through this before and survived.And yet the comfort is scant, because these are different times. For one thing, guns are even more available now than they were then: there are more than 850m firearms in private hands in the world, and nearly half of those areowned by Americans. For every 100 Americans, there are120 guns.For another, today’s information supply is dominated by social media, amplifying the most extreme voices and rewarding the angriest sentiments. Where once the CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite couldbreak the newsof a presidential assassination and provide sombre balm, now grief is inflamed into fury, with footage of Kirk’s horrific shooting entering global circulation mere moments after his death.But the crucial difference is at the top. An act of political violence used to be met by a standard, reassuringly predictable response: the president would condemn it, grieve for the dead and their families, plead that there be no rush to judgment, and call for calm and for unity, insisting that Americans not give the killers what they want, which was division, but rather come together as fellow citizens of a republic they all loved. I heard versions of that speech, delivered at different moments by Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. On Wednesday night, Donald Trump chose an alternative path – one that proved that, as he later admitted to Fox News when asked about bringing the country together, he “couldn’t care less”.Instead, and at a time when no one was in custody and nothing at all was known of Kirk’s killer, Trump said the blame for his death lay with “the radical left”. It was its “rhetoric” that was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today”. The problem was not political violence in general, but “radical left political violence”.Put aside the inaccuracy of such a statement. Put aside the documented fact that not some, butallextremist-related killings in the US in 2024 wereconnected to rightwing extremism, just as they were in 2023 and in 2022. Put aside that, although Trump listed incidents in which figures associated with the right had been attacked, he pointedlydid not mentionand wilfully chose to ignore the murder of the DemocraticMinnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortmanand her husband in June; orthe arson attackon the home of the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, in April; or an earlier plot to kidnap the Democratic governor of Michigan.Put it all aside, even though it exposes the transparent falsity of Trump’s declaration that US political violence comes from one side only. Consider instead the likely effect of his words. At best, they add fuel to an already incendiary situation. At worst, they encourage retaliation and revenge.Witness Trump’s allies and cheerleaders. “We’re gonna avenge Charlie’s death,” promised Fox News host Jesse Watters.Elon Musk declared that“The Left is the party of murder”. A legion of other rightwing influencers have already taken this talk to its logical conclusion, announcing, as one put it, that “THIS IS WAR”. Could the message being sent to a furious and well-armed support base be any clearer?And notice something else Trump said on Wednesday. He pledged to find those “organisations that fund and support” what he classifies as political violence. Given that one of his closest aides said before Kirk’s murder that the Democratic party should be viewed as a “domestic extremist organisation”, it’s not hard to imagine who he will be coming for. Surely any group that opposes him.How should they – Democrats, liberals, the left – be responding to this moment of peril? So far they have observed the old norms, with almost every Democratic figure of any standing, whether former president or serving politician, offering the decent, human response: horror at such a brutal act, sympathy for Kirk’s wife and now-fatherless young children, fear for where this leaves the country. Watch MSNBC, or listen to the Pod Save crowd, and you’ll see that that’s how most of the leading lights in the anti-Trump universe have, rightly, responded. Any deviation from that normhas been punished.It is one of the asymmetries of the US culture wars that this etiquette, rigorously enforced from left to right, is not observed in the other direction. So when an intruder broke into the home of the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and nearly clubbed her husband, Paul, then 82, to death, the leading Republican in the country did not offer condemnation or words of consolation. No, Trump responded by makingrepeated jokesat Paul Pelosi’s expense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After an act of violence, Democrats must be gracious, empathetic and call for calm on all sides, whileRepublicanscan mock the victims, blame only one side and demand more violence. And there’s a further asymmetry: a single post from a random, anonymous user online will be treated as a statement from “the left”, while the outpourings of the right’s most powerful voices, in politics or the media, and including the president himself, somehow get a free pass.As part of this etiquette, it’s become poor taste to point out Kirk’s actual views. It’s as if the belief that no one should be killed for their opinions requires you to withhold any judgment of those opinions. But Kirk did not hold back. He was happy to tell people that he would be nervous getting on aplane flown by a Black pilot, and to talk of “prowling Blacks”; totell Taylor Swiftto “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband … You’re not in charge”; to deny the truth of the 2020 election; to recommend that children should watchpublic executions; and to suggest “Jewish dollars” were to blame for the spread of “cultural Marxism”.Many liberal luminaries have swerved past this back catalogue, preferringto express their admirationfor Kirk’s willingness to debate and his genuine gift for engaging the young. That has left the field clear for the right to redefine Kirk not as the extremist he was – and was proud to be – but as a paragon of civic participation, one who merits a posthumous presidential medal of freedom and a lowering of the flag. While the liberal left is observing the conventional pieties, the right is swiftly sanitising Kirk’s views and canonising him, hailing him as a martyr for the cause of what they insist is “simple common sense”. As a result, it will have moved theOverton windowyet further in its direction.These are dynamics Kirk knew well and that he was adroit at using to his advantage. He understood that a culture war inherently favours those willing to disregard the rules. It is a lesson that liberals and the left are, rightly, reluctant to learn – but that reluctance comes at an increasingly high price.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But they barely were covered upFri 12 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 12.02 EDTShareJeffrey Epsteinhad a lot of friends. When his girlfriend-cum-assistant and convicted fellow sex trafficker,Ghislane Maxwell, set out to compile letters, drawings and well wishes from friends in celebration of the pedophile financier’s 50th birthday in 2003, theresulting scrapbookwas 238 pages long.The book, titled The First 50 Years, included letters from prominent well-wishers such as former president Bill Clinton and the Bear Stearns executives James Cayne and Alan Greenberg, as well as from the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling scout and Epstein’s fellow pedophilic rapist.The lawyer and longtime Epstein friend Alan Dershowitz contributed a mock cover of the magazine Vanity Fair, which was working on a profile of Epstein at the time;Peter Mandelson, until this week the UK ambassador to the United States, wrote that Epstein was “my best pal!” The fashion designer Vera Wang compared Epstein to the contestant on the reality series The Bachelor, and the Microsoft executive and Bill Gates deputy Nathan Myhrvold included photos from a recent trip to Africa, writing that they were “more appropriate than anything I could put in words”. The photos included images of lions and zebras copulating, as well as of a zebra with a visible penis.Among the contributions was aletterwithDonald Trump’s signature, featuring a poem typed out in center alignment, alluding to things that the now president has in common with the pedophile, their “wonderful secret”, and a strange line noting that “enigmas never age”. Around the poem, an armless and headless female form has been drawn in black marker. Trump’s typical signature, angular and frantic in hishabitual black Sharpie pen, is positioned at the figure’s pubic area, reading, “Donald”.When the existence of this letter apparently from Trump – as well its contents and the nature of the drawing – was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in July, Trumpclaimedthat the document was both fake and also did not exist. Hefileda $10bn defamation suit against the paper. Now that the Epstein birthday book itself has been released by House oversight committee Democrats following a subpoena of Epstein’s estate, Trump and hisalliesclaim that the letter contained there is afake. “The White House says it’s not true,” said the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to Lisa Desjardins of PBS, adding: “So.” Tim Burchett, a Republican representative from Tennessee,suggestedthat the president’s letter had been forged.Such a claim insults Americans’ intelligence – Trump’sfriendshipwith Epstein throughout the 1990s and early 2000s has been well-documented and was spoken of by Trump at the time. Trump’s tendency to comment on Epstein’s sex life, too, is well-established. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,” Trump said of Epstein in comments to New York Magazine in 2002, just a year before his contribution to the birthday book, “and many of them are on the younger side.”Trump has denied wrongdoing in his dealings with Epstein, just as he has denied allegations bymore than two dozen womenthat he committed sexual harassment and assault against them, allegations by his first wife, Ivana, made during their divorce proceedings that he raped her (a claim she later retracted), and allegations by the writer E Jean Carroll that he raped her in the dressing room of a department store in the early 1990s. (After Trump denied Carroll’s claim, a jury awarded her a sizable defamationsettlementon a finding that he in fact sexually abused her.) Trump has also denied that hewalked inon contestants of the Miss Teen USA pageant while they were undressing in a changing room in 1997. Trump does not deny the repeated sexualizedcommentshe made about his own daughter Ivanka during her teen years regarding her “hotness” and desirability; those, at least, he seems willing to stand by.There is no evidence suggesting that Trump personally partook in Epstein’s organized trafficking and sexual assault of teenage girls. But there is mounting circumstantial evidence that makes it hard not to speculate that Trump at least knew and approved of Epstein’s abuse of the girls – seeing the sexual assaults as evidence of Epstein’s cheeky virility and a luxurious prerogative of wealth.Indeed, what’s most striking about the birthday book, which was released to the public on Monday, is how little Epstein’s friends seem to know about him aside from the fact that he liked to surround himself with young women and teenagers. The sentiments expressed in the book are overwhelmingly bawdy; many allude directly to the young ages of Epstein’s sexual partners, as well as his penchant to transport the girls to his Caribbean island onboard his private plane.One illustration, attributed to Mar-a-Lago regular Joel Paschcow, shows women from what appears to be a clip art file in various risque poses – a dancer does a high kick, two women pose suggestively in swimsuits, a mermaid reclines on a rock – all arranged beneath a drawing of an airplane. Perhaps the most disturbing contribution is a drawing, not attributed, that shows Epstein giving a bunch of balloons to a group of three young girls in a panel labeled “1983”; beside it, a panel labeled “2003” shows Epstein reclining on a beach chair in a tropical locale – a plane bearing the tail numbers of his “Lolita Express” flying above – while four women in thongs massage him. One, crouched near his crotch, has Epstein’s initials tattooed on her rear end. The implication is that these are the same women – that Epstein gave the girls balloons in their childhood in order to encourage them to give him “massages” later on. “What a great country!” the sketch is captioned.There is no doubt that the contributors to Epstein’s birthday book will have different accounts of their time with the pedophile financier. But it is a horrifying document. An uncharitable reader will regard it as a collection of confessions of complicity: the relentlessly sexual nature of the contributions, and their frequent allusions to Epstein’s plane, makes it hard to avoid suspicion that many of them knew full well that there was something sexual about Epstein’s habit of regularly transporting young girls to a private island to spend time with powerful adult men. Knowing what we now know about Epstein, who was convicted for sex crimes against minors years after the book was compiled, it is hard to read the book charitably.Even the most generous reader – the one who was driven by an excess of caution or charity towards those who spent time with Epstein – would note that Epstein’s social circle, though highly elite, is also decidedly distasteful. The drawings and letters and various missives from Epstein’s well-wishers almost uniformly consist of the kind of crude, jocular misogyny and objectification of women that passes for friendship between men of little intellect and even less character.Clearly, they thought they were being funny; there’s a decent chance that to Epstein, his abuse of those girls and young women was hilarious. Sexual violence is often experienced as violence only by the victims: to the perpetrators, it is delightful fun – trivial and unserious – and it is the perpetrators, endowed as they so often are by maleness, age, money and status, whose view guides that of others. History, after all, is written by the winners, and in cases of sexual abuse, it is almost always the men who win.In the more fevered corners of the internet, conspiracists wonder about what Epstein and his powerful friends may have done to cover up and conceal his sexual abuse of teenagers. But maybe this sense of a vast effort of concealment is a bit too optimistic, even, for the banal avowedness with which so much of men’s actual sexual abuse of women and girls is conducted.More often, abuse of the kind that Epstein practiced does not have to be covered up at all: more often, it is conducted out in the open, before a group of indifferent onlookers who ignore it when they do not laugh. In such cases, it is wrong to say that there are “revelations” about an abusive man’s behavior. This conduct is not “revealed” so much as reinterpreted – found to be wrong, not due to an uncovering of facts but a change ofinterpretation.It is made objectionable, that is, to people who did not object before.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpGhislaine MaxwellPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

He has dismissed the entire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory panel, narrowed access to life-saving Covid-19 vaccines, filled scientific advisory boards with conspiracy theorists and fired the newly appointed CDC director for refusing to rubber-stamp his actions.But his rejection of vaccines is only part of the problem. Secretary Kennedy is unfit to be our nation’s leading public health official because he rejects the fundamental principles of modern science.For generations, doctors have agreed that germs – like bacteria or viruses – cause infectious diseases.In the 1850s, John Snow, known as the father of epidemiology, traced a cholera outbreak in London to water contaminated with human waste – not the “bad air”, or so-called miasma, that many at that time believed to be the cause.In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur, the French chemist, in a controlled experiment, injected one group of sheep with an anthrax vaccine while another group went without it. Then he injected all of the sheep with anthrax bacteria. The vaccinated sheep survived, the unvaccinated did not.The germ theory led to a revolution in public health and medicine which, over the years, has saved tens of millions of lives.Just a few examples.At a time when many women were dying during childbirth at hospitals, Dr Ignaz Semmelweis found that handwashing by doctors saved lives.Joseph Lister showed that sterilizing medical equipment before surgery prevented needless deaths.Florence Nightingale, considered the mother of modern nursing, substantially improved hygiene at hospitals and made healthcare much safer for patients.Pasteur made the food we eat and the milk we drink safer through a process of heating called pasteurization.And these are just a few examples.Yet, incredibly, in the year 2025, we now have a secretary of HHS who has cast doubt and aspersions on the very concept of the germ theory – the very foundation of modern medicine for over a century.In his book The Real Anthony Fauci, Kennedy absurdly claims that the central tenet behind the germ theory “is simply untrue”. Vaccines are not, Kennedy falsely asserts, responsible for the massive decline in deaths from infectious diseases. Instead, Kennedy falsely proclaims that “science actually gives the honor of having vanquished disease mortalities to sanitation and nutrition”.Kennedy’s rejection of science is endangering the lives of millions of children in the United StatesYes. No one disputes that proper sanitation, a nutritious diet and exercise can lead to healthier lives. But no credible scientist or doctor believes that alone makes a person immune from polio, measles, mumps, Covid, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. Otherwise healthy people can become sick, hospitalized or even die from these and other terrible diseases.Sadly, Kennedy’s dangerous rejection of well-established science is behind his wild conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns.It’s what led to Kennedy’s falseassertionthat “there is no vaccine that is safe and effective” despite peer-reviewed scientific studies finding that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives and reduced infant deaths by 40% in the past 50 years.It’s behind Kennedy’s bogusclaimthat the polio vaccine “killed many, many, many, many, many more people than polio ever did”, even though the scientific data has shown that the polio vaccine has saved 1.5 million lives and prevented about 20 million people from becoming paralyzed since 1988.It undergirds his history ofpromotingthe ridiculous idea that HIV does not cause Aids, despite rigorous studies finding the exact opposite. This type of outrageous HIV/Aids denialism is widely believed to have caused the deaths of at least 330,000 people in South Africa who did not receive the life-saving medicine they needed.It’s what led him to say that the Covid vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made”, that vaccines cause autism, and that the hepatitis B vaccine doesn’t work and should only be used for “prostitutes” and “promiscuous gay men” – lies that have been thoroughly debunked by scientific data and the medical community.Frighteningly, it’s what caused Kennedy to say: “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get him vaccinated.’ And he heard that from me. If he hears it from 10 other people, maybe he won’t do it.”As a private citizen, Kennedy is entitled to his views, no matter how misguided they may be.It’s time for the US to guarantee healthcare to all | Bernie SandersRead moreIf Kennedy would like to swim in water contaminated by raw sewage and fecal matter, as he hasdone recentlyin Washington DC’s Rock Creek Park, he is free to do that.But as our nation’s top health official, Secretary Kennedy’s rejection of science and the actions he has taken as a result of his bizarre ideology is endangering the lives of millions of children in the United States and throughout the world.Today, Kennedy is making it harder for people to get vaccines. Tomorrow, what will it be? Will he tell doctors they don’t need to wash their hands before surgery? Will he tell hospitals that they don’t need to sterilize their scalpels and other medical equipment?The American people need a secretary of HHS who will listen to scientists and doctors, and not conspiracy theorists.We need a secretary of HHS who will listen to medical experts who may disagree with him, not fire them summarily.Bottom line: we need an HHS secretary who will not engage in a war on science and the truth itself.Secretary Kennedy must step down.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

In May, as the president prepared to visit, the Qatari government donateda luxury Boeing jet, a “palace in the sky” valued at $400m, which is nowbeing refittedso Trump can use it as Air Force One.But none of that, including Trump’s exuberant promises of protection, stopped Israel from attacking Qatar on Tuesday. Israellaunched a brazen airstrikeagainst a group of Hamas leaders who were meeting in the country’s capital, Doha, to consider the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal submitted by Israel and the US. The senior Hamas officials, including its top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the attack but six others were killed.Israel has replaced Iran as the biggest security threat to the Gulf states | Sanam VakilRead moreThat Israel was trying to kill the negotiators – and to destroy Qatar’s role as a mediator between Hamas and western powers – is no surprise. For nearly two years, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has consistentlyobstructed ceasefire talksand torpedoed potential deals by adding new demands or changing his mind. And when that hasn’t worked, Netanyahu has resorted toassassinating Hamas leadersin an apparent attempt to stall negotiations.Under Netanyahu, Israel is now a rogue state posing the greatest danger to stability in the Middle East. With unconditional political support and an unlimited supply of US weapons (starting under Joe Biden’s administration and expanding under Trump), Israel can bomb virtually anyone and anywhere in the region, with impunity. Over the past few months,Israel has bombedIran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen – and now Qatar, with little consequence beyond tepid condemnation from some western powers. And that’s not to mention Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians andinstigated a faminein parts of the territory.Netanyahu seems to have succeeded in blowing up the latest negotiations and Qatar’s role as an intermediary. On Tuesday, the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani,called the Israeli attack“an act of state terrorism”, and vowed that the emirate would continue its work as a mediator. But he seemed resigned that the current talks had collapsed and Qatar would not be able to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas anytime soon. “When it comes to the current talks, I don’t think there is something valid right now after we’ve seen such an attack,”he said.Since the regional chaos unleashed by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Qatar’s ruling family has tried to position itself as a global mediator, using its enormous natural gas wealth to distinguish itself as a small emirate capable of keeping channels open between enemies. Over the years, Doha has hosted peace negotiations between the US and Taliban leaders, and talks for prisoner exchanges between Iran and Washington. But that muscular foreign policy also pushed Qatar into conflict with its two larger and more powerful neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which accused Doha of financing terrorism and being too close with Iran. In 2017, the two countries led a blockade against Qatar – and Trump initially supported the siege during his first term as president,claiming that Qatar“has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level”.Qatar survived the blockade, which was lifted in January 2021, partly thanks to mediation by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser during his first term. Qatar also doubled down on its regional efforts as a negotiator. Aside from investing $8bn to upgrade Al-Udeid airbase outside the capital, which houses more than 10,000 troops and is thelargest US military installationin the Middle East, Qatar tried to prove itself indispensable to Washington in other ways, especially by hosting non-state groups that are labeled as terrorists by western powers.Qatar has hosted several of Hamas’s top political leaders since 2012, when they were forced out of Syria by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Qatari officials insist they allowed Hamas leaders to settle and open offices in Doha only because, they say, Barack Obama’s administration asked the emirate toestablish an indirect channelthat would enable the US to communicate with Hamas, which Washington had designated as aterrorist organizationin the 1990s.Despite Qatar’s history of punching above its weight in international diplomacy, the Israel-Hamas negotiations have been the most high-stakes undertaken by Qatar’s emir, the 45-year-old Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. For nearly two years, Qatar’s leaders had exerted significant energy and political capital to negotiate a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, only to be repaid with an Israeli attack on their country. Qatar’s leaders also learned a hard lesson: Trump’s promises of protection are largely worthless, especially when it comes to Israel. Even Qatar’s extravagant donation of a luxury jet to Trump – possibly themost expensive giftfrom a foreign government in US history – did not make a difference.After Tuesday’s attack, Trump said he had assured Qatar’s ruler in aphone callthat “such a thing will not happen again on their soil”. But Israeli officials were quick to declare that they will not hesitate to target Hamas leaders in Qatar again. As Israel’s ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter,told Fox News: “If we didn’t get them this time, we’ll get them next time.” And Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations was evenmore blunt: “There will be no immunity for terrorists – not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, and not in Qatar.”Israel’s sense of impunity will continue to grow, as long as US presidents fail to restrain its rogue leaders from more brazen and lawless acts.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsQatarOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

It’s never been more critical to challenge the misinformation that could turn a crisis into a catastropheSupport the Guardian’s independent, fact-based journalism todayFri 12 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 07.02 EDTShareAlittle over a decade ago I published a book,This Changes Everything, which explored the reality of the climate crisis as a confrontation between capitalism and the planet. For a few years after the book came out, it seemed like we might just win a breakthrough. A cascade of large and militant mobilisations pressed the case for keeping warming below 1.5C as globalcalls for a green new dealgrew louder and louder. Countries across the world announced long-term plans to reduce emissions and to hit net-zero targets; so did some of the largest corporations on the planet.And then … well, we all know what happened. A corporate-financed backlash on all fronts.In the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, his administration took more than 140 actions to roll back environmental rules and push for greater use of fossil fuels. He signed executive orders to ease restrictions on their extraction and export, filled his cabinet with oil industry supporters, gutted federal agencies on the forefront of the climate crisis, and cancelled life-saving environmental justice projects.Empowered by the world’s most powerful man’s assault on the planet, the banks and corporations that have financed our climate disaster – those with an apocalyptic fear of regulation eating into their super-profits – have let their masks slip,dropping their stated renewable ambitionsandploughing money into fossil fuels.Meanwhile, climate misinformation – amplified byfar-rightandrightwing populistpoliticians – is now so virulent online that one comprehensive study says it is likelyto help turn a crisis into a catastrophe.In 2020, the Guardian banned advertising from fossil fuel companies – the first major news organisation to do soI write for the Guardian because it continues to challenge and expose these forces – even as the financial conditions for producing this kind of work become more challenging by the day.For the past fortnight the Guardian has been reminding its readers about the role it is playing in exposing the threat to climate and environmental progress – and, as always, it has been naming names.The reason the Guardian is free to do this kind of vital work is simple: it is not beholden to corporations or billionaires.

Kirk’s killing is also sending prominent conservatives on a warpath, setting the stage for a dangerous expansion of federal government repression.Kirk was a social media megastar and the founder of Turning Point USA, the foremost rightwing youth organization in the country. His political positions were to the far right, and his language was often combative, to say the least. HecalledMartin Luther King, Jr “awful” andsaid“we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s”. He believed in the so-called great replacement theory, which asserts that elites are encouraging mass migration to undermine white people in western countries. “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America,” hewroteon X the day before he was killed. He alsoblamed“Jewish dollars” for funding “cultural Marxist ideas and supporters”.Charlie Kirk’s death is a tragic marker of the indiscriminate nature of political violence | Margaret SullivanRead moreKirk said being “trans is a mental delusion”. He portrayed himself as a free speech champion while also running a “Professor Watchlist” against liberal professors. “Having an armed citizenry comes with a price,” hesaid, explaining his opposition to gun control. “I think it’s worth … [the] cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so we can have the second amendment.” And he alsosuggesteda “patriot” should pay the bail of therightwing conspiracy theoristwho attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, with a hammer, fracturing his skull.So, yeah. I find a lot of what Kirk peddled to be reprehensible, but he should still be alive to say it. Obviously, no one should be killed for their views. In an open society, people like Kirk should be able to say what they want, just as I should have the right to say what I want. And that includes the right to criticize. For example, when Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker,saysthat “political violence has become all too common in American society. This is not who we are,” I should have the right to point out that political violence founded this country and political violence has taken many of our most important leaders, including Abraham Lincoln and Malcolm X. That list is getting longer now. The Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman, the leader of the state house Democratic caucus, was assassinated along with her husband just this past June at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in apolitically motivated killing.As political violence is escalating in the country – what the University of Chicago professor Robert Pape has dubbed “violent populism” – it is being performed with a mix of motives. Sometimes this violence comes from the left;moreoftenit comes from the right, while the motives of some others, such as Thomas Crooks, the young man who shot Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania in 2024, remainunclear.But if you listen to the Maga-sphere, today’s political environment is made uniquely murderous only because of a mythically powerful and extremely organized radical left. (A passing familiarity with the disputatious US left will quickly cement how far-fetched such beliefs are.) The motives driving Kirk’s shooter, still at large as I write this, are unknown. But that doesn’t matter. Sensing an opportunity, some of the most influential Maga conservatives are now hellbent on completely destroying “the left” – which in practice is anyone who voices opposition to their agenda – with all the might the federal government holds.Christopher Rufo, an influential conservative activist with close ties to the Trump administration,postedon X that the “last time the radical Left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J. Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years. It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.” Hardly a call for lowering the temperature of the discourse.Jesse Watters, a Fox News host,toldhis audience: “We are going to avenge Charlie’s death in the way that Charlie wanted to be avenged.” He continued: “They are at war with us. Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us.” The Maga political strategist Steve Bannontoldhis audience that “Charlie Kirk is a casualty of war. We are at war in this country. We are.” Elon Muskwroteon X that “The Left is the party of murder.” The far-right activist Laura Loomer (who holdssignificant influencewith the president)wrote: “The best way President Trump can reinforce Charlie’s legacy is by cracking down on the Left with the full force of the government,” adding: “We can’t allow for these people to live among us in society. If you threaten people over their political views, you should be jailed for 25 years or more.” Loomer seemed oblivious to fact that she was in fact threatening people over their political views.Not to be outdone, Trump chimed in with astatement: “My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity,” he said, “and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it … From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on Ice agents, to the vicious murder of a healthcare executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House majority leader Steve Scalise and three others, radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.”Trump makes no mention of, say, the assassination of Melissa Hortman or the attack on Paul Pelosi. He conflates public opposition to Ice’s militarized policing with extreme political violence, and he insinuates, without evidence, that a broad leftwing conspiracy is directing events behind the scenes. Fanciful in description, Trump’s words are utterly terrifying in their meaning.Why? Because despite what you might think, Trump is not saying that all political violence comes from the left. Rather, he is suggesting that all that comes from the left is political violence. And once that lie is accepted as true, the call to destroy any and all opponents, and by every means available, won’t lag far behind. Our collective commitment to democracy and the right to free speech, including Kirk’s, demands that we reject such destruction.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionFreedom of speechcommentShareReuse this content"

If they independently decide to hire a bias ombudsman, that’s their prerogative. If they think the best person to monitor bias at this moment is a career partisan likeKenneth Weinstein, that’s cause to question their judgment, but not necessarily a first amendment concern.That all changes, however, when the monitoring is at the behest of the federal government. And that’s what’s going on at CBS. The creation of the ombudsman rolewas oneof many capitulations CBS’s owners made to the Trump administration to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to approve the Paramount-Skydance merger.Other concessions included a commitment toend DEIand, of course, the $16m dollarbribeto Trump, laundered as asettlementpayment to resolve hisfrivolouslawsuit over 60 Minutes’ editing of an interview with then vice-president Kamala Harris. Two days after the check hit, the FCC approved the merger. And thoughParamount denies it, Trump claims there was also aside agreementto sweeten the deal with $20m in pro-Trump PSAs.A ‘bias monitor’ for CBS News is a bad idea. Here’s why | Margaret SullivanRead moreGiven the original sin of that rotten transaction, there is no room for benefit of the doubt when it comes to Weinstein’s hiring.The day the hire was announced, the FCC chair, Brendan Carr – known for hislapel pinwith a golden bust of Trump –toldthe Wall Street Journal that his supposedly independent agency was “fully aligned with the agenda that President Trump is running”. When it comes to the press, that agenda is clear: censorship and retribution.Weinstein’s past Trump bootlicking raises questions about whether he’s too biased to monitor bias. Soon after the administration extracted its latest surrender from CBS – acommitmentto no longer exercise its constitutional right to edit interviews, in response to criticism from the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem– it was reported that Weinstein haddeleted his X account.So the man tasked with policing transparency atCBSis already obscuring his own words? Not a great start as a journalistic ethicist.David Ellison, CEO of the new Paramount Skydance Corporation and son of Larry Ellison,who recently becamethe world’s richest person,insistsWeinstein won’t report to the government. The ombudsman role is about transparency, not oversight, he claims. It willensurethat CBS showcases “varied ideological perspectives”, presumably including that of hisdad’s buddyin the White House, who also wants to broker a deal for the Ellison family to control TikTok.One might argue that a serious bias monitor would focus on whether journalists’ biases (and yes, journalists have biases like everyone else) interfere with their pursuit of truth rather than implementing a nonsensical “all perspectives are created equal” policy. But again, absent government interference, Ellison’s entitled to write the job description as he sees fit.The government, however, apparently does intend to oversee – and, if it sees fit, interfere with – CBS’s bias policing. Carrreportedlysaid his agency was in a “trust but verify posture”, when it comes to the anti-bias commitments it unconstitutionally extracted. He noted: “When you make a filing at the FCC, we have rules and regulations that deal with false representations to the agency,”addingthat his agency was “going to stay in touch with [Paramount] and track this issue”.In other words, the FCC is positioned to use Paramount’s seeminglycoerced commitments during the merger process – including the bias ombudsman – to punish CBS if it steps out of line, or better yet, make it think twice about doing so in the first place. An independent bias cop would be all over the Columbia Journalism Review’sreportingon Thursday on alarming corporate meddling, by old and new ownership alike, in an effort to slant the network’s coverage in Israel’s favor. What an opportunity to hit the ground running! But don’t hold your breath.Legally, the government cannot use regulatory penalties as an end run around the constitution to control the news. As a prior version of Carrsaidin 2021: “A newsroom’s decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official.”But that assumes a government that respects the limits of its authority. The United States doesn’t have one of those. If this administration needs a pretext to punish CBS, it’ll find one – whether it’s alleged misrepresentations to regulators or some otherbizarre theorygovernment lawyers have yet to dream up.We are witnessing the silencing of American media | Robert ReichRead moreAnd don’t expect the FCC to push back. My employer, Freedom of the Press Foundation, filed an attorney disciplinarycomplaintagainst Carr in July, which included a laundry list of his overreaches and extra jurisdictional actions, from threatening corporate owners of cable news networks that don’t air Trump’s press conferences to efforts to meddle in online content.The FCC regulates neither cable news nor online speech, and Carr knows that. He also knows he can’t force even those he does regulate to broadcast whatever he wants. But those on the receiving end of Carr’s correspondence understand that he’s not speaking to them as an independent regulator but as one of Trump’s henchmen. It isn’t about whether they violated whatever regulation he cites (if he even bothers), it’s about whether they’re kissing the ring emphatically enough for his boss’s liking.TheTrump administrationhas abused its powers to shake down Paramount and secure a foothold inside CBS’s newsroom. That doesn’t mean CBS will never criticize Trump again – that would be too obvious. But its owners know they might get slapped if it goes too far. That’s enough to tame a watchdog – especially a corporate one that prioritizes endeavors more lucrative than defending the first amendment.The new CBS might not quite be state media, but it’s certainly going to be state-supervised media.

The only surprise is that this time it unravelled so fast: just seven months from resurrection to disgrace.Though there is no good time to lose our ambassador to Washington over his friendship with a convicted paedophile, this one is biblically bad: days after losing Angela Rayner, in the middle of a deputy leadership contest that is being viewed as apower strugglebetween Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham, ahead of astate visitby a US president with his own embarrassing connections to Epstein.Yet this sacking couldn’t wait. Mandelson might have survived Monday’s publication of a gushing birthday tribute to his “best pal”, written before Epstein’s conviction for soliciting prostitution from minors. But the lateremails that surfaced on Wednesday, fondly urging his now disgraced friend to fight for early release and promising that “your friends stay with you and love you”, were beyond toxic. No Labour government battling poisonous conspiracy theories about the left turning a blind eye to grooming gangs could tolerate this, but perhaps especially not from a man who had just effectively made a public fool of his leader.Twice in a week now,Starmer has defendeda scandal-ridden colleagueto parliament, only for them to be gone 24 hours later. But where Angela Rayner’s resignation was met with sorrow on the backbenches, Mandelson’s sacking invites only rage that he was ever allowed to get this close to power again.What hurts isn’t just the grubbiness – the impression created that pretty much any scandal can be overlooked if hiring someone is politically expedient, reinforcing all voters’ most cynical assumptions – but the crystallising of backbench concerns about Keir Starmer’s poor judgment and consequent overreliance on close aide Morgan McSweeney. Anger once aimed at Downing Street’s longsuffering monkeys is now converging on the organ-grinder.Ironically, Mandelson and Starmer are not personally close, and in opposition his constantly proffered advice was sometimes a source of irritation. But Mandelson found a way in, as he always does, via friendlier shadow cabinet ministers and crucially his mentorship of McSweeney. It is precisely that ability to ooze through locked doors that got him to Washington: if anyone could get inside Donald Trump’s head at a time of existential danger for Europe, it was the man who for all his flaws is an extraordinarily gifted politician, possessing an almost supernatural ability to anticipate and manipulate those around him.On his shift, Britain got its trade deal,escaped miraculously lightly from tariffsand helped persuade the White House, at least temporarily,not to betray Ukraine. Perhaps history will judge some of these victories worth having, though it’s hard to say precisely how much was owed to Mandelson and how much to his old friend (and now foreign policy adviser) Jonathan Powell, assorted cabinet ministers, or outgoing ambassadorKaren Pierce. But if the prize was epic, so were the risks.For the sake of full disclosure, I was a baby political reporter during Mandelson’s first resignation in 1998 – over taking a secret loan from the millionaireLabourminister Geoffrey Robinson to buy a swanky house he couldn’t afford – and part of the Observer reporting team that precipitated his second, this time over his response to allegations that he intervened on behalf of an Indian billionaire seeking a British passport.Years later, my overriding memory of that time is the palpable anguish of his colleagues deciding that they couldn’t trust his version of events. What most surprises me isn’t that another prime minister took a risk on Mandelson’s talents and lived to regret it, but that when trouble came calling, Starmer seemingly gave him the benefit of the doubt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it came to Mandelson, the wrong side won | Emma BurnellRead moreMandelson insists that he never personally saw any wrongdoing in Epstein’s homes, suggesting thatas a gay manvisiting with his then partner (and now husband), it’s perhaps not surprising that Epstein never offered him “any introductions to women in the way that allegedly he did for others”. But it was a matter of public record that their friendship survived Epstein’s exposure and every alarm bell should have rung on Wednesday morning, when the Sun’s Harry Cole posted clips of a forthcoming interview in which Mandelson said he regretted staying close for too long – a classic move to get ahead of a damaging story.Questions will obviously be asked about everything from vetting to who knew what in advance of prime minister’s questions. But barely a fortnight after the last reset of the Downing Street machine, there are almost no minions left to fire.What is left instead is a prime minister who in surrounding himself with Tony Blair’s brightest talents – not just Powell, but fixer Pat McFadden, policy chief Liz Lloyd and most recentlyspin doctor Tim Allan– inadvertently left himself nowhere to hide. If all the old ingredients, added to the pot in roughly the old order, can’t start producing something like the old magic by next spring’s local elections, then eventually there will be nobody to blame but the chef. Don’t be surprised if, at that point, someone else tries to take over the kitchen.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Inclusion without voice is tokenism | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreMamdani should be a darling of the left and liberal press. But what the veiled racism echoes, in a more subtle way, is the same anxiety I feel writ large and explicit in the rise of Trumpism and its echoes in Australia. Demographic changes are irrevocably transforming power in western democracies.

But Mamdani’s ability to sit proudly in that, a respect for his heritage, a confidence in his self, and a vision for the future, is a real decolonial practice.

We are comfortable with difference and tradition, loving our Naanis, and often existing in the pointy, working-class ends of society, where surveillance and systemic violence as well as lack of access to affordable housing, education, safety and justice have forced a political savvy and urgency to mobilise and challenge systems that impact us the most.I belong to the beach and also to Eid, in swimmers and shalwar kameez. I’m a feminist who prays, and happy to wave both Pride flag and Palestinian keffiyehFor a long time, the price of entry to these worlds of power was to capitulate to the model of the grateful migrant. The insanity of our current times has perhaps created an opportunity, an appetite, for the kind of boldness, cultural confidence and agility Mamdani embodies. As the fear-mongering and Islamophobia reach saturation point and doesn’t seem to work, especially in the age of social media, a new appetite emerges – for unapologetic voices who refuse to be silenced.Just like Mamdani, who visited a Shia mosque in the Muslim holy month of Muharram and represented for Pride, stepping out of the pigeonholes and private spaces I’m allowed to exist in has made me feel more confident and mentally healthy and helped me find the right people in my life.

Personally, I would be in favour of peers throwing out the whole idea, which is what this dangerous and badly written bill surely deserves. But it is unlikely that they will want to go so directly against the Commons, especially on such a controversial issue. So instead I must hope that they listen to disabled people’s groups, as well as legal and medical experts, and at least undo some of the lower house’s most egregious errors.Whether you are for or against the principle ofassisted dying(I am pro), we should be able to agree that the passage of this particular bill through the Commons has been haphazard, deeply unedifying and fundamentally flawed. The Lords should reject this precedent and, by adopting a better process, produce a much safer bill than the one they have been sent.Although peers can’t do anything about the fact that the bill is a private member’s bill, which somewhat limits the scrutiny it endures, it can allocate more time to debating it. The Commons did dedicate several days to its second and third readings, but on both occasions many MPs who wanted to speak did not get the chance to do so. The new home secretary (then the justice secretary), Shabana Mahmood, was among those who said there hadnot been enough timefor debate. Of course, MPs often don’t get to speak during a debate, but when a law fundamentally changes the nature of the state, limiting the voices that are heard cannot be a good thing. A shift this big should not be rushed. And given the failures of the Commons process, dissenting opinions should be prioritised. The Lords exist to provide scrutiny, especially when politics means MPs haven’t, so peers should slow down and give this bill as much debate time as possible. Everyone should be heard – especially the peers who are experts in disability rights, healthcare, and inequality.In a similar spirit, the Lords could bring in many more outside voices. One of the worst parts of the Commons process happens at committee stage. This is where interested and affected parties are invited to give evidence about a bill to a select group of MPs whose job it is to scrutinise itslanguage and propose amendments based on what they hear. For a private member’s bill, the members of the committee are chosen by the bill’s proponent, meaning the committee usually leans in favour of the bill. But, even with that natural bias taken into account, the committee made some extraordinary decisions with the assisted dying bill. The original lineup for oral evidence did not include a single disabled people’s organisation, and it was only after much clamour from within and beyond parliament that Disability Rights UK was added to the billing as the most affected community’s sole representative. Other disabled people who gave evidence spoke in favour of the bill, despite the fact that a coalition of 350 disability organisations have, in an unprecedented move,united to oppose it. This clearly represents a critical imbalance that the Lords should endeavour to correct. Disabled people are not a monolith, of course, but when a bill so directly affects our lives (and deaths), we deserve to be front and centre, with our views fairly represented. Hearing from us would, one can only hope, lead peers to add desperately needed safeguards into the bill.One way to do this would be to reintroduce amendments rejected by the committee, including those designed to exclude anorexic people from assisted dying, to protect prisoners and homeless populations, to give those with learning disabilities tailor-made information and to ensure that patients, not doctors, would be the first to raise the option of an assisted death. The rejection of these safeguards was horrifying, and made even worse by the fact that such important, literally life-and-death votes were taken by 23 hand-picked MPs rather than all of them. In an effort to make the bill safer, it is vital that when the Lords go through their own committee stage, as many crucial decisions are left to the whole House as possible.But it’s not just on procedure where the Lords could outdo the lower house. Throughout the bill’s Commons passage,MPs were (deliberately or not) misled. When the committee stripped out judicial oversight, MPs were told safeguards had been strengthened. They were repeatedly told that disabled people were excluded from the bill’s provisions, but anyone with a progressive condition and an unscrupulous doctor might qualify. They were even told that the medical royal colleges supported a change in the law, but the Royal College of General Practitionersis officially neutral, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists hasvoiced serious concernsabout the specifics of the bill. The best and simplest way the Lords could foster a better debate is by having an honest one, based on the bill before them, not a lofty ideal. The truth always matters; here, it is absolutely vital.It would be easy to ask peers to chuck out the assisted dying bill. But it would also be naive and perhaps counterproductive. Instead, I ask them to give it, and disabled people’s lives, the consideration and time they deserve, to strengthen its safeguards with the amendments MPs rejected (and add others), and to have an honest debate. If the Lords does so, it will have proven its worth, tenfold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scottish politics has been pivotal in the UK-wide battle over gender self-identification, and the issue hascome up at the Edinburgh festival before. Probably no one would have expected the National Library of Scotland to be the battlefield. But when a bestselling gender-critical anthology, The Women Who Wouldn’t Wheesht, was excluded from a centenary exhibition, that is what happened.The book, whose title means “the women who wouldn’t be quiet”, is a collection of essays about the Scottish campaign against Nicola Sturgeon’s gender reforms. Its 34 authors include JK Rowling, six politicians and the group For Women Scotland, which won April’slandmark supreme court caseabout the meaning of the words “sex”, “woman” and “man” in the Equality Act.Its editors, Lucy Hunter Blackburn and Susan Dalgety, were already upset when they learned that their book had not been chosen for the Dear Library exhibition. They had not been invited to appear at the Edinburgh book festival either – despite their big-name contributors and hot topic. So they put in a freedom of information request. When it revealed that their bookhad received four nominationsfrom members of the public, before being rejected at the urging of an LGBTQ+ staff network, they complained.Last week’s result, after apointed interventionby Index on Censorship, wasan apology and a U-turn. Blackburn, a former civil servant,said it had been “emotional”, and that she would now tell her 97-year-old mother, a retired bookseller, all about it.This perhaps sounds tame compared with the Irish writer Graham Linehan’s arrest at Heathrow by armed officers, and therow about the policing of tweetsthat followed. But I think the argument about The Women Who Wouldn’t Wheesht is important – and not only because, as theauthor of a gender-critical book myself, its reception has implications for me.When trans rights activists and allies talk about this issue as a “culture war”, they imply that advocates for single-sex sports and spaces, or against treating children with puberty-blocking drugs, lack the legitimacy of other human rights campaigners. Disagreements about sex and gender identity are portrayed as the gratuitously divisive fodder of rightwing populists.I think this is anti-democratic and anti-feminist. Women’s concerns about their safety, privacy and equal sporting opportunities should be part of the political mainstream. But if culture is defined more narrowly to mean the interlinked worlds of publishing, media, arts and entertainment, then it is true that a battle over women’s and trans rights is raging there, having been displaced from the centre of politics by the UK and Scottish governments’ rejection of self-ID, and the supreme court’s ruling that “sex” in the Equality Act refers to biological sex.While governments accepted the 87-page judgment, the National Library of Scotland is not the only cultural organisation to have taken the view (until it changed its mind) that gender-critical arguments should be ignored or suppressed. This attitude has been prevalent in the humanities faculties of universities as well. One early example was the treatment, by some students and staff, of the philosopher Kathleen Stock. Her book Material Girls: Why Reality Matters for Feminism was the first “trade” title (for a general audience) of the UK campaign against self-ID. In 2021Stock left her jobat the University of Sussex after protests, including smoke bombs, targeted her. Other cases cited in arecent reportby the social researcher Matilda Gosling on the publishing industry include campaigns by colleagues against the children’s author Rachel Rooney and the publisher Ursula Doyle, who recently settled a discrimination case against her former employer Hachette.Blackburn and Dalgety were ignored not only by Edinburgh’s book festival. They have not been invited to any book festivals at all. Nor hasJenny Lindsay, the Scottish author of Hounded, which describes how she was driven out of her career as a poet and arts programmer due to her gender-critical views. There are more than 100 literary festivals in the UK each year, and big ones such as Edinburgh’s feature hundreds of authors.I was invited to three literary festivals, and am lucky to be able towrite about these issuesin the Guardian. But I have also been snubbed. Last year the Conway Hall in London refused a booking for a launch of my book, and complaints to other venues where I was appearing were stressful and upsetting. In June I had the humiliating experience of beingcancelled in Polandafter an interview I gave to a news website, Oko, was taken down the day after publication – a decision for which Oko, which won an Index on Censorship award in 2020, gave no explanation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People working in the arts have also suffered. In 2023 Denise Fahmywon a harassment caseagainst Arts Council England. She now helps to run an organisation promotingfree expression for artists.About the law, the British anti-self ID movement has been proved right. Gender identity does not trump biological sex in the Equality Act. Trans people’s rights and protections coexist with sex-based ones, rooted in the reality that biology shapes us all. By keeping what they regard as bigoted views out of cultural spaces, activists presumably believe themselves to be moving ahead of an outdated law. Of course individuals must be free to express views and make choices. But they should be mindful of the cumulative effect of their complaints and boycotts. I think they undermine principles of diversity, inclusion and pluralism, and make a mockery of progressive claims to stand against culture wars.Susanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British FeminismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Built in the unions’ distant 1970s heyday, the hulking traditional venue fortheir annual TUC conferenceis sometimes a melancholy place, windowless meeting rooms half-full of delegates and union leaders trying to raise their spirits while talking about setbacks, betrayals and rare victories.Yet for much of this conference the sun was out, the wind was light by Brighton standards and, inside the centre, the exhibition stand for Labour Unions, the collective body for those affiliated to the party, was plastered with uplifting posters promoting “Labour’s new deal for working people”. Theemployment rights bill, less comprehensive than some trade unionists would like but full of improvements never offered by New Labour, is expected to easily clear one of its final parliamentary hurdles next week.Not since the 1970s have unions known a period when their powers are significantly expanding rather than contracting. Yet not since then, too, has there been such anunpopular Labour government– or such a menacing wave building on the radical right. With the party down to 20% in some polls, ever further below Reform UK, if we assume that Labour’s total vote of 9.7 million at the last election has fallen in line with its ratings, there may now be fewer Labour supporters, about 6 million, than there are trade unionists – who numbered 6.4 million at the last count, after almost half a century of shrinkage.So unions find themselves in an unexpected and paradoxical position. The more the government struggles, the more it needs their support – unlike New Labour’s much more popular, less union-friendly administrations. “Let us remember, we are the real power of theLabourmovement,” said Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, in an almost swaggering speech in Brighton on Tuesday, rapturously received in the cavernous main hall.However, Keir Starmer’s mounting difficulties are also making it more and more likely that Labour will lose power in four years, or sooner. While Reform has made gestures of support towards some trade unionists, such as steelworkers, its MPs have voted against the employment rights bill. “We must make it easier to hire and fire,” says Reform’s website, reflecting the rightwing business interests, former Tory voters and dogmatic free-marketeers who fund and support the party. At theTUCconference this week, Reform was constantly invoked by speakers, and not in a hopeful way.Meanwhile, expressions of cautious optimism about the employment rights bill and the government’s generally pro-union attitude, so far, were mixed with anxiety that the bill – which is scheduled to take two more years to fully become law – will be watered down as part of the government’s panicky but seemingly relentless shift rightwards. At last year’s conference, I watched the then minister for employment rights, Justin Madders, tell a bar full of pleasantly surprised delegates that fairer workplaces were essential, partly “to show people quickly the difference a Labour government can make”. Last weekend, Madders was sacked without explanation during the reshuffle after the resignation of Angela Rayner, another of the unions’ key allies. Lobbying against the bill by parts of business and their many media allies continues to be relentless.Given these developments, should the unions get what they can, while they can? “A lot of people are of that mind,” one delegate told me. Unions have always been partly about collective self-interest: their first duty is to their members, not Labour. This was vividly clear on Monday evening, when Eddie Dempsey, the combative new general secretary of the RMT transport union, was greeted like a hero at a packed Brighton fringe meeting, cheers echoing off the low ceiling, for leading the tube strike which at that very moment was messing up the London rush hour and Sadiq Khan’s Labour mayoralty.Yet it’s a mistake to think that only members’ gains interest unions. Even more than other TUC conferences I’ve been to, this year’s resounded with critiques of the state of the country: “excess profits”, “rotting regulators”, “asset bubbles created by corrupt policies”, “a 10-fold increase in the number of billionaires since 1990”. Ambitious proposals such as wealth taxes and restructuring the economy were equally common – along with exasperation at the government’s cautious policies.“They’re not offering systemic solutions,” Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, not affiliated to Labour, told me. She suggested that influential figures around Starmer were more interested in “factional politics”. Strikingly, many speakers at the conference referred to his administration in cool, distancing language, as “the Labour government” or “the Starmer Labour government”, rather than “our government”.If this party can’t satisfy trade unionists, then it’s increasingly possible that others will. One delegate I met who had had enough of Starmer – “just more austerity” – had already set up a branch of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s half-formed new party. Like Reform, it floated through lots of conversations in Brighton, a spectre of more Labour troubles to come.Meanwhile, another threat was already present in physical form. Zack Polanski, the Greens’ leftwing new leader, was a polite yet forceful participant at a fringe meeting on taxing the super-rich. “I’ve come here to listen to workers who are feeling incredibly let down by this Labour government,” he said. The party had been “corporate-captured”. His conclusion was predictable but typically pithy: “Trade unionists, your home is no longer in the Labour party.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour, and what it can and can’t do for trade unionists, still permeated the talk in Brighton, from animated delegates arguing or agreeing in the conference centre’s draughty bars and corridors to set-piece speeches in the main hall. Addressing the latter, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary and favourite for Labour deputy leader, insisted that the employment rights bill would be enacted “in full”.Her fluent and personal speech – perhaps also an early pitch for Labour’s more senior job – got only respectable applause. Labour and the unions are wary of each other now, despite what the government still looks likely to do for workers. As with the wider electorate, “delivery” is not bringing the rewards Starmer expected. If that disconnect continues, and Reform takes power, then this week’s TUC conference, tetchy and anxious though it often was, may seem like something from a lost golden age.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTUCOpinionLabourTrade unionscommentShareReuse this content"

We sit in comfort watching death and destruction fall on thousands in Gaza andUkraine. Each night we see buildings exploding, people screaming and children starving. Statesmen stand around and deplore. There is anxious talk of what next –another 9/11 perhaps, or a Cuba 1962? Or is it, as some say, a 1939 or 1914 moment? As for the one man with notional power over the world, Donald Trump, his pledge of an end to wars has proved futile – and a bonanza for defence industries everywhere.Whenever someone cries that something must be done, I always ask by whom? Day after day, Britain’s Keir Starmer – when he isn’tbattling domestic crisesand scandals –rises in the Commons to announce that he is working towards a ceasefire. But he is not. He is talking about working. If Trump cannot stop the killing – and he patently cannot – how can Starmer possibly do so? He has taken eagerly to the rhetoric of statesmanship. A lingering legacy of empire is that Britons expect of their rulers a running commentary on world affairs, as in the prime minister yesterdayon the killing of Charlie Kirk. I am not aware of Swedes or Italians expecting the same.In 1901, as Europe’s nations flexed their muscles amid rising tensions, the young Churchill pleaded for caution in such rhetoric. The wars of tomorrow, he said, would no longer be tidy battles between soldiers. Whipped by public opinion, they would be vindictive. “The wars of peoples,” he said, “will be more terrible than those of kings.” And that was before the coming of aerial bombardment.There can be no virtue at present in predicting global catastrophe. The Gaza conflict is confined to a strip of coast where one atrocity, Hamas’s disgusting 7 October massacre, was met by a monstrously disproportionate one, courtesy of a politically trapped Benjamin Netanyahu. The US is by far hislargest supplier of armsand must have an obligation to curb him. The Arab world will doubtless settle its own scores, but we must pray this time that we can stay out of it. Britons owe victims of war their charity, but that is surely all.As for Ukraine, Russia had reason to regard the 1990s expansion of Nato eastwards with suspicion. It has since respected that boundary in terms of war – untilits drones entered Polandthis week – but has continued its long tradition of interfering with its smaller neighbours and peoples. Georgia, Chechnya and Ukraine in 2014 all suffered Russian aggression. They were all allowed to pass by the west, as had been the Soviet Union’s interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan in former times.What was different about Ukraine was the scale of Russia’s attack. Vladimir Putin thought he could swiftly topple Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, where he assumed he would find sympathisers. Ukraine was not in Nato, but what shocked the west was the scale of Putin’s arrogance – that and Kyiv’s spirited defence. ButRussiacan fight for ever. We must assume that sooner or later some extension of the 2014 border will stabilise, probably on Russian terms.There are two views of what kept the cold war with the Soviet Union cold. One is that Nato’s US nuclear arsenal held at bay a Soviet ambition to conquer Europe. I must have attended a hundred defence conferences, but never have I once seen evidence of this ambition. It deserves to rank among the most costly fictions in modern history, dressed up by defence lobbyists as “insurance”.The other view is realistic. It is that the cold war policy of containment was a success. The policy was advanced in the aftermath of the second world war by the Russia expert George Kennan, and adhered to by Dwight D Eisenhower and his presidential successors. It averted any direct confrontation with Russia, merely confining it within its “sphere of interest”. The policy defended West Berlin and reacted to Cuba and helped eject the Soviets from Kabul. Communism decayed and collapsed from within.Whether the west might have done more to help Russia restore its self-respect in the 1990s is the subject of much debate. Instead, Nato’s expansion unleashed the country’s latent reserve of paranoia, personified in Putin. But there is nothing to suggest that the policy of containment is still not effective – witness Joe Biden’s scrupulously limited aid to Zelenskyy.The west’s strategy of making Zelenskyy believe it would deliver him total victory over Russia was a clear mistake. So too was the counterproductive shambles of western sanctions, and the resulting buildup of a new Brics-plus bloc, led by China. Strategy was sacrificed to tactics.As for Britain, a cohort of defence chiefs have joined Fiona Hill, co-author of Starmer’s defence review, in maintaining that “Russia is at war with Britain”. It is a war requiring “whole society” mobilisation. This is bonkers. Putin clearly likes pumping his muscles with killings and espionage, and his cyber-attacks must be contained. But terrifying Britons into ever more defence spending merely gives Starmer a free pass for endless foreign trips.Europe has a real awakening ahead. Forget Trump – the fact is that Americans in future are not going to honour Nato’s guarantees without question. Europe must look to its own, and that means eventually making peace with Russia. If some western European states wish to arm themselves to the hilt, so be it. Russia offers no conquering threat to British territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Starmer has positioned himself as a lead player among other European leaders. He clearly fancies himself as being in the premier diplomatic league, and he needs the equipment to match. He is maintaining a carrier presence east of Suez. He has held on to aChagos base in the Indian Ocean. He wants to strengthen his nuclear posture with costly fighter jets. These have nothing reallyto do with the defence of Britain – or Europe – any more than did Blair’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Pumping up a Russian threat to Britain on the back of Putin’s reckless blunder in Ukraine may make good politics. War always has the best tunes. Boris Johnson could not stay out of Kyiv’s central square. We can shower Ukraine with charity, but this is not Britain’s long-term dispute and no amount of public hysteria will make it so.The foremost duty of an elected government is the defence of its own people in their own communities. Britons need protecting there as much as ever. But Britain’s home soil has not been under serious military threat since the second world war. All else is a staggering waste of money.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionRussiaUkraineGazaIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder we are taking to the streetsFri 12 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 12.48 EDTShareThe protests that rocked France this week did not come out of the blue. For more than a year now, our country has been in a state of unprecedented political turmoil. You can date this crisis to June 2024, when Emmanuel Macron unexpectedlycalled a snap electionthat produced gridlock in the national assembly, rendering all subsequent governments unable to govern. This week’s events have added another historic chapter to the tumult.For the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic, a government collapsed after a vote of confidenceinitiatedby a prime minister. François Bayrou, in office for just nine months, chose to place his ministerial fate in the hands of an openly hostile hung parliament. The outcome was a foregone conclusion: even the right, though partly represented within his government, broke ranks – a third of the conservative (Les Républicains) deputies refused to back Bayrou. Now, with Sébastien Lecornu – a close ally ofEmmanuel Macron– becoming France’s fifth prime minister to be sworn in since May 2022, the question looms large: how did France, whose institutions once seemed so unshakable, arrive at such a state of fragility?Make no mistake: the hallmark of Macron’s presidency is his persistent disregard for the will of the people. And it is to this disregard that Bayrou really fell victim. Last year’s legislative elections placed the left-leaning New Popular Front (NFP) – rallying to stop the far right –ahead of any other political grouping. True, the left did not secure an absolute majority, but under the established norms of the Fifth Republic, the president should have appointed a prime minister with the support of a parliamentary majority.Instead, Macronchose defiance. Herejected Lucie Castets, the candidate put forward by the NFP coalition, despite their internal divisions. He then postponed the appointment of a new prime minister until after the Olympic Games before imposing on us a government devoid of any legitimacy.‘My first barricade’: French protests unite teachers, gilets jaunes and studentsRead moreThe president –nicknamed“Jupiter” by his entourage, a nod to his supposed authority and distance from mere mortals, just like the king of the Roman gods – chose the septuagenarian Michel Barnier, a fixture on the French political scene for decades. It was an utterly incomprehensible move in the context: here was Macron appointing a man from the rightwing Les Républicains party, whose legitimacy bordered on nonexistent, having polled a mere 6.6% in the elections. Moreover, the Barnier cabinetincluded numerous figuresfrom previous administrations as well as members of Macron’s own party, even though the voters had clearly rejected the ruling political class.Unsurprisingly, Barnierwas toppledby parliament barely three months later. Macron then appointed Bayrou, one of his closest allies – a figure who, for most French people, has been part of the political landscape for ever.(I was still in middle school when he served as minister of education).Bayrou’s multiple missteps quickly eroded whatever standing he may have had: his callouslack of concernfor the people of the French department of Mayotte after a natural disaster, his use of far-right rhetoric when he talked about the notion of “migratory submersion”, or his role in downplaying acts of violence committed againststudents at a Catholic boarding schoolduring his time as education minister. All of this rapidly made himdeeply unpopularin the eyes of the French public.But Bayrou mystifyingly doubled down, not even flinching as he drove forward the very budgetary reforms that had sparked such public anger and shaped the electoral backlash. Hisausterity plans, unveiled in July, were rightly identified by theunionsandparties of the leftas an assault on low- and middle-income workers that shielded the wealthiest. But he then crossed a line of basic decency by seeking theabolition of two public holidays, effectively asking people to work more for no additional pay. The aim of clawing back the holidays, he claimed, was tosave €4.2bn, a sum almost identical to the revenue lost when Macron, as one of his first acts,scrapped the solidarity tax on wealth.At the same time, aSenate reportpublished over the summer revealed that €211bn in public funds isbeing handed outto businesses annually with no conditions attached. No wonder so much of the French public finds it nauseating to stomach the government’s calls for “responsibility” and sacrifices. The wealth of the 500 richest individualshas doubledsince Macron’s election in 2017 – no doubt aided by generous tax breaks.Revolt has not simmered so fiercely for years. Macron’s two terms as president have been marked by waves of social unrest. Thegilets jaunesbrought the country to a standstill in 2018. Then, in 2023,millionstook to the streets in outrage against Macron’s unfair pension reforms. This anger even spread to France’s overseas departments, with violent unrest particularlyin Martinique, where the cost of living is higher than in mainland France and where deep inequalities rooted in the colonial past persist. Yet his government forced the law through anyway, invoking special powers tobypassparliamentary approval.It is the combined unfairness and heavy-handedness that people so vehemently oppose now – in the streets and at the ballot box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No surprise there: he has spent years defying them. Yet even now, he tasks a party ally – a party voters rejected twice last year – to run the country.This blatant denial of democracy lays bare the dead end of France’s hyper-presidential system, one that grants a single individual enough power to openly disregard the popular will. And it fuels such mass mobilisations as theBlock Everythingmovement.It was clear to many of us – after Bayrou detailed his inequitable budget plans – that this campaign was exploding on social media during the summer. I was on group chats with some of the organisers of the day of action, and could tell that many were simply tired of not being heard. They were trying to find an impactful way on a nationwide scale, to force politicians to listen. Social and climate injustices are at the heart of a discontent that I share.On Wednesday we got a sense of the scale of this movement’s potential on the streets – with protests in more than 500 locations despite the repressive, heavy-handed deployment of riot police. I am not surprised at the public defiance. Policies that deepen social hardship are intolerable for those told to tighten their belts, while the wealthy – idolised by Macron – grow richer still.Rokhaya Diallo is a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Lloyd approaches her subject obliquely, via a complex mise-en-scène in the semi-darkened main gallery. There are screens all round. Some you can sit at, others are hung mid-air from wires or mounted on stands or fixed to the walls. High above, a mirror ball twirls, dimly reflected in a shiny black-painted slab that sits low on the floor in front of a translucent hanging curtain. It is a room of interruptions and diversions. What’s that black slab about? A reference to the seams of coal in Potter’s birthplace in the Forest of Dean on the border between England and Wales? I think of the glossy black of a grand piano, and a dance-orchestra backing Al Bowlly, Potter’s favourite 1930s crooner. Does the slab intimate a darkness haunting Potter’s life and work? Moving around is a constant negotiation. Potter’s past collaborators appear and disappear, re-enact moments from his work, reminisce and get sidetracked.Annotated pages of his scripts, not always easy to read, appear on a screen high above our heads. On another, the Berry Hill Silver Band (in which the youthful Potter once played) practise As Time Goes By. On another screen, sitting at home and speaking with Lloyd, the now 85-year-old broadcaster and authorMelvyn Braggremembers hisfamous last television interviewwith Potter in 1994, and gets waylaid by a memory of a New York sidewalk encounter with Lauren Bacall. High Frequency is full of delays and diversions.View image in fullscreenInstallation view of Hilary Lloyd’s Very High Frequency at Studio Voltaire, London.Photograph: Dominique CroshawWearing headphones and standing before the screen on its raised lectern, I struggle to listen. Behind me, Henry Hall and the BBC Radio Orchestra strike up the familiar, swaggering bars of The Teddy Bear’s Picnic. “If you go down to the woods today you’re in for a big surprise,” goes the song. Two young men are fucking in the bracken. Avid and bucolic, the bodies are pale in the dappled green woods as they kiss and wrestle, in a situation devised by Lloyd. Potter’s 1968 television playA Beast With Two Backsfictionalised an incident in the 1890s, when an itinerant troupe of French Travellers, accompanied by some dancing bears, were waylaid in the forest and their bears killed, in retaliation for an entirely unrelated attack on a local young girl. Potter’s work is filled with memory and secrets, sex and death, and the forest itself is a protagonist as much as a setting.Here’s footage of the sections of the rail tracks that led into now defunct little forest coal mines, bits of rusting equipment, piles of decaying pit-props and sealed-up entrances to pits which Potter described as being like great black sows buried in the trees. Going from screen to screen, headphones come on and off. Now a supermarket trolley clatters along a street. Then there’s talk of iron and coal and charcoal burning, and the history of the region, and phone-footage of cats donated by a staff member at the gallery. Lloyd gets everyone involved.Richard E Grant has a jolly lunch at Quo Vadis in Soho with Studio Voltaire curator Nicola Wright. We get a sneak glimpse of the day’s menu, a look at Grant’s wine glass, his watch, his Adidas pumps, his winning appeals to the camera. Zinnnnnnng! Grant was in Potter’sKaraoke(one of his last works, posthumously produced in 1996) and now he’s miming to Zing Went the Strings of My Heart, and lip-syncing to Pennies from Heaven. Elsewhere there are interviews with actors Janet Suzman, Alison Steadman, John Belcher, Potter’s location scout and “fixer”, and Kenith Trodd, who produced much of Potter’s work.But there’s lot here that feels superfluous and extraneous. Videos of cats and grasshoppers, a phone camera zooming back and forth, the phrase Wow What a Shit Show sequinned on to a shirt, closeups of baubles on a Christmas tree. I guess it is all texture, and might allude to tiny details in Potter’s fictions or his life.View image in fullscreenSecrets on show … A still from The Singing Detective by Dennis Potter (1986).Photograph: undefined/© BBC Archive.Lloyd likes losing us in detail. Perhaps it all comes back to Potter’s remarks, when he was dying, about living in the moment, when “things are both more trivial than they ever were, and more important than they ever were, and the difference between the trivial and the important doesn’t seem to matter”. This could easily be the motor of Lloyd’s own art.Thirty years after his death, Potter isstill being talked about, and his one-off television plays and longer series, which came to include fantasy segments, lip-synced song and dance routines, sex, murder and autobiographical allusions to his own childhood abuse by an uncle, have a continuing resonance. One series,Pennies from Heaven, was remade as a critically well-regardedHollywood film, though it bombed at the box office. Another,The Singing Detective, starred Michael Gambon, who spent much of the work in a hospital bed, suffering the same chronic and debilitating psoriatic arthropathy as Potter.View image in fullscreenDetailed stories … Hilary Lloyd, work in progress, 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistDivisive, contrarian and enormously creative, Potter was an outspoken and complex figure, both as a man and as a playwright. The complexities of Lloyd’s own art, and her approach to Potter make for a rich, allusive but sometimes frustrating exhibition. You have to work at it. Potter’s interview with Bragg, recorded just a month after the playwright’s diagnosis with terminal cancer, has been called the writer’s final great work. The interview was unscripted and uncensored. “This is my chance to say my last words,” says Potter towards the end.Filmed in a darkened studio, with Potter smoking and drinking champagne and swigging from his hip-flask of morphine as he talks with Bragg, the conversation is full of life, even in death’s ante-room (he would die a few weeks later). Potter is funny, serious and unafraid. Shown in a room away from the main gallery, it demands our attention. Nowadays, this interview is referred to more often than Potter’s television plays, which are rarely screened. For one thing, their production values often work against them. But Bragg’s interview is as present as ever it was. Ed Atkins’ 2021 film The Worm, recentlyscreened in his Tate Britain show, builds on the physical situation of that interview, which is also the key work here, not least for Potter’s fortitude and candour about death and dying, and his years of debilitating illness.View image in fullscreenCashback … Bob Hoskins  and Cheryl Campbell in the BBC play Pennies from Heaven (1978).Photograph: © BBC Archive. Photograph by Christopher RidleyAs we watch, high on the wall in the corner behind us, Lloyd’s silent, looped film Blossoms plays. Out-of-focus pink and white blossom sways silently in a light breeze against a blue sky. You know it is there but you can’t see it when you are looking at Potter’s amused smile and listening to his soft accent, as he talks about the blossom on the plum tree beyond his window in Ross-on-Wye.Lloyd’s exhibition gives us an opportunity to think about Potter again. There will be screenings of many of his television plays, and of other archive television interviews with Potter. All this is more than period flavour, and we get a sense of Potter’s originality, his belief in the possibilities of television as a medium, and its vitality and openness during the period in which he was working. What Lloyd brings to Potter, and Potter’s work to Lloyd, is less clear. Perhaps it is all about the slipperiness of life, and how hard it is to capture significance, or to know what or where it is.Hilary Lloyd: Very High Frequency is at Studio Voltaire, London, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsInstallationDennis PotterArtVideo artreviewsShareReuse this content"

But if you ever needed proof that they’re not actually the same, it’s the fact that when I meet him for breakfast at his London hotel, he’s not at the buffet with an oversized plate, the staff aren’t giggling at him, and we’re not in a Travel Tavern.We’re here to talk about his new show, How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge). It’s the latest instalment in the wider Partridge universe in which he presentsdigital radio,writes books, successfullypodcasts,goes on tour, and made his BBC comeback on magazine programmeThis Time.(The character is now co-written with the Gibbons brothers, rather than Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham.)This time round we meet an altogether happier, wiser Partridge 3.0. He’s no longer in the public eye, but “finds a steady stream of Norfolk-based corporate work just as fulfilling. On the face of it, my life is great,” we learn. “I’ve got a large house,” – he lives in the oasthouse from his podcast – “my partner Katrina [played brilliantly by Katherine Kelly] is one of the fittest women over 40 in Norfolk.”View image in fullscreenNorfolk legend … Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.Photograph: Rob Baker Ashton/BBC/Baby CowThe show is a documentary, self-funded by Pear Tree Factual Productions, as he explores the topic of mental health: something else that Partridge is dealing with personally. He presents to camera. He conducts vox pops, hosts focus groups and interviews local experts. There are infographics. There’s behind-the-scenes stuff with (yes!) Lynn. He attempts to reconcile with Sidekick Simon (Tim Key), who has had enough of Partridge’s constant criticism, in the name of mental health. He visits a book club and takes to the air wearing a jet pack. Forget Partridge 3.0. This is Partridge 4.0 and a half.Given the theme of the new show, what I really want to get to grips with is Coogan’s inner Partridge. I’ve come armed with therapy-style questions. My thinking is: if I don’t have Coogan in tears with repressed emotion by the end of the interview, I haven’t done my job properly.Things start well when Coogan’s press woman (who disappointingly looks nothing like Lynn) introduces me with a mention of the Guardian’srecent autumn TV preview, which (correctly) claims Partridge to be “the greatest comedy character ever produced by the UK.”“No pressure then,” smiles Coogan.“Alan’s definitely more popular than me. That’s a given,” he says when I ask if he’s jealous of Partridge’s universal appeal. “He also wants to be liked by as many people as possible. I don’t care about that. I want enough people to like me so that I’m allowed to exist.“As you get older, I do feel like Idon’thave to be to everyone’s taste. I’m OK with some people finding me irritating. When something has really gotten under my skin, rather than get broadsided for it, I’ll have Alan be the champion of the thing I loathe, but in a funny way. You can’t just have a big psychological wank. That’s not entertainment. But it’s a good starting point.”What advice would Coogan give Partridge on this chapter of his life?“I would say: ‘Don’t try and be something you’re not. You’re never going to host Newsnight. Lean into what you’ve got.’”What would Alan say to the seven-year-old Alan Partridge – and what would Coogan say to his younger self?“[Alan would say:] It’s going to be OK. They will all be proved wrong. You will win.”And Coogan? “It’s not a million miles away. I did have an odd childhood,” he continues. “I was quite sociable and popular, but lazy. I’m an autodidact. What drives me is the class thing. I have deep-seeded class issues, but I don’t mind, because they’re part of the engine. I used to have low expectations of myself. I’d get from one place to another place career-wise, then think: ‘I wonder if I can get over here?’ There’s been times when I’ve turned down quick money. I’ve never done any panel shows. I watch Would I Lie to You? with my mum and think it’s really funny, but I don’t want to go on it. I don’t have the personality …”Why doesn’t he think he has a personality?“I’ve got a personality. But I’m notapersonality. I have to talk about this shit to get people to watch it,” he says, of days when he’s forced to meet the press. “Sometimes people, like you, ask me questions I haven’t thought about before, and that gets folded back into my work, because I’ll think: ‘Oh yeah, that’s why I do that …’”View image in fullscreenA good match? Katherine Kelly as Katrina with Coogan in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: Matt Frost/BBC/Baby CowQuestions like what?“Well, the direct parallel about what Alan and I would say to our younger selves. It makes me think of the sixth-form common room. Maybe this is [a bit] Alan Partridge, I don’t know. Forty years ago, I remember thinking: ‘I could be part of the next generation of comedy. Why don’t I do whatever it is you’re supposed to do and see if that happens? And if it doesn’t, at least I know I tried.’”If Alan was on the therapy couch, what would he be trying to get to the nub of?“I think he would masquerade as emotionally open. But all the things he would confess to would be completely risk free. He’d be posturing. His vulnerability isn’t real vulnerability. It’s affected.”I crank it up. A therapist might say: “Steve, you are using Alan as an avatar. What’s the story you’re not telling yourself?”“I’m reasonably happy as me,” says Coogan. “I look around and think I have lots to be grateful for, so that keeps me grounded. Idoaccept that Alan is an unfiltered, unmitigated, unedited version of me. What’s the story I’m not telling myself? It might be that I don’t really want to fully understand the dysfunctions of my personality. All I know is it works when I shovel it into this avatar, so why mess with it?”Everybody wears masks, I point out, it’s just that Coogan wears one so publicly.“I am self-aware in a way that Alan isn’t,” he says. “Sometimes when I’m speaking to well-educated southerners, my northern accent will fade away. When I’m talking to horny-handed sons of toil from up north, it suddenly comes back. It’s either rank hypocrisy or it’s empathy. I prefer the latter.”Does that apply to subject matter too?“My daughter, Clare, says: ‘You’ve got to stop talking about your midlife crisis. You are way past that.’ Alan is lockstep with whatever will give him the least grief. He’s quite Starmer-esque in that respect. I get angry and sanctimonious. I get incensed and descend into slagging people off. I don’t trust myself in that regard. There’s a catharsis in doing Alan. Some of his world view I fundamentally disagree with. But there will be something that I’ll be glad to put the Alan wig on so I can say it out loud.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a catharsis in doing Alan’ … Coogan with Felicity Montagu as Lynn in How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge).Photograph: How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)./BBC/Baby CowDoes he ever seehimselfas a fictional character? For example, Lorraine Kellysuccessfully claimedfor tax reasons that she appears as “a chatty personality”?“Really? Wow!” This is news to Coogan. “I say things as Alan that are not true, like he had a fight in a car park with Noel Edmonds. The BBC lawyers say: ‘That’s slander.’ How am I slandering someone by saying they had a fight in a car park with a fictional character?”How long before the circles of the Venn diagram of Coogan/Partridge overlap completely?“Maybe they’ll eclipse before passing over each other.” He tells a story of arriving in his trailer to find a blue, checked Aubin and Wills shirt to wear while playing Partridge – which was identical to the one he was already wearing. “I did take mine off and put the other one on, even though there was no one to witness me. There was a time when I was writing with Armando and Pete when I’d say something as myself, and they’d just write it down as Partridge and it would irritate me. Now the Gibbons do it all the time. As you get older, you realise it’s all gravy.”What life lessons has Partridge taught Coogan?“To be kinder to people.”I glance at the clock: we’re coming up to 45 minutes, which seems like a good cut-off point for a pseudo therapy session. One last question. Will Coogan mind that, when he dies, his obituary will probably say: “best known for playing Alan Partridge?”“It would be nice if they filled in some of the other details,” he laughs. “I remember, as a child, watching Fawlty Towers. It would fill the house with laughter for half an hour, we’d switch off the TV, have a cup of tea and dissect it, to make sure it was imprinted on your memory. It was an event. I remember thinking: how amazing it would be to create something like that. I did that with Alan Partridge. If that’s what I’m remembered for, that’s fine with me.”How Are You?

Such was to be the fate of the Pretty Things in the mid-60s: to be a band who embodied all that was a threat to bourgeois values, to an extent that rather overshadowed the music they were making. The biggest threat of all was Viv Prince, the band’s drummer, whose death at 84 was announced on Instagram on Friday by, fittingly, Jack White.After his sacking he joined the Hells Angels, and was duly thrown out for bad behaviour“Viv was an incredible drummer, wild and full of abandon,”White wrote. “He played for the band the Pretty Things, and he influenced many other musicians like Keith Moon. I was lucky enough to meet Viv some years ago who was working on his farm in Portugal at the time. He was an inspired and eccentric rock and roller and maybe I’ll have to put together a team to work on a documentary about this man one day.”Indeed, so wild was Prince that he lasted barely 18 months before the wildest band in Britain could no longer cope with him. You get a taste from his response to reports in the New Zealand press about the group’s appalling behaviour touring the country in 1965. Returning to the UK, he went through the allegations one by one with Record Mirror’s Norman Jopling.Did they break chairs? “One chair.” Light fires. “Complete lie.” Abuse officials? “We had a go at them because they didn’t make any attempt whatsoever to stop the kids coming through the stage door and into our dressing room.” Ruin heartthrob Eden Kane’s act by laying carpet onstage while he performed? “Everyone was digging it.” Do the same to Sandie Shaw’s act? “I was cleaning up from our act when she came on early.” Drink meths? “We’ve got a great big bottle of water we carry around labelled ‘meths’. It’s a private joke.”The list continued until Jopling reached “the incident at the airport”, about which he offered no detail. “Those bits about the crayfish running around the airport lounge that were printed. The fish were dead when we bought them. They always are. How on EARTH can dead fish run around? And when I was turned off the plane … The captain said straight away, ‘There’ll be no liquor on my plane. You pop groups have been on my plane before.’ As I sat down, a bottle of bourbon I was carrying dropped out. Instantly everyone appeared from nowhere and were upon me, and threw me out of the plane.”Eat your heart out, Spinal Tap.View image in fullscreenThe Pretty Things in 1964 … from left: John Stax, Dick Taylor, Brian Pendelton, Phil May and Viv Prince.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBefore the Pretty Things, Prince’s career reads like an exemplar of the British musician as rock’n’roll established its own commercial and artistic identity, and the young musicians who had picked up instruments in the 1950s tried to work out their place in it. Just look at the names of Prince’s groups – one can almost see the faded photos in one’s mind from reading them: the Viv Prince Skiffle Group, Brian Woolley’s Jazzmen, Lennie Baldwin’s Dauphin Street Six, the Trevor Jones Jazzmen, Carter-Lewis and the Southerners, the Jazz Cardinals.He had joined the last of those in Copenhagen, but then “had to leave Denmark in a hurry”. Back in London he played sessions, and songwriter Jimmy Duncan recommended him to the Pretty Things, who were looking for a new drummer.Prince played only on the first two Pretty Things albums – The Pretty Things and Get the Picture? – but those were the records that established the group as the hardest of the British R&B bands: their debut single, Rosalyn, was wilder than anything the Stones or the Yardbirds were doing at the same time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The full craziness of the Pretty Things was only revealed live. Often, there is no way to verify those claims, but with the Pretty Things there is. There’sa 15-minute clip of the band performing in 1965, and they are unhinged. Viv Prince is the most unhinged of all.The second song is You Don’t Love Me, You Don’t Care, and with the crowd in front of them a seething mass, having to be restrained by men in suits who try to put barriers in place, the band bring the song down to a break of just guitar and harmonica. Which should calm things down, except Prince has come out from behind his kit and is crawling around the stage, drumming on his bandmates, on the ground, turning everything into a circus. It’s wild and thrilling and violent.Prince’s musical career after the Pretty Things didn’t amount to a great deal, but his life took a while to calm down: after his sacking he apparently joined the Hells Angels, and was duly thrown out for bad behaviour. For 18 or months or so, though, the drummer of a moderately successful R&B band from the home counties was the greatest rock star in the world.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Every chorus line and corps de ballet knows it. It has been scientifically proven that we get pleasure from seeing bodies sync up, and French choreographer Sadeck Berrabah’s show, Murmuration Level 2, is on point when it comes to this. The show’s title refers to the mesmerising, morphing formations of flying birds, whole flocks coordinated seemingly by instinct. In this show, nothing has been left to instinct and these dancers have been drilled within an inch of their lives, creating intricate moving patterns. When an arm hits a 90 degree angle, it’s not 89, or 91, but bang on 90, all 30 dancers at exactly the same time. This is technically very impressive.Berrabah got his break witha viral YouTube videoand has gone on to work for pop acts such as Shakira and Black Eyed Peas. You can see how his style would be so eye-catching in short-form video. You could imagine him on Britain’s Got Talent. The dance is based predominantly on tutting, a street style so-called because it looks a bit like hieroglyphics (King Tut, you see), with very exact, geometric movements of the arms and hands. The cast are dressed in black, sleeves to their elbows, leaving forearms and hands almost floating in space. From a single dancer the effect multiplies to make a complex weave of shifting patterns, a physical fractal. The challenge, not quite met, is how to take this cool effect and keep it interesting for 75 minutes. Meanwhile, the soundtrack of continuous dancey, chill out-y loops, is like a bed; background music. Not enough to carry the show.Later on Berrabah “conducts” the group, his own hands deftly moving as if doing close-up magic with invisible props. He gets some audience participation going and he’s funny, charming, good company; the personality that has been lacking. The best bits are when they up the tempo, the beat kicks in, and smiles beam across the dancers’ faces. There are fleeting solos where shoulders loosen and bounce, flashes of who these dancers are. With more of that you could appreciate the tightly laced sections so much more.AtPeacock theatre, London, until 20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The genius screenwriter behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind andSynecdoche, New York, the devastating Buñuelian comedy of mortality that he also directed, can’t get a movie off the ground. “I’m having great difficulty,” he sighs. “I’m not a person that people want to trust with their money. It’s very frustrating.”Earlier this year, production of a film he was preparing to make – Later the War, starring Eddie Redmayne as a manufacturer of dreams who diversifies into nightmares – was shut down in Belgrade; he hopes it will resume. To make matters worse, he sorely needs some shut-eye. “Not to get into it, but I’m not a great sleeper,” he says, reaching out of frame for his coffee. The webcam is angled in such a way that his bearded, bespectacled face is shunted into the bottom half of the screen, leaving ample space above him where a big, fluffy thought-bubble might go.View image in fullscreenKaufman, right, with Michel Gondry and Kate Winslet at the Academy Awards in 2005.Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/ReutersHe has just arrived back home in New York from the Venice film festival, where he was presenting How to Shoot a Ghost, the second of two lyrical shorts he has directed, both written by the poetEva H.D. This one features Jessie Buckley, star of Kaufman’s 2020 filmI’m Thinking of Ending Things, in which she shuffled through an entire Rolodex of different identities as she was driven through a blizzard to meet her new boyfriend’s parents. Now she plays a recently deceased photographer wandering around Athens in a blue wig, armed with a Polaroid camera and accompanied by a queer translator (Josef Akiki) who is also newly dead. Together, they savour life from the afterlife. ThinkWings of DesireGoes to Greece.View image in fullscreenJosef Akiki, Eva H.D. and Charlie Kaufman at the Venice film festival this month.Photograph: Doreen Kennedy/AlamyThe short is poignant and oddly consoling. “I like what the ghosts come to feel and see about their lives and their deaths,” says 66-year-old Kaufman. “I think it’s a hopeful film. Maybe that has more to do with Eva, since she wrote it. I think she sees beauty as well as pain, and sees that they are not mutually exclusive.” I ask whether he can see beauty, too. “Ican,” he says after a long pause. “I have a lot of anxiety. And I think that gets in the way of the experience of being alive.”View image in fullscreenJosef Akiki and Jessie Buckley in How to Shoot a Ghost.Later this month, Kaufman will bring How to Shoot a Ghost to Bristol’sEncountersfilm festival, where he will also appear on stage with Michel Gondry before a screening of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which Gondry directed. That 2004 gut-punch of a love story, which won Kaufman an Oscar for best original screenplay, stars Jim Carrey as a woebegone soul undergoing a cerebral deepclean to erase all memory of his ex-girlfriend (played by Kate Winslet, beating Buckley to the blue hair by two decades).Kaufman and Gondry spent several days in 1998 driving around Hollywood, pitching the idea for Eternal Sunshine to studio executives. “I had an infected tooth,” Kaufman grimaces. “I’d never been in such pain. But I didn’t have time to go the dentist because we were doing this.” Positive responses offset his agony. “Everybody was, like, ‘It’s a new way to tell a love story’. They knew how to sell it and that was exciting to them.”Once the idea for Eternal Sunshine was sold, Kaufman had to set about writing it, which took time (“It always does”). Gondry wanted to get cracking on a film, so Kaufman pulled an earlier unproduced script from the drawer for him to make in the meantime. The result,Human Nature, starred Patricia Arquette as a hirsute writer, Tim Robbins as a repressed scientist with a “minuscule penis” and Rhys Ifans as his laboratory subject, who was raised as an ape. Full of unruly charm, it flopped and is hard to find these days. “Is it?” asks Kaufman. “I haven’t looked for it.”View image in fullscreenTim Robbins, Rhys Ifans and Patricia Arquette in Human Nature.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyEternal Sunshine, though, was a breakthrough: the most sincere and effective marriage of mainstream and avant-garde ingredients sinceGroundhog Day, and a hit to boot. “Though the people who own the rights report back to me regularly that it’s still in the red,” he says dubiously. “‘Hollywood accounting’ is what it’s called.”Wobbles along the way were mostly to do with the coincidental resemblance of other movies to Eternal Sunshine. Kaufman has said previously that the release in 2000 ofChristopher Nolan’s memory-loss thriller Mementogave him pause during the writing process. Perhaps that’s why the bloviating fictional film critic B Rosenberger Rosenberg, who narratesKaufman’s 2020 novel Antkind, has several digs at Nolan, referring to Starbucks at one point as “the smart coffee for dumb people. It’s the Christopher Nolan of coffee.”John Woo’s 2003 science-fiction thriller Paycheck, released before Eternal Sunshine but now fittingly forgotten, also gave Kaufman a fright. “The trailer showed Ben Affleck with this memory-erasing machine on his head,” Kaufman recalls. “Michel and I were, like, ‘Holy shit!’ We called one of our producers and said, ‘We can’t put the movie out now.’”View image in fullscreenJim Carrey and Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyPerhaps the success of Eternal Sunshine was a mixed blessing for both men. WhenGondry was asked in 2023why he hadn’t made more films in Hollywood, he said: “It’s very hard to work after having worked with Charlie Kaufman.” Other writers’ scripts, he reflected, “all seem very dull”. Maybe those first five spectacular years of being a screenwriter also skewed Kaufman’s expectations of how the rest of his career would pan out. “Well, I’d spent much of my adult life not being successful,” he says. “But, yes, there was this brief moment – beginning when Malkovich opened and ending with Synecdoche – where I was, you know …” He pauses, and I wonder if he is going to say “hot”, a word I can’t imagine ever crossing his lips. “In demand,” he says finally. “Or something.”In 2008 came the global financial crisis – “From which I still don’t think the film business has recovered,” he says – and the release of Synecdoche, New York. The movie, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as an anxiety-riddled and insanely ambitious theatre director mounting a replica of his own life inside a vast warehouse, made no money. “I don’t care,” says Kaufman defiantly. “I’m very happy with it.” Yet, its box-office failure had clear consequences. “My films are well regarded and yet I’m constantly up against this wall of not being able to get financing. And I’m not asking for a lot.” How will the situation ever change? “I guess if I directed something that made a fortune,” he suggests.Would it be intolerable for him to take on a movie he didn’t believe in just to get the clout for his own projects? “I think the world is in a terrible, terrible situation right now,” he says, his tone suddenly grave. “I don’t think that Hollywood has nothing to do with it. I could argue that Hollywood haseverythingto do with it. And I have a responsibility, as I see it, not to put garbage in the world. I’m not going to do that. If you start trying to figure out what it is that people want, you are doing whatAIdoes. The idea of AI precedes AI itself because that’s the Hollywood machine. It’s why they remake the same five movies every 10 years. It’s why they have a formula for what a movie is.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyThe looming horror of AI is much on his mind today. “The most valuable thing to me in terms of my mental health is to read a poem or see a painting or listen to music which speaks to me, which breaks me open for a moment, and where I feel an experience honestly and delicately portrayed. That’s another reason AI can never create anything artistically. It can trick us into thinking it has, but it doesn’t have the experience of being alive. It doesn’t know loss and joy and love and what it feels like to face mortality.I’m very worried about the future in so many ways, and if we don’t allow ourselves to connect with other humans who have the experiences that we have, then I think we’re lost.”The evidence is already around us, he argues. “That’s where the greed and acquisitiveness and all of this garbage comes from. It’s people who are really lost and don’t have anything, so they’re desperately trying to make themselves feel better by acquiring, by lording it over people, by being powerful and wealthy. They’re damaged people doing so much damage.”He throws up his hands. “I’m a damaged person too!” he says. “But I’m trying, you know? I’m trying to be truthful about it.”Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and How to Shoot a Ghost will screen at the Encounters film festival, Bristol on 24 and 25 September respectively.Explore more on these topicsCharlie KaufmanAIArtificial intelligence (AI)interviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the man who plays Mr Farouk, quite beautifully, in the phenomenally successful Netflix seriesHeartstopper. He’s an established stage actor and has featured in a number of director Jamie Lloyd’s recent blockbuster theatre productions, from memorable turns in Lloyd’s bold new versions ofCyrano de BergeracandRomeo and Juliet– where Taleghani’s skill as a rap artist helped him shine in the director’s stripped-back, miked-up productions.This month, Taleghani will be the very first playwright to have a debut play staged on the vast Olivier stage at London’sNational Theatre. To top it all off, the production – a ferociously original, rap-infused take on Euripides’ Greek tragedy The Bacchae – will open Indhu Rubasingham’s inaugural season as the National’s new artistic director.It’s a big deal. Yet as our conversation unfolds in a small side room at the complex, the 32-year-old writer-actor seems remarkably relaxed. There’s something about Taleghani, with his silver chain and twinkling sense of mischief, that seems to exist on the edge of things – a place where all that noise and fuss can’t reach him. “I’m quite a cool cookie really,” he says. “I’m not too tied to the idea that if something good happens, my life is good, and if it doesn’t, my life is bad.”View image in fullscreenUkweli Roach as Dionysus.Photograph: Marc BrennerTaleghani’s parents emigrated from Iran before he was born. He grew up on Elthorne estate in north London and, in his teens, very nearly got expelled from his comprehensive school. In a lovely quirk of fate, it was Taleghani’s drama teacher (who just happened to be the excellent playwright Vivienne Franzmann) who pulled her student back into the fold with the stern words: “You’re good at this. Take it seriously.” And so he did, focusing on his studies a little bit more and messing around in class just a little bit less. Through it all, Taleghani was always interested in rap and rhyme: rapping “badly” in the playground or on the street corner with his friends.After some decent GCSE results, Taleghani “hustled and rascalled” his way into sixth form and eventually landed a place studying English literature at Warwick University. He didn’t always feel comfortable at Warwick and turned to spoken word to help him fit in with a literary crowd: “It was my way of introducing myself to this community I wasn’t used to being around. Because I was different from them. And I knew it.”While studying at Warwick, Taleghani wrote one of his final Shakespeare modules in the form of rap. He was keen to test himself and see if he could do things the “traditional” way – but he also felt there were much more truthful ways to express himself. So Taleghani turned to rap, kickstarting a merging of classical content and contemporary form that has run like an electric thread through his early acting career.View image in fullscreenRoach and Reuben Johnson in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerAfter a master’s in English at University College London, there followed a flurry of acting work in the theatre. This included a particularly memorable Slung Low production ofThe White Whale,stagedon a floating platform at Leeds dock. “It was for 500 people a night and it was free,” he says. “It was for the people and to serve the community. That spirit has stayed with me.” The work made a strong impression, but it was Taleghani’s time atHaringey Shed, when he was still at school, that was truly formative. “That was my first experience of theatre: a bunch of underprivileged kids and young people with different types of disabilities. The whole ethos was: what can we do with who we are and what we have? It was really raw and honest.”If the play’s not good it’s a brutal experience, especially if you feel out of place in those environmentsTaleghani doesn’t raise his voice at this point – he’s far too relaxed for that – but his eyes gleam brighter still. “Watching that type of theatre always gets me so much more emotional and moved than 99% of supposed ‘theatre’. That type of theatre isn’t honest. It’s mannered. Trained. Sculpted. Whereas with Haringey Shed theatre, I believe it. It moves me more when you don’t hit the note perfectly.”Taleghani’s very first authored play nearly didn’t happen. During lockdown, a producer asked the actor – a rising star thanks to his sparkling turn in Heartstopper – if he’d ever considered writing for theatre. No, was his quick reply. “I wasn’t really interested. Being a playwright isn’t my thing. You have to care. There has to be a sense of love. Just because there’s an opportunity there, it doesn’t mean you should take it.”View image in fullscreenSharon Small playing Agave and Clare Perkins as Vida in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerIn fact, Taleghani still seems fairly sceptical about theatre in general. “Cinema’s cool because you can go and have your popcorn and Coke and even if the film isn’t good, you have a good time.” he says. “But if the play’s not good it’s a brutal experience, especially if you feel out of place in those environments. It’s just compounding the tragedy of theatre!”But the playwriting queries kept coming in from producers aware of Taleghani’s rising profile as an actor and talent with rap and spoken word. So Taleghani decided to take another look at The Bacchae – about Dionysus, the Greek god of theatre, wine and general excess, who travels from Asia to Thebes to prove his godliness – and something finally clicked. ‘“I connected with the idea that a god could be a refugee. What does it say about society’s tendency to other people, that even a god can be an outcast? And what kind of god moves from where they’re revered, to somewhere they’re treated like shit? I found that really moving.”Taleghani was determined to do something more with Dionysus’s chorus of followers, the Bacchae, who are “basically just backup dancers” in the original. Not so in Taleghani’s version, where each member of the female chorus has a sharply defined reason to leave their country. Their reasons for fleeing read like mini plays in their own right: one woman “chopped the left bollock off a touchy-feely priest”; another escaped a stoning orchestrated by her own brother; and a third sliced her husband’s face off with a razor after he tried to “rob her oesophagus of its oxygen”.As I sit in on rehearsals on a blazing summer afternoon, Dionysus (Ukweli Roach) is meeting with his band of Bacchae. The very first cue I hear director Rubasingham utter to her huge ensemble cast is: “Can we have a bigger reaction after the word ‘dickhead’?” This is swiftly followed by: “Can we go from, ‘Shut up you shitty little dentist?’” The air crackles with possibility. Everyone in the vast company, including DJ Walde on the decks in one corner and choreographer Kate Prince in the other, seems utterly at ease but excited, too, and buzzing with ideas.The flashes of dialogue I catch are vivid. Bold. Full of defiance and humour. The writing feels dynamic and instinctive, but Taleghani’s first attempt at playwriting didn’t always come easily. He laughs as he recalls his moments of doubt throughout the drafting process, but there’s vulnerability in there too. “I was getting really frustrated,” he says. “Feeling so stupid. Embarrassed. Ashamed. ‘Who do I think I am? Why am I trying to do this? I’m not the person for the job.’” He lets off another brittle laugh. “If I’d submitted my work and they’d said it was rubbish, I would’ve agreed with them. Of course it is! It’s my first draft and I haven’t even googled how to write a play!”At one point, deep into the playwriting process, Taleghani quit altogether. But thanks to support from Rubasingham and her team of dramaturgs, as well as a frenzied co-codamol-fuelled redrafting session while recovering from a minor operation at home – the play kept driving forward.Now, only a year after Taleghani and Rubasingham first met, Bacchae is landing on the Olivier stage with a bang. It comes amid promises of a “new chapter” for the National Theate. Fresh perspectives. An awful lot of press and pressure. Not that Taleghani is taking any notice of all that. “My friends from drama school have much more of a reverence for the NationalTheatre.” He lets out another cheeky chuckle: “I don’t have that. That heritage hasn’t been passed down to me. It isn’t in my body or my bones. So I can just get to work.”Bacchaeis at theNational Theatre: Olivier, London, 13 Septemberto1 November.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some, standing amid yellow and blue flags, simply held placards. “Art is not neutral,” read one. And indeed it isn’t, though opera’s entanglements in international geopolitics are rarely as visible as at Covent Garden in recent months. “It feels like crossing a picket line,” a colleague muttered grimly.But modern opera houses are well soundproofed. By the first interval of Oliver Mears’ new production of Puccini’s Tosca with Russian soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, the protesters had dispersed.Controversial as Netrebko’s casting has proved, the only disturbances inside the auditorium were roars of approval at the end of the opera’s best-loved numbers.As the first collaboration between Mears – the organisation’s director of opera – and its new music directorJakub Hrůša, as well as RBO’s first new production of Tosca in almost 20 years, this was always going to be a high-stakes season opening. The house lights were dimmed only a fraction of a second before Hrůša landed Puccini’s opening orchestral chords, gleaming and bottom-heavy. The curtain rises on a monumental chapel interior: walls of white marble, a heap of rubble and broken pews on one side, Cavaradossi’s painting-in-progress on the other. There is more marble in Scarpia’s palace (forbiddingly cavernous, dominated by a vast wall clock) while the white tiling of Act 3’s torture-chamber-with-a-view is stained from punishments past.View image in fullscreenHorribly believable … Gerald Finley and Anna Netrebko.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMears’ Rome is a 20th-century war zone. The chapel’s sacristan clears rubbish into a plastic bin bag; Cavaradossi is part of a restoration effort. The police chief Scarpia is an oleaginous CEO (1970s double-breasted suit, combover and a constant, fidgeting need to wipe his hands) with late-20th-century surveillance equipment and a team of thugs. Tosca the diva provides a flash of glamour amid so much drab. The only other colour pop is the blood splattered across Acts 2 and 3.These are striking, harshly drawn tableaux.Freddie de Tommaso’s Cavaradossi arrived with all guns blazing and maintained a steady flow of vocal power throughout.Anna Netrebko’s Tosca – her covered soprano now hard and occasionally reedy – could compete with his wattage, but was at her most compelling in extremis, distraught as she negotiated with Scarpia. As the latter,Gerald Finleyprovided something altogether subtler and more insidious, his voice terrifyingly appealing, his bullying presence horribly believable. Holding it all together from the pit, Hrůša drove forwards and pulled back with absolute musical confidence, making space for moments of beauty but mining from the darkest, grittiest passages of Puccini’s score a performance of tremendous emotional force.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 7 October.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

I thought that was going to go swimmingly,” Spielberg told an audience of journalists at the Academy Museum inLos Angelesthis week, where an exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of Jaws is opening on Sunday.“I thought my career was virtually over halfway through production onJaws, because everybody was saying to me, ‘You are never going to get hired again,” Spielberg recalled.Jaws, the Academy Museum’s first exhibit focused on a single film sincethe museum opened in 2021, traces the film’s colorful struggles, including the many mechanical failures of the titular prop shark, along with the artistic collaborations that led to its ultimate success. Film editor Verna Fields won an Oscar for her work shaping the film’s legendary scenes of suspense. So did composer John Williams, whose ominous “dun-dun” theme song has become one of the most recognizable movie soundtracks. The$260.7m successof the film with domestic audiences also launched Spielberg’s career as one of the most influential American directors.But in 1974, as the production was filming on Martha’s Vineyard, it was far from clear that the movie would secure a place in Hollywood history – or even that the film would actually be finished at all. Spielberg’s attempt to shoot on the actual ocean soon put the production massively over budget and behind schedule, he said, due to constant problems with “the shark, the weather, the currents, the regattas”.“I’ve never seen so much vomit in my life,” Spielberg said of people’s queasiness at sea, to laughter. “I haven’t! In the six months out to sea, I have never seen so many people getting sick.”Spielberg himself “never got seasick”, he said – “and I think that is only because I had the weight of this production on my shoulders and I didn’t have time to get sick.”View image in fullscreenThe sole surviving full-scale model of Bruce, the shark from the film, at the Academy Museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APFilming on the ocean caused non-stop challenges, many of which are highlighted in the new exhibit, which focuses on the value of artistic problem-solving. At one point, a speedboat pulling the Orca, the small boat the main characters use to hunt the great white shark, went too fast and pulled out the boat’s planking, sending John Carter, the film’s Academy Award-winning sound director, into the water, his recorder still in his hands.While the Amity Island Regatta is a key plot point in the film, the actual boat races around Martha’s Vineyard caused endless headaches for Spielberg’s wide-lens ocean shots.“I cannot tell you how nerve-racking it is to get the cameras in position. The tides are slack. We don’t have currents dragging our anchors. The picture boat moves away from the Orca, moves away from the electrical barge, and we’re finally ready to shoot. Everybody’s ready. And all of a sudden, the first white sail appears on the horizon, followed by another one, followed by 25 white sails, little regattas going through the frame,” Spielberg said.Because it was 1974, there were no simple tools to erase the sails from the film post-production. “So, most of the time, we just waited,” Spielberg said. “People played cards. A lot of people vomited.”Then there were all the technical problems with the three animatronic sharks, which Spielberg nicknamed Bruce, afterhis lawyer, Bruce Ramer.View image in fullscreenA replica of the Orca fishing boat at a press preview at the Academy Museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APView image in fullscreenA woman seen through a set of great white shark jaws used for research and set decoration.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe sharks, which were powered by pneumatic and hydraulic systems, had to be assembled on a very rapid timeline after the film studio moved up Jaws’s production schedule to better capitalize on the bestselling success of the novel on which it was based, exhibit curator Jenny He told the Guardian. Many special effects experts refused the assignment, saying the sharks would take years to create.“The special effects team who designed and constructed the shark never had a chance to test it in salt water,” He said. “The first time they put it in the ocean was in Martha’s Vineyard.”As she noted, wryly, “mechanics and salt water really didn’t mix”. The pressurized air systems designed to manipulate the sharks used long underwater tubes, which sometimes got unplugged, or filled with oil, or simply malfunctioned because of the distances they had to snake through the sea.As the filming dragged on, “I was offered, actually, several times, a chance to gracefully bow out of the film, not to be replaced by another director, but for the film to be shut down,” Spielberg said. He refused.The rest of his production team, crucially, stood by him, even as the long delay put a strain on the whole crew: “Every week, I’d have five or six people come over to me to say: ‘I haven’t seen my family. I’ve been here for five months. Just give me an incentive to keep working on your movie. Give me a date, a guarantee of when you’re going to wrap.’ And I didn’t know when we were going to wrap.”What got the cast and crew through it all, Spielberg said, “was being in the company of each other … the camaraderie that happens when you’re just trying to survive something.”View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at a wall of photographs at the museum.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APWhile it would probably have been easier to film the prop sharks in a controlled tank environment, the curator said, Spielberg’s choice to shoot on location in Martha’s Vineyard was crucial to the film’s artistic power: “He made you feel that you could encounter Bruce in the ocean,” she said. “Even though there were challenges, without those challenges, I don’t think Jaws would have been as successful.”Spielberg, who has since been nominated for nearly two dozen Academy Awards, praised the new exhibit and said he was amazed to see the more than 200 objects the museum curators “have so ingeniously assembled” from a film that finished production more than a half century ago.“Why would anybody, when we shot the opening scene of Chrissie Watkins being taken by the shark, and we had a buoy floating in the water – how did anybody know to take the buoy and take it home and sit on it for 50 years and then loan it to the Academy?”“How did they know? I didn’t know!” Spielberg said.Jaws: The Exhibitionruns at the Academy Museum through 26 July 2026Explore more on these topicsSteven SpielbergJawsLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Back in Hollywood, publicists are recalibrating campaigns and pundits are placing their bets on the big films and performances of the upcoming awards season.A few key contenders are still yet to be seen, but at this stage of the race, one thing seems clear: come next March, records will be broken. A victory for any of the three current frontrunners would mean unprecedented scenes on the podium.Venice’s big hit was ticking clock nuclear thrillerA House of Dynamite, whose director, Kathryn Bigelow, became the first woman to win the Oscar for best director back in 2009 with The Hurt Locker. Should she triumph for a second time, Bigelow would become the first woman to win the director Oscar twice in the awards’ 96-year history.A House of Dynamite review – Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear endgame thriller is a terrifying, white-knuckle comebackRead moreThe same would also be true of Chloé Zhao, whose drama Nomadland was nominated for six Oscars, in most of the key categories, and won three including best director and picture, in 2021. Zhao’s latest,Hamnet- the toast of both Telluride and Toronto - was adapted by Maggie O’Farrell from her own novel and stars Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal as Agnes and William Shakespeare, torn apart by the death of their son. The film mixes awards-friendly literary fittings with a keenly feminist narrative and passionate turns from hot young stars who also seem shoo-ins for nominations.View image in fullscreenPaul Mescal in a scene from Hamnet.Photograph: Agata Grzybowska/APZhao didn’t just become the second woman to win the best directing Oscar, but also the first woman of colour to do so. To date, no Black people, men included, have ever won that Oscar, with only six ever nominated (although Steve McQueen and Barry Jenkins have directed best picture winners).That would change should Ryan Coogler’sSinnerssustain the momentum of its cinema launch in April. A steamy horror starring Coogler’s frequent collaborator Michael B Jordan, Sinners has taken $366m (£270m) worldwide – a remarkable result for a non-franchise, original concept movie. Coogler is perceived as a talent too often passed over for recognition, whether for his Sundance debut, Fruitvale Station, or his Marvel smash Black Panther,the most lucrative film ever made by a Black director, taking $1.3bn (£960,000). And few bodies are more eager to celebrate movies that strike a chord with young, diverse and mainstream audiences than the Academy.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreSinners skipped a festival launch, but as the example of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023, seven Oscars) shows, that may no longer be an issue, provided the film can stay in the conversation for almost a year. The recent precedent for the latter feat was madcap genre-hopper Everything Everywhere All at Once, which debuted in early 2022 at South by Southwest festival in Texas before sweeping the 2023 awards.From 2007 to 2024, 13 of 18 best picture winners (72%) premiered at a festival, with Cannes indexing especially well, giving us the likes of Parasite, The Zone of Interest, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall, The Substance, Emilia Pérez and last year’s big Oscar victor, Anora. But this year things were quieter on the Croisette and only the Palme d’Or winner, Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident, looks set to really trouble Oscar voters outside the best international film category.This void leaves potential for other films to come into play, including those which might have otherwise been notable mostly for their splashy star turns. Wrestling biopicThe Smashing Machinemeans Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson is a definite in the best actor category, but there may also be nods for director Benny Safdie and co-star Emily Blunt. Sydney Sweeney also fights her way into the best actress race with a punchy turn in boxing dramaChristy; that film may also pick up some supporting star silverware.Jay Kellyis a star vehicle for George Clooney, but Noah Baumbach’s film is unlikely to only be up for best actor.View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAYet the feeling from both Venice and Toronto was that festivals as a whole have been muted so far this year. This means spots are also being held for those films still to premiere. Next week will see first reviews of Paul Thomas Anderson’s US freedom fighter comedy-drama One Battle After Another starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn – all three men are staples of the Oscars, though the film itself is not thought to be the same awards slam dunk as some of Anderson’s previous titles. Buzz is also building for Marty Supreme, starring last year’s Oscars bridesmaid Timothée Chalamet as a table tennis prodigy who has an affair with a gangster’s wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow.In early October, the New York film festival offers early looks at Is This Thing On?, Bradley Cooper’s fourth film as director, starring Will Arnett as an aspiring standup, as well as Daniel Day-Lewis’s comeback as a former British soldier in hiding in the woods, in Anemone, directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. And Emmy favourite Jeremy Allen White will be giving us his best Bruce Springsteen impression in a biopic co-starring Jeremy Strong and Stephen Graham.Meanwhile, only the foolish would write off James Cameron, king of the Oscars, the man responsible for three of the four highest-grossing films of all time, whose latest Avatar spectacular is being positioned as a Christmas treat. The first of those CGI eco-fables lost out in 2009 on all the big Oscars to The Hurt Locker – a film directed by his ex-wife.At the time, this unusual public face-off was the subject of extensive column inches – and was still being referenced in 2013, when Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty was nominated for four Golden Globe awards and host Amy Poehler memorably noted that, “when it comes to torture, I trust the lady who was married to James Cameron for three years.”Will Cameron have the last laugh, or will Bigelow once again triumph? Either way, a rematch between these big beasts of cinema should raise the stakes yet further on this already charged Oscar season.Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsAwards and prizesVenice film festivalToronto film festivalTelluride film festivalKathryn BigelowanalysisShareReuse this content"

In Hare’s 1975 play she takes the lead role of a singer, Maggie, in an imploding band who put on a concert for a Cambridge University May ball at the end of the 1960s.

Taylor will contribute additional music and lyrics to original song by the brothers Nick and Tony Bicât respectively.View image in fullscreenTaylor in Teeth ’n’ Smiles.Photograph: Jono WhiteDaniel Raggett will direct the production, which opens in March and runs for 12 weeks.Tickets will go on sale in October. “I’m deeply honoured to be bringing Teeth ’n’ Smiles back for its 50th anniversary,” said Taylor. “I love to challenge myself in new forms and I can’t wait to slap you round the face with Maggie. I am a huge fan of Daniel and David’s work, and the chance to collaborate with them on such a landmark production is something I am insanely excited about.”Taylor spent a decade in the indie duo Slow Club and released her solo debut album as Self Esteem,Compliments Please, in 2019. It was followed by Prioritise Pleasure, named thebest album of 2021by Guardian music critics. Taylor made her theatrical debut as Sally Bowles inCabaretat the Playhouse in London in 2023. Next month marks the publication of her first book,A Complicated Woman, billed as “a cathartic scream … that gets to the heart of being a woman in the world today”.“I can’t think of anything more exciting than watching Rebecca Lucy Taylor and Daniel Raggett strip the varnish off my old play,” Hare said. “It’s a perfect moment to see if a new generation responds to that 70s mix of hope, drugs, music, sex and despair.”Teeth ’n’ Smiles was first staged at the Royal Court in 1975, with a cast includingAntony Sher, and transferred to the West End the following year. The role of Maggie was compared to Janis Joplin, and the Guardian’s Michael Billington wrote that Hare “captures precisely that moment in a culture when a dream explodes. Like John Osborne in The Entertainer, he realises there is poetry and pathos in the spectacle of decline.”View image in fullscreenHelen Mirren in Teeth ’n’ Smiles in 1975.Photograph: Dennis Hart/Daily Mail/Rex/ShutterstockIn 2002, Hare’s play was revived at the Crucible in Sheffield by director Anna Mackmin, with Amanda Donohoe as Maggie.“I first read David’s play over a decade ago and it seared itself into my brain,” Raggett said. “It’s an extraordinary picture of a world, and a band, tearing itself apart at the seams, shot through with some really great songs. Its spirit of rock’n’roll revolution and desperate howl of defiance feels just as pertinent now as it did in 1975.”Raggett’s production at the Duke of York’s comes hot on the heels of another drama about a combustible rock band,Stereophonic, a five-star hit that is currentlybooking at the same theatre until late November.Explore more on these topicsTheatreDavid HareSelf EsteemWest EndPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Sellers on Ticombo, the only one of the sites to have listed tickets for sale already, may have broken consumer law, according to one expert.The development will add to pressure on the UK government to make good on itspledge to crack down on touting.“Radiohead have always strived to protect their audience from exploitative ticket touts which, in the absence of robust government legislation, becomes increasingly challenging,” said the band’s manager, Julie Calland.“Fans will be encouraged to stay away from secondary sites and we will work alongside venues, promoters and organisations like FanFair Alliance and FEAT [Face-value European Alliance for Ticketing], to shut down unauthorised sales at inflated prices – tickets that for the most part, don’t actually exist.”Hurdles put in place by Radiohead’s management to stop touting meant that fans were invited to apply for an unlock code earlier this week.Amid widespread disappointment from the many applicants who failed to get one, those armed with a code can apply for tickets from Friday but are still not guaranteed to get them.“The registration process, while not a perfect science, is an attempt to deliver tickets as fairly as possible directly to fans at the prices the band intended,” said Calland.Analysis of listings on Ticombo, a German-owned ticketing platform with a London office, found more than 1,200 tickets advertised for the shows, for prices up to £788.Of those, 30 were for just one night of four at the O2 in London, listed for a combined value of more than £22,000 by a single trader, a Swiss company called Worldtix AG.Both Calland and industry experts said that they did not believe it was possible for anyone to have the tickets before they go on general sale.This raises questions over the potential use of “speculative listings”, which is when touts advertise seats they do not have, hoping to bank a sale and then source the tickets later.This practice has been deemed fraudulent in a criminal court.Ticombo said there was “no evidence that the listings in question are speculative or fraudulent” and that tickets could have been obtained some other way, such as through hospitality releases.But Reg Walker, a ticket security expert who works with large venues and artists, said: “The tickets do not exist. It’s a clear breach of the Consumer Rights Act, which is designed to protect consumers from fraud.”Ticombo said it “takes these matters very seriously”. It removed the listings after it was contacted by the Guardian and said it “merely provides a technology platform” and did not buy or sell tickets itself. The company takes a commission on every ticket sold.Worldtix AG said it was an intermediary, distributing tickets on behalf of a “network of sellers, ticket brokers and authorised agents”.“We are currently reviewing the listings in question to double-check the validity of the tickets and ensure full compliance with our policies,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers, who have outlined proposals for a cap of up to 30%, are expected to outline their final plans within weeks.Amid the threat of tighter regulation, Viagogo’s US parent company, StubHub, recently scaled back its stock market float ambitions, aiming for a $9bn (£6.6bn) valuation having previously set a target of $16.5bn (£12.1bn).Adam Webb, a spokesperson for FanFair Alliance, said: “This exploitative model can be devastating for artists and audiences, and it won’t stop until the government introduces and enforces a long-promised cap on ticket resale prices.”Viagogo, by far the largest player in the UK secondary ticketing market, also appears to be planning to defy Radiohead’s anti-tout measures, stating on its website that tickets will be on sale from Friday.The company even included a message to potential buyers, claiming that less than 1% of customers who had previously bought Radiohead tickets through the site had ever complained about being refused entry.Viagogo criticised Radiohead’s ticket policy, saying: “We are fully compliant in the UK, where resale is highly regulated and permitted under the law.“Some organisers take anti-competitive actions and try to limit where tickets can be bought or sold. We exist to serve fans on their terms – whether they missed the onsale, are buying tickets just days before the event, or need to sell at the last minute.”A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “The Radiohead tour is a great opportunity for fans to enjoy live music – but too often rip-off touts are ruining the gig-going experience.“We are considering the evidence provided in response to our consultation earlier this year and are committed to clamping down on this activity as part of the Plan for Change.”Explore more on these topicsRadioheadViagogoTicket pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

But the risk paid off. Eggers has captured both the pervading sense of dread and stylish production design of the original, while deepening the mythology to make it more palatable for modern viewers. It’s a true horror, with every frame filled with foreboding. And now, after playing both Pennywise in It and Count Orlock, surely Bill Skarsgård qualifies as the world’s scariest actor.

As extreme weather events become the new normal, we still hear from “sceptics” who think the energy transition is unnecessary, a massive leftwing plot. Hannah Ritchie, a global development data scientist and the author ofNot the End of the World, has followed that work up with a book that addresses 50 objections to the adoption of greener technology.To start with, we need some tough love. It’s time, Ritchie insists, to abandon the slogan “Keep 1.5 alive”, referring to an aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. “The 1.5C target is dead,” she announces flatly. “The public – who are repeatedly told that 1.5C is still within reach – will start to lose trust when we pass that target.”And then there is the good news. “Since peaking in 2008,” Ritchie reports, “the amount of fossil fuels being burned for electricity in the UK has fallen by almost half.” Battery technology has vastly improved and continues to do so. The solar panels China installed just in May of this year would meet the electricity needs of the whole of Poland.There is similar hope, Ritchie explains, for the prospects of mineral recycling, low-carbon cement, electrified ferries and hydrogen as a fuel for airliners. Meanwhile, most of the objections to increasing our use of solar, wind and nuclear energy are bogus.One route to bogosity is to dazzle the reader with large dollar costs for the rollout of greener technology, but Ritchie recommends always asking: “Is that a big number?” Compared with decades of fossil fuel subsidies and the health costs of pollution from coal plants, probably not. Always ask, too, “How old is the data?”: as Ritchie points out, the cost of solar power has fallen by more than 90% in the last decade. Beware undated graphs on X.This is a refreshingly pragmatic and undoomy book, which dismantles a lot of dubious arguments, including those made by deep-green degrowthers. Yes, electric cars take a little more carbon to build than petrol cars, but they pay off that debt quickly. No, nuclear power is not dangerous. No, carbon capture is not going to work on a planetary scale. Don’t wind turbines “kill all the birds”, as Donald Trump has said? Yes, they do kill some, but buildings kill 500 times as many just by standing there, and no one is proposing we demolish Trump Tower to save the birds.Ritchie is particularly good on air conditioning, which some activists deplore. “If someone living in heat can’t afford air conditioning, they’re living in fuel poverty,” she argues. Plus, if your air conditioning is solar powered, you are using the sun to counteract the sun, which has a pleasing symmetry. Instead of shaming coolness, we could rethink our other priorities. According to a graph Ritchie reproduces, datacentres are forecast to require more global electricity in 2030 than desalination plants – you know, the things that make clean drinking water.

You can go vegan, stop taking aeroplanes and wear a hair shirt for the rest of your life in an ecstasy of virtuous self-denial, but that won’t make the slightest bit of difference to the planet’s climate. What we need is collective action.Collective action is often anathema to conservatives, of course, and near the end the author does leave an opening for those who believe talk of climate action is just a subterfuge for enforcing leftist policies. “This transition is not a sacrifice,” Ritchie writes, “it’s an opportunity to build a better, fairer and more sustainable world.” Wait, I thought we were talking about mitigating risks from global warming, not building a fairer world. Many people might agree that we should smuggle in a more egalitarian politics under cover of environmental concern, but opponents will just point to such talk as evidence of a  greenwashed conspiracy.Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change – in 50 Questions and Answers by Hannah Ritchie is published by Chatto & Windus (£20).

Their village is on the Sussex Downs, overlooked by an ancient face carved into the chalk, reputed to protect inhabitants from a hungry spirit. But since the death of the last member of the family traditionally bound to look after it, the face is fast disappearing beneath the grass, and something frightening is stirring in the land. Atmospheric, psychologically astute and beautifully realised, this is a brilliantly original literary take on folk horror.View image in fullscreenExilesby Mason Coile (Baskerville, £16.99)In 2030, three astronauts arrive on Mars, on a one-way mission to prepare for full-scale colonisation. They find their robot-built base, the Citadel, severely damaged, and one of the robots missing. The remaining two offer different explanations: the missing robot malfunctioned and caused the damage before fleeing, or the Citadel was attacked by an unseen, hostile alien force, and the third robot went in pursuit and has not returned. A taut, terrifying thriller, sadly the last work from Mason Coile, a pseudonym of award-winning author Andrew Pyper, who died in January.View image in fullscreenAlchemisedby SenLinYu (Michael Joseph, £25)This big fantasy debut had its first incarnation as Manacled, an online fan-fiction serial with shades of The Handmaid’s Tale and starring Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy as tormented lovers, a sub-genre of Harry Potter fanfic known as “Dramione”. Now the author has created their own fantastic world, driven by various occult sciences. The story is set around a long brutal war between religious believers who insist god-given gifts should be used for good, and necromancers obsessed with gaining power and immortality at any price. As the book begins, Undying necromancers are in control of the city. Helena, a healer who had helped her friends in the Resistance, wakes from a nightmarish stasis with no memory of the final years of the war. She’s shackled, so cannot use her powers, and is made a prisoner of the High Reeve, one of the most feared of the Undying, set on finding out what secrets are hidden beneath her amnesia. This is a violent tale and the author advises reader discretion. The Undying are fond of ripping out the organs of living victims and there are other horrors, including the love match between a caring healer and a violent mass-murderer. This very readable grim-dark fantasy left me feeling queasy.View image in fullscreenSaltcropby Yume Kitasei (HarperVoyager, £18.99)Set in a near-future world ravaged by climate change, pollution and the effects of mass starvation caused by a crop-destroying blight, the author’s third novel focuses on three sisters. Skipper and Carmen leave their small seaside village to search for their older sister, Nora. She had withdrawn from them after moving to the city to research ways of making crops more resilient, but they hear from her landlord that she hasn’t paid her rent, and learn she has also left her job, and they are concerned. When they get a coded message asking for help, they embark on a long and perilous ocean voyage in the small boat they had built together. An absorbing, compelling tale of love, loyalty and danger, and a frightening look at what we’re doing to our planet.View image in fullscreenBig Timeby Jordan Prosser (Dead Ink, £10.99)The Federal Republic of East Australia is a new authoritarian state determined to impose old-fashioned values by rejecting the rest of the world and keeping its citizens under tight control. It is also the only country where a new drug, F, exists. Dispensed as eye drops, it allows glimpses of the near future. Illegal, of course, but musician Julian and his bandmates can’t resist this new high. In the rest of the world, certain “extreme coincidences” and near-death experiences revealing the afterlife as a giant shopping mall may be connected to the temporal meddling down under. This debut is a wonderfully wild, funny, fast and furious trip.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The connections can be genuine, and the feelings often real, but the situations are contrived and manipulated, a pioneering brand of deliberately saccharine, hokey and ridiculous in the name of love and for the sake of entertainment. Watching The Bachelor and its spinoffs, as I occasionally have over its two-plus-decade run, is to be baffled, frustrated, annoyed and ultimately hooked. The show, with its in-group rituals and shocking sincerity, casts a strange spell over its contestants and its viewers; if you stick through one episode, you’re liable to start caring about what happens.The Man in My Basement review – Willem Dafoe is an unsettling guest in eerie psychodramaRead moreNo such spell exists for The Wrong Paris, Netflix’s latest attempt to build an in-house Hallmark Channel, in which Miranda Cosgrove plays a single woman who goes on a reality dating show for what Bachelor Nation would call “the wrong reasons”. No offense to the Hallmark Channel, which at its best can be laughably unserious fun. But The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor, nor the drop of derangement – like, say, ahot snowman brought to life– required to beat the Netflix allegations of low-quality, lowest-common-denominator stuff.The setup, at least, is promising, like a fluffier and sillier UnReal. In an almost daringly utilitarian first scene, the stakes are set: Cosgrove’s Dawn, a Girl With Tools in a Small Town With Dead Parents, achieves her dream of getting into art school in Paris. But her “Paris fund” cash jar cannot cover the $30,000 tuition, especially after she personally paid the healthcare costs for her grandmother/guardian (Frances Fisher). Her sister Emily (Emilija Baranac), an avid fan of a show called the Honeypot – The Bachelor, if at the very end the lucky lady has the option to choose money instead of engagement – has an alternative plan: go on the show, conveniently set in Paris, for the $20,000 appearance fee and plane ticket, then get herself eliminated ASAP.A ludicrous invisible hand of plot should be part of the enjoyment, so I’ll keep it brief: Dawn, a master of all non-city skills – welding, farming, kicking the ass of creepy, sniveling out-of-towners – gets on the show. But thanks to a plucky producer (Insecure’s Yvonne Orji, too good for this), the competition is set in Paris, Texas. Specifically, at the Yellowstone-aspiring ranch of one Trey McAllen III (Pierson Fodé, doing a budget impression of Matthew McConaughey), with whom Dawn had a brief meet-cute at a local bar before filming. (True to the spirit of the movie, British Columbia stands in for Texas ranch country.) The fact that the preposterously ripped Trey is frequently shirtless and good with horses, and that Dawn also low-key really loves horses, complicates her secret plan to take the money and run. Not even the drives-a-truck and makes-her-own-spurs Dawn is immune to the power of a six-pack, especially if it’s wearing tight jeans.Which is all well and smooth-brained good, with a couple of satirical shots at The Bachelor via archetypes of its contestants: the princess (Madeleine Arthur), the muscly badass (Veronica Long), the awkward nerd (Christin Park), the baby-fevered Christian girl (Hannah Stocking), the influencer (Madison Pettis, rounding out a cast that is almost entirely alums of Disney or theNetflixromcom To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before). Unfortunately, the film’s basic construction fails to clear the requisite low bar – shoddy editing that nearly cuts off lines, camera work so front-focused that it looks filmed in iPhone Portrait Mode, framing that warps inexplicably into near-fisheye.Hot Frosty review – Netflix’s sexy snowman romance is as silly as expectedRead moreEven worse, there is barely a spark between the two fated lovers. Despite some limp sparring, the only friction between Dawn and Trey is the quality of their hair – she has the perfect curl waves natural only to television, and he has the crispiest ends I’ve ever seen on a man. Cosgrove, a former child actor and veteran of Nickelodeon’s millennial YA staple iCarly (and its far less successful adult reboot), is much better suited to handle the overdrawn slapstick comedy of this genre – pigging out on wings, tripping and falling into a pool – than the attempts at genuine romantic beats.Neither Cosgrove nor the mechanical script sells Dawn’s pivot from betting it all on art school to love, which is irksome, if expected. Maybe I’m being overly sensitive – this is, after all, not meant to be taken too seriously. But it’s hard not to detect a whiff of regression in, to borrow a term beloved by reality television, Dawn’s journey from fiercely independent student to willing to sacrifice her big dream for a guy (who has money and will pay for things). That that’s the fantasy – in a movie aiming broadly for middle America, amid a great rightward lurch in culture – feels less like a happy ending than a bummer sign of the times. Those seeking a feelgood romcom should keep looking.The Wrong Paris is now out on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Much as Tom Stoppard’s Travesties, spotting that James Joyce, Lenin and the artist Tristan Tzara coincided in Zurich in 1917, audaciously fantasised their interactions, Marks and Gran even more boldly posit that, if Adolf Hitler had seen a shrink in Vienna in the early 20th century, it might plausibly have beenSigmund Freud.Beginning with a title-explaining scene in which an Austrian mother seeks advice on her young son’s nocturnal bedwetting and nightmares, Dr Freud Will See You Now, Mrs Hitler contrives encounters across three decades: with Hitler as a patient; house-painter; hiker near the Freuds’ summer house in Berchtesgaden (giving, it is implied, ideas to Hitler); war-wounded corporal; and, ultimately, Führer.This is, especially latterly, very dark material and those who know Marks and Gran only for the sitcom Birds of a Feather might be surprised to find them going here. In fact, their time-slip sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart (BBC, 1993-99) – in which a man was in effect committing adultery with a dead woman – might have interested Freud, and The New Statesman (ITV, 1987-94), with the character of Alan B’Stard MP, presciently lampooned the possibilities of rightwing populism.Though always making clear its “what if?” nature, the play (a much-truncated chunk was broadcast on Radio 4 in 2007) feels historically and psychologically plausible in dialogue between Hitler and Freud that fizzes with intelligence and dangerous jokes. The psychoanalyst is fascinated by Patient A’s relationship with his cruel, dead father and his tendency, as an artist, to erase people from scenes. Patient A is engaged by the ideas Freud is developing about the “group mind” and the exercise of power. Chillingly, the patient is openly antisemitic to the doctor and his family but they tolerate it because words can’t hurt and these Viennese politics are a blip.View image in fullscreenTension … Sam Mac as Hitler and Ruby Ablett as Anna Freud.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianSam Mac as Hitler convincingly charts Adolf’s growth from pathetic to psychopathic and suggests the Freudian connection between the two states. Ruby Ablett, portraying Anna Freud from 13 to her 30s, is given the most daring hypothesis – that sexual tension between Freud’s daughter and Patient A exacerbates his pathology and even antisemitism – but plays it strikingly and touchingly.Jonathan Tafler gives a vivid sense of Freud’s questing intelligence but radiates such charm that it risks weakening the balance between protagonist and antagonist. There is a severe attack on the psychoanalyst’s sometimes contentious methods and assumptions but it comes from Hitler, in brown shirt and swastika, who by this point is clearly not to be trusted in the play or history. It can be argued, though, that the whole conceit is a critique of Freud, who catastrophically misunderstands Patient A.A structure of short scenes in multiple locations is fine for radio or screen but Isaac Bernier-Doyle’s production too often needs the cast as furniture removers. But the props department should get an award for Freud’s ever-held cigar, which is very clearly not just a cigar.AtUpstairs at the Gatehouse, London,until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSigmund FreudAdolf HitlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

The latter is Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, and a fictional director, based on a real-life director, is producing it when Russia declares war on Ukraine. If that sounds like meta leaps within somersaults, Russian director Alexander Molochnikov does a heroic job of making it enjoyable, if antic.It begins with rehearsals at the Moscow Art theatre and travels to New York where fictional director Kon (Daniel Boyd), loosely based on Molochnikov, lives in exile after his public criticism of Putin’s war.The stronger first act powerfully reflects on the role and responsibility of theatre to voice protest, albeit too briefly. There is initial disbelief among the company of actors, then trauma, guilt and anger. Chekhov’s play itself transposes well in its preoccupations around artists and artistic creation.Kon carries shades of Chekhov’s Konstantin, not least because of his relationship with his mother (Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė), who also plays Arkadina, the actor-mother in Chekhov’s play. She initially tries to persuade him to apologise to the government and resume his life as a director inRussia. He refuses, meeting bohemian actor Nico (Stella Baker) in New York and experiencing his own Seagull-style tortured love story. These meta convolutions are made easy to follow with the help of MC cum narrator (Andrey Burkovskiy, very charismatic).View image in fullscreenShades of the original … Daniel Boyd and Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė in Seagull: True Story.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThere are dressing room lightbulbs around the proscenium arch and Alexander Shishkin’s set is surrealist, playful and innovative. The production as a whole, arriving from a season Off-Broadway, fizzes with imagination and high-octane energy – pumping beats, rap and arresting visuals. There is a fabulous dream sequence with Putin arriving shirtless on a horse, one actor swishing its tail.But it is exactly this playful whimsy that dilutes the focus and comes to feel self-indulgent. The switches from drama to satire do not quite work either, especially when Kon arrives in the US and finds his creative vision straitjacketed again, this time by commercialism. Again this reflects Konstantin’s original war against his mother’s commercial sensibilities, but it also sets up a kind of false equivalence between creative freedoms in the US and Russia. It also takes us further away from questions around dangerous dissidence and how artists live – and work – through a war.The play is, in a sense, undone by its own cleverness and determination to speak about everything at once – Chekhov, autobiography, Russia and the US’s confines around creativity. But Molochnikov raises important questions around the cost of conscientious objection that go beyond Putin’s war, and apply, ever disturbingly, closer to home. What action do you take when a war is fought in your name and when various kinds of protest around it become outlawed? What action can a theatre take? These questions linger.AtMarylebone theatre, London, until 12 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAnton ChekhovRussiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Opening track Helynt Ryfeddol (An Incredible Ordeal) introduces a folk story about an old man drawn towards the purest music he has ever heard, sung by a bird, to which he listens until it stops. He returns home to find his house entirely changed and lived in by different people. Seven tracks later, the title track tells us that the bird was an angel, and that the man went away for 350 years, never to be seen again.View image in fullscreenCerys Hafana: AngelAngel is the third release by this piercingly beautiful singer and exceptional, adventurous musician in 18 months. (Their collection of precise piano instrumentals, Difrisg (Differing) was released by Instant Karma back in June, while 2024’s guitar-led EP The Bitter combined the eerie melancholia of Broadcast with a Welsh twist on sultry Americana.) The piano returns for Angel, but Hafana also builds striking patterns on their best-known instrument, the Welsh triple harp, and draws from Breton influences, including folk dance rhythms and a call-and-response technique, kan ha diskan.Hafana’s approach is endlessly inventive. On Drexelius and the minimalist An Dro (A Turn), they dampen the triple harp’s resonant strings with the addition of Blu-Tack; their piano and Amie Huckstep’s saxophone dart around each other like hares on O’r Coed (Of the Woods), and Ursula Harrison’s incoming, icy double bass counters Hafana begging for the return of spring on Carol Mynyddog (Mountain Carol). Angel also nails delicacy in the iridescent Ffarwel i f’Ieuenctid (Farewell to My Youth) and Atsain (Echo), yet the album overall has a profound impact, hymning the life cycle, and the fantastical properties of music and time, to stunning effect.Also out this monthJunior Brother’s The End (Strap Originals) is a rich, gnarly feast of a record, using the eerie folklore of Irish fairy forts, into which people can disappear, to mirror the disorientating realities of the modern world. Clashing flutes, growling drones, punk and polka squish around material inspired by Ireland’s National Folklore Collection. Junior Brother’s voice is also a mercurial cousin of Richard Dawson’s.Jon Wilks’ Needless Alley (Grizzly Folk)comprises 10 folk-rock-brightened, ambitious originals with moments that recall Pentangle (Montagu Whaler), the Mamas & the Papas (Could You Be the One?), and psych-pop (Mine Is the Sun).Ian Nyquist’s Gilded (Flood) is this month’s most intriguingly odd confection, mirroring the sound of the Irish bodhran through modelling software to soundscapes both primeval and sci-fi.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk album of the monthFolk musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Though the Amsterdam-based group have only released two EPs and maintain an elusive online presence, they have developed a steady cult following in guitar and dance music circles alike.Formed around 2022 by Nushin Naini and Nic Mauskovic (who also releases music under the alias Nicolini), the mutating band draw on a range of influences dating from the 70s: the percussion, sax and funky bass recall New York no wave and post-punk, and the skulking tempo and echo have their roots in dub. These elements combine with punk’s DIY approach. Much of the instrumentation on their debut EP Tambal comes from undisclosed “miscellaneous objects” and their short, scrappy tracks have the production quality of some hazy late-night jam between friends: vocalist and bassist Naini likens their bedroom recording set-up to a “fun playground to experiment with sounds”.They add exciting surprise elements into the mix: the spliced samples and turntablism add a chaotic edge to the otherwise groove-heavy tracks, and Naini’s self-described “fried Farsi” – a semi-improvised version of the language – is delivered through pitch-shifted yips and nursery-rhyme chants. It suits the wackiness of the Devon Rexi lore: these self-appointed “diasporic human snacks are vibrating their sonic manipulations in tribute to the lonely and oblivious Mr Naster” – which might give an insight to their headspace, if not their approach.Safi BugelThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenDebit.Photograph: Monse GuajardoDebit – La Ronda y el SonideroMexican producer Delia Beatriz stretches and smears 90s selector Gabriel Dueñez’s slackenedcumbia rebajada(slowed cumbia) sound so the beat becomes a twitch, the horns and yells lurching like TV static in search of a signal.Jessy Lanza – Slapped by My LifeWritten to make her husband smile when he was undergoing chemotherapy, this Lanza loosie is characteristically bright, bubbling club pointillism that flickers like a hummingbird wing – then shifts surprisingly bassy.Kali Malone and Drew McDowall – The Sound in My MindIntricate yet fathoms deep, the drone doyen and former Coil member McDowall’s monophonic modular synth experiment evokes observing the intricate grain and monumental scale of a Richard Serra sculpture at the same time.George Riley – RainFrom a new mixtape, Riley mixes chattering UK garage with the sweetness of Janet Jackson’s All for You and a real earworm chorus about being deluged by romance.Stella Donnelly – Feel It ChangeWishing on a satellite “that you still love me”, the Australian songwriter reckons with a relationship’s looming demise, her hymnal composure faltering over an appropriately rainy trudge of drums and guitar.Casey Dienel – SeventeenJettisoning the shivery synths of their old moniker White Hinterland after eight years away, Dienel’s comeback bridges the lush 70s studio upholstery and jittery rhythms of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours and Tusk.Tortoise – Layered PresenceTense bass, intricate pulse, a little proggy dissonance: who else could it be?

Judging by their in-house record label’s first signing, this isn’t a model they’re bringing to their music ventures: it’s very hard to imagine the gritty, lugubrious, bathos-steeped tunes of south-east Londoner Mark William Lewis lassoing the zeitgeist, let alone lending themselves to a quirky product tie-in. (A vial of filthy Thames water, perhaps?)View image in fullscreenMark William Lewis: Mark William LewisYet one spin of Tomorrow Is Perfect, the lead single from Lewis’s second album, and it’s instantly obvious why any corporate arbiter of cool would trip over themselves to sign him. An exquisitely beautiful dirge that unites the Durutti Column’s bright, sad slashes of guitar with the plodding, cleanly produced indie of Parachutes-era Coldplay under Lewis’s almost spookily sonorous baritone, it is narcotically familiar and ineffably fresh, a combination of post-ironic simplicity and hyper-sophisticated taste.There is something fashion-adjacent about his ability to make unexpected nostalgic references (see also: Still Above’s muted dinner party funk) feel avant garde. That said, he does sound like a Blur tribute act on Seventeen, a tale of teenage addiction delivered via an uncanny impression of Damon Albarn’s estuary croon and falsetto backing vocals. One thing Lewis doesn’t pilfer is Blur’s sense of humour: occasionally the vibe is a little po-faced. Yet from his guttural sprechgesang to his haunting harmonica and poetic evocations of bleak banality (“another deathly shiver from your restless phone”), this is reliably spine-tingling stuff.Explore more on these topicsIndiePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Chausson’s Poème de l’Amour et de la Mer has more often been recorded with orchestra; with piano it unavoidably loses some of its oceanic glitter and heft, but Middleton plays this sweeping, Wagner-inspired music in full colour, and Connolly is a powerful narrator, her rich tone subtly hollowed out for the fleeting moments of bleakness. In Debussy’s Chansons de Bilitis she’s not the usual ingenue, but she and Middleton make a worldlier-sounding interpretation work, paying attention to every word and every sensual harmonic shift.View image in fullscreenSarah Connolly and Joseph Middleton: The World Feels DustyThe recording’s title comes from one of Copland’s Emily Dickinson settings, put across here with appealing immediacy. Barber’s Op 10 Three Songs bring longer, more expansive lines from Connolly, and a slight American accent – which broadens for the second song of Night Thoughts, a song cycle byErrollyn Walleninspired by the artistHoward Hodgkinand written for Connolly and Middleton in 2023. It’s admittedly hard to imagine this particular song done in cathedral English given that its narrator, singing Wallen’s own words, is Ella Fitzgerald. Connolly, who sang jazz early in her career, is surely one of few singers who could be convincing in both this and the angular settings of Dickinson and Shakespeare with which Wallen frames it.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

With most day-trippers gone, even the island’s lone lighthouse at La Mola feels yours alone, and off-season ferry deals from Ibiza make this pocket-sized paradise surprisingly gentle on the wallet.AzeemA French B&B that has the LotView image in fullscreenThe medieval fortress town of Capdenac le Haut.Photograph: Herve Lenain/AlamyFor a gentle late-summer escape, head toLe Relais du Chien Bleu(doubles from €80 a night), a hidden B&B on the Lot-Aveyron border. Set in a 19th-century townhouse, it serves superb vegan dishes (yes, in France!) made from local market produce. Stroll down to the Lot River, nibble figs straight from the trees, and wander the medieval streets of Capdenac-Le-Haut, while the nearby railway town of Capdenac adds historic charm. With fewer crowds and warm, attentive hosts, this is the perfect spot to savour the relaxed rhythms of rural southern France as summer eases into autumn.LiamAncient island trails scented with thyme, GreeceView image in fullscreenChurch of the Seven Martyrs on the island of Sifnos.Photograph: Photo Stella/AlamyFor a blissful late-season escape, head to the Cyclades island ofSifnosa few hours on a ferry from Piraeus, Athens’ main port. The summer crowds have faded, but the sun still warms the quiet beaches and whitewashed villages. Enjoy fresh seafood at harbour tavernas, hike ancient trails scented with wild thyme, and join locals at gentle evening festivals. With lower prices and a slower pace, Sifnos reveals its authentic charm – perfect for unwinding before autumn truly arrives.Sandraskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The region stretches from cork oak forests to wild Atlantic beaches, with daytime temperatures still hovering above 20C. In the whitewashed town of Évora, Roman ruins and quiet plazas invite slow wandering. Farther west, the coastline near Vila Nova de Milfontes offers warm surf and near-empty sands. Alentejo is languid and sun-drenched, a secret escape where summer lingers and time seems to pause.Matthew HealyTake the Tarragona train in SpainView image in fullscreenThe amphitheatre in Tarragona.Photograph: Damkier Media Group/AlamyTarragona is really easy to reach by Eurostar, TGV, then local train from Barcelona. Self-catering accommodation in the old city centre is within apartment buildings that may well incorporate the ancient city walls or the foundations of theRoman circusand mean you can experience living like a local with narrow communal staircases and markets on your doorstep. Outdoor tables at restaurants are delightful well into autumn and the waves at the beach are still warm. Entrance to theamphitheatreis only €5 (beat that Rome!) where you can see surviving painted wall plaster.AmyAgritourism amid Ottoman splendour in AlbaniaView image in fullscreenTraditional Ottoman houses in Berat, Albania.Photograph: MehmetO/AlamyTheUnesco-listedtown of Berat, nicknamed the “town of a thousand windows”, not only offers amazing places to see such as castles, Ottoman-era houses, museums and so on, but also it’s a perfect place for agritourism. If you want to experience harvesting fruits such as grapes and figs (Alpetais one of the many vineyards and farms offering agritourism), then September is an ideal time to visit.Gentian AgalliuStay on a rewilded nature reserve, south-west FranceThe sleepy woods of south-west France are wonderful for a late summer break. Stay near Limoges atLe Moulin de Pensol(gîtes from €60 a night), run as a nature reserve with plenty of rewilded land. Mushrooms take over from butterflies as the main September attraction, with the advantage that they stay still for photos. I walked miles along golden, leaf-lined trails in the Périgord-Limousin natural regional park. The annual chestnut festival at Dournazac completed the autumn package.RachelView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsBeach holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But sales have plummeted amid a surging pro-meat trend embraced by theTrump administration, raising a key question – willvegetarianismever take hold in the US?This year has been a punishing one for the plant-based meat sector, led by companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, with sales of refrigerated productsslumping17%. This follows a difficult 2024, during which salesfell7%, furthering a multi-year spiral – last year Americanspurchased75m fewer units of plant-based meat than they did in 2022.Despite hopes that burgers, sausages and chicken made from soy, peas and beans would curb Americans’ love of eating butchered animals – thereby reducing the rampant deforestation, water pollution and planet-heating emissions involved in raising livestock – these alternatives languish at just 1% of the total meat market in the US.Instead, a resurgent focus on meat has swept the US, pushed by industry lobbyists and online wellness influencers who advocate greater protein consumption via the carnivore diet and deride plant alternatives as overly processed.Accordingto the meat industry, since 2020 there has been a 20% drop in the number of Americans seeking to cut their meat consumption.The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again credo has embraced this push. Paul Saladino, a leading online meat proponent who hascalledplant burgers “garbage”, took a meat-based smoothie to a White House event in May and slammed a shot of raw milk withRobert F Kennedy Jr, the contrarian US health secretary. “I eat protein, a lot of protein,” KennedytoldSaladino of his own meat eating.“It’s not our moment, we recognize that, you’d be crazy to think it is,” Ethan Brown, chief executive of Beyond Meat, the plant-based business that was valued at $10bn a few years ago but has suffered a 97% drop in its share price since, said.“Meat consumption is on the rise, the political culture is different. We just need to get through this period.”The meat industry “did a masterful job, convincing people that there was something wrong with the products, or that they were ultra-processed or things of that nature”, Brown added.To try to keep pace with the culture shift, Beyond recentlydropped“Meat” from its name andunveileda new product that is primarily a protein-based food (made of fava beans) rather than mimicked beef or chicken. It has laid off workers,missedrevenue expectations and has had to deny it isstrugglingto pay its bills.Its big rival, Impossible, meanwhile has scrambled to align with meat rather than oppose it, even floating the idea of a hybrid plant-beef burger. “We’re not here to win over the salad eaters,” reads its website. “We’re here for the meat stans.”The meat industry’s attack upon veg competitors as unhealthy has been successful, if rather misleading – researchshowsthat a plant-based products generally have less saturated fat, more fibre and about the same protein as processed meat.Also, many of the increasingly popular high-proteinbars, milks and other products are very processed, without suffering any of the stigma that plant-based meat has. “If you walk into grocery store there is a protein enhanced version of almost every product, even though Americans are getting enough protein,” said Kate Stanley, a food researcher at Duke University.Crucially, studies havefoundthat while most Americans understand the benefits of eating more plants, only a quarter are willing to do so and the vast majority don’t view the environment as a priority when choosing meals.“There’s a disconnect between the mounting evidence on meat’s environmental footprint and what’s actually driving consumer behavior,” said Shauna Downs, who has studied Americans’ views at the Rutgers School of Public Health.Food remains a deeply personal and cultural part of our lives and for most people that involves meat – a fifth of all Americansstilleat red meat five times or more every week. Herbivore imitations may have improved from previous iterations of veggie burgers but remain more expensive than meat.“Sustainability is a consideration for only a very small portion of the population – taste and price are the biggest things and plant-based products need to deliver on those,” said Jody Kirchner, associate director of market insights at the Good Food Institute, which hasresearchedthe plant-based sector.“Inflation has had a big impact across the food sector and that’s a big challenge for plant products because they cost two to three times more than traditional meat. A lot of progress will need to be made on taste and cost to become feasible for customers – a lot of people just don’t see the need for these products.”Regardless of the ebb and flow ofvariousdietaryfads, and rising alarm over the destruction of the natural world, Americans have been immovable when it comes to becoming vegetarian or vegan. Just 4% of people in the US identified as vegetarian in 2023, a proportion that is actually down from the 6% that said the same in 2001,according to Gallup. A mere 1% are vegan.Inspiring a move away from meat, even if it just to cut back consumption, is seemingly far more difficult in the US than other comparable countries that havelarger, and growing, cohorts of vegetarians.“Certainly in the American fabric there is a relationship with cattle, the kind of pioneer, rugged individualism, John Wayne, and it’s all wrapped up with this kind of Manifest Destiny,” said Brown.Current cultural trends around masqueradingrustic pursuitsand traditionalhomesteadinghas helped elevate meat, Brown said, along with the macho political posturing of the Trump era where the US, for the first time in years,again has adepartment of war.“It’s just not a moment for altruistic kind of behaviors,” he said. “I think right now it’s about TikTok and tariffs, that’s what is on the consumer’s mind. It’s not the moment for any sort of broader concern, it’s a very self-interested moment.”“It’s a particularly difficult moment for movements like vegan and vegetarianism,’ he conceded. ‘“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to come back.”The plant-based problem: why vegan restaurants are closing – or adding meat to the menuRead moreThe cultural pendulum may have swung toward meat but the stresses upon the planet have only worsened. Vastdeforestation, in places like the Amazon, to clear land for cows is fueling ecological and climate breakdown, with the burps of cattle and the associated chemicals, machinery and land loss from feeding and raising livestock responsible for up toa third of all planet-heating emissions.Each year, billions of animals are crammed into giant American barns, fed a cocktail of vaccines and antibiotics and killed, with the pollution from such facilities oftenbefoulingwaterways. Grass-fed cows in rolling paddocks are often portrayed as a greener option,although this system involvesrazing biodiverse forests and grasslands and converting even more land for cattle feed.“I’ve been trying for 30 years to get people to eat less meat but the numbers just haven’t budged in the US,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University. “I think consumers are confused. They like what’s familiar to them.”Gardner said he finds hope inevidencethat a growing number of younger Americans are willing to reduce meat intake and that the culture will shift away from the celebration of the carnivore.“Not everyone has to become vegetarian but we will have to eat a lot less meat – at some point people will wake up and say ‘where have the rainforests gone?’” he said.“We are heading to the point we don’t have the land or water to support the amount of meat we want to eat. I hope people finally get it. They have to get it. We are facing an existential moment here.”Explore more on these topicsFoodVegetarianismVegetarian food and drinkTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, when they’re nestled into soft almond cream and scented with star anise, they make a delicious tart for any time of day. Serve warm with pouring cream as pudding or cold with a cup of tea.Plum and star anise frangipane tartPrep15 minChill1 hr 30 minCook1 hr 45 minServes8-10For the pastry300g plain flour,plus extra for dusting90g icing sugar¼ tsp salt200g cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus an extra 10g, melted, for greasingFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 large egg yolk20ml ice-cold waterFor the plums4-5 medium plums(about 100g each), halved, stoned and sliced into 1cm-wide wedges1tbsp caster sugar3 whole star anise(about 3g), finely ground in a mortar to get 1½ tspFor the filling125g unsalted butter, at room temperature125g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange¼ tsp fine sea salt½ tsp almond extract, or vanilla extract2 eggs, at room temperature40g plain flour125g ground almondsIcing sugar, to finishTo make the pastry, put the flour, icing sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine and aerate. Add the butter and lemon zest, then process to the consistency of fresh breadcrumbs.Lightly whisk the egg yolk and water, then add to the flour mix and pulse until it begins to come together. Tip out the dough (it will be quite soft and slightly sticky) on to a lightly floured worktop and pat gently to bring it together. Divide the pastry in two with one piece slightly larger than the other, then wrap each loosely in clingfilm. Press gently to form discs and put the larger piece in the fridge for at least an hour (and up to three days); freeze the other piece of pastry for another use.To make the tart, grease a 23cm x 2½cm tart tin with a removable base with butter. Unwrap the pastry disc (if it is very firm, soften it slightly by tapping all over with a rolling pin), then roll out on a lightly floured worktop to about 4mm thick. Line the tart tin with the pastry, then trim the overhang and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Line the chilled pastry case with a sheet of baking paper and fill with baking beans. Blind bake for 20 minutes, then lift out the beans and paper. Return the tart to the oven, turn down the temperature to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and bake for another seven or eight minutes, until light golden brown. Remove, and leave the oven on.Meanwhile, mix the plums, sugar and a half-teaspoon of the ground star anise in a small bowl.For the almond cream, put the butter, sugar, orange zest, remaining teaspoon of ground star anise and the salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high until light and creamy. Add the almond extract, then the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn down the speed to low, add the flour and ground almonds, and mix thoroughly. Scrape into the pastry shell, then smooth the top. Arrange the plum wedges in a neat, tight concentric circle on top, then bake for 40-45 minutes, until the filling is set.Remove, leave to cool a little in the tin, then ease out and on to a serving plate. Dust lightly with icing sugar and serve warm or cold.Explore more on these topicsPastryThe sweet spotDessertFoodBakingFruitPieAutumn food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
