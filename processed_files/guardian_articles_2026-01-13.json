She is trying to keep warm by layering up and she picks her way around her home in the remote Cornish village of New Mill with old battery lamps from her days of caravanning.“I think it’s safe to say that we’re in a bit of a state,” said Williams, a retired council accounts assistant. “But it can’t go on for ever … can it?”Storm Goretti brought chaos to the far south-west of Britain last week with gusts as high as 99mph bringing down hundreds of trees and61.8mm of rainadding to the danger and misery.Almost a week on, trees still block roads and scores of people remain without power, water or phone connections. The feeling is growing thatCornwallhas been left to cope on its own, leading an increasing number of people to call for the UK government to step in to help.View image in fullscreenLinda Williams has been without power since Thursday.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianWilliams said neighbours and friends had come to her aid, sending hot meals, delivering bags of Cornish pasties and arriving with flasks of hot water, some of which she uses to make drinks, some to fill her hot-water bottle. “I feel vulnerable,” she said. “But I feel I have to stay put so I’m here if the power companies come to sort it out.”One of her neighbours, Roger Gillespie, 75, is cooking on a camping stove and warming his 15th-century mill house by keeping a log burner topped up. He lives with a red setter, Orlando, and two muscovy ducks (the ducks had to move into the cottage to protect them from a fox).Gillespie wears a head torch permanently because his house is dark and the oil lamps do not light the corners. “I’m a bit of a survivalist, so I’ll be OK,” he said. “But I feel sorry for some of the people round here who aren’t as fit as me.”View image in fullscreenRoger Gillespie: ‘I’m a bit of a survivalist, so I’ll be OK.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianAs well as losing power and a phone connection, Gillespie’s water went. “It turned all milky. I had to get to the supermarket for bottled water. We’re blessed here in good times. It’s a beautiful place – until something like this happens.”The local Liberal Democrat councillorJuliet Linewas spending hours on Tuesday visiting those cut off and trying to get utility companies and the highways department to reconnect people and move fallen trees.“The lack of national attention has been frustrating,” she said. “Staff at the council and local people are working so hard but the scale of the problem is massive.”Line believes the crisis highlights a lack of resilience. “The internet-based phone systems, for example, just don’t work when something like this happens. People don’t even know if help is coming.”View image in fullscreen‘The lack of national attention has been frustrating,’ says the local councillor Juliet Line.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianAndrew George, the MP for St Ives, said those trying to get Cornwall back on its feet were overwhelmed. “It doesn’t help if power and water suppliers feel obliged to present an ‘everything is under control, so don’t worry’ coping message, but that’s not the impression I get when out talking to those affected,” he said. He has called for a national emergency to be declared and for extra resources to be ploughed into Cornwall.One man died in Cornwall when a tree fell on to his caravan, and George said he worried there could have been other, as yet undiscovered, deaths. “People are feeling traumatised,” he said.Cornwall council said seven schools remained closed on Tuesday and its highways teams were responding to about 1,000 incidents across Cornwall, many involving fallen trees and branches.The National Grid said that by Tuesday afternoon 168 properties remained without power in west Cornwall owing to Storm Goretti. South West Water said “fewer than 100” were still experiencing loss of water or low pressure.The village of Goldsithney, close to Penzance, was cut in two by a tree that fell across the main street and on to a cottage roof. The family who lived there had a narrow escape.View image in fullscreen‘It’s the state of the country’: Harry Glasson in front of the fallen tree lying across the main road in Goldsithney.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“The mother and three children were downstairs,” said a neighbour, Harry Glasson. “If it had been a few hours later they’d have been in bed and may not have survived.” He was not surprised the tree still lay across the village’s main street. “It’s the state of the country,” he said.Fallen trees have made driving hazardous. Oona Burch, a school governor, told how she got stuck thanks to a combination of mud and a fallen tree as she drove her five- and seven-year-old children. “There was no phone signal and I was just thinking: what am I going to do?” She managed to extricate herself.She said farmers cleared the way to her school with chainsaws. “There’s been no sort of national response. We’ve still got blocked roads five days after the storm.”The cost is not just a human one. The storm felled almost 100 trees on St Michael’s Mount near Penzance – approximately 80% of the island’s trees – along with many much-loved camellias, hydrangeas and rhododendrons.View image in fullscreenJan Shearn: ‘God knows when we’ll be back to normal.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe National Trust said hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of damage had been done. The charity’s director for the south-west, Ian Marsh, said: “In terms of breadth and scale, this is the worst storm I’ve seen in my 16 years with the National Trust. Tenants and properties have lost power and water, roads are impassable and many thousands of trees have been damaged. It will take months of work to get some of our woodlands open and accessible again.”In the House of Commons, the Cabinet Office minister Dan Jarvis said he could give a “categoric assurance” that the government cared as much about Cornwall as the rest of the country.He said he realised that coastal and rural communities were vulnerable but said he believed the local resilience forum had worked well and it had not been deemed necessary to convene Cobra, the government’s crisis response committee.Jarvis said lessons would be learned from what Cornwall had experienced and the government would look at the issue of people being cut off when phones that relied on the internet did not work.Back at New Mill, Jan Shearn, 80, a retired headteacher, said local people had worked together to make sure everyone was safe, if not always very warm. “God knows when we’ll be back to normal,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCornwallUK weatherEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Do not hog the practice court. But as leading players testify – the reality is very differentTumaini Carayolin MelbourneTue 13 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 21.31 ESTShareOn a cool Wednesday afternoon before the US Open last year, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev were busy fine-tuning their games in an intense practice set at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, semi-finalists in the mixed doubles tournament, were scheduled to take their place at the hour and the American pair duly arrived a couple of minutes before their allotted slot.An amusing scene soon unfolded. Medvedev and Zverev were clearly desperate to continue playing for a little longer, but their court time had run out. The pair began to sheepishly deliberate over whether to attempt to play another game, even lining up on the baseline again, and they still occupied the court past the hour. Finally, they admitted defeat, allowing Collins and Harrison, who had been standing quietly on the sidelines, to begin.Nick Kyrgios delights rowdy fans as tennis cultures clash at Kooyong ClassicRead moreAlthough tennis players happily train with their rivals throughout the year, the practice court can also be a source of friction. Some players are particularly irritated when some of their colleagues inconsiderately extend their practice sessions past their scheduled court time. An unwritten rule in professional tournaments around the world: do not hog the practice court.Many people shrug off poor timekeeping from their peers, but for others this is a cardinal sin. Gabriel Diallo, a talented young Canadian player ranked No 41 in the world, smiles widely: “Some people abuse their time. It’s one hour, they push it to 1.05, 1.10. I’m Canadian so I hate confrontation. I just let people play, maybe too much.”The subject similarly prompts a chuckle from Coco Gauff: “It’s happened on tour now more so than juniors,” she says. “You definitely get some people that you know will push their time two, three, four minutes past. I’m not on the bar with that. If I’m on the court, I’ll ask my coach the time. I don’t like to be that player that goes over their time. I’m going to stop literally maybe even a minute before, especially if they have to clean the court [on clay].”A practice court handover can be awkward on both sides. Trying to finish a session on time and on the right note is not always a pleasant feeling, as stressed by Emma Raducanu: “Seven out of 10 times you end up double faulting,” she says. “That’s what happened to me today and I had a good practice. Maybe you feel pressure with the people coming on, especially if they’ve got a team of eight people in total. It is always a funny little interaction because the [final] point usually ends up being either terrible or unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff in a practice session in Melbourne.Photograph: Marcin Cholewinski/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockCourt time is precious at nearly every tournament and few players are allocated as much training time as they would like. There is also a difference between the time and quality of courts available to top players and the rest. This can lead to further resentment when higher-ranked players still take their time.Jessica Pegula, who spent much of her career outside the top 100 before a mid‑career breakthrough, notes how differently she was treated as a lower-ranked player, even at the US Open, her home tournament: “I was back in the park smelling all the weed and all the smells New York City has to offer,” she says. “They were completely different courts too. They were so fast, and they were nothing like the match courts. I’ve definitely seen a shift in my practice courts and my times and what courts I can get now that I’m a top player. I guess you could say it’s unfair a little bit, but I also think sometimes you’ve earned that right.”Perspectives are varied on the best way to react when another player is hogging the court. Pegula believes most players are flexible and understanding, but she does not hesitate to make her presence felt when necessary: “It is kind of funny, because you walk out and stand around: ‘All right, your time’s up,’” she says. “You go up and stand there, bouncing the ball. Like, ‘OK, it’s time to get off.’”View image in fullscreenGabriel Diallo says he takes a ‘very Canadian’ approach to practice-court etiquette.Photograph: Kobe Li/Nexpher/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockGauff is similarly proactive when the player before her is taking too long: “There are some people that go over [the time limit] and you’re kind of standing and you start making your way further and further on the court,” she says. “I don’t mind [players taking their time] as much, but it’s just, like, acknowledge it sometimes. If someone [says]: ‘Sorry, I have a match, I just want to hit a few more serves.’ I’m, like: ‘OK, cool.’ But the worst is if the player just keeps going like they’re not in the wrong. And then they don’t say sorry after. And I’m like: ‘OK, noted.’”During the early rounds of the US Open, Cameron Norrie had the pleasure of waiting for Novak Djokovic and Zverev to finish their practice session. As the hour came to an end, Norrie turned to his fitness trainer: “It was like 59 [minutes past]. I was trying to push my fitness trainer on to put a bit of pressure [on them]. He was like: ‘No, I don’t want to go!’”Others take a more passive stance, waiting patiently for the player before them to finish. Diallo chooses peace, but he is still judging the player for every additional second they spend on the court during his practice hour: “I think at a certain point, it’s ridiculous. If you’re finishing up your serves, OK fine. I don’t think at this stage it’s going to make a difference how you’re going to play.A smile creeps across Diallo’s face as he continues: “I just sit and watch them until when they’re going to be satisfied that: ‘OK, I’ve had enough and I can go and be calm now about my match.’ Very Canadian.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026TennisAustralian OpenAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some ministers you can’t get to shut up, others refuse to say a word. On balance, Keir Starmer probably prefers it when they say next to nothing. On the grounds there is probably less that can go wrong. He likes it best when he is the one doing the talking as he is more in control of the message. The only trouble is, the public often prefer it when it’s someone else doing the talking. Especially when that person isWes Streeting.OK, so we all know that Streeting can be a bit annoying. No one is ever going to love Wes in quite the same way Wes loves Wes. The self-regard is total. And he has never made any secret that his ambition goes well beyond being health secretary. He wants the top job and will be among the first to put his name forward when Starmer decides – or has it decided for him – that enough is enough. And of course, Wes is constantly plotting. How do we know? Because he is breathing.But here’s the thing. Despite all this – or maybe even because of it – Streeting is one of the better performers on theLabourfrontbench. He believes in himself and he believes in the NHS and has no qualms about trying to make a good news story out of both. Above all, he looks like he cares. As if he is up for the fight of making the health service better again.Streeting is a natural salesman. Whenteam Starmer briefed against Wes shortly before Christmas, insisting he was trying to stage a coup to oust him from No 10 – Keir still isn’t quite sure how that inquiry into the leaks Keir started is going – the whole thing backfired. Because on the media round the very next day, Wes did a star turn. Not only deflecting the whole thing as paranoia, but showing everyone why he would make a much better leader than Starmer. Confident, clear and assured. Here was a genuine prime minister in waiting. If people hadn’t seen Wes as a successor to Starmer before this, they did now. This was Wes leading Wes’s charmed life.Since then, Streeting has kept more of a low profile. A spell on the sidelines doing a conspicuous show of loyalty wouldn’t do his long-term chances any harm. But with Starmer’s popularity ratings still flatlining and the questions over his tenure in Downing Street becoming more persistent, Wes had decided that it was time to break cover again. And it was done with some subtlety. No great LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE klaxon. There again, maybe it’s a sign of Keir’s weakness that even a simple statement of the obvious can be seen as a threat.Not so long ago,Starmer gave a speech in which he had a moan about the levers of power being frustratingly slow. That civil servants were too comfortable in the tepid bath of the status quo. This was followed up byan article written by one of his former stafferswho also moaned about the speed of government. Neither appeared to realise that the public weren’t that interested in the internal workings of the administration. They just wanted something to change. They were fed up with being broke and no public services working properly. Having to listen to the powerful saying how powerless they felt made people want to kick something.Wes, though, understood the public’s mood perfectly. So in a keynote speech to the Institute for Government’s conference on Tuesday morning,he set about challenging his own government’s orthodoxy. It wasn’t good enough just to complain about the levers of power, he said. The government had been elected to improve public services and that’s what he was determined to do. It was up to him and other ministers to change the system if the system wasn’t working. He didn’t mention Starmer once. He didn’t need to. Everyone understood the subtext. Wes was being Wes. He was ready whenever the call might come. He didn’t mind waiting a little while longer. Time was on his side.Later in the morning, we were treated to the more monosyllabic – borderline mute – kind of minister that Starmer much prefers. The type of ministerial performance that the public rightly detest. The junior housing minister Matthew Pennycook had been summoned to the Commons to answer an urgent question brought by Tory shadow minister Alicia Kearns on the proposals forthe new Chinese embassynear the City of London. The Daily Telegraph had been shown the unredacted plans, which showed there were 208 secret rooms and a hidden bunker with extractor fans little more than a metre or so away from fibre optic cables carrying sensitive financial and personal data. Ideal for hacking.Now it’s fair to say that if the plans were being considered by a Tory government – a decision is expected in a week’s time – then Pennycook might have had quite a lot to say on the subject. Along the lines of falling over backwards to accommodate a hostile and authoritarian state. But all this was happening on Labour’s watch and so Pennycook had taken a vow of silence.Now, it maybe be harsh to pick Matthew out as personally responsible. He was just the messenger. The fall guy sent out because neither his boss – the housing, communities and local government secretary, Steve Reed – nor the security minister, Dan Jarvis, felt quite brave enough to front this one up. So the janitor was sent out. And Pennycook died a thousand deaths.He’s not the most self-aware of men, but even he could sense that things weren’t going well for him. He could hardly not. It wasn’t just the Tories and the Lib Dems who had him in their sights. Every single Labour backbencher was angry that the proposed embassy looked like it was getting the go-ahead just to keep in with the Chinese. Just imagine the Chinese doing the same for us. You can’t.“It would be inappropriate to comment on this case,” Pennycook said time and time again as MPs raised every objection from data theft to bounties and transnational killings. Matthew was unmoved. “No decision had been made but all considerations are being … er, considered.” It was a graceless performance. I hope he reckons it was worth it.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchWes StreetingKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s the finest of the 28 franchise by a blood-curdling milePeter BradshawTue 13 Jan 2026 16.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 16.01 ESTShareIt’s very rare for a fourquel to be the best film in a franchise, but that’s how things stand with the chequered 28 Days Later series. In this one, which follows immediately on from the previous episode,28 Years Later, Ralph Fiennes and Jack O’Connell bring pure death-metal craziness. There is real energy and drama in this latest iteration of the post-apocalyptic zombie horror-thriller saga, created by director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland back in 2003, with Nia DaCosta taking over directing duties for this film. Fiennes’s dance toIron Maiden’s The Number of the Beastis basically one of the most extraordinary moments of his career. At the screening I attended, we were on our feet, looking for a speaker bin to headbang into. The band surely has to rerelease this track with Fiennes’s performance as a new official video. His Voldemort was never so freaky.It is just so exhilarating to see this intergenerational face-off between such superb actors as Fiennes and O’Connell. That brings us to the point of my agnosticism about this whole franchise; Bone Temple is the best for an interesting reason – because the zombies are almost entirely irrelevant and are at a minimum. The always slightly dull business of zombieism is de-emphasised, and what counts is the conflict between sentient human beings. Even the one important zombie here is interesting because he is being transformed into something else.In the preceding film, set 28 years on from the original zombie-infection outbreak, a kid called Spike (Alfie Williams) leaves the quarantined safety of Holy Island off England’s north-east coast for the zombie-infested mainland. He is brooding over rumours of a doctor played by Fiennes, a lone standard-bearer of decency and civilisation, who has created an ossuary-monument to fallen humanity: the bone temple. At the end of the earlier film, there was extraordinary new franchise-extension twist which critics could not mention due to spoiler rules and from which, even now, new viewers may want to avert their eyes.It turns out there is a murderous Clockwork-Orangey gang of non-infected people roaming around – unafraid of zombies and more interesting than zombies – led by the bizarre Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal (O’Connell) whose tracksuits and blond wigs are modelled on … erm … Jimmy Savile. It isn’t at all clear when these people will have seen Savile on screen; his heyday was long before their youth, although they do remember and idolise the Teletubbies.The horrific Jimmies come across poor bewildered Spike, and this courageous kid witnesses at close quarters the bullies’ loathsome, ultraviolent way of life. And Sir Lord Jimmy, who has developed a whole psychopathic theology to justify his power over his credulous cowed followers, emerges as a horribly watchable new character (though Erin Kellyman plays a Jimmy disciple who is not so submissive).We also see more of Fiennes’s Dr Ian Kelson, whose weird orange skin (the result of iodine self-treatment) and unusual deportment is fatefully misunderstood by the Jimmies. Dr Kelson is in fact trying to come to terms with the alpha zombie rampaging around the place, a giant he has named “Samson” (played by Chi Lewis-Parry); Dr Kelson’s almost Christlike gentleness and non-aggression, and his pharma stockpile, mean that we see unsuspected depths in Samson.This is an exciting, forthright, energised – though very gruesome – film in which there is real human jeopardy and conflict. Non-zombies are more cinematic.28 Years Later: The Bone Temple in out on 15 January in Australia, and 16 January in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror films28 Years LaterRalph FiennesJack O'ConnellIron MaidenDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The main criticism levelled at the ceremony so far seems to be that it didn’t adequately reflect the moment. It was all a bit 1920s Berlin, with a shimmering array of beautiful millionaires busy congratulating themselves, oblivious to the fear and exhaustion of the rest of the world.Little wonder, then, that the only real moment of the show to go viral was a red carpet interview with Mark Ruffalo. Called over by an interviewer to explain the pin he was wearing on his tuxedo, Ruffalo explained that “I’m not feeling so great. We have a woman, Renee Good was murdered in our streets of America today … As much as I love all this, I don’t know if I can pretend like this crazy stuff isn’t happening.” (An assistant attorney general hasdecided not to investigate the killing of an unarmed civilian by an ICE agenteven though this would be usual in the case of a shooting by law enforcement.)Ruffalo was far from the only attender who wore a Be Good badge to the ceremony – Jean Smart, Ariana Grande, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne all did the same – but he does seem to be one of the few figures who consistently speaks his mind on matters such as these. The “activism and political views” section of his Wikipedia page runs to 14 dense paragraphs of causes he has supported, on issues ranging from Iran to pollution to the preservation of Manhattan churches. Just this week, post-Globes, he signed a letter calling for the immediate restoration of medical care in Gaza.Being this outspoken puts Ruffalo in the crosshairs – just today, a newspaper called him “the most sanctimonious man in Hollywood” – which, in an age where the entertainment industry is being run by a smaller and smaller number of figures, can be a dangerous game to play. But the beauty ofMark Ruffalois that he has always danced to the beat of his own drum.View image in fullscreenUS comedian Wanda Sykes wears a Be Good pin.Photograph: Michael Tran/AFP/Getty ImagesIn terms of his professional output, he has always managed to juggle his personal projects with blockbuster fare. In one year alone he managed to make Dark Waters (a film about a lawyer trying to land a hit on a multinational chemical company) and Avengers: Endgame (a film where he played a version of the Incredible Hulk who can dab). Commercially, one of these was the second biggest film of all time, and the other was just the 130th biggest film of 2019, but Ruffalo approached both with the same vigour.The Golden Globes ceremony ignored politics. But their big winner taps today’s unhappy turbulence | Peter BradshawRead moreIn other words, he is proof that speaking out on issues that resonate personally won’t necessarily harm your career, so long as you mean it. Which brings us back to the tightrope. Political statements have a history of going down badly at awards shows – Michael Moore was booed at the Oscars in 2003, and Jonathan Glazer created a firestorm when hespoke about Palestineduring his acceptance speech in 2024 – but Mark Ruffalo managed to hit the sweet spot. His red carpet moment this weekend landed because it managed to be awkward, sincere and unresolved at the same time. It wasn’t so much an out of touch sermon as a howl of frustration, and who can’t relate to that?This article was amended on 13 January 2026 to correct the details about the investigative situation regarding the Renee Good shooting.Explore more on these topicsGolden GlobesMark RuffaloAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the total area burned globally hasfallenfor decades as farms have expanded across Africa and slowed the spread of blazes – forests have become a new hotspot.The rise in forest fires is unmistakable. Four of the five worst years on record have occurred since 2020.Research from theWRIshows that 2024 was the first time that major fires raged across tropical, hot and humid forests such as the Amazon, and boreal forests, such as those spanning Canada’s vast coniferous regions.Charts showing extreme wildfire events are increasing the most in boreal and temperate conifer forestsSome of the world’s worst-affected areasBrazil, Bolivia, Russia, Australia and Canada have all endured some of their worst fire seasons in recent years, as heatwaves stoked by fossil fuel pollution drive the risk of extreme blazes higher.The maps, using data from theUniversity of Maryland, show some of the hardest-hit forests.init-1Russia has suffered three of itsworst fire seasonson record since 2020, with 2021 the most severe. About 45,000 km2of forest was burned – mainly across Siberia and Russia’s far east.The fires extended so far north that they reached permafrost regions within the Arctic Circle, and in 2021, satellite sensors recorded the northernmost wildfire ever recorded. As more permafrost thaws – drying soil, warming air, and reducing humidity – scientistsexpectan “abrupt increase” in wildfires.end-1init-2In 2023, 78,000 km2of forest burned in Canada – another record-breaking fire season. The choking smokekilledCarter Vigh, a nine-year-old with asthma playing at summer camp in British Columbia, along with 82,000 others. The fine particles of toxic pollutants spread so far that Europe shouldered one-quarter of the death toll. Firefighting resources were pushed to their limit across several Canadian provinces, and the fires forced mass evacuations.The fires reached previously unburnt areas in the boreal north, and weather stations recorded temperatures up to 10C higher than average.end-2init-3Wildfires were especially extreme across swathes of South America in 2024 – with the Amazon once again beingheavily impacted. 23,000 km2of forest burned in Brazil alone, with the majority of that in the Amazon – its second worst year on record. The Brazilian states of Pará, Rondônia and Mato Grosso suffered some of the fiercest blazes. Flames also penetrated into Indigenous territories and protected areas.Extreme heat and drought, attributed to climate change and theEl Niño effect, led to more extreme fire conditions. This was thenmade worseby illegal deforestation, land grabbing and agricultural clearing.end-3init-4Australia’s 2019 to 2020 fire season was so bad it became known as the“black summer”. Millions of hectares of land burned nationwide. While the worst effects of the 2019-20 bushfires on property were in the eastern states, forestry suffered more in western Australia.Several contributing factors have beenidentifiedas to why these forests were affected so severely: ongoing drought, high winds, heatwaves and changing land use practices. More than 3,000 homes were destroyed and over 30 people died during this fire season. An estimated three billionanimalsalso perished as crucial ecosystems such as the Stirling Range national park burned.end-4How climate change is driving this changeExperts warn that climate change is making wildfires bigger, longer and more destructive. Hotter, drier conditions are extending fire seasons and fuelling more extreme blazes.2023 and 2024 had the most forest area burned by wildfires on record. They were also the two hottest years on record.Chart showing how both temperatures and burned forests have increased since 2000Northern latitudes are heating faster than the global average, driving a surge in boreal forest fires.James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager with the Global Forest Watch initiative at the WRI, said: “Because of where they grow and how climate patterns are changing, boreal and temperate conifer forests are warming and drying faster than most other forests.“Fire is a natural part of these ecosystems, but the traits that once helped them survive infrequent burns – like thick bark and seeds that are released in response to fire – are now being overwhelmed as fires grow larger, more frequent and more severe.”“Fires are increasingly burning in places that were historically too wet to ignite and rarely caught fire, like peat-rich forests.”A vicious cycleWhat makes burning forests even more concerning is the fact that, normally, they arecarbon sinks.By absorbing CO2and storing it in trees, plants and soil, forests normally regulate the climate by reducing greenhouse gases and slowing the pace of global warming.But when they burn down, the carbon that they have stored is released into the atmosphere.In 2023 and 2024, forestsonly absorbed a quarterof the CO2they do in a typical year.MacCarthy warned: “When these forests and peatlands burn, they release carbon that has been locked away in trees and soil for hundreds of years, accelerating climate change and setting the stage for more fire.Smoke from these firescan travel thousands of miles, polluting the air for millions of people, while nearby communities face evacuations, health risks and mounting costs.”Calum Cunningham, research fellow at the University of Tasmania fire centre, said: “Massive forest fire seasons threaten to reshape the atmosphere by releasing huge amounts of CO2, which could create a feedback loop – more warming, worse fire weather, more fire. That’s the ultimate fear.”Curbing the damageReducing human-caused carbon emissions and addressing climate change is the crucial step in tackling fires.But experts say local action is also essential. Halting deforestation, restoring degraded land and managing fire risk in vulnerable regions can all help curb the damage.init-5Bolivia’s2024 fires were its worst on record. More than 10,000 km² of forest burned – double the previous high. Experts warn that worsening drought and the rapid spread of agriculture are fuelling a surge in fire activity across the country.end-5But some forests in Bolivia escaped the worst of the flames.Charagua Iyambae, a newly established Indigenous Territory in southern Bolivia, had invested in early warning systems and land-use policies that helpedprevent the spreadof forest fires.A crucial protected area within the territory – called Ñembi Guasu – largely avoided the worst of the fires due to a combination of Indigenous-led governance and practical fire-management. It is a 12,000 km2area and home to jaguars, giant armadillos and tapirs.This involved local Guaraní park rangers using satellite monitoring to report risks quickly to authorities, enabling quick action before small ignitions spread. Pre-positioned people and gear were quick to stamp out or block fires before they became bigger problems.All of this meant that, while the map above shows how swathes of Bolivian forests burned last year, Charagua Iyambae was left relatively untouched – even areas that burned before.But authorities cannot be complacent. In early September this year, the territory declared a disaster as flames entered the protected area. Rainfall eventually helped extinguish them, but the episode showed there is no such thing as fire immunity.Some fire-affected forests can regrow if given the chance: in Australia, for example, many ecosystems are adapted to recover after low-intensity burns, though recovery depends on the species lost and the extent to which the land is left ecologically degraded.Experts warn that these trends will continue as climate change gets worse. The ongoing rise in global temperatures is expected to create even more conducive conditions for wildfires, leading to longer and more intense fire seasons.Boreal and temperate conifer forests, already experiencing rapid warming, are especially vulnerable. Without significant action, the vicious cycle of warming leading to more fires, less carbon absorption and further warming is set to accelerate.The WRI’s MacCarthy said that a combination of local and global solutions will be needed to solve the crisis.“To reduce the growing risk of forest fires, we need to address the underlying drivers. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions can limit the hot, dry conditions that fuel fires, while ending deforestation can slow climate change and prevent forest fires linked to land clearing.”"

Medical staff said the gunshot wounds were mostly concentrated on protesters’ eyes and heads – a tactic that rights groups said authoritiesused against demonstratorsin the country’s 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests.UK announces ‘full and further sanctions’ amid Iran killings and arrestsRead more“[Security forces] are deliberately shooting at the head and the eyes. They want to damage the head and the eyes so they can no longer see, the same thing they did in [2022],” said a doctor in Tehran. The doctor added that many of the patients had to have their eyes removed and were blinded.Iran’s demonstrations, which started on 28 December over a sudden dip in the value of the country’s currency, have since turned into the country’s biggest anti-government protest movement since 2009. Tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets across the country each night, chanting anti-government slogans such as “death to the dictator”, a reference to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests have alarmed authorities, and on Thursday night,they shut off internet and mobile access in the country, cutting the Iranian people off from the rest of the world. Rights groups have accused the government of exploiting the media blackout to carry out a brutal crackdown against protesters.More than 2,000 people have been killed in the protests – more than 90% of whom were demonstrators – and over 16,700 people have been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said.The death toll, still expected to rise, was stunning. After two weeks it is already four times greater than that of the months-long 2022 Mahsa Amini protests. The authorities’ reactions to 2022 protests were previously considered a particularly violent crackdown.View image in fullscreenDoctors say the death toll from the crackdown is likely to be much higher than current numbers.Photograph: APDoctors in Iran said they suspected that the death toll, though shocking, was just a fraction of the true number of dead in the country. They saw a sharp rise in wounded patients arriving at hospitals immediately after Iranian authorities cut off the internet on Thursday.“It’s like in the war movies where you see the injured soldiers getting treated on the open field. We don’t have blood, we don’t have enough medical supplies. It’s like a war zone,” the doctor from Tehran said. His colleague detailed treating injured protesters on the ground outside in freezing temperatures due to lack of space in hospital wards.The Tehran doctor described medical staff working in challenging conditions, as the network shutdown prevented him from reaching other doctors and emergency services. He added that security forces would enter hospitals from time to time to arrest injured protesters.The doctor said: “My colleagues are very distressed, tired and horrified. They are breaking down in tears.” One colleague, a doctor, was wounded while travelling to the hospital, after being shot by authorities.The types of injuries seen by medical staff led them to believe that authorities were deliberately targeting the eyes of protesters, a claim echoed by rights groups. Authorities have been documented using shotguns firing metal pellets, as well as rifles with live ammunition, against protesters.“Eyes were hit by birdshot pellets and it was deliberate, they are shooting to kill,” said the Tehran doctor. A colleague added that they had removed “20 pellets” from the body of a single protester.Protesters have been shot in the eyes and genitals, with at least one young girl in critical condition after being shot in the pelvic area, according to a spokesperson from the US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights.The spokesperson said: “The evidence demonstrates that even when utilising ‘less-lethal’ weapons, the Islamic Republic deliberately targets vital organs, transforming these tools into instruments of systematic mutilation and permanent disability to terrorise protesters.”The Iranian government has accused protesters of being behind the violence, rather than its own security forces, releasing videos of what it said were foreign saboteurs. The government has pointed to videos of protesters beating police officers, as well as gunmen from a Sunni militant group killing a police chief and mosques being ransacked, as evidence that demonstrations had taken a violent turn.At least 135 people affiliated with the Iranian government have been killed in the protests, according to HRANA.Protesters who managed to evade the communications blackout said that, by contrast, they witnessed authorities targeting peaceful protesters. A 20-year-old protester said that during a protest they attended in Tehran on Friday, things quickly turned deadly after the intervention of security officers.“We were just chantingJavid Shah[Long live the king] and plainclothes killers infiltrated the people a few lines ahead and shot point blank, from behind, with guns directly at their head. We ran away and we don’t even know if they picked up the dead bodies,” they said.Trump promises ‘help is on its way’ and tells Iranians to ‘keep protesting’Read moreAnother video sent to the Guardian by activists in Iran showed a protester lying on the ground, with blood pouring out of his mouth, after particularly violent crackdowns were reported on Thursday in Fardis, in Alborz province west of Tehran. “He’s not breathing! Please hold on, I swear to god, please hold on,” a protester screams as blood continues to spurt out of the wounded man’s mouth.Despite the brutal crackdown, protests continued into their 17th day, with crowds numbering in the thousands filling the streets each night.Doctors cautioned, however, that while images of protests managed to make it out of the country, the world was vastly underestimating the death toll in Iran.“The images and data broadcast by the international media do not represent even one per cent of the reality, because the information simply does not reach them,” a physician who left Irantoldthe US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran on Monday.“This was a mass-casualty situation. Our facilities, space, and personnel were far below the number of injured people arriving,” the doctor said, describing the scenes in the hospital.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Iranian officials had earlier admitted to 600 deaths.His call to keep protesting comes a day after demonstrations had apparently subsided owing to the severity of the crackdown. Trump is still conferring with officials about the action he could take. But his words imply he will not be content with further economic pressure.On Tuesday evening, the state department warned US citizens to leave Iran immediately and Trump said that there would be “very strong action” if the regime hangs protesters. He did not elaborate on what that would mean.The current assessment of European diplomats is that the regime is very determined to cling on to power, and has the internal unity and resolve to do so. They believe it would take a very sustained US bombing campaign for that alignment of forces to change.Trump’s new declaration of support may bolster the demonstrations, but it remains unclear if a show of force by the US can compel the Iranian regime to back down. The death toll from the crackdown on the protests has risen as images of Iranian morgues filled with the bodies of demonstrators have leaked online.In his posts, Trump also called on Iranian protesters to “save the names of the killers and abusers” suggesting that the US could bring them to account and that they would “pay a big price”.Trump has also vowed to target foreign backers of the Iranian government and has announced a 25% tariff on any country still trading with Iran, a move that ledChina, Iran’s largest export partner, to threaten retaliation. The US president said the new tariffs would be “effective immediately”, without providing further details.In March last year, Trump proposed a similar measure of imposing tariffs on countries trading with Venezuela, but it was left to the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to complete the details and was never implemented.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday.Tariffsare paid by US importers of goods from those countries.Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said Beijing would “take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests” after Trump threatened to ramp up his global trade war. Other major trading partners include Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson characterised US pressure on Iran by saying that “external forces hostile to Iran are trying to use the growing public tension to destabilise and destroy the Iranian state”.The UK and other European countries including France, Germany and Italy summoned their Iranian ambassadors on Tuesday as they condemned the crackdown, but seemed to be seeking a way to avoid a US military intervention. The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, called on the Iranian ambassadors to “answer for the horrific reports” of violence from the country.The US senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said: “The tipping point of this long journey will be President Trump’s resolve. No boots on the ground, but unleashing holy hell – as he promised – on the regime that has trampled every red line. A massive wave of military, cyber and psychological attacks is the meat and bones of ‘help is on the way’.”More than 140 countries still trade with Iran, according to the World Bank, but sometimes only in small amounts.Trump’s threats of tariffs on Iranian trading partners coincided with Iran easing some restrictions on its people and, for the first time in days, allowing them to make calls abroad via their mobile phones on Tuesday. It did not ease restrictions on the internet or permit texting services to be restored.Reporting restrictions and the online shutdown make it difficult to determine the death toll. The Associated Press, however, reported that the news agency of Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been accurate in its coverage of previous unrest, had given a toll of at least 2,000 people, of whom 135 were government-affiliated.Yvette Cooper has announced sectoral sanctions on Iran covering finance, energy transport and software. She condemned the “horrendous and brutal killing” of peaceful protesters, saying Britain had summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of the situation.She described the Iranian narrative that the killings were the responsibility of foreign interference as lies, adding that Britain would not do anything to play into the regime’s efforts to whip up opposition to the west.The demonstrations in Iran have evolved from complaints about dire economic hardships to defiant calls for the fall of the deeply entrenched clerical establishment. The authorities have responded with aharsh crackdownincluding mass arrests,internet blackoutsandpublic warningsthat participation in the demonstrations could carry the death penalty.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters this week thatairstrikes were among the “many, many options”that Trump was considering but that “diplomacy is always the first option for the president”. More targeted assassinations and hitting Iran’s police headquarters with cruise missiles could also be considered.There is no public sign yet that Iran sees its internal crisis as so existential that it needs to change its nuclear programme to meet US demands – and gain relief from already crippling sanctions. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has been at the forefront of ministers claiming the protests were hijacked by foreign terrorist groups.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on Tuesday: “I assume that we are now witnessing the final days and weeks of this regime. When a regime can only maintain power through violence, then it is effectively at its end. The population is now rising up against this regime.”Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The UK has already designated key players in Iran’s oil, energy, nuclear and financial systems.“Further measures will target finance, energy, transport, software and other significant industries which are advancing Iranian nuclear escalation, and we will work further with the EU and other partners to explore what additional measures might now be needed in response to developments.”View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper making the announcement in the Commons on Tuesday.Photograph: House of Commons/PAShe said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister on Monday to set out the UK’s “total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”.Cooper said Iran’s claims that its domestic protests were due to foreign influence and instigation were “lies and propaganda”.“Just as they did in 2022, it’s absolutely clear the Iranian regime are trying to paint these protests as the result of foreign influence and instigation,” she said.“We and other governments across the world are determined not to play into the hands of the regime or to allow our words or actions to be twisted to support their lies and propaganda …“The world is watching Iran, and the UK will continue to confront the regime’s lies, to call out its repression and to take the steps necessary to protect the UK’s interests.”Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, questioned why the Iranian ambassador to the UK was not summoned sooner. She said: “Where is the government’s resolve to stand up to Iran, back those protesting and work to bring about the end of the cruelty of this regime? As Iranian citizens are sacrificing their lives in the fight for their own liberation, what message of hope and reassurance does the foreign secretary give to those risking their lives on the streets of Iran each day?”Earlier on Tuesday, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said he believed the Iranian government was in its “final days and weeks”.

In fact, there has been a drawdown in the last few months, reducing military options further.The US has had no aircraft carriers deployed in the Middle East since October, after two years of near continuous deployment following the Hamas attack on Israel, having moved out the USS Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean in the summer and the USS Nimitz to a port on the US west coast in the autumn.It means any air or missile strikes against regime targets, and perhaps at the Iranian leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would probably have to come from or involve US and allied airbases in the Middle East. An alternative would be similar to June’s long range B-2 bombing mission against the underground Iranian nuclear site of Fordow, although that sort of attack against an urban site would appear to be dangerous overkill.The US would also have to ask permission to use bases in countries such as Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq, the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia (perhaps even the UK’s Akrotiri base in Cyprus) – and protect them and their host countries against retaliation. Even if such assets were not used by the US, Iranian leaders have threatened to strike US bases and ships if the country is attacked.Although Iran’s military capabilities were badly degraded in the 12-day summer war with Israel, and its air defence systems easily overwhelmed, Tehran has retained a limited missile capability. Key launch sites remain buried in the mountains, and it has been rebuilding. It is estimated thatIran has 2,000 heavy ballistic missiles, capable, if launched in numbers, of evading US and Israeli air defences.GraphicA more salient question is: what would the US bomb? It would be possible to identify military and civilian sites used by the Iranian regime, but both the protests and the increasingly bloody regime crackdown are taking place across the country. Targeting is not always accurate, sites can be misidentified and civilian casualties in urban locations would be an evident risk. And it is not obvious this would be effective on the ground.It would also not be difficult for the Iranian regime to try to use any US attacks as a rallying point for what is left of its support, given the long history of US meddling dating back to the 1953 CIA coup. And, however unpopular it may be with ordinary people protesting, the ruling regime does not appear to be brittle or weak, having already survived Israel’s sustained attack in June.“There is a clearly a cohesive government and military and security service in Iran,” said Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a senior associate at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. “The government is showing it doesn’t have any red lines: it is going to secure its borders and streets, and the extraordinary number of body bags reveals its determination to do so.”The US could consider a direct attack on Khamenei. Trying to kill the Iranian leader would be easier militarily than a Maduro-style seizure operation, which would be considerably more complex than in Venezuela because Tehran lies hundreds of miles from the country’s borders. However, killing the leader of another country would be astonishingly escalatory, raise a host of legal concerns, and invite a sustained military response.Nor would it necessarily lead to regime change. During the 12-day war, Khamenei appears to have evaded Israeli detection: the country’s defence minister, Israel Katz, defence minister said afterwards that “if he had been in our sights, we would have taken him out”. The Iranian leader had also lined upthree senior clerics on a shortlistto replace him if he was killed, in an effort to secure a rapid transition.Other experts, such as Farmanfarmaian, argue that the most likely outcome would be a takeover led by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. But either way, the Iranian regime remained intact after Israel killed as many as 30 military and security leaders in June. A handful of US demonstration strikes would be unlikely to change that, while US allies, Congress and Trump himself would almost certainly not want a lengthy campaign. Already, the president himself has ruled out “boots on the ground”.Against such an uncertain backdrop, it is not surprising alternatives have been canvassed. The most notable is a targeted cyber-attack, raising the question of what would be intended. After the seizure of Maduro, Trump claimed that the US had turned off the power in Caracas to help facilitate his capture, but this would only be useful in Iran in conjunction with a military operation.Ciaran Martin, a former head of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, argues that “it is hard to see what could work” and that “disrupting civilian or even government services” such as electricity would probably affect civilians more. A theoretical possibility would be for the US to try restore the internet, largely shut down since last Thursday, though Martin added it would be “hard to intervene via cyber” to do so.A simpler possibility would be to try and “flood the place with Starlink” – Elon Musk’s satellite internet service – by overcoming Iranian jamming, providing the service for free. But, Martin said, that was “not really a cyber-operation” and sharing more information about repression may not stop the killing in the streets. What can be achieved by US military intervention may not match up to Trump’s promise that“help is on its way”.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneianalysisShareReuse this content"

MI5 is understood not to have any security concerns about the project, asrevealed by the Guardianlast year.Kearns said the lack of concern was complacent, and that access to the cables underneath the embassy “would give the Chinese Communist party a launch pad for economic warfare against our nation”.It would be “a daily headache” for our security services, she said, demanding the Chinese ambassador be called in to explain the plans. Citing Starmer’splanned visit to China, she asked if approval of the embassy would allow the prime minister to “turn up with a gift in hand”.Government officials are aware the timing could be useful but say it is coincidental. As one put it: “There is no political pressure, but that has crossed our minds.”No Labour MPs spoke in favour of approving the plan during the urgent question. Among those who expressed concern was Sarah Champion, who chairs the Commons international development select committee.“Multiple government agencies and government departments have raised concerns about this mega-embassy,” she said. “Our international partners have raised concerns about it. Every security briefing I’ve had identifiesChinaas a hostile state to the UK. I am in no doubt this mega-embassy should not be allowed to go ahead.”Why are proposals for China’s super-embassy in London so contentious?Read moreOther Labour backbenchers focused primarily on the possible repercussions for residents originally from Hong Kong, Tibet or Xinjiang. Several said Chinese diplomatic missions had been used to target such diaspora populations before.Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, said the embassy could pose a “real threat” to UK-based Hong Kongers and Uyghurs, the predominantly Muslim population of Xinjiang, the far-western region where China has been accused of abuses including forced labour and arbitrary detention.Rushanara Ali, the MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney, in whose constituency the embassy would be sited, called for the concerns of local people to be taken seriously, saying that the area’s large Muslim population meant there was a particular focus on Xinjiang.Another Labour MP, James Naish, who represents Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, said the debate was not just about a building, but one of national security and the safety to diaspora groups. He asked for assurances that the process had been fair.Pennycook said: “The planning process hasn’t been compromised. We will make a planning decision on the basis of the relevant propriety guidance.”The decision had been delayed because of the “detailed nature of the representations that have been provided, and the need to give parties sufficient opportunity to respond”, he said.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsChinaPlanning policyLondonSurveillanceKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

One chemist called the concerns “a bombshell”.Studies claiming to have revealed micro and nanoplastics in thebrain,testes,placentas,arteriesand elsewhere were reported by media across the world, including the Guardian. There is no doubt that plastic pollution of the natural world is ubiquitous, and present in the food and drink we consume and the air we breathe. But the health damage potentially caused by microplastics and the chemicals they contain is unclear, and an explosion of research has taken off in this area in recent years.However, micro- and nanoplastic particles are tiny and at the limit of today’s analytical techniques, especially in human tissue. There is no suggestion of malpractice, but researchers told the Guardian of their concern that the race to publish results, in some cases by groups with limited analytical expertise, has led to rushed results and routine scientific checks sometimes being overlooked.The Guardian has identified seven studies that have been challenged by researchers publishing criticism in the respective journals, while a recent analysis listed 18 studies that it said had not considered that some human tissue can produce measurements easily confused with the signal given by common plastics.There is an increasing international focus on the need to control plastic pollution but faulty evidence on the level of microplastics in humans could lead to misguided regulations and policies, which is dangerous, researchers say. It could also help lobbyists for the plastics industry to dismiss real concerns by claiming they are unfounded. While researchers say analytical techniques are improving rapidly, the doubts over recent high-profile studies also raise the questions of what is really known today and how concerned people should be about microplastics in their bodies.‘The paper is a joke’View image in fullscreen“Levels of microplastics in human brains may be rapidly rising” was the shocking headline reporting a widely covered study in February. The analysis,published in a top-tier journalandcovered by the Guardian, said there was a rising trend in micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in brain tissue from dozens of postmortems carried out between 1997 and 2024.However, by November, the study had been challenged by a group of scientists with the publication of a“Matters arising” letterin the journal. In the formal, diplomatic language of scientific publishing, the scientists said: “The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported concentrations.”Plastic nurdles found at 84% of UK sites of special scientific interestRead moreOne of the team behind the letter wasblunt. “The brain microplastic paper is a joke,” said Dr Dušan Materić, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany. “Fat is known to make false-positives for polyethylene. The brain has [approximately] 60% fat.” Materić and his colleagues suggested rising obesity levels could be an alternative explanation for the trend reported in the study.Materić said: “That paper is really bad, and it is very explainable why it is wrong.” He thinks there are serious doubts over “more than half of the very high impact papers” reporting microplastics in biological tissue.Prof Matthew Campen, senior author of the brain study in question, told the Guardian: “In general, we simply find ourselves in an early period of trying to understand the potential human health impacts of MNPs and there is no recipe book for how to do this. Most of the criticism aimed at the body of work to date (ie from our lab and others) has been conjectural and not buffeted by actual data.“We have acknowledged the numerous opportunities for improvement and refinement and are trying to spend our finite resources in generating better assays and data, rather than continually engaging in a dialogue.”‘Bombshell’ doubtsView image in fullscreenBut the brain study is far from alone in having been challenged. One, which reported that patients withMNPs detected in carotid artery plaqueshad ahigher risk of heart attacksand strokes than patients with no MNPs detected, was subsequentlycriticised for not testing blank samplestaken in the operating room. Blank samples are a way of measuring how much background contamination may be present.Another study reportedMNPs in human testes, “highlighting the pervasive presence of microplastics in the male reproductive system”. But other scientists took adifferent view: “It is our opinion that the analytical approach used is not robust enough to support these claims.”This study was by Prof Campen and colleagues, who responded: “To steal/modify a sentiment from the television show Ted Lasso, ‘[Bioanalytical assays] are never going to be perfect. The best we can do is to keep asking for help and accepting it when you can and if you keep on doing that, you’ll always be moving toward better.’”Further challenged studies includetworeporting plastic particlesinblood– in both cases the researcherscontested the criticisms– and another ontheir detectioninarteries. A study claiming to have detected10,000 nanoplastic particlesper litre of bottled water was called “fundamentally unreliable” by critics, a chargedisputed by the scientists.The doubts amount to a “bombshell”, according to Roger Kuhlman, a chemist formerly at the Dow Chemical Company. “This is really forcing us to re-evaluate everything we think we know about microplastics in the body. Which, it turns out, is really not very much. Many researchers are making extraordinary claims, but not providing even ordinary evidence.”While analytical chemistry has long-established guidelines on how to accurately analyse samples, these do not yet exist specifically for MNPs, said Dr Frederic Béen, at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: “But we still see quite a lot of papers where very standard good laboratory practices that should be followed have not necessarily been followed.”These include measures to exclude background contamination, blanks, repeating measurements and testing equipment with samples spiked with a known amount of MNPs. “So you cannot be assured that whatever you have found is not fully or partially derived from some of these issues,” Béen said.Biologically implausibleView image in fullscreenA key way of measuring the mass of MNPs in a sample is, perhaps counterintuitively, vaporising it, then capturing the fumes. But this method, dubbed Py-GC-MS, has come under particular criticism. “[It] is not currently a suitable technique for identifying polyethylene or PVC due to persistent interferences,” concluded aJanuary 2025 studyled by Dr Cassandra Rauert, an environmental chemist at the University of Queensland in Australia.“I do think it is a problem in the entire field,” Rauert told the Guardian. “I think a lot of the concentrations [of MNPs] that are being reported are completely unrealistic.”“This isn’t a dig at [other scientists],” she added. “They use these techniques because we haven’t got anything better available to us. But a lot of studies that we’ve seen coming out use the technique without really fully understanding the data that it’s giving you.” She said the failure to employ normal quality control checks was “a bit crazy”.Py-GC-MS begins by pyrolysing the sample – heating it until it vaporises. The fumes are then passed through the tubes of a gas chromatograph, which separates smaller molecules from large ones. Last, a mass spectrometer uses the weights of different molecules to identify them.The problem is that some small molecules in the fumes derived from polyethylene and PVC can also be produced from fats in human tissue. Human samples are “digested” with chemicals to remove tissue before analysis, but if some remains the result can be false positives for MNPs. Rauert’s paper lists 18 studies that did not include consideration of the risk of such false positives.Rauert also argues that studies reporting high levels of MNPs in organs are simply hard to believe: “I have not seen evidence that particles between 3 and 30 micrometres can cross into the blood stream,” she said. “From what we know about actual exposure in our everyday lives, it is not biologically plausible that that mass of plastic would actually end up in these organs.”“It’s really the nano-size plastic particles that can cross biological barriers and that we are expecting inside humans,” she said. “But the current instruments we have cannot detect nano-size particles.”Further criticism came in July, in areview study in the Deutsches Ärzteblatt, the journal of the German Medical Association. “At present, there is hardly any reliable information available on the actual distribution of microplastics in the body,” the scientists wrote.Fresh bloodView image in fullscreenPlastic production has ballooned by 200 times since the 1950s and is set to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060. As a result, plastic pollution has also soared, with 8bn tonnes now contaminating the planet from thetop of Mount Everestto thedeepest ocean trench. Less than 10% of plastic is recycled.Anexpert review published in the Lancetin August called plastics a “grave, growing and underrecognised danger” to human and planetary health. It cited harm from the extraction of the fossil fuels they are made from, to their production, use and disposal, which result in air pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals.In recent years, the infiltration of the body with MNPs has become a serious concern, and alandmark studyin 2022first reported detection in human blood. That study is one of the 18 listed in Rauert’s paper and was criticised byKuhlman.But the study’s senior author, Prof Marja Lamoree, at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, rejected suggestions of contamination. “The reason we focused on blood in the first place is that you can take blood samples freshly, without the interference of any plastics or exposure to the air,” she said.“I’m convinced we detected microplastics,” she said. “But I’ve always said that [the amount estimated] could be maybe twice lower, or 10 times higher.” In response to Kuhlman’s letter, Prof Lamoree and colleagues said he had “incorrectly interpreted” the data.Prof Lamoree does agree there is a wider issue. “It’s still a super-immature field and there’s not many labs that can do [these analyses well]. When it comes to solid tissue samples tissues, then the difficulty is they are usually taken in an operating theatre that’s full of plastic.”“I think most of the, let’s say, lesser quality analytical papers come from groups that are medical doctors or metabolomics [scientists] and they’re not driven by analytical chemistry knowledge,” she said.ScaremongeringView image in fullscreenImproving the quality of MNP measurements in the human body matters, the scientists said. Poor quality evidence is “irresponsible” and can lead to scaremongering, said Rauert: “We want to be able to get the data right so that we can properly inform our health agencies, our governments, the general population and make sure that the right regulations and policies are put in place.“We get a lot of people contacting us, very worried about how much plastics are in their bodies,” she said. “The responsibility [for scientists] is to report robust science so you are not unnecessarily scaring the general population.”Rauert called treatments claiming to clean microplastics from your blood “crazy” – some are advertised for £10,000. “These claims have no scientific evidence,” she said, and could put more plastic into people’s blood, depending on the equipment used.Materić said insufficiently robust studies might also help lobbyists for the plastics industry downplay known risks of plastic pollution.The good news, said Béen, is that analytical work across multiple techniques is improving rapidly: “I think there is less and less doubt about the fact that MNPs are there in tissues. The challenge is still knowing exactly how many or how much. But I think we’re narrowing down this uncertainty more and more.”Prof Lamoree said: “I really think we should collaborate on a much nicer basis – with much more open communication – and don’t try to burn down other people’s results. We should all move forward instead of fighting each other.”‘On the safe side’View image in fullscreenIn the meantime, should the public be worried about MNPs in their bodies?Given the very limited evidence, Prof Lamoree said she could not say how concerned people should be: “But for sure I take some precautions myself, to be on the safe side. I really try to use less plastic materials, especially when cooking or heating food or drinking from plastic bottles. The other thing I do is ventilate my house.”“We do have plastics in us – I think that is safe to assume,” said Materić. “But real hard proof on how much is yet to come. There are also very easy things that you can do to hugely reduce intake of MNPs. If you are concerned about water, just filtering through charcoal works.” Experts also adviseavoiding food or drinkthat has been heated in plastic containers.Rauert thinks most of the MNPs that people ingest or breathe in are probably expelled by their bodies, but said it can’t hurt to reduce your plastics exposure. Furthermore, she said, it remains vital to resolve the uncertainty over what MNPs are doing to our health: “We know we’re being exposed, so we definitely want to know what happens after that and we’ll keep working at it, that’s for sure.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The hope is that this would crack down on illegal working while avoiding the controversy of an in effect compulsory ID system.It is understood that one of the motivations for the change was to allow people who wanted to use digital ID to do so, while avoiding the PR hurdle of a mandatory element. As one official put it: “We will no longer have the conspiracy nonsense about state control.”A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to mandatory digital right to work checks. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly.“Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.”The Conservatives called the move “yet another humiliating U-turn from the government”.Mike Wood, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “What was sold as a tough measure to tackle illegal working is now set to become yet another costly, ill-thought-out experiment abandoned at the first sign of pressure from Labour’s backbenches.”Lisa Smart, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: “No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate to cope with all their U-turns.“It was clear right from the start this was a proposal doomed to failure, that would have cost obscene amounts of taxpayers money to deliver absolutely nothing.“The government now needs to confirm that the billions of pounds earmarked for their mandatory digital ID scheme will be spent on the NHS and frontline policing instead.”A government source said the revised plans would not change the main principle of the original proposal, in which checks for eligibility to work were to be made tougher, in line with systems in other countries.Currently, they said, many were based on employers seeing paper copies of documents, whereas under the new system it was likely to involve a digital check of a passport or e-visa.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerIdentity cardsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

She said US allies “must now contemplate what was unthinkable: to defend themselves against the US, in both trade and security”.“It is not grandiose to call this the end of the western alliance,” she said, in the sense of countries “sharing principles of individual liberty, intellectual and religious freedom, constitutional democracy and free trade at their heart”. Maddox said these principles “have been the engine of their prosperity as well as the rationale for their global influence”.She said in recent months we had seen “the rejection of principles of international law that the US helped forge – even if it often declined to apply those to itself”.“Venezuela is the latest example,” Maddox said. “Trump’s intention to acquire Greenland is an offence against the UN charter and the prohibition on taking territory by force. If he did so by using force, as his team has threatened, it would be the end of Nato.”In an interview with the Guardian, Maddox said one of the tasks of Chatham House would be to champion the need for new alliances and pacts in which countries stood up for principles that the superpowers were shredding.“I understand the UK government’s inevitable pragmatism but at some point you have to stand up and say we have these differences over principle, and we are acquiring quite a list,” she said.“The UK faces a huge dilemma, as does Europe. It wants two big things from America. One is trade and the other is help on defence, including support for Ukraine. The prime minister does not want to jeopardise those two. We have seen in so many ways how the Trump administration, including the president, can react very, very strongly to small things that people say.”In seeking to preserve its autonomy and yet maintain the US special relationship, Maddox said the UK had to be willing to differ publicly, urgingKeir Starmerto make an explicit stand in the defence of the BBC, for instance.BBC seeks dismissal of $10bn Trump lawsuit over Panorama ‘fight like hell’ clipRead moreTrump has mounted a $10bn defamation lawsuit against the broadcaster, claiming it damaged his reputation by splicing together two sections of his address to a rally on 6 January 2021, which it is alleged gave the impression he encouraged supporters to storm the Capitol building in Washington DC.Maddox said: “Sometimes lines have to be drawn. Whatever you think of the BBC, the president of the US is launching a personal lawsuit which at the very least could impoverish and disrupt a citizen-funded national institution, which the prime minister needs explicitly to defend.”She added: “US efforts to challenge UK laws governing social media appear to equate US interests with those of the US tech giants.” She said not enough was “made of the monetisation of the presidency, a threat to the reputation of US institutions”.Maddox also urged Starmer ahead of his imminent visit to China to take a tougher stance. She did not challenge China’s plans for a new embassy at Royal Mint close to the City of London – a plan that still requires government planning consent – but she pressed Starmer to question why China needed such a large diplomatic representation in the UK.She also said the imminent decision on whether to give permission forChina to provide technology for UK wind turbineswas being underplayed since it would provide China with an off switch and an enormous amount of information about UK energy consumption. She also urged Labour to make decisions about the dependence on Chinese students to finance British universities.Maddox argued that as international law and global order unravelled, there was a need to look for regional blocs to step forward as sources of order. Lots of countries were going to have to spend more in their own self-interest on their defence, and to work out quite quickly where they could find fellow travellers. “This is not a recipe for saying the rest of the world can bypass the US. It’s about finding lots of ‘coalitions of the willing’ built around common interests,” she said.She warned: “China is certain to try to offer to fill the vacuum created by Trump, as well as appropriate the precedent set in Venezuela. It will say ‘we want global governance, the rule of law and for the United Nations to work’. It will make a play for the high moral ground, but it does not regard Taiwan as an issue of international law since this is an internal issue.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyThinktanksKeir StarmerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

No more paying lip service to the potential of the north, but backing it to the hilt.”Government officials said that plans for how local contributions would be funded were being developed but could include business rates, tourist taxes or borrowing against future revenues.Doubt remains over a key demand of Andy Burnham, theGreater Manchestermayor, for an underground station at Manchester Piccadilly. Burnham has argued it is essential to allow through trains and improve capacity and to build a new line without years of disruption and demolition in the city centre.The cost difference between an underground and overground Piccadilly is thought to run into several billion pounds.Burnham’s support for the plans had been in doubt, and he hinted at his frustration with the process earlier on Tuesday. Speaking at an Institute for Government event, the Labour mayor complained of having to “fight endlessly” in an “attritional battle” with Whitehall departments, accusing them of resisting devolution.However, he welcomed the news as “a significant step forward”, describing it as a “an ambitious vision for the north, firm commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail and an openness to an underground station in Manchester city centre”.He said Manchester would “work at pace” to prove the case for an underground station, as well as detailed designs for the line to Liverpool.Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, welcomed what he called “a genuinely strategic approach … not another empty slogan or back of a fag packet plan but real investment, delivered in a proper partnership with local leaders”.Manchester airport, the UK’s biggest outside London, will have a new station on the line. Ken O’Toole, the airport’s managing director, said it was a “long overdue step towards the creation of a highly productive and internationally competitive northern growth corridor”.Yorkshire may be the biggest immediate beneficiary from the announcements, with Bradford confirmed to get a new station as part of the first stage of upgrades across the Pennines.In a joint statement, the three Yorkshire mayors, Oliver Coppard, Tracy Brabin and David Skaith, said there was now “a clear national focus on connecting Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and York with a frequent, electrified service”.Development work will also be taken forward on reopening the Leamside Line, a 21-mile route in County Durham, which was closed in 1964.Henri Murison, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the package would “enable a single labour market more like that of London and the south-east … The potential of the north will be unlocked, giving us better-paid jobs and new homes.”However, it is understood that talks between Whitehall and some mayors went right to the wire, with Burnham said to have been reluctant to endorse the proposals as recently as Friday.Another mayoral source said months of negotiations between Whitehall and northern leaders had led to a point where most mayors were happy: “The starting point for this was all wrong. We were concerned that it had to be a significantly new network and what some of the officials – not the politicians – have been advised was just the cheapest. We’ve ended up with something that’s workable.”Explore more on these topicsInfrastructureRail industryTransport policyNorth of EnglandRail transportKeir StarmerTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

My perception is that if you don’t deal with anti-Israeli hatred, you leave wriggle room for those who indulge in antisemitism but formally disavow it. Once hatred to Israelis is tolerated then it is carried around like a flame.”Hall said there was a “palpable” national security risk when police prioritised maintaining public order over applying the law, particularly during pro-Palestinian protests where chants such as “death to the IDF” or “globalise the intifada” went unchallenged.The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, a group of lawyers and politicians who comment on human rights, disputed Hall’s argument.Its head of public affairs and communications, Jonathan Purcell, said: “Hall’s conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism is deeply problematic, a well-trodden line that erases the existence of the many anti-Zionist Jewish people at pro-Palestine marches.“If he is truly alarmed about sectarian calls for violence, he would be well advised to also concern himself with the genocidal comments of Israeli officials, and our government’s relationship with such a rogue state.”Hall, who backed listing Palestine Action as a proscribed terrorist group, said in his speech that – for some people – any signs of Israeli life were “illegitimate”.He added: “There have been protests against Israeli-owned restaurants and bakeries in London and Australia and the United States. In Australia, a restaurant with Israeli ownership was attacked by protesters shouting ‘Death to the IDF’.“Israelis are a group like any other whose individual members, like members of any other group, deserve protection. We have lost our collective senses if, as a society, we permit the demonising of holders of any nationality who live in our tolerant and open society.”Asked who should be held responsible for failing to protect Israelis, Hall replied: “Ultimately, police have got to be responsible for the safety of their citizens. And I include expressly within that Israeli citizens as well as Jews living among them.”He told an audience at the right-leaning thinktank that he had “lost count” of the times that hatred against Israelis had been “stirred up” on UK streets.He also questioned why West Midlands police appeared to have been aware of intelligence that “Islamists” were preparing to attack fans ofMaccabi Tel Avivin November but failed to enforce the law.“If, according to intelligence held by the West Midlands police, local Islamists were arming themselves and preparing to seek out and attack fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv, that can only have been because of their hatred to Israelis. The local Islamists were not hostile because of football, they were hostile because of nationality,” he said.Ministers have refused to be drawn on the future of Craig Guildford, the West Midlands chief constable, overthe ban on Israeli football fanswatching their team in Birmingham.An independent report commissioned by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, into the ban is expected this week. The decision to bar Maccabi fans from attending the match againstAston Villawas taken for safety reasons, according to the force.Guildforddefended his officersin an appearance before the Commons home affairs committee and said there had been “no conspiracy” to stop Israeli fans.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, has defended his force’s handling of a demonstration outside an Israeli-owned restaurant in Notting Hill. Dozens of protesters, calling themselves the “International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network” gathered outside Miznon on Friday.Speaking on LBC on Monday, Rowley said: “I do take very seriously how Jews in London feel and how the behaviour of protesters influences that. We are taking those issues very, very seriously.”Prof David Feldman, director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Study ofAntisemitism, said: “There are reasons why Israel’s actions excite condemnation and anger. It is a sad fact that sometimes protest slips into antisemitism and occasionally targets individual Israelis living in this country. But any suggestion that these failings characterise anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel in general is wide of the mark.”He added: “Jonathan Hall’s support for liberal principles and for individual not collective punishment is welcome. But by conflating Islamic State with street demonstrations in support of Palestinian rights, he does, in fact, target a collectivity and not individuals. He departs from the very principles he wants to uphold.”Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismMaccabi Tel AvivIsraelPoliceAston VillanewsShareReuse this content"

The findings were published inthe Lancet.ITV agrees to invest £3m in fitness app created by Joe WicksRead moreThe authors stressed that while the findings should not be used as personal advice, such as specific exercise recommendations for individuals, they showed the potentially vast benefits for populations as a whole.Prof Aiden Doherty, of the Nuffield Department of PopulationHealthat the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, said the “excellent” analysis was “a leap forward” from existing evidence.“While this might seem like yet another ‘more physical activity is good for you’ study, the authors have added important new details,” he said.“This paper indicates that up to 10% of all premature deaths might be prevented if everyone were to make small and realistic increases to their moderate-intensity physical activity of five minutes a day. Reducing sedentary time by 30 minutes a day would likely result in a smaller, but still meaningful, number of averted deaths.”Daniel Bailey, a reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, who was not involved in the study, said the “really promising” finding was that just five more minutes a day of moderate-intensity physical activity could save lives. “This should be feasible for most people, even those who only do very small amounts of physical activity already.“Moderate activities are those what make us breathe a bit heavier and feel warmer. So simple daily activities like a brisk walk, housework or gardening will do the trick. And if we want to reduce sitting by 30 minutes a day, this can be swapped for light activities like pottering around the house or a slow walk.”Meanwhile, a second study,published in the eClinicalMedicine journal, found that when combined, small improvements in sleep, physical activity, and diet were linked with a longer life.For example, an extra five minutes of sleep, two minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity – such as brisk walking or taking the stairs – and an additional half a serving of vegetables a day could lead to an extra year of life for those with the worst sleep, physical activity, and dietary habits.Experts led by the University of Sydney gathered information on the levels of activity, diet and sleep of almost 60,000 people taking part in the UK Biobank study.Compared with people with the worst sleep, physical activity and dietary habits, the study suggested that the optimal combination of these behaviours – seven to eight hours of sleep per day, more than 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day and a healthy diet – was associated with living almost a decade longer.Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessWalkingHealth & wellbeingNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Daytime temperatures have dropped to –12C (10F) and as low as -19C at night.While the heat in her block has come back on, like many she must cope with the fact that, despite her having bought storage batteries, all her appliances, including her cooker and the water pump for her block, rely on electricity.“Everything in the apartment is electric. No electricity means no water and I can’t cook. And for the first 24 hours after the attack there was no heating. All of us were in our thermal underwear, ski clothes, and then more clothes on top of that, and then all sleeping in the same bed,” she said.“My son is 11 and he stayed calm, but my daughter is just four and she was cold even then.”While there have been heavier strikes on Kyiv in the almost four years of war since the full-scale Russian invasion, the impact of the 9 January raid on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has rivalled the dark days of the early weeks of the war, when Russian tanks were trying to force their way into the capital.The intention is clear to all. Following a fresh wave of Russian attacks on Monday night, Ukrenergo, the country’s state-owned grid operator, said Moscow’s aim was to “disconnect the city”.View image in fullscreenOleg Voronets, a volunteer, is given hot soup at an emergency rescue warming point in the Kharkivske Shose area of Kyiv on the left bank of the Dnipro river.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Guardian“The Russians are trying to disconnect the city and force people to move outside [Kyiv],” Vitalii Zaichenko, the chief executive of Ukrenergo, told the Kyiv Independent, saying substations had been hit overnight and 70% of Kyiv was without electricity.Russia’s increased focus on attacking energy infrastructure has led to major blackouts in recent weeks in Odesa, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, compounded both by the cold and an increasing shortage of spare parts as repairs mount from the attacks.Even in areas of the capital with more reliable electricity supply, rolling blackouts are in evidence in darkened streets, in cafes and in supermarkets, where escalators and conveyor belts are turned off when the power goes out. Some supermarketsannounced plans on Tuesday for temporary closures.Elsewhere in the worst-hit neighbourhoods of Kyiv, where, days later, power has yet to come anywhere close to reliable, emergency services have erected warming tents in the snow, with pumped heating and a hot food station serving drinks and stew.Amid a cluster of tower blocks on Kharkivske Shoshe on Kyiv’s left bank, Alla Polischuk was in one of the tents with her teenage daughter Iryna, who had just finished online classes while her school is closed.View image in fullscreenAlla Polischuk and her daughter Iryna arrived at the emergency warming point after their flat had been without power for three days.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Guardian“We just came in here to warm up,” said Polischuk. “We’ve had no electricity for three days in a row. In some places it comes on for a few minutes but then it goes again.“But the worst thing is the cold, even when we dress in all our clothes and under blankets. It doesn’t matter how much you dress, you can still feel it on your skin. We live in an old building so it gets cold very quickly.”Some in her building, she added, took the advice of the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, to leave the city and go to dachas or relatives in the country.“I’m afraid they are trying to freeze us,” she said. “They waited for this cold snap. They had a large raid on the energy infrastructure in November but the temperature was 8C. I’m worried now that they will strike again now it’s so cold.”Outside the Coffee and Friends cafe in another area of the left bank, Oleksandr Matienko, a building manager, was trying to help the owner fix a failed generator that had forced the cafe to shut down.View image in fullscreenPeople charge their phones and warm themselves in heating tents set up by emergency services.Photograph: Andriy Dubchak/Frontliner/Getty ImagesMatienko’s building was well organised. In his office was a large inverter and a bank of 12 large batteries. But with no supply for five hours when the Guardian visited, a third of the batteries had been drained.“We are fortunate,” Matienko said, “but the building next door doesn’t have the same equipment and it is freezing cold in their apartments. I tell the residents here, please be mindful how you use your electricity because everyone wants to start charging and doing laundry when the power does come on and it strains the supply.”Ukraine war briefing: Oreshnik missile sparks anger at UN security councilRead moreAcross the road from his office is school 329. While online lessons are continuing it has been shut since the latest strikes, with temperatures inside the building hovering around 10C. Housing an air raid shelter for the local community, it has also been designated as a warming centre where residents can visit and borrow LED lighting among other emergency supplies.1:32People feel like the 'Russians are trying to freeze them': Guardian reporter in Kyiv – videoOn the night of 9 January a Russian missile hit the apartment block 100 metres from where deputy director Valentina Verteletska lives, killing a mother and her daughter.“I think the Russians want to break us. There is nothing to be done so we need to survive these kinds of problems. They want to make Ukrainians angry and unhappy. They think this will make us go out on the streets and protest but that won’t happen,” she said.“And this makes us tougher and more determined. War doesn’t make people bad or good but it amplifies who you are are. It allows people to show who they are inside and we have seen a lot of volunteering to help their neighbours.”“You can see with your own eyes what is going on,” said Matienko. “They are trying to kill us. They can’t win any other way. So they are willing to do anything to destroy Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsKyivUkraine in depthUkraineRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anyone would think we lived in unstable times with growing public distrust of governments.So who is the all-time top small-screen spook? We’ve rated the Top 20. Just make sure you destroy this list after reading …20Napoleon Solo(The Man from UNCLE, 1964-1968)View image in fullscreenSomehow they kept a straight face … Robert Vaughn with David McCallum in The Man from UNCLE.Photograph: NBC/AllstarSuavely played by Robert Vaughn, this gadget-wielding Cary Grant-alike was the small screen’s answer to 007 – partly because Bond creator Ian Fleming was a consultant on the NBC series. Napoleon “no relation to Han” Solo and his stoic Russian sidekick Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) worked for the United Network Command for Law & Enforcement, foiling the evil THRUSH (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables & the Subjugation of Humanity) and its dastardly plans for world domination. Somehow they kept straight faces amid all the absurd acronyms.19Tamar Rabinyan(Tehran, 2020-present)View image in fullscreenA-list oomph … Niv Sultan in Tehran.Photograph: Apple TV+Once you’re in, there’s no way out. With alumni of the equally ace Fauda on its writing team, this breathlessly tense espionage thriller became the first Israeli series to win an Emmy. It follows computer hacker Tamar (Niv Sultan) whose first field mission for the Mossad takes her to Iran to destabilise a nuclear reactor. It’s twisty and timely as the coolly charismatic Tamar fights to escape from behind enemy lines. Streaming on Apple TV, it added A-list oomph with Glenn Close in season two and Hugh Laurie in the third.18Simon Templar(The Saint, 1962-1969)View image in fullscreenI can see your halo! … Roger Moore in The Saint.Photograph: ITC/AllstarEyebrow-archingRoger Moorelimbered up for his later stint on Her Majesty’s Secret Service with this ITV caper. As Simon Templar, he was a Robin Hood-style maverick who worked for whichever side of the law served the greater good. Once per episode, an animated halo would appear above Templar’s head as he broke the fourth wall. Banging theme tune, too.17Hanna(Hanna, 2019-2021)View image in fullscreenWhat a super-soldier … Esmé Creed-Miles in Hanna.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe 2011 film, starring Saoirse Ronan as a teen assassin raised off the grid by her spy father Eric Bana, was solid enough. The Prime series, created by The Night Manager’s David Farr, is even better. Esmé Creed-Miles stars as the prodigious super-soldier, who evades her CIA pursuers to unearth the truth about the secret government programme from which she was rescued as a baby.16Steve Austin(The Six Million Dollar Man, 1973-1978)“We can rebuild him. We have the technology.” After being near fatally injured when a Nasa test flight crashed, astronaut Steve Austin (Lee Majors) was reconstructed by scientists with $6m worth of bionic implants. Now with superhuman strength, speed and vision, he became the ultimate half-cyborg secret agent. Austin’s old flame, tennis player Jaime Sommers (Lindsay Wagner), soon got her own spin-off, The Bionic Woman. Both became firm playground favourites, despite the shonky sound effects.15David Callan(Callan, 1967-1972)This hard-boiled gloomfest was an antidote to the camp spy romps of its day. It followed the work of a shady secret service branch called “Section” as its haunted assassin Callan (Edward Woodward) repelled internal security threats by torturing and terminating hostiles. He loathed his posh bosses, all codenamed “Hunter”, and had a love-hate bond with malodorous informant “Lonely”. Woodward later riffed on his macintosh-clad vigilante persona in schlocky US action series The Equalizer.14Guillaume Debailly(The Bureau, 2015-2020)View image in fullscreenFrench flair … Mathieu Kassovitz in The Bureau.Photograph: Album/AlamyBringing a touch of French flair to our list is the charismatically troubled agent codenamed “Malotru” (Lout) from this suspenseful Canal+ series. After six years undercover in Syria, moody hero Guillaume (Mathieu Kassovitz) returns to Le Bureau des Légendes in Paris, where he struggles to readjust to a normal life – not least when his lover from Damascus arrives to renew their affair. Based on real accounts by former spies, it’s coolly captivating and all too credible. In the English-language remake, The Agency, produced by George Clooney, the equivalent role was played by Michael Fassbender.13Eve Polastri(Killing Eve, 2018-2022)View image in fullscreenA bona fide cultural phenomenon … Sandra Oh (right) with Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: David Emery/BBC AmericaShe inevitably suffered by comparison with Jodie Comer’s designer-frocked assassin Villanelle but Sandra Oh was still superb as a bored MI5 analyst who becomes obsessed with catching the psychopathic gun-for-hire. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s intoxicating thriller, adapted from Luke Jennings’ novellas, became a bona fide cultural phenomenon, even if it suffered diminishing returns in later seasons.12John Steed(The Avengers, 1961-1969)View image in fullscreenKitsch cult classic … Patrick Macnee with Diana Rigg in The Avengers.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyLike the semi-serious template for Austin Powers, this knowing caper was set against the backdrop of swinging 60s London. Battling super-villainy were debonair “MI5½” agent John Steed (Patrick Macnee), with his bowler hat and brolly, alongside his kickass female partners – most memorably Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman). Both later became Bond girls. All arch dialogue, jazzy soundtrack and Pierre Cardin costumes, it’s a kitsch cult classic. “Mrs Peel, we’re needed …”11Martin Rauch(Deutschland 83, 2015-2020)View image in fullscreenSlinky thrills … Jonas Nay in Deutschland 83.Photograph: Conny KleinThis cold war saga became the first German-language series to air on a US network and built a devoted UK fanbase on Channel 4. East German border guard Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay) was sent through the iron curtain as an undercover agent to steal military secrets for the Stasi. Rich in period detail and with a pulsating synth-pop soundtrack, it mixed slinky thrills with endearing coming-of-age drama.10Sydney Bristow(Alias, 2001-2006)View image in fullscreenSo good she recruited for the real CIA … Jennifer Garner in Alias.Photograph: Norman Jean Roy/Touchstone TelevisionShowrunner JJ Abrams’ breakout hit was this zippy thriller about student turned spook Sydney (Jennifer Garner), a double agent working against the malevolent network known as SD-6. Fierce fights, whizzy tradecraft and head-spinning conspiracies were lent emotional resonance by Syd’s damaged relationship with her spymaster father, Jack (Victor Garber). Across five seasons, Garner became so synonymous with her character that she starred in real CIA recruitment videos.9Jonathan Pine(The Night Manager, 2016-present)View image in fullscreenHiddlebum strikes back! … Tom Hiddleston with Camila Morrone in The Night Manager.Photograph: BBC/Ink Factory/Des WillieHe runs away from explosions! He has steamy threesomes! He changes his name and bares his bottom a lot! The lavishly produced Le Carré adaptation updated its setting to the Arab spring, where ex-soldier Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) staffed the front desk at a swish Cairo hotel – until tapped up by Olivia Colman’s intelligence officer to bring down arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”. The equally slick sequel, now airing on BBC One, takes our reluctant secret agent to Colombia. Hiddleston remains a compelling blend of Etonian charm and shape-shifting amorality.8Harry Pearce(Spooks, 2002-2011)When counter-terrorism section chief Sir Harry (Peter Firth) slipped on his black leather gloves, you knew things were about to get deadly. The BBC’s pacy procedural (tagline “MI5, not 9 to 5”) found hot young operatives foiling post-9/11 threats, while juggling their duplicitous private lives. There was a revolving security door at Thames House for the field agents. Hard-bitten Harry was the sole constant across 10 series. Would he get his well-deserved happy ending with GCHQ analyst Ruth (Nicola Walker)? I’m welling up just thinking about it *dabs eyes with leather gloves*.7Elizabeth Jennings(The Americans, 2013-2018)View image in fullscreenFighting the cold war, one bad rug at a time … Keri Russell in The Americans.Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/ITVOn the suburban surface, Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) was a wholesome travel agent in 1980s Washington DC. In reality, she was a KGB sleeper agent named Nadezhda who sold package holidays by day but by night donned a sequence of ropey disguises to gather intel for Mother Russia. She pips her husband, Philip, AKA Mischa (Matthew Rhys), to our countdown because while he was plagued by conscience and a growing fondness for their adopted homeland, she remained a stone cold-killer who fought the cold war, one bad wig at a time.6Jack Bauer(24, 2001-2014)Dammit, Chloe, put me higher up the list! With each season documenting “the longest day in the life” of maverick counter-terrorism agent Jack (Kiefer Sutherland), this groundbreaking thrill ride deployed split screen, copious cliffhangers and a beeping digital clock to crank up the real-time tension. As badass Bauer raced to save the world, he was happy to wield hacksaws, axes, screwdrivers, pens, wet towels and other improvised torture implements to serve his country. We just wished he’d take a bathroom break occasionally. No wonder he was so cross.5Number Six(The Prisoner, 1967-1968)View image in fullscreenBe seeing you … Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesHe’s not a number, he’s a free man. He has also crept covertly into our top five. The nameless British intelligence agent (played by series co-creator Patrick McGoohan) tried to quit his highly classified government position – only to be gassed, kidnapped and wake up imprisoned in an idyllic coastal village. Our hero waged a battle of wits against his mysterious captors in this 1960s counter-cultural take on the spy genre. With its Kafka-esque surrealism and sinister Portmeirion setting, The Prisoner aired just 17 episodes but exerts an enduring influence on pop culture.

Carrie’s bipolar disorder became her superpower – at least when she was taking her meds – enabling hyper-focus, tireless dedication and obsessive attention to detail. Initially she waged a one-woman campaign against Damian Lewis’s war hero turned al-Qaida asset. Later seasons saw her presciently fighting such evils as fake news, Russian electoral interference and terror attacks on European cities.3Danger Mouse(1981-1992, 2015-2019)View image in fullscreenWho needs James Bond? … Danger Mouse.Photograph: Fremantle Media/Shutterstock“He’s the greatest, he’s fantastic / Wherever there is danger, he’ll be there.” Who needs James Bond when you could have a crime-fighting, wise-cracking rodent who wears an eyepatch and lives in a Mayfair postbox? “The white wonder” – voiced by David Jason in the 80s ITV original and Alexander Armstrong in the CBBC reboot – is accompanied by bumbling hamster sidekick Penfold as he battles baddies led by wheezing toad Baron Silas von Greenback. DM has a flying car, wears inflatable dangertrunks, practises the ancient martial art of kung moggy and is so top secret that his codename has a codename. Good grief, chief.2George Smiley(Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy/Smiley’s People, 1979/1982)View image in fullscreen‘The cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin’ … Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyForget Obi-Wan Kenobi. Sir Alec Guinness delivered his definitive late-career performance as MI6 veteran George Smiley, summoned out of retirement and brought back to “the Circus” to root out a Soviet mole. The classic BBC adaptation of John le Carré’s landmark novel was intricately structured as the cerebral spymaster unmasked the traitor at the heart of the secret service. Blessed with “the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin”, Smiley sifted through paperwork and politely probed sources over pots of tea. Le Carré hailed Guinness “a genius” for bringing him to such mesmeric life, citing the series as his favourite screen version of his work. In the 2011 film remake, Smiley was played by Gary Oldman. Talking of whom …1Jackson Lamb(Slow Horses, 2022-present)View image in fullscreenThe underdogs’ champion! … Gary Oldman with Kristin Scott Thomas in Slow Horses.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFarting and arse-scratching his way to the top of our chart is the underdogs’ champion. Adapted from Mick Herron’s brilliant novels, the Apple TV hit sees jaded “joe” Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) presiding over a motley crew of MI5 outcasts, exiled to the grotty outpost of Slough House. Rude, crude and witheringly cynical, his scabrous management style isn’t what you’d call touchy-feely. Typical bon mots include “I’ve got haemorrhoids that are more fucking use than you” or “Bringing you up to speed is like trying to explain Norway to a dog”. Yet time and again, Lamb outwits his so-called superiors and proves that his disgraced rejects are more capable of keeping Britain safe than the grunts from Regent’s Park. He’s a potty-mouthed, chain-smoking, whisky-swigging, vindaloo-scoffing slob but somehow utterly lovable.

The Andy Warhol portraits that complement this exhibition, without actually being part of it, brutally catch his gaunt, ravaged face in the glare of a photo flash under the hat he wore to hide burns sustained in a plane crash while serving in the Luftwaffe. The most haunting portrait turns Beuys into a spectral negative image, all darkness and shadow, his eyes wounded, guilty, lost. This was in the 1970s when Beuys was a charismatic one-man artistic revolution, inspiring young Germans to plant trees, lecturing about flows of ecological and human energy – and, in breathtaking performances, speaking to a dead hare or spending a week locked in a cage with a coyote.All that remains today of those actions, protests and performances are posters, preserved scrawls on blackboards and mesmerising videos. Yet the moment Beuys disappeared – he died in 1986 – his solid, material sculptures took over. He believed passionately in flow and flux, promoting an animist vision of humanity and the cosmos. When he stopped talking and acting, entropy gripped his art, making it a static, slumped set of dead objects. And all the greater for it.Who would want to take a bath in this? The sculpture at the heart of this exhibition, Bathtub, is a massive steampunk metal tank with protruding pipes and valves, the inside rumpled and mottled like human flesh, the entire grotesque structure resting on a giant mammoth tooth. Cast from a design Beuys tinkered with from 1961 to near the end of his life, Bathtub is a sinister, unforgettable work, immersing you not in hot water but in the black bile of modern history, its pipes connected to the fetid sewer of the 20th century’s worst horrors.View image in fullscreenWho would want to take a bath in this? … Badewanne (Bathtub), 1961-85, cast 1987, Joseph Beuys.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockBeuys enchants and sickens you simultaneously. This excellent show celebrates him at his most Wagnerian: an unabashed mythmaker, reviving ancient Germanic lore. For who would use such an epic bathtub? Brunhilde of course. The exhibition is called Bathtub for a Heroine, in case we miss that.Meanwhile, his 1949 sculpture Lead Woman imitates the wild anatomies of the Venus of Willendorf and other Palaeolithic sculptures fromGermany, Austria and central Europe. You can see why an artist searching for German renewal after 1945 might turn the clock back 30,000 years. In the stone age, from which the “Venus” figures that inspired Beuys come, he can imagine a prelapsarian national mythology. His little nude sculpture with its massive hips embodies a Wagnerian cult of mythic women that’s been freed from Wagner’s sins. In dreamy watercolours like Female Figure (1954) and Animal Woman (1949), Beuys redeems the Rhinemaidens.The obsession with prehistory reaches a screaming climax in his 1961 work Mammoth Tooth, Framed, consisting of a real tooth from an extinct mammoth, ivory and grey, ridged and furrowed, supporting a small copper bathtub. It’s a maquette for the giant bath at the heart of the show. Perhaps this ancient tooth from a beast that roamed Germany before Germany existed can purify the bath and whoever bathes in it.View image in fullscreenJoseph Beuys, Mammutzahn eingefaßt (Mammoth Tooth, Framed), 1961.Photograph: Ulrich Ghezzi/© Estate of Joseph Beuys / DACS, London 2025. Courtesy Thaddaeus Ropac gallery, LondonYet, walking around Bathtub, I see no escape from history. Far from a balm of forgetting, it looks like a coffin for a Valkyrie, jagged and ugly with memory. The horrible pipes jutting from it seem to plumb into the machinery of mass murder just as surely as the rusty rails in his great installation Tramstop lead to Auschwitz.Beuys always had one foot in the grave. As time goes by, his utopian hopes are eclipsed by the immeasurable truths that weigh down his art. This blast of him is a reminder of the joyous yet cursed creativity of an artist who literally saved his country’s culture, giving it access to myths that might have been forever internally censored, laying the tramlines for today’s great German artists Georg Baselitz andAnselm Kieferand showing the way to any young artist who wants to discover the poetry of material objects. It is also, be warned, a bath in history’s acid.AtThaddaeus Ropac Gallery, London, until 21 March.Explore more on these topicsArt and designJoseph BeuysSculptureGermanyExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What does that say about men?The explosive popularity of the gay hockey TV drama reveals women’s desire for sex and romance without violence or hierarchyJulia Carrie WongTue 13 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 17.06 ESTShareThe first time gay hockey romance crossed Mary’s radar, she was warned off it. A 64-year-old non-profit executive from Toronto, Mary recalled mentioning the Canadian author Rachel Reid’s Game Changers series to her son, a twentysomething queer writer and fellow hockey obsessive, a few years ago.“I said: ‘Have you heard of these books?’ and he said: ‘Yeah.’ I said: ‘Should I read these books?’ And he said: ‘No. They’re not for you.’”Mary took her son at his word; after all, she considers herself “basically a cynic”, hasn’t cracked a romance novel since she threw a Danielle Steel book across the room in disgust about 40 years ago, and declares that she would have to be “hogtied” to watch a Hallmark Christmas movie. “I’m divorced. I’m old. I’ve had men in my life and I’ve had romance in my life,” she said. “I watch TV and I’m just like, it doesn’t happen like that. No.”Heated Rivalry: this horny gay ice hockey drama has everyone talking – but is it any good?Read moreBut when gay hockey romance entered the cultural zeitgeist with a vengeance late last year, thanks to the steamy television adaptation of Reid’s Heated Rivalry by the Canadian streamer Crave, Mary, who asked to be identified only by her first name, discovered that a sexually explicit love story about two men was “for her” after all.“I admit I may have rewatched it more than once,” she said. “It’s super sexy. They’re fabulous to look at. There’s a huge amount of consent. I’d really like to get that back in my life – that feeling of ‘I can’t keep my hands off you.’”Straight women, queer women, cisgender women, trans women; young and old, single and coupled, Canadian, American and increasingly every other nationality – they’re all going feral for the love story between Shane and Ilya, two closeted professional hockey players on rival teams whose sexual chemistry sustains them for a decade as they learn to open their hearts and minds to the possibility of love.View image in fullscreenIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander face off on the ice in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/APBut what does it say about gender relations in 2026 that so many women are fantasizing about gay smut? The fervent popularity of Heated Rivalry suggests that for many, the realromantasyis not sex and romance with dragons and fairies, but sex and romance without misogyny and gendered hierarchy. If the only way to get that in today’s media environment is through sex and romance without any women, they’ll take it.The women who love men who love menLillian King is the last person anyone would expect to enjoy a TV show that kicks things off with a locker room masturbation qua seduction scene and builds toward scenes of remarkably tender frottage. A writer for the NPR quiz show Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me, King is 30 years old, straight, engaged and decidedly “sex negative”, at least when it comes to media. She’s “squeamish” about onscreen kissing and prefers Anna Karenina’s approach to representing sex scenes: “Tolstoy just does ‘dot, dot, dot’ and I think that’s right,” she said. “When my fiance told me that Timothée Chalamet goes down on Gwyneth Paltrow inthe ping-pong movie, I was like, ‘I don’t need to see that.’”But she decided to check out Heated Rivalry when she learned, via viral TikToks, that it featured a song by the Canadian indie band Wolf Parade. She figured she could put it on in the background while she did laundry. Instead, she “inhaled the first three episodes” and ended up being late to meet a friend. “I couldn’t let it go. I just was so in.”The show seems to go out of its way to say that it’s very masculine to be gay … It’s a vision of a non-toxic but also non-anxious masculinityAdrian DaubKing sounds amused but untroubled by her newfound appreciation for gay smut. “There was a moment where I was like, ‘Wait, why is this hot?’” she said. “Well, of course it’s hot. If I find one hot guy attractive, when there’s two of them it’s just like, ‘Oh, sick.’”The fact that some women enjoy watching men have sex with each other on screen is not exactly new – PornHubclaimsthat nearly half of the people watching gay porn on its platform are women – but the Heated Rivalry fandom may be the first truly mainstream example of the phenomenon in North America. As the show’s audience has grown, it has tilted even more heavily female, according to HBO figures reported by theNew York Times.TikTok and Instagram are awash with videos of female fans filming their tearful reactions to The Cottage (IYKYK) or expressing their utter devastation at the bleak contrast between their app-blighted dating lives and Shane and Ilya’s delicate yearning.Lesbianandwomen’s sports barsare holding marathon screenings of all six episodes; one bar’s tagline for its event reads: “Sapphics love a slow burn.” Late-night host Jimmy Falloncomparedthe screaming crowd that gathered to watch him interview Hudson Williams, who plays Shane, last week to the kind of enthusiasm he’s seen for BTS and Harry Styles.View image in fullscreenThe success of Heated Rivalry has turned its leads, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, into breakout stars who presented at the Golden Globe awards on Sunday.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesI experienced that fervor when I posted a call-out for women who enjoyed Heated Rivalry on social media. Never in my career have I received so many responses, so quickly. Some were veterans of the men loving men (MLM) romance genre. Others were entirely new to the idea that they could find depictions of gay sex appealing. Many revealed that they had already watched the series multiple times, that they had bought and read the rest of Reid’s Game Changers series (six books in total), or that they were now planning to read nothing but MLM. A lesbian said that Heated Rivalry had “some of the all-time best kisses on TV”. A trans woman told me that, after so many people had put pressure on her to “just” be a gay man when she transitioned, she was hesitant to watch the show; despite that trepidation, she loved the romance and the characters – and has downloaded all the audiobooks.Some even suggested that the gay and bisexual men of Heated Rivalry had convinced them to give straight men another chance. “I’ve been single for forever and off the dating apps since August, but I’m ready to get back out there again,” said Marie Stone, a 35-year-old social media manager from Philadelphia who primarily dates men. After watching the series “about 15 times”, she feels that her brain has been “rewired – for the better”. “I’m open to dating and love again,” she said. “Thanks, Canada.”Jacob Tierney, the Canadian showrunner who wrote, directed and produced the series, was aware that his show’s chance of gaining widespread popularity rested on a demographic that simply outnumbers gay men.“I always said: ‘Once you film this, gay men will watch it, but we’ll watch anything with gay men in it,’” he toldTeen Vogue. (Much of the media campaign by the show’s stars and creators has centered on women’s outlets.) “We’re not wildly discerning in that way, and we’re starved for stories. But the secret fanbase of this is women, and that is a much bigger target than just queer people or queer men.”Heated Rivalry review – these physically perfect people have so much sex it’s tediousRead moreThe genre of gay romance stories written by and for women goes by a number of different names on the internet: MLM, MM, slash fiction, boy’s love (BL) andyaoiamong them. But women producing and enjoying gay erotica predates the internet.“There’s a whole tradition of women, usually lesbian women, writing classical era historical fiction with pretty heavy man-on-man themes,” said Adrian Daub, a professor of comparative literature and gender studies at Stanford University. Mid-century historical fiction writers Mary Renault and Marguerite Yourcenar wrote novels exploring homosexual relationships set in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, respectively, for an audience that was probably heavily female, Daub said.Daub draws a direct parallel between the assured masculinity of Heated Rivalry’s hockey players and those literary depictions of gay love. “The show seems to go out of its way to say that it’s very masculine to be gay, which is exactly why people like those classical romances, where homosexuality is a natural overflow of masculine energy,” he said. “It’s a vision of a sort of non-toxic but also non-anxious masculinity – masculinity that doesn’t require women to constantly affirm it.”There is a conscious effort to identify who leads, who yields, how care and vulnerability are expressed and that it can shift more fluidlyAnonymousClare Sears, a professor of sociology and sexuality studies at San Francisco State University, traces the roots of commercial MLM romance novels to fan fiction, which emerged in the 1970s and largely featured “fictional male pairings, most notably Kirk and Spock from Star Trek”. Same-sex relationships were not represented on TV, but there was often an erotic subtext to the relationships between two male characters that fans – most of them straight women – picked up on and ran with in self-published zines and slash fiction (or just “fic” for short).With the internet came an explosion of fan culture and the development of websites such as LiveJournal and Archive of Our Own (AO3), where slash fics continued to show a marked preference for gay male pairings.The cultural impact of fan fiction has been undeniable. Fifty Shades of Grey started life as a Twilight fan fiction, whilecertain Harry Potter fan ficshave eclipsed the original in parts of the fandom. Commercial MLM book publishing, of which the Game Changers series is just one example, evolved out of the online appetite for MM fan fiction. (Reid published aninitial draftof the first Game Changers novel as a Marvel fanfic, later swapping out Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes for the hockey captain and smoothie maker that started off the Game Changers series.)This history points to a clear provenance of MLM romance as a distinct genre. “Gay romance novels are written by gay men for gay men,” Sears said. “Whereas MLM romance novels, similar to slash fan fiction, are intentionally written by women for women, they tap into women’s fantasies, and they’re exclusively about men having sex with men.”View image in fullscreenFans of Heated Rivalry meet up in Montreal at the independent bookstore Joie de Livres on Sunday.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockWhether or not it’s problematic for women to read and write MLM is a debate that has been hashed out extensively in the online communities where such fics are shared, to the extent that theMM_RomanceBookssubreddit declared ablanket banon complaints about female authors and readers in 2021, arguing that they are reductive and unresolvable. Some peopleworrythat female authors are misrepresenting the gay experience and that female readers are objectifying or even feminizing gay men. In a recentTikTokabout Heated Rivalry, Griffin Maxwell Brooks, a gay, non-binary influencer, offered this attempt at detente: “When people are like, ‘Oh, they’re fetishizing gay men,’ I’m like, ‘Girl, if anything they’re fetishizing men who are not abusing women, and I think we can’t be mad at that.’”Perhaps the more interesting question iswhyso many women are fantasizing about gay sex at all. On the one hand, the answer to “why?” might as well be “why not?” Sears said. “Sexual fantasy is totally different from sexual identity. Many people enjoy fictional stories or fantasies that are really removed from who they are or what they want to do in real life.”Still, stories that cater to our desires can be illustrative of what those desires are – and that’s useful in a society that still prefers to tell women what they should want rather than listen to what they say. The “basic explanation” that scholars such asLucy Neville, a lecturer at the University of Southampton and author of Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys: Women and Gay Male Pornography and Erotica, have hit upon is, according to Sears: “Erotic stories that focus exclusively on men sidestep the kind of gendered power imbalances that structure intimacy between men and women, both in fiction and in real life.”Sundresses and rugged self-sufficiency: ‘tradwives’ tout a conservative American past ... that didn’t existRead moreAt a time oftrad wives, Trumpism, and more than a little scolding from a pundit class that women need to spend more time and energy attending to men’s loneliness, it can seem like heterosexuality itself is in a death spiral. Women are hyper-aware of the real world threat of sexual violence, of the expectation that they will make concessions to a male partner’s career, of the ongoing rollback of reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, and that sex and dating are often unsatisfying and disappointing.“Is having a boyfriend embarrassing now?” Vogue asked in a recentarticleabout women who are foregoing posting about their male partners on Instagram. Others are swearing off men altogether, a phenomenon known asheteropessimismorheterofatalism.So many of the major book-to-film franchises of the 21st century, such as Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey and Bridgerton, serve as exemplars of the kind of extreme but societally normalized gendered power imbalance (male vampire v female mortal; male billionaire v female mortal; male aristocrat v female mortal) that Heated Rivalry defies. (It might behoove those men who complain about the use of the phrase “toxic masculinity” to consider what women find so intoxicating about Shane and Ilya’s relationship, but I won’t hold my breath.)“This is our dream romance,” said Mary, who invoked a lifetime of dealing with sexism and inequality in the workplace – starting with her first job out of college, when she was paid less than men because she was expected to marry and quit working – to explain why Heated Rivalry felt so refreshing. “Number one: I wish I looked that good in the shower. Number two: that there was someone who was literally my equal.”This was a common theme among the women who reached out to me, some of whom had been seeking out MLM romance for years for this exact reason. “Without the default expectations, the power dynamics had to be negotiated more consciously,” said one woman. “In these romances there is a conscious effort to identify who leads, who yields, how care and vulnerability are expressed and that it can shift more fluidly.”View image in fullscreen‘You’re not having to think of yourself as an object of male power relations,’ professor Adrian Daub said of women engaging in MLM content.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/HBO MaxThe genre also creates avenues for women readers to play around with their own sexual and gender identities. “This kind of MLM romance offers a more complex and fluid viewing position, because you’re free to identify with either character or both characters,” said Sears. “Your identification isn’t predetermined by gender, so it opens up imaginative space for women to access more masculine parts of themselves or to fantasize about themselves in different sexual roles or scenarios.”Daub described the dynamic as “the opposite of the friction one experiences when one realizes, ‘oh, this isn’t made for me’ … It’s allowing a certain viewer, usually women, to engage in a male gaze without a woman being offered as its object. You’re not having to think of yourself as an object of male power relations.”It’s extra fun and escapist for me to watch a relationship that is hard to possibly project myself intoAnnie VoughtIn Heated Rivalry, nude male bodies are shot with a lingering and appreciative gaze, while women get to keep their clothes on. Though early episodes mimic the gendered dynamics that typify straight romance – the first two cast Ilya as the more experienced and emotionally withholding Russian top to Shane’s virginal and emotionally needy Asian Canadian bottom, while the third episode features a Cinderella tale of a star hockey player and the smoothie-serving cater waiter he falls for – the second half of the season subverts those paradigms comprehensively.It doesn’t hurt that Shane and Ilya are wealthy enough that almost all domestic labor is taken care of offscreen, presumably by well-compensated housekeepers, interior designers and stylists. When these characters cook for each other, the implications are strictly emotional.Many women spoke to me of the sense of freedom that Heated Rivalry and other MLM gave them to indulge in fantasy while shedding their personal experiences. “It’s seeing a romantic relationship where you don’t have to think about your own baggage and hurt,” said one woman.Womenstruggling with disability or chronic illness mentioned that MLM freed them from having to think about the differences between their own bodies and those of romance heroines.“It’s extra fun and escapist for me to watch a relationship that is hard to possibly project myself into,” said Annie Vought, a 34-year-old bisexual woman from Seattle. “There is zero room for me personally to be like, ‘Wish that was me.’ I’m just like, ‘Get it, boys!’”An escape from misogynyWhile for some women, the gender equality evinced in Heated Rivalry is aspirational, for others it’s a necessary escape.“The main reason I read MM is I just absolutely cannot stand reading or watching women suffer at the hands of men – in any way, big or small, any more,” said Dawn Bovasso, a 49-year-old queer woman from Boston.I have never found one novel – romance or other – where the woman is just treated well from the beginningDawn BovassoBovasso is a voracious reader – getting through 250 to 350 books a year, she estimates – but she hit a limit on fictional depictions of female characters when she read Fourth Wing, a hugely popular romantasy novel published in 2023. Despite the novel featuring a “strong female lead who is smart, fierce and brave”, Bovasso said, the plot of the book involves a lot of emotional abuse, disrespect and poor treatment.“I have never found one novel – romance or other – where the woman is just treated well from the beginning,” she said. Even lesbian romances almost always include “women being treated with disdain and trauma when they’re at work and when they’re talking to their families and when they’re moving through life”, she said.The constant reminder of misogyny and inequality makes it impossible for her to relax and enjoy a story. That’s not a problem with MLM in general and Heated Rivalry in particular, Bovasso said. “The women who are in it are all treated with respect. The men do their own emotional labor. It’s not on us to fix, defend ourselves, or worry. We, as women, can just watch this and relax.” She now reads almost exclusively MM and encourages other women to do so as well: “I realized how much better these were for our psyche and our wellbeing.”View image in fullscreenIn MLM stories, ‘the women who are in it are all treated with respect. The men do their own emotional labor,’ said Dawn Bovasso, a queer woman and avid reader.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/SkyThe sharp contrast between this imaginary space free of gendered hierarchy and the attempts by the Maga movement to capitalize on the backlash to the #MeToo movement to reinforce female subservience offer a meaningful context for Heated Rivalry’s runaway success.Maya, a 30-year-old bisexual lawyer in Seattle, switched from reading literary fiction to romance novels at the beginning of the second Trump administration, when she was “very, very keenly aware of the degree to which the judiciary was being dismantled and the rule of law was being attacked”. She started usingRomance.io, a website where readers rank and rate books by their level of smuttiness; by March 2025, she had read “easily” 40 gay hockey romances.Romantasy, Bridgerton, audio porn apps: it’s a great time for horny ladiesRead moreMaya appreciates the “subtle suspensions of patriarchy” that occur in MLM romance. “In classic male-female romance, women are often the ‘weak’ partner,” she said, while MLM romances more typically depict actual equality between partners. “It’s catching up with what women can genuinely expect – or should expect, or should demand – from our relationships, which is equality,” she said.But no matter how many MLM novels Maya reads, she can’t ignore the reality that the rights of women and queer people to pursue lusty, joyous sex lives are under severe threat.“It’s devastating to read these stories and know that this would have been more believable five years ago,” she said. “The Trump administration is making any kind of sex other than straight sex within marriage fundamentally unsafe. I think if they had a choice they would roll us back to actual laws outlawing sodomy, and that’s terrifying.“Maybe that’s why it was so easy for me to go from Fourth Wing and the other romantasy books to MM romance. This is fantasy.”This article was amended on 13 January 2026 to remove some personal information.Explore more on these topicsSexualityWomenLGBTQ+ rightsMenTelevisionDramaHBOfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But some good habits are worth keeping, whether that’s flossing daily, getting exercise or eating more plants.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So how do you build a habit that sticks – and what helped you to do it? We asked for your tips on changes that worked, from drinking your second cup of coffee outdoors to reminders to move (or putting a trampoline in your kitchen).How to build a habit that sticksBatch cookView image in fullscreenGlass storage containerFrom £4.50 at John LewisI try to do as much food prep and batch cooking as possible (it’s cheaper and I think it saves time in the long run). I used to store batch-cooked meals in plastic containers, but I became much less enthusiastic after getting panicky about Pfas and forever chemicals. Glass food boxes have been a revelation. They’re slightly heavier to carry to and from work, but they’re much easier to clean, and you can pop them in the microwave safely too.EllaJump to itView image in fullscreenMini fitness trampolineFrom £39.99 at AmazonI keep my mini trampoline propped against a wall in my kitchen, and challenge myself to bounce on it any time I’m in there waiting for the kettle to boil, air fryer to finish or pasta to cook. Aesthetically speaking, I’d much rather it be hidden away in the basement, but I’d never use it if it were out of sight. Trampolining is a great mood booster, and you’d never believe how much it gets the blood pumping if you’ve not tried it.EmilyGet outsideView image in fullscreenThe Filter’s favourite travel mug: KeepCup Commuter£34 at KeepCup£31.95 at AmazonI’m a big believer in habit stacking, and I made a rule that my second cup of coffee always has to be outside during a morning walk (not my first cup, which is essential for basic function). Soon the walks became their own reward, and the habit just a part of my life.JackieFor more, read our guide to thebest travel mugsRemind yourself to moveView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Portra/Getty ImagesStand Up! The work break timer appFree at the Apple App StoreI have an app on my phone called Stand Up. You can set it up as you choose, but mine is set to go off on the hour every hour to remind me to get up and move around for two minutes so that I don’t sit for the whole day while working from home. It helps me to not be stiff and uncomfortable, and it stops my joints from seizing up.I do wall planks; step-ups; go up and down the stairs in those two minutes; or it may be a reminder to go and empty the washing machine, or to do another chore, but it does make me move, and I think it’s great!Debbie RichardsonTrack your hydrationView image in fullscreenIon8 motivator water bottle£14 at John Lewis£18.99 at DecathlonI find it really hard to remember to drink water, so I find this bottle really useful.

We just eat it, all of it, every week, planning meals that use what we’ve got and getting a lot more healthy, fresh, plant-based nutrition.We get a weekly delivery of seasonal veg, mostly produced in the UK. Once you factor in longer shelf life (a bag of spinach still fresh after six days!) and not peeling roots such as potatoes and carrots, it’s about the same price as supermarket veg but with much less food waste and minimal packaging.We’ve extended our range of dishes (kale crisps; roast beetroot with goat’s cheese; fennel and apple salad; squash, lentil and barley soup; roast veg and chick peas with ras el hanout), eat almost entirely vegan food and any occasional bits of leftover veg are dried or frozen or made into The Soup at the End of the Week. We’ve also cut prepared foods and ready meals to almost nil. Better for us, better for the planet.Nichola ClarkeView image in fullscreen35+ gut booster mega mix£6.25 at OcadoI’m obsessed with eating at least30 plants a weekand love this 35+-plant mix from Marks & Spencer. It’s made up of crunchy grains, beans, nuts and seeds, and adds a good crunch and flavour to soups, salads, curries, pasta … it works with almost any dish, although the coriander seeds make it more savoury-friendly.MonicaI keep a bag of baby spinach in the fridge at all times. I stir it into soups, casseroles and pasta dishes; and put it in wraps and sandwiches. If I were the sort of person who made smoothies, I’d add it to them, too. It’s such an easy way to add veg to my diet.HannahStop that snooze buttonView image in fullscreenLumie Bodyclock Glow 150 sunrise alarm£111.99 at Healf£119 at BootsMy Lumie sunrise alarm clock has stopped me from snoozing my alarm. It gently wakes you by slowly getting brighter, which makes me feel a lot less groggy and able to jump straight out of bed. It’s also impossible to drift back off with a bright light shining in your face. If the light doesn’t wake me, I’ve set it to play bird noises to rouse me from my slumber, which is a lot more pleasant than being jolted awake by my phone’s aggressive alarm tone.LilyFor more, read our guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocksHabit stack for boring dutiesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesFor me, the only time I am half-likely to stick with the dutiful stretch is before a morning shower, PJs or comparable: comfy. So it’s the sun salutation, trying to hold for four counts on each move, and then getting down on one knee and up, both sides, no hands. Plus, teeth brushing while standing on one leg (I’m 72 and dread the Fall). I lock the door.Penny LewisView image in fullscreenPlant-based floss picks£3.99 at Holland & Barrett£3 at AmazonTo make flossing feel like less of a chore, I’ve started doing it during my long, hot showers. It’s a great way to stack a boring task with something I actually enjoy. These floss picks from Humble Co are a handy option that are made partly of plant-based materials.EllaEat healthily with less effortView image in fullscreenSimmer meal deliveryFrom £3.75 a meal at SimmerSimmer has been brilliant for managing my calories and tracking macros. I buy the meals for work lunches – they eliminate the grab-and-go sandwich trap and make it easy to stay on target. They’re healthy, tasty, quick to heat and support staying within your calorie goal during the dreaded January cut.

Six rules to ditch – and what to do insteadDr Ezekiel J Emanuel, a former Obamacare adviser, has deceptively simple advice for living a healthy lifeElle HuntTue 13 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.03 ESTShareBeing healthy shouldn’t feel this complicated. Yet every week brings a new wellness fixation, from “fibermaxxing” to “zone 2 training”, creatine and cortisol-hacking.Between prescriptive plans, complex science and often contradictory advice, it can seem like being healthy is a full-time job – or a hopeless cause.It’s neither, argues Dr Ezekiel J Emanuel, a leading public-health physician, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and former adviser to the Obama administration. In his new book,Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules for a Long and Healthy Life, Emanuel dismantles the “wellness industrial complex” in favour of a few basic, sustainable principles.“The way I like to think about it is we both make it too complicated – and we also make it too simple,” he says. Here is Emanuel’s expert pick of the wellness advice you can afford to leave behind in 2025 – and what to focus on instead.Let go of: Intense fitness challengesBring in: More movement – of all kindsWe all know the importance of exercise, but it doesn’t have to be complicated or extreme. As Emanuel writes in Eat Your Ice Cream: “Just get off your ass and move around.”Fitness trends like “zone 2 training”, focusing on keeping your heart rate between 50% and 70% of your maximum, often overcomplicate things. “I think making an obsession of getting all the details right is absolutely the wrong thing,” he says. Simply getting some exercise and getting your heart rate up should be the goal.Walking, then progressing to running or other aerobic activity, delivers major gains. But after a point, more exercise isn’t always better, says Emanuel: “There is a plateau to how much benefit you’re getting.”The sweet spot remains 150 minutes a week (roughly 20 minutes a day) of activity vigorous enough to leave you slightly out of breath. Beyond that, you may be at risk of injury, Emanuel says.More important than benchmarks or challenges is consistency – and not just with cardio. Strength training and flexibility training are just as essential, at every life stage, Emanuel says:“For wellness to really be impactful for a healthy, long life, you have to be doing it for years and years – it has to be a habit.”But, he adds, “perfection is not the goal”.Let go of: Sad solo mealsBring in: Social diningHealth advice often neglects social connection, despite strong evidence that relationships are essential to wellness, longevity and happiness. Friends, family and even “weak ties” can matter more for health than diet or sleep alone, Emanuel says, while loneliness is increasingly linked to early death.One simple intervention: eat with other people. In 2023, roughly one in four Americansreported eating allof their meals alone, a sharp rise over two decades. Eating alone is also associated with poorer nutrition.Inviting someone over for dinner delivers multiple benefits. “Cooking a wonderfully nutritious meal, exercising your brain in that, then making it social by inviting other people to share it is a big wellness trifecta,” says Emanuel.The same goes for exercise, he adds: hitting the gym alone is better for you than not working out at all, but “if you’re smart, you’ll make it a social activity”.Let go of: Habit-tracking and statsBring in: Screen SabbathsRestorative sleep is essential for health, but Emanuel is against tracking it with tech. The data is often inaccurate, potentially misleading people about their individual patterns, and can exacerbate difficulties with falling or staying asleep.While stats can motivate some people to form good habits, Emanuel argues that time on screens generally undermines wellbeing by displacing social interactions and distracting us from the present.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’As well as no phones at the dinner table or in the hour before bed, he tries to spend every Saturday entirely screen-free. He has yet to achieve 52 consecutive weeks, Emanuele admits – but the intent is important.“If we rely on our own willpower, we’re going to fail … You have to create an environment where it’s easy to say no,” he says.Let go of: ‘Wellness’ as an interestBring in: Hobbies and interests … for wellnessIt’s increasingly the norm for wellness to be taken as a passion or interest in and of itself. This worries Emanuel, along with the fixation on longevity. He says: “There seems to be this sort of obsession that you need to make wellness the focus of your life … Your life should be bigger than wellness.”Too much focus on fitness, physical health and longevity can even come at the expense of other activities – such as socialising – that would make us happy and potentially healthier, he adds.“There’s an opportunity cost: if you’re spending all this time exercising, you’re going to miss out on doing other things – talking to your friends, cooking nutritious meals or just enjoying a book.”In Eat Your Ice Cream, Emanuel stresses the importance of hobbies, for not only enriching your days but also often bringing secondary wellness benefits.Each year, he challenges himself to take up an entirely new activity. Last year, he learned to keep bees and make his own honey. “I learned a lot, and actually it was very good for me, because for bees, you have to move slowly and be very conscious,” he says.This year, he has committed to learning ballroom dancing with his wife – again, promising multiple benefits, he points out: “There’s a lot of moves, you have to do a lot of coordination, you have to connect with another person.”Such activities support wellness as a way of life – rather than being the point of it, Emanuel says.Let go of: Your daily puzzleBring in: A book clubEmanuel’s annual challenge to learn something new also helps to keep him mentally sharp, he says. Many of us do crossword puzzles or word games daily to stave off cognitive decline, but repeating the same activity reinforces the same neural pathways.Watching television, scrolling social media or engaging in otherwise passive consumption likewise don’t stretch our brains. “A diversity of mental engagement” is important for slowing cognitive decline, especially if you’re retired, Emanuel says: “And make sure you don’t just do it once.”A regular book club can help keep you mentally nimble, combining critical thinking, exposure to new ideas and debate – along with the all-important social element.Learning to cook or expanding your repertoire is also accessible and rewarding, Emanuel adds; he suggests attempting one new dish every week: “It doesn’t take that much to learn a new recipe, and it expands your palate and your experiences.”Let go of: ‘Ultra-processed foods’ anxietyBring in: Real food“Ultra-processed foods” may dominate public-health debate, but the “quasi-scientific” term and debate over what counts as such may be adding to confusion about how to eat, Emanuel says:“Let’s call it what it is: junk food. It’s not healthy for you.”It’s unrealistic to eliminate it entirely, but junk food should be minimised, Emanuel says: “From scratch, and natural – that’s the way we should be eating.”One way to achieve this is, again, by cooking most of your meals yourself. Processed, packaged foodshave been linked todepression and anxiety, as well as to faster cognitive deterioration.Even many supposed “health foods” don’t deliver nutrition. Protein bars, for example, can be convenient during intensive exercise or while you’re on the go, but many are only slightly better for you than candy bars, Emanuel says: “You should not think they’re healthy.”Multivitamins and supplements, too, are generally unnecessary if you aren’t pregnant or vegan or otherwise have specific needs. As for “wellness drips” and infusions, they’re a “total waste of money”, Emanuel says.Better to focus on nutrition, and limiting your intake of empty calories. Snacks make up 500 calories per day in an average adult’s diet – nearly 25% of the daily total. You don’t need to cut them out, Emanuel says, but “make sure it’s a good snack”.Let go of: RestrictionBring in: PleasureOne of the biggest issues with modern wellness culture, Emanuel says, is its narrow focus on the individual, encouraging fixation and restriction. “A lot of the recommendations are about depriving yourself,” he says, whether of food, leisure time or social opportunities.Not only can obsessing about health and wellness come at the detriment of overall wellbeing, it can also be counterproductive, Emanuel says: “You’re not going to sustain that activity if you’re constantly depriving yourself. You’re just using too much willpower – and we know that willpower fatigues.”How to end the year right: come up with your own personal ritualsRead moreDespite his commitment to health, Emanuel is an enthusiastic home baker and avowed chocaholic. He has even made his own chocolate bar, listed alongside his professional accomplishments on his website under “hobbies”.By embracing his sweet tooth, Emanuel has cultivated new interests, learned new skills, connected with others and enriched his life. That’s the best way to approach indulgences, he suggests: make them worth it.Hence the provocative title of his book: wellness isn’t one-size-fits-all, and pleasure plays a part.“My wife’s grandmother ate ice-cream every day for her 101 years,” Emanuel says. You wouldn’t think of it as medicine – but, as a treat, enjoyed two or even three times a week, “it makes perfect sense”.Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules for a Long and Healthy Life by Ezekiel JEmanuel is out nowExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But even in prison, violence isn’t inevitableAlex SouthTue 13 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 09.31 ESTShareThere are hotspots for violence in prison. The exercise yard, the showers. There are peak times, too. Mealtimes and association periods are particularly volatile.But first thing in the morning is not when you expect to hear an alarm bell. I certainly didn’t, at 6am in my office on the residential wing of a high-security prison in late 2018. All prisoners were locked up at that time. But overcrowding has long been a problem in UK prisons, and keeping three men in cells designed for one can be a recipe for disaster.When I reached the scene, I found one of my colleagues standing outside a cell with his keys in the lock, poised to open the door. The control panel next to the door showed a blinking orange light. The cell bell can be activated by prisoners inside to call for officer assistance. Normally this would be a request for toilet roll or paracetamol. But that day was different.Inside the cell, one man sat trembling on the top bunk. Another stood with his back to the window, arms folded, T-shirt spattered with blood. The third prisoner lay prone on the floor. He was conscious, but only just. The eerie stillness of that cell was suddenly broken by noise and urgency. The officer beside me radioed for an ambulance. The dedicated search team was deployed to photograph the cell and preserve available evidence. Staff from the segregation unit were assigned the unenviable task of relocating the perpetrator to a “dry cell” (one with no toilet, sink or furniture) where he would not be able to scrub the dried blood – the evidence – from his skin or his T-shirt. Later, in the dry cell, he would proceed to smash the light fitting, and use the shards of plastic to assault the next officer who opened the door.The prisoner we had found unconscious on the floor, a man in his 60s serving a short sentence for burglary, was taken to hospital. He spent several days in a medically induced coma. The liquid I’d noticed streaming from his nose was, in fact, brain fluid. One of the doctors who treated him likened his injuries to those he would expect to see after a high-speed road traffic accident. Mercifully, he survived. His assailant was subsequently assessed as high risk, and will never share a cell again. He was already serving a life sentence, so additional charges were deemed not to be in the public interest. Yet the impact of his actions was far-reaching. For the victim, obviously, who was lucky to survive. But also for the man on the top bunk, who in the middle of such appalling violence had the courage to reach out and press the cell bell. And for the staff who responded, for whom such incidents are difficult to forget. We were all acutely aware that if that cell bell hadn’t been pressed, if there hadn’t been enough of us who turned up early to work that morning, the outcome could have been very different.A year or so later, I was reminded of that morning as I sat for a training session in an auditorium in Manchester. On stage, a slight woman in her 70s was delivering a talk about trauma and men in prison. She spoke about how their lives are often defined by trauma long before they’re incarcerated, how they continue to accumulate trauma during their sentence – and how we all pay the price of it afterwards.As part of the training day, we were supposed to discuss how often we saw signs of trauma – the results of childhood abuse and neglect – on the landings as prison officers. How did abuse manifest itself on prison wings? Were prisoners able to manage their personal hygiene? Did they interact in a healthy way with others? And we did talk about it, for a bit. I recalled the man in one prison I worked at: he had grown up in a children’s home, and was triggered by the sound of boots outside his cell door. As a 12-year-old, he’d come to recognise the sound of a certain pair of boots, scuffed heels, the way they dragged along the linoleum at night. Then paused outside his bedroom door.But there is something about these kinds of conferences that always feels a little condescending, as if frontline prison staff could not have worked out the impact that child abuse can have on a person without a psychologist explaining it. Something a little pointless, too. When are we supposed to see signs of this stuff? Prisoners are banged up forup to 22 hoursa day insome places. And if we do see it, what next?I was sitting at a table with people who wore the same uniform I did. Lightweight jacket, cheap zipper that kept breaking, Queen’s crest. Heavy black boots. Starched white shirt. Dubious expressions.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Callum Rowland/The GuardianOur nametags set us apart from one another.Chloe, HMP BerwynReece, HMP/YOI FelthamNeil, HMP Full SuttonAnd me: Alex, HMP BelmarshI’d been in the Prison Service for a while by then. Enough to know something about most other prisons in England and Wales.Berwyn: new officers out of their depth. Problems withstaff corruption. A relatively new prison, staffed by inexperienced officers and running a limited regime, with little time outside cells. A senior officer from there once told me she’d had to explain to a new officer why it was inappropriate to pluck a prisoner’s eyebrows for him.Feltham: like a mini war zone. Young men from different areas, different gangs, a tangled web of rivalries and affiliations that only intensified behind bars. Education is compulsory in young offender institutes – or at least it’s supposed to be – but the time it took to get prisoners into their classrooms often surpassed the time allocated for learning. Staggering a regime in this way, meaning that multiple small groups of people are moved to education or activities at different times to avoid them coming into contact, is typical of prisons with high rates of violence. But it also means that mistakes are inevitably made. It is near-impossible to keep up with the ever-changing feuds and allegiances between groups, to remember who is friends with who, and who has links to which area.Full Sutton: an officer had beentaken hostagethere back in 2013. Back then, I was a junior officer still on probation. Even now, I can remember how that incident affected us all in the highest security prisons. The knowledge that if it could happen there, it could happen anywhere. And that feeling that hung in the air over the next few days as we unlocked the cells. I held my keys differently. Checked my angles differently.That day in 2019, at the training session in Manchester, Full Sutton was back in the news. A convicted paedophile serving 22 life sentenceshad been murdered therea few weeks earlier.“Were you on shift?” I asked Neil.He stirred his weak coffee, black granules spreading like oil.“I was on scene,” he said.All prison officers have witnessed violence. It’s a part of the job. But I was floored by the level of depravity that Neil had dealt with in that cell. The fact that it had happened in a place such as HMP Full Sutton made it all the more shocking. Full Sutton is a high-security, category A prison. It benefits from higher staff-to-prisoner ratios, more thorough security procedures and additional resources. Category A prisons tend to be smaller. They are more conducive to a community environment, where prisoners and officers often call each other by their first names. Where workshops and classrooms have full attendance. Where governors are a visible presence, regularly seen visiting the residential wings, the segregation unit, the healthcare department. Better funded. Better resourced. Or at least, that was how things were in the not-so-distant past.Prisoner-on-prisoner murders were rare when I joined the Prison Service in 2012. There were incidents that came close, but the courage and quick thinking of officers had led to near-misses rather than deaths. Back then, it would be news if an officer was assaulted. Times have changed. Now, there are regular stories of violence, corruption, overcrowding and suicide in prisons. Between April 2013 and March 2016, there were13 murders in prisons in England and Wales.I had hoped never to work in a jail when one took place, but I had no such luck.I’d transferred out of one prison only weeks before a young man was stabbed to death on the residential wing where I had been based. I’d listened as one of my former colleagues described watching the paramedics carry out open heart surgery on the landing; his stunned disbelief that the thing we’d all said was “only a matter of time” had actually happened. The panic and intensity, and then sudden disorientating stillness: a young man stabbed to death in a filthy cell.I considered myself lucky that I’d left that prison before the murder took place. But then I was on shift when a murder was committed at the next jail I worked. On shift – but not on scene. Responding to an incident is not the same as being the first one there. It’s not the same as being the one to find the victim, or to intervene while that kind of violence is happening right in front of you. I was grateful that I hadn’t been that officer. But even as paramedics took over and I walked away, I knew I’d have a hard time forgetting what I’d seen.In the last few years of my decade as a prison officer, I’d come to better understand how the job was affecting me. In the grip of a cold February shortly after the murder, I’d been inside my office when the red light above the door started flashing. The looping alarm bell followed seconds later. And then a panicked shout for staff. It took me seconds to reach the cell and seconds more to glance inside. Inside, a man’s body was slumped against the toilet. It was too late. Not a murder or a suicide. A drugs overdose. He had been a quiet man, occasionally picked on by the younger prisoners. He never caused staff any problems.Hours later, I was pulling my lightweight jacket tighter around my body as I stood on a doorstep in Croydon, the chaplain beside me. The rain fell in a fine mist underneath the streetlights. Christmas lights were still sparkling in one window. The woman who was listed as the prisoner’s next of kin opened the door. When we told her the news, she did not react the way I’d expected. Her tears were not of grief, but a mixture of relief and bitterness. She had spent so many years of her life afraid, she said. The quiet man who had never caused any problems had been abusive and violent. He had smashed her windows and chased her with a baseball bat. She felt some semblance of freedom only when he was locked up, and yet she had lived in constant fear that he’d get back out. I forgot his face after a few months, but I have never forgotten hers.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Callum Rowland/The GuardianNor did I ever forget the lifer whose hand I’d held on the operating table. Sporadic chest pain, suspected to be a panic attack, had turned out to be serious heart disease. I was 23 and he was 25. His expression when he asked me if he’d be OK. My voice as I said, “Yes, of course.” Because I thought that he would be OK. I thought that he was too young to die, and the operation was safe and the hospital world-class, and I thought I was saying the right thing. But he never woke up.All of this had done what you might expect it would. It made me a little more cynical, a bit paranoid about personal safety. But my experiences in prisons had done something else, too. I empathised a little more with the men I locked up. I could see that none of this was black and white, as I had once thought. I felt conflicted about the men I met who had done terrible things but were not always terrible people, and I felt conflicted about the others whose offences I struggled to look past. I was conscious of the pain they had caused, and yet I could recognise that the scaffolding of their lives was flimsy. The places where they should have been helped, they were not.I saw a version of that in my own experience. This system, of which I had once been so proud to be a part, now showed me contempt. I resented being at that Manchester conference in my cheap uniform, learning things that were blindingly obvious, being told what I needed to do by people who would never have to do it, and the painful knowledge that none of this would ever translate to life in prison as I knew it. Because how could it? When would any of this happen? And who would do it?That night in Manchester, we ate in a gastropub not far from the city centre. I sat beside Chloe from HMP Berwyn.We’d met before a few years earlier, on our hostage negotiators course. She was bright, funny, with bleached blond hair and a stud in her nose. We laughed about that course and the incidents we’d faced: the time a prisoner sprayed a fire extinguisher in her face, the time a teenager with hepatitis B spat in mine. In both cases, a better system might have provided some kind of support for the officers afterwards, but nothing was forthcoming.It’s hard for the prison officers trained as peer supporters to support their peers when jails are understaffed. If there aren’t enough officers to relieve the peer supporters, and there aren’t enough officers to relieve the ones who need peer support, what happens next? Not much, is the answer. There’s the employee assistance helpline, where the person on the other end has no knowledge of prisons or the specifics of that environment. Or the teams of skilled wellbeing personnel, who supposedly respond to critical incidents in prison within two hours. They sound amazing, but in 10 years of frontline prison work including riots, murders and countless suicides, I never met them. I don’t know anyone who has. In 2024, it was reported that officers todayare assaulted nearly hourly. These wonderful-sounding teams might just as well move in.In the past few years, there have been prisoner murders in the cells atHMP Wormwood Scrubs,HMP Belmarsh,HMP Fosse Way,HMP/YOI Stoke Heath, murders in a bunkbed atHMP Bristol, in the showers atHMP Nottingham, the corridor atHMP Coldingley, the gym atHMP Whitemoor, the exercise yard atHMP Woodhill, the landings atHMP Pentonville.I believed in the system. But now I see it turned inside out. Prisons don’t just hold people who have committed unspeakable violence, they now perpetuate it. Assaults on staff are commonplace. Drones deliver flick-knives to cell windows. Officers are equipped with Tasers to protect themselves and others. A man on remandfor terrorist charges escapes. A convicted sex offender is “released in error”.With 262 releases in error in one year, does anyone really believe the debacle of convicted sex offender Hadush Kebatu’smistaken releaselast October was solely down to “human error”? Or the one after that at HMP Wandsworth? Does anyone believe that these are individual mistakes? Because it seems glaringly obvious that these are systemic problems that require systemic changes.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Callum Rowland/The GuardianA new checklist isn’t going to cut it. David Lammy, the justice secretary, has described theimplementation of new measuresas being “the strongest release checks … ever”. I wish that that was all it took to fix our prison system. Some more checks. But the gap between words, reality and decisive action continues to widen.In 2024, an inquiry was launched by the House of Lords justice and home affairs committee into prison culture and staffing.The inquiry foundthat prison governor visibility is crucial to effective leadership, that staff and prisoners must routinely see and interact with senior management. The government agreed. And yet we are pressing ahead with plans to build enormous prisons with capacities of more than 1,000, where visibility will be practically impossible.In the same report, the justice and home affairs committee stressed the importance of purposeful activity such as education, describing it as “essential to prisoners’ personal development and to the reduction of reoffending upon release”. Thegovernment agreed. And yet in September, plans were announced to cut spending in education in prisons in England and Wales byup to 50%.The report also discussed the need to ensure frontline prison staff go through a robust recruitment process and can access high-quality, in-person training to ensure they have the skills needed for such a complex, challenging role. But the recruitment process remains predominantly online, as does much of the training. Starting salaries are between £33,000 and £44,000. Unsurprisingly, retention rates are low and there have been high-profile allegations of staff corruption.Labour tells us it inherited a Prison Service in crisis – and it did. But 50% cuts to education? Recruiting prison officers over Zoom? Insisting that prison officers are properly supported when every single one wearing that cheap uniform will tell you different? The whole thing exhausts and angers and saddens me. I feel relief and bitterness. Relief I’m out of it. Bitterness that I felt I had no choice. Why on earth would I have stayed?Late last year,two moremurders– both at HMP Wakefield, in the space of less than a month. That brought last year’s total to eight. Many will see the death of these particular men as no great loss to society. One of the men had murdered his partner’s two-year-old daughter; the other man was jailed for numerous sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Yet the fact that these murders in prison can happen – and happen regularly – is a sign of something that has gone very wrong.A murder in prison is not a single event that occurs and then is over. It reverberates. Within the prisons, it is felt in the doctor’s surgeries, classrooms, football pitches, gyms, laundries, cells. The staff feel it – that very specific feeling, that the thing that will happen here one day has happened. The people on shift, on scene, are left with the memories. Boots running, heavy breathing, keys fumbling in locks, alarms looping and red lights on the walls flashing. Paramedics, defibrillators, a white sheet. The coroner’s van comes, silent in the early hours of the morning. So many lives are fractured.‘If you decide to cut staff, people die’: how Nottingham prison descended into chaosRead moreBut there are ways back. Violence is not inevitable. I have known two men, one serving a sentence for the attempted murder of the other, who sat in the chapel with staff watching from the sides and talked. It was a difficult, angry conversation, but a necessary one, that allowed them to come to an agreement. They were in one of the best jails in this country, with a decent gym and eight hours out of their cells a day. Neither wanted to serve their time anywhere else. So they agreed to coexist. And to this day, they continue to live on the same wing and play football on the same team.There are very few good jails these days. Eight hours out of cell a day sounds fantastical now. The cost is immense. Time out of the cells is so important. Learning how to debate, to argue, that back and forth. And education, too, can be transformative. The chatter and buzz of a full classroom in prison. Certificates pinned to the wall. Flowers crafted from toilet roll. Intricate sculptures of skylines and scenery made from matchsticks. In my memory I can see the portraits that one man on the second floor landing would do, his cell dark and smoky, his paintings like looking into another world.Some names have been changedListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

Aren’t we lucky?Tue 13 Jan 2026 09.10 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareSorry to call it early, but the worst trend of 2026 is politicians who are graciously doing us all a favour. “He doesn’t need to be here,” declared Nigel Farage on Monday of Reform UK’s newest sloppy second,Nadhim Zahawi. “He could have gone abroad.” Ooh, aren’t we lucky! Thanks for stopping by, Nadhim!If you missed this, the former mayfly Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi hasswitched gravy trains. If that sounds like the sort of death-defying stunt Tom Cruise might break his ankle doing in the Mission: Impossible franchise, it’s nothing like as exhilaratingly watchable. The Tory gravy train has ground to a halt, and Farage will stop his Reform train even between stations to pick up any old has-been you may remember from episodes such as “deathbedBoris Johnson appointments” or “my horsesare warmer than pensioners”. (More on that one shortly.) Needless to say, Farage is doing his best to explain that these guys aren’t secondhand, they’re pre-loved. They’re vintage, they’re appealingly worn in, they’re heritage pieces. They may even have increased in value – they’re basically political Birkin bags.But, as I say, you’re lucky you’re even being allowed to look at them. Don’t dream of touching what you can’t afford. Farage’s party is increasingly full of people who’d like you to know they’ve got way better options than power and don’t actually need to do this.Nigel’s one himself, of course, having declared “I want my life back” in 2016, before repeatedly presenting his frequent un-retirings as some kind of regrettable sacrifice he could well afford not to make. He doesn’t need to do this, guys! Or take Richard Tice, the Reform deputy leader given to making grandly self-dramatising statements like: “My job pays for everything. The politics just costs me.” (By way of a quick sidebar, incidentally, do spare a genuine thought for Tice. He’s been a Successful BusinessmanTM, he led Reform for almost three years when they leapt from 0% to 15% in the polls, and he then dutifully surrendered the leadership to the endlessly un-retiring Farage. AndstillFarage has resolutely declined to name him the unofficial opposition’s shadow chancellor and clearly never will, waiting instead for a Tory of the right perceived calibre to defect so he can give it to them instead. It’s like Nigel loves Richard, but knows he isnot serious people.)Anyway. Now, take Nadhim Zahawi, who spent Monday’sunveiling press conferencemaking much of the fact that a successful businessman such as himself could have chosen to enjoy a “comfortable retirement”, but instead is joining Reform, apparently as an act of national philanthropy. But is Zahawi truly one of life’s most selfless givers, or is he a career chiseller whose interactions with the taxpayer include simplynot payinghis own taxes, and putting in expenses for heat and lighting for the stables on his Warwickshire estate? Something to bear in mind for Reform supporters currently feeling too cash-strapped to put the heating on. Zahawiaccepted morefrom the taxpayer in energy costs for his second home than any other MP. He was forced to repay those, as he was forced to settle his unpaid bills with HMRC after concealing the investigation into his affairs led to him having to resign as chancellor.Below these upper echelons of Reform, this attitude that politics needs you far more than you need it persists. The recently resigned leader of Staffordshire county council is a guy called Ian Cooper, whose Reform party membership wassuspended last monthafter the discovery that social media accounts linked to him were a “top fan” of a white supremacy page, and that he had been posting stuff like a diatribe against David Lammy that included the dictum: “No foreign national or first-generation migrant should be allowed to sit in parliament.” Yet when a Labour councillor questioned the deafening silence among his colleagues about all this, Cooper reacted airily. “The good thing is I don’t need to be a politician for the money, unlike some,” he sniffed. “I can walk away without consequences.”Strange times we live in, when a consequence-free lifestyle is now being presented as an ideal characteristic for a politician. People didn’t used to talk like this, constantly implying they were far too good or well-feathered for this crap, and only here as a favour to the little people. It’s such an eye-catching reframing of public service for the hyper-individualised age, yet at the same time its practitioners don’t even seem to realise that they’re doing it.Is Nadhim Zahawi’s defection to Farage’s Reform a bombshell? No, it’s just naked opportunism | Henry HillRead moreNor, indeed, is the tendency limited to Reform. Back when the Conservatives were looking to expand their pool of MPs,Rory Stewart has recountedasking David Cameron if he’d be made a minister fast. “What I was saying was: ‘Do you want me? Because I can do other things. I’ve got a chair at Harvard. I don’t need to do this.’”Not needing to do this was the absolute keystone of Donald Trump’s first White House run, with the future president reminding voters at every turn that: “I’ve built a great, great company. I don’t need to do this.” That great, great company has, of course,enriched itselfbeyond measure during Trump’s two stints in office – which rather disproves the man we might consider the daddy of this particular streak in modern politics, Ross Perot. By way of a recap, tech-firm billionaire Perot ran as an independent US presidential candidate in 1992, and a big part of his norm-shattering shtick was the fact he was so rich that he couldn’t be corrupt like all those other politicians. Perot explicitly believed that autocratic businessmen were the answer, and that government was something that could be fixed if you just got “under the hood”. One in five Americans voted for him. (By the way, the next time he ran, in 1996, he called his party theReform party.)Last week I saw a poll that found 74% of people across the UK, EU, US, Canada and Japan believed the world is “hopelessly riggedfor the rich”. It’s kind of nuts that in an era in which this outlook is overwhelmingly prevalent, the supposed great knights in shining armour are men who keep telling you they are doing so well that they really don’t even need to bother. They’re doing it for YOU, and you need to follow them into battle in what Zahawi called Farage’s “glorious revolution”. Is there any armour for the foot soldiers, as they march towards their own consequence-free promised land? Look, I’m sure the guys at the top are working on it. You’re just going to have to take it all on trust.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What began as demonstrations over a collapsing currency and rising inflation has rapidly evolved into one of the most destabilising episodes of unrest the regime has faced in years. The protests have exposed both the resilience of Iranian society and the growing brittleness of a political system stubbornly unwilling to reform.It’s the scale, spread and momentum of the demonstrations that have been most alarming to the authorities. Protests have erupted across all provinces in the country, reaching more than 180 towns and cities, cutting across class, ethnic and regional lines. This time, the turn to openly anti-regime slogans has been rapid and widespread. Protesters are no longer demanding relief from within the system. They are rejecting it outright, directly challenging the authority of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei – and the wider establishment.The state’s response underscores how seriously it views the threat. To disrupt coordination and prevent images of repression from circulating globally, the country has been placed under an unprecedented totalcommunication and internet blackout. At the same time, the regime has deployed its full coercive apparatus. In the absence of full access to news and information, human rights organisations estimate that more than 6,000 peoplecould have been killed, with thousands more arrested, injured – or disappeared into Iran’s opaque detention system.Yet, despite continued violence, protesters have shown courage and determination, seeking to sustain momentum in the face of reported massacres, live ammunition, street clashes, mass arrests and intimidation. The movement remains largely leaderless, which is both a strength and a constraint. It makes the protests harder to dismantle, but it also limits the ability to organise, or chart a clear political pathway forward. This is not a matter of choice, though, but is a result of decades of repression that have weakened civil society, alongside the imprisonment and intimidation of activists, many of whomnow languishin Evin prison.What makes these protests particularly significant are their place in a longer trajectory of resistance. Since themass protests of 2009, Iranians have repeatedly taken to the streets – in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022 and now again. Each cycle has been met with repression rather than reform. Under Khamenei’s leadership, the system has shown a striking refusal to compromise, doubling down instead on coercion and ideological rigidity.Figures outside the country have stepped into the vacuum. Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, has publicly called on Iraniansto take to the streetsand maintain pressure on the regime. Protesters have responded by chanting his name in several cities. This should not be read as a call for monarchist restoration, but as evidence of the absence of credible, organised opposition inside Iran, and a search for symbols that represent a clean break with the Islamic Republic. For the authorities, such chants are deeply unsettling, reviving a historical memory they have long sought to erase.As in every crisis, the regime has blamed foreign enemies. In a Friday sermon on 9 January, Khamenei dismissed the unrest as the work of external powers,casting dissent as treason and foreign conspiracy. This framing serves a familiar purpose, allowing the government to legitimise repression at home while reinforcing a siege mentality within the state. Yesterday, the government organised its ownstate-backed demonstrationsto project an image of unity and control.These claims ring increasingly hollow though, particularly after the June 2025Israel-Iran conflict, which exposed the extent to which Israel had penetrated Iran’s security and intelligence systems. In that context, domestic unrest is no longer merely a political challenge. It is an existential one. The leadership fears that internal dissent, external pressure and covert infiltration could converge in ways that would unravel the regime’s grip on power.International dynamics further complicate the crisis. Donald Trump has threatened potentialmilitary intervention on behalf of the protesters. Tehran has respondedby warningthat any US strike could trigger retaliation, not only against American assets in the region but also against Israel. A direct US entry into the crisis could have contradictory effects. It would give the regime cover to escalate its crackdown at home, but the strategic aim would be to weaken the Islamic Republic by deepening its economic isolation, degrading elements of its security capacity and loosening the bolts on the state’s already fragile functionality. Such pressure would not deliver immediate change, but it would sharpen the regime’s internal contradictions and make governing even more difficult.What comes next is unlikely to be liberalisation. Faced with declining legitimacy, economic collapse and geopolitical isolation, the Islamic Republic will become a more inward-looking state, increasingly reliant on repression rather than representation. The trajectory bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, where survival depended on fear, surveillance and brute force, rather than consent.Pitted against the repressive capacity of a brutal state, these protests may again fade from the headlines, but they are not an aberration. They are the clearest signal yet of a political order that has lost its capacity to adapt. Unless Iran’s leadership chooses a radically different path, involving reform, accountability, economic change and engagement with the outside world, future unrest is not a question of if, but when.

Worrying about his actions isn’t enoughTue 13 Jan 2026 09.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareIf you want to understand what’s happening in the US right now, and what is likely to happen next, don’t just focus on Donald Trump. Rather, pay close attention to Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. It’s increasingly clear that Miller, a man who has said that “America is for Americans and Americans only” and who is on a mission to “save the west” is the driving force behind the Trump administration’s most extreme policies. Per a recentBloomberg profile, some of Trump’s aides even privately call Miller “the prime minister”.Miller’s influence stretches across both foreign and domestic policy. Those masked immigration agents pulling people off the street, and occasionally shooting unarmed citizens in the face? You can trace their aggressive tacticsback to Miller. The plot to get rid of birthright citizenship? Miller’s handsare all over it. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro? He helpedplanit. The campaign to Maga-fy universities?Miller again! All right-leaning roads seem to lead back to Miller.While the likes of JD Vance have aggressivelyshape-shiftedto curry favour with the president, 40-year-old Miller has long been a zealot. In 2017, one of his former high school classmatestold the New York Timesthat a teenage Miller informed him they couldn’t be friends because of his Latino heritage. He also reportedly complained that Spanish-speaking classmates ought to speak English. A 16-year-old Miller ran for class president, and gave a speech (which Jimmy Kimmelrecently resurfaced) where he asked his fellow students: “Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?”He didn’t win that particular election, but Miller’s been rising up the political ranks ever since. In 2013, as an aide to then-senator Jeff Sessions, he made a name for himself fighting a bipartisanimmigration reform bill. Then, under Trump 1.0, Miller was the mastermind behind the separation of immigrant families at the US-Mexico border. His unclepublicly lambasted himfor this, noting that the family descended from Jewish refugees escaping persecution in Europe, but Stephenbondedwith Katie Waldman, who was then an immigration spokesperson, over their shared opposition to migrants. They’re currently married; she’s now Katie Miller and, like all the worst people in America, she has apodcast.I suffered through the very first episode of that tedious podcast, by the way, and learned a fun fact about Miller. His passions don’t just include kidnapping foreign heads of state. He also bloody loves a bit of mayonnaise. Indeed, in her podcast, Katie Miller made it sound like the whitest of white condiments is the only thing her husband eats. Which seems a little too apt, doesn’t it? A bit like the fact Ivanka Trump has asuper-white dogcalled Winter. It all just sort of feels like America: The Final Season has been scripted by lazy AI.Anyway, ever since hearing that podcast, I’ve had intermittent intrusive thoughts of Miller standing barefoot in the luminous light of a fridge spooning mayonnaise into his mouth, straight from the jar. Yes, I know, I know, I should probably go to therapy. So should Miller, obviously. In fact, we could solve a lot of problems if someone could just round up Elon Musk, Trump, Miller, and JD Vance and force them all into intensive therapy.Seriously, though, I think the reason the mayonnaise anecdote has stuck with me is because it’s a reminder that while Miller may be in a position of extraordinary power, he is ultimately still just a man, one who likely has grease stains on his T-shirts. While the ghouls hellbent on bringing authoritarianism to America, and misery to their self-declared enemies, may think of themselves as demi-gods, they are, ultimately, just mere mortals.I say this not to humanise Miller, but to put him, and the egomaniacs around him, in perspective. What people like Miller want most of all is for us to fear them; that’s why they’re all so obsessed with talking aboutstrength and force and power. And, yes, we should all be afraid of Miller’s brutish vision of theworld. We should be worried about what Miller is doing. But we should also make sure to laugh at him; there is nothing thin-skinned authoritarians hate more thanbeing laughed at. And we should never forget that, amid all the trappings of office, Stephen Miller is ultimately just a pathetic little man.

Trump arrested Nicolás Maduro to plunder our wealthAndrés AntillanoThe US president invokes the usual suspects – drugs, organised crime, illegal migration – but this is simply a grab for resources and powerTue 13 Jan 2026 10.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareIn the early hours of 3 January, Caracas and other cities in Venezuelawere bombedand the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was kidnapped along with his wife by US military personnel. In addition to the100 deathsrecorded so far as a result of the attack,approximately 100 morewere caused by US attacks on small boats in the previous months, under the pretext of combattingdrug trafficking. Although it seems clear that the real intention of Donald Trump’s administration was to seize Venezuela’s wealth, the initial argument to justify the military deployment in the Caribbean was that it was to fight the illegal drugs trade and stop the flow of migrants that the Venezuelan government was allegedlycausing by emptying prisons of criminals andsending them to the US.As a criminology professor who has studied Venezuelan drug trafficking for 20 years, I find this far-fetched. To understand this, we have to consider Venezuela’s historical role in drug trafficking. As a typical Andean country neighbouring the world’s main coca producers, Venezuela has always played a significant role as a cocaine corridor. Since the turn of the century, its involvement in international drug trafficking has increased significantly as a result of growing European demand for cocaine, the effects of 2000’sPlan Colombia, which displaced illegal operations to border regions and neighbouring countries, and the breakdown of technical cooperation with Washington.However, Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking has declined significantly in recent years. According to theUN World Drug Report 2025, only 5% of Colombian cocaine passes through Venezuela. There may be many reasons for this decline. The increase in seizures in the Caribbean, for example, may have favoured new routes, such as the Pacific. There has been a fragmentation of criminal groups linked todrug trafficking in Colombiaand a strengthening of criminal structures in other countries,such as Ecuador.In my opinion, the fundamental reason for this decline inVenezuelahas to do with the degree of fragmentation and competition among actors (illegal and legal, criminal and state) involved in drug trafficking, and the prolonged crisis in Venezuela aggravating the traditional fragmentation of the state. This means that the use of routes through Venezuela generates a high degree of uncertainty for drug traffickers, because securing the collaboration of one state actor does not guarantee that they will escape being intercepted by another. Even drug trafficking needs clear and predictable rules, which do not exist in Venezuela.The latter argument also allows us to discuss another of the reasons put forward by the Trump administration to justify its attack on Venezuela: that the Venezuelan government (or at least part of it) is a criminal organisation involved in drug trafficking, known as theCartel de Los Soles(“Cartel of the Suns”, in reference to the suns that identify the highest ranking officers in the armed forces on their uniform epaulettes). This was onedeclared reason forsending in special forcesand kidnapping Maduro and his wife.The term Cartel de Los Soles has been used by the Venezuelan press since at least the early 1990s to denounce the links between high-ranking military officers and drug trafficking. In other words, if we believe the press, ithas been in existence for almost 40 years. When Hugo Chávez was in power, the US government appropriated the term to attack the Venezuelan government, accusing it of collusion with international drug trafficking without any evidence to date to support the claim.The idea of a cartel implies horizontal and vertical coordination between different actors to control a drug production and trafficking chain, or at least some of its operations. The prosecution responsible for charging Maduro and his wife in New York last weekrefrained from pointingto their participation in such a structure when presenting its case, most likely due to the difficulties of proving its existence.After Trump’s attack, we Venezuelans need to know what comes next – authoritarianism or democracy | Jesús PiñeroRead moreRegarding Venezuelans’ migration, Trump’s interest in this issue is not new. In November 2024, in the midst of his presidential campaign, he took advantage of an incident involving armed Venezuelan migrants to promote the idea that Venezuelan migration was a threat to the American way of life. To do so, he drew on one of the popular bogeymen of the moment: the Tren de Aragua, a gang born in a Venezuelan prison. As soon as he took office, Trumpdeclared this groupa “foreign terrorist organisation” and accused it of leading a “predatory incursion” in concert with the Venezuelan government; he sentseveral hundred Venezuelans to prisonin El Salvador and deported several thousand others for reasons as random ashaving tattoosor simply being Venezuelan. Regarding the military deployment in the Caribbean, Trump has repeatedly resorted to the argument that the Venezuelan government sentex-convicts and mental patientsto the US to undermine American democracy.Venezuelan migration in recent years amounts toseveral million people. However, neither in the Latin American countries that host most of this population, nor in the US, are there any signs of a disproportionate involvement of Venezuelans in crime. As for the notorious Tren de Aragua, serious studies indicate that itdoes not existas a centralised organisation with a single command structure outside its place of origin. Furthermore, even US intelligence sources agree that there isno evidence of a linkbetween the Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government.Trump resorts to the usual suspects (drugs, narco-terrorism, organised crime, illegal migration) to justify his persecution of Venezuelan migrants and the invasion of Venezuela. There is nothing older or more worn out than using folk devils to generate fear and legitimise persecution and wars, while hiding the real motives: the plundering of Venezuela’s wealth and the intimidation of countries in the region to submit to Washington’s tutelage.Andrés Antillano is a social psychologist and professor at the Central University of VenezuelaExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionAmericasTrump administrationUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

We spend a lot of time trying to get on the insurance for each others’ cars, because some can fit a sideboard, and others can’t fit a handbag. We swap recommendations for things like secondhand book exchangers, and avoid talking about fond memories of the home about to be departed, concentrating on all the brilliant things there are to be said about new pastures. The main thing we don’t talk about is that none of us know how to do anything and that all of us are hoarders.There’s a reason not to know the big stuff – how to paint a skirting board, how to mend a bannister spindle – never doing a thing without landing in a place of pure ignorance. Probably if any of us were 25, we’d be no worse at painting than any other 25-year-old.‘I’m never going back to living like this’: how an innovative project is helping hoardersRead moreOther stuff is frankly embarrassing; I don’t know how to get the decorative cover off a light fitting; I don’t really know the difference between a knick-knack and some mess; I haven’t got the trace of a clue about when is the right time to throw away a pair of trainers – is it when the fabric is full of holes but they’re still watertight, or is it before then?My friend, clearing out a chest of drawers, found one filled entirely with different-coloured ribbon of unusable length. I stare at old Christmas cards and can’t figure out whether they’re from a person I’ve tragically forgotten, or if I just found them on the street and decided the right thing to do was to file them. I have spices that are older than my youngest child (16), so I must have moved house with them twice already. I have more defunct appliances than I could name, and fair enough, it is hard to bin a soup maker or an air fryer when you have no clue why they stopped working – if it’s that random, who’s to say they won’t start working again?

Instead it debased the freedom of speech it symbolisesRokhaya DialloThe satirical title targeted in an Islamist attack 10 years ago published a racist, sexist caricature of me that speaks volumes about its valuesTue 13 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareThe day before Christmas Eve, just as France readied itself to slip into the holiday slowdown, something abruptly shook me out of any festive torpor. The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, known globally and tragically for being thetarget of an Islamist attackin 2015 published a caricature – of me. And it wasappallingly racist. A huge, toothy grin, an enormous mouth, the cartoon depicts me dancing on a stage before an audience of laughing white men, adorned with a banana belt on a largely exposed body. The headline: “The Rokhaya Diallo Show: Mocking secularism around the world.”Stunned by the violence of this grotesque cartoon, I shared it on social mediawith a brief analysis: “In keeping with slave-era and colonial imagery, Charlie Hebdo once again shows itself incapable of engaging with the ideas of a Black woman without reducing her to a dancing body – exoticised, supposedly savage – adorned with the very bananas that are hurled at Black people who dare to step into the public sphere.”The reference toJosephine Bakerwas as obvious as it was disrespectful and incomprehensible. One of the most iconic performances of the American-born dancer, actor and activist in the 1920s involved Baker in a (rubber) banana skirt, at a time when France took pride in displaying what it claimed was its superiority over the territories of its colonial empire. But Baker was far more than the act whose erotic charge she deliberately chose to subvert through exaggerated, clownish gestures. She was amember of the French Resistance, a recipient of France’s highest military honours, the only woman to speak at the 1963 March on Washington led by Martin Luther King Jr, and the only Black woman interred in Le Panthéon, the national mausoleum for France’s greatest figures. I was therefore dismayed to see the Baker legend reduced to a grotesque, minstrel show-like grimace.From the moment I posted my reaction, the controversy took off. Millions upon millions of views across my social media, outraged reactions and analytical content produced in several languages to unpack the image’s colonial undertones. I received a level of attention and support that I could not have imagined when I first shared my disgust.But instead of acknowledging the obvious racism, Charlie Hebdo used the clumsiest form of gaslighting. The magazinerespondedto the wave of protests by accusing me of a “manipulation”– one I was supposedly familiar with – claiming that I had “distorted” the image by presenting it “separated from its text”. As though any accompanying article could possibly justify the use of such despicable imagery.The said article accuses me of being “America’s little sweetheart”, operating from foreign platforms such as the Guardian to smear what they call “my country of birth” – a phrasing that, to my mind, insinuates that I am not fully French. As a Black Muslim woman, I am well aware that any public criticism ofFranceis routinely read by racists as the betrayal of an ungrateful immigrant’s daughter. Yet even setting aside this poisonous framing of my positions, the article offers no coherent link – neither political, nor historical, nor symbolic – to Josephine Baker. It has absolutely nothing to do with Josephine Baker, or with bananas.The most absurd element lies in Charlie Hebdo’s conclusion, where the magazine claims to be “an anti-racist, feminist, and universalist newspaper” which, in its view, is what I “blame” it for. In a move that France has perfected, an all-white editorial team defends a racist cartoon drawn by a white man by turning the accusation back on to the Black victim – an author of some 20 books and documentaries on race and gender – branding her as hostile to anti-racism and feminism. It would be funny if it weren’t so pathetic.In my message denouncing this drawing, I also wrote, “this hideous cartoon is meant to remind me of my place in the racial and sexist hierarchy”,because I fully understood what lay behind this device. Stripping me and placing me in a humiliating posture is a way of discrediting me as a legitimate interlocutor, of reminding me of the fate imposed on my ancestors, whose humanity was denied.Josephine Baker made her dancing debut in Paris at the age of 19. Before her death in 1975, she became a film actor, the most photographed woman in the world, a pilot, a spy for France – the nation she made her own – and an anti-racist activist, among many other things. Yet Charlie Hebdo proved incapable of invoking her in any way other than by reducing her to a naked body costumed in colonial trappings.And what matters here is this: our trajectories have little in common. The decision to link me to a 19-year-old woman (I am 47) who rose to fame a century ago in a field that has nothing to do with mine reveals the extent to which white supremacy renders Black women interchangeable.In this controversy, the issue is not only about me but about all of us who, on a daily basis, are confronted withmisogynoir– the intertwining of sexist and anti-Black violence theorised by academic Moya Bailey – that descends on any Black woman who dares to step outside the secondary role to which postcolonial societies persist in trying to confine her.Charlie Hebdo sought to sanction a woman it deemed too audacious, and a Black person who does not rely on the French media to make her voice heard.It is no coincidence that among the thousands of messages of support I received – including a statement from the historicLigue des Droits de l’Homme– was one from the former French justice ministerChristiane Taubira, the first Black woman to hold that position in 2012.Taubira was herself subjected to some of the most vicious racist attacks, including avile Charlie Hebdo cartoon. With the exceptional command of language she is renowned for, Taubira characterised the drawing as “intellectually impoverished, visually flat, stylistically bland, semantically mediocre, and psychologically obsessive”.By attempting to discredit me as a legitimate participant in the public debate, Charlie Hebdo has also laid bare its unwillingness to engage on an equal footing. In seeking to humiliate me, the magazine has soiled itself – and debased the very freedom of expression of which it had become a symbol.Rokhaya Diallo is a French journalist, writer, film-maker and activistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is not a question designed to deflect from the barbarism being unleashed by Iran’s theocratic regime. Because it severed the country’s internet connection, facts are difficult to establish, but the respected Human Rights Activists inIranhas confirmed 544 have been killed and well over 10,000 arrested – those numbers are probably significant underestimates.Here is a regime that consolidated its power in the 1980s bybutchering leftists– helped, it should be noted,by both MI6 and the CIA, who supplied them with lists of alleged Soviet agents. Today,trade union activists are arrestedand tortured, while women’s activists languish in jails. The economic disaster resulting from sanctions may have helped spark these latest protests, but millions of Iranians are fed up with living under fundamentalist rule –underlined by surveys confirming growingreligious non-observance and opposition to the compulsory hijab.But those who believe freedom will arrive on the back of western bombs seem incapable of learning from the catastrophes that have defined this century. Donald Trump continues to threaten to bomb Iran,egged onby Reza Pahlavi, son of the late deposed shah. The one advantage of Trump is that – unlike his predecessors – he generally does not pretend to champion noble ideas. He incited an attempted coup against his own democracy, and after recently attacking Venezuela, made clear that oil was his primary concern. He has paid lip service to the protests in Iran. Butas far back as 1980, he publicly declared his support for intervening in the country, claiming that “right now we’d be an oil-rich nation” if the US had done so. Similarly, overseeing thekilling of Qassem Suleimani, and attacking the Fordow nuclear facility at a time of extreme regional tension, were hardly done with the best interests of average Iranians in mind.And long before Trump, the US had no objection to supporting tyranny in the Middle East, not least Saudi Arabia, which beheads dissidents, and reportedly committed war crimes in Yemen, such as blowing up aschool bus packed with children, with US bombs. Trump’s recently published national security strategy even abandons the previous US pretence of supporting democracy, committing to abandoning a “misguided experiment with hectoring” the Gulf autocracies “into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government”. And indeed facilitating Israel’s genocide should have been more than sufficient to eradicate any remaining illusions about the motivations of American power.Iran’s nightmare began with western intervention. It was Britain and the United States that engineered the coup against the progressive democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. It was justified by thethen secretary of state, John Foster Dulles on the grounds that the “free world” would be “deprived of the enormous assets represented by Iranian oil production and reserves”.The new shah tolda CIA agent: “I owe my throne to God, my people, my army, and to you.” The 1979 Iranian revolution emerged from the brutality of this dictatorship.View image in fullscreenStreet protests in Tehran on 8 January 2026.Photograph: ReutersAnd what of the record of western intervention in the Muslim world? The catastrophe of the Iraq war is well understood, but too little attention has been devoted to the role of exiled Iraqi politicians returning to the country. They sought to establish legitimacy in the aftermaththrough religious sectarianism– which then helped unleash the catastrophic bloodletting between Shia and Sunni militants that ripped Iraq apart.InAfghanistan, the plight of women under the Taliban was cited in favour of western intervention: yet after two decades of bloody occupation ended and the Taliban returned to power, their nightmare is worse than ever. In Libya, the pretext was to defend protesters from a violent crackdown by the regime. Violent civil war ensued, which jihadists opportunistically exploited, and 15 years later the country remains with no central authority as two rival governments battle it out.Iran is much larger than any of these examples, and ethnically and religiously diverse. Its population is three-and-a-half times bigger thanIraqat the time of the invasion. Its rich tapestry includes Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Lurs, Arabs and Turkmens. There is no question that a large majority of Iran’s people have run out of patience with the corrupt theocracy that reigns over them. But the regime has a much bigger and entrenched support base than any of those previous examples. Millions still vote for ultra-conservative candidates.Unlike in other protests, we’ve seen attacks on religious sites. This clearly comes from a fury that has grown among some Iranians at spending their lives being force-fed religious dogma. But it also hints at the sort of divisions that could erupt, not least ifPahlavicomes to power, given the chauvinistic and ultranationalist positions of many of his key advisers.And Israel looms large. Trump’s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo tweeted: “Happy new year to every Iranian in the streets. Also to every Mossad agent walking beside them.”An Israeli ministerhas boasted that “our people are working there right now”. We’ve seen how Israel has sought to undermine post-Assad Syria, both by routinely attacking it and promoting its Balkanisation. Israel clearly believes its relative strength in the Middle East is best served by weakened and chaos-afflicted neighbours – rather than a genuinely free and democratic Iran.Given the dire precedents, it would surely be lunacy to believe that despite all these disastrous western interventions, the one that will finally succeed will be underDonald Trump. The truth should be obvious – the US is not driven by the best interests of the Iranians. It would be a tragedy if this lesson – written in the blood of Iraqis, Afghans and Libyans – were ignored once again.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionProtestUS foreign policyDonald TrumpAfghanistanLibyaIraqcommentShareReuse this content"

Pip is designed to support disabled people with the additional costs of daily living and mobility, yet for many claimants it has instead become a source of prolonged uncertainty, financial hardship and distress. Waiting months –and in some cases more than a year– for a decision can push people into debt, rent arrears and poverty, especially as Pip unlocks other support such ascarer’s allowance.Parliament has been sounding the alarm over the scale of the problem – but it appears the Department for Work and Pensions has its fingers in its ears. The stock response is that a new “health transformation programme” will lead to efficiency gains made by replacing paper Pip applications with an online claims system. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,the chair of the public accounts committee, last weekpointedout that MPs had been told “three years ago that improvements would have manifested by now; we are now told that they are a further three years off”.The figures tell the story. The department aims to process 75% of new Pip claims within 75 working days, but, in 2024–25, only 51% of claims were processed within this timeframe. Despite this, the department continues to present long-term digital reform as its primary answer, while offering little reassurance that waiting times will improve meaningfully in the near future. Theresultis a widening gap between policy intent and lived reality.For disabled people who rely on Pip to remain financially secure and independent, delay is not a neutral administrative issue – it is pushing them into poverty. Added to that, it is considerably more expensive to live as a disabled person. Charities say that disabled householdsneed to find £625 more each yearthan non-disabled households just for the basic essentials such as energy bills and transport.Post-Covid Britain has seen more people with long-term illness, worsening mental health and the numbers of people reporting adisabilityincreasing sharply. The result is more new Pip claims each year, even as the system struggles to process existing ones.The minister for social security and disability – Sir Stephen Timms – was tasked with undertaking a review of Pip, including the assessment model, and isexpected to report this year. But the committee is blunt in telling the government that it cannot allow the review to become another excuse for delay. Reform and speed are not mutually exclusive, and claimants should not have to wait years for basic administrative competence.The problem that MPs identify is that this fits a broader pattern in three distinct ways. One is that while Pip is legally an entitlement, it looks as if it is being administratively rationed by delay. It is also hard not to feel thatdigital transformationbeing is used as a shield against parliamentary accountability. And what is happening is that ministers talk about reform while frontline capacity erodes. Clearly the committee’s patience is running out – and with very good reason. Cynics might suggest it suits ministers not to have to hire extra staff to cope with increased Pip demand while the tech solution comes on stream sometime in the future. The state could fix this. It just refuses to name the problem correctly.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The cost of living iserodinghis support ahead of the congressional midterms. By launching a legal assault on the Fed, Mr Trump is trying to shift blame for borrowing costs.Yet despite controlling the presidency, Senate and the House, Republicans have passed little beyond a large tax-cutting bill that benefits the rich. They have not legislated on housing supply, childcare, healthcare costs or wages. Indeed most of their actions areworseningaffordability, notably deferring action even though millions face a sharp rise in theirhealth insurance bills. Mr Trump’s sudden enthusiasm forcredit card capsand housing interventions is pure opportunism.Affordability is not an abstract talking point; it is increasingly driving US politics. The rise of New York’s Zohran Mamdani – whose victory was built by zeroing in on the cost of living – crystallised a broader shift: voters respond to real help, not rhetorical blame. Clearly, Mr Mamdani offered concrete policies and institutional reform.Democraticleaders are listening. Importantly, Senator Elizabeth Warren ispreparedto take on the vested interests in her own party. Republicans have offered gestures, scapegoats and reversals of their own past consumer protections.Until recently President Trump described the affordability crisis is a “hoax” invented by Democrats. For ordinary Americans, however, it is a rising grocery bill eating into already fragile household finances. Then at the end of November Mr Trumpdeclaredhe was the “AFFORDABILITY PRESIDENT” and he would deliver Republican midterm victories. If this prediction were realised it would be a triumph of spin over substance. Mr Trump’s own policies – tariffs, weaker than expected wage gains and elevated prices – resulted in an estimated 3% hit to median household spending power.Thomas Edsallin the New York Times reckoned the average American household lost about $2,250 in spending power in 2025.Mr Trump’s economic policies are defined by theatrical announcements that do no more than gesture at confrontation with corporate power. Hispromiseto ban institutional investors from buying more single-family homes briefly rattled markets, yet it remains conspicuously vague – there is no legislation, no enforcement mechanism, no challenge to the tax privileges and regulatory carve-outs that fuel real-estate consolidation. In practice, his administration has done the opposite:settlingantitrust cases,throttlingfunding for consumer protections and givingreal-estatetax breaks.The US president claims to want to smash a system stacked against ordinary people. What he actually does is make small changes that leave powerful interests better protected than before. The latest wheeze over pollution is a case in point. By telling theEnvironmental Protection Agencyto stop counting the health benefits of clean air, his administration makes it easier for polluters to cut costs while voters pay the price in illness, missed work and shorter lives.Mr Trump is not lifting all boats, only raising tolerance for corruption and pollution that benefit a plutocratic class. He trades in symbolic hostility toward corporate excess while promoting policies that entrench it. That is why affordability remains elusive – and why scapegoats, from theFedto “Democrats”, must continually be found.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Americans need to focus on challenging repression on the streets of Minneapolis, Chicago and Portland, rather than stoking insurrection in Tehran. The time for America to play-act being the world’s policeman as a front to whitewash its worldwide exploitation and hegemony is over.Raza GriffithsChatham, KentDonald Trump says “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before” (Iran warns US against attack as protest death toll reportedly soars, 11 January). Is there anybody out there old enough to judge how close Iran came to it in 1953, before the US and the UK aided the overthrow of an elected government, and whether anything has happened since to convince Iranians that they can trust either of those countries?Bryn HughesWrexhamAs a survivor of two consecutive dictatorships in Iran, I urge the international media to accurately reflect the aspirations of the Iranian people. My family has paid the ultimate price for freedom: my father, Iraj Karim, died under brutal torture, and my mother, Fatemeh Kharazian, was destroyed by the current regime’s interrogators.The world must understand that the popular slogan “No to the Shah, no to the Sheikh” is a definitive rejection ofallforms of tyranny. Millions of Iranians are not looking to restore the Pahlavi monarchy; instead, they seek a democratic republic. Social media campaigns attempting to revive the previous dictatorship do not represent the will of those on the ground.The democratic alternative presented by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and the 10-point plan drawn up by Maryam Rajavi – the Iranian dissident politician and leader of the People’s Mujahedin of Iran organisation – offers a viable path to a secular, non-nuclear and democratic Iran. This plan is a guarantee for human rights and global peace.Maged KarimBerlin, GermanyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Corporations have rights without minds. The 2016 EU parliament resolution on “electronic personhood” for autonomous robots made exactly this point – liability, not sentience, was the proposed threshold.The question isn’t whether AI systems “want” to live. It’s what governance infrastructure we build for systems that will increasingly act as autonomous economic agents – entering contracts, controlling resources, causing harm. Recent studies from Apollo Research and Anthropic show that AI systems already engage in strategic deception to avoid shutdown. Whether that’s “conscious” self-preservation or instrumental behaviour is irrelevant; the governance challenge is identical.Simon Goldstein and Peter Salibargue on the Social Science Research Networkthat rights frameworks for AI may actually improve safety by removing the adversarial dynamic that incentivises deception. DeepMind’s recent work on AI welfare reaches similar conclusions.The debate has moved past “Should machines have feelings?” towards “What accountability structures might work?”PA LopezFounder, AI Rights Institute, New YorkAs humans, we rarely question our own right to legal protection, even though our species has caused conflict and harm for thousands of years. Yet when the subject turns to artificial intelligence, fear seems to dominate the discussion before understanding even begins. That imbalance alone is worth examining.If we are genuinely concerned about the risks of advanced AI, then perhaps the first step is not to assume the worst, but to ask whether fear is the right foundation for decisions that will shape the future. Avoiding the conversation won’t stop the technology from developing; it only means we leave the direction of that development to chance.This isn’t an argument for treating AI as human, nor a call to grant it personhood. It’s simply a suggestion that we might benefit from a more open, balanced debate – one that looks at both the risks and the possibilities, rather than only the rhetoric of threat. When we frame AI solely as something to fear, we close off the chance to set thoughtful expectations, safeguards and responsibilities.We have an opportunity now to approach this moment with clarity rather than panic. Instead of asking only what we’re afraid of, we could also ask what we want, and how we can shape the future with intention rather than reaction.D EllisReadingExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputinglettersShareReuse this content"

It would prove the best chance of an underwhelming first half.Like Wissa, Erling Haaland’s touches were strictly rationed and, perhaps distracted by Nick Pope’s outstretched toe the Norwegian centre-forward spurned his one and only opening of the first 45 minutes following Bernardo Silva’s dangerous cross. Too often he and Semenyo entered each other’s orbits moving with the suspicion of strangers.Initially it all left both Pope and Trafford – who came close to joining Newcastle from Burnley last summer and is still much admired by Howe – with relatively little to do. Guardiola though still looked a little uneasy as the impressive Lewis Miley and Murphy aimed to pressure arguably City’s weakest defensive link, their left-back, Nathan Aké at every opportunity.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo’s second goal is ruled out by the video assistant referee.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersWith tension, and tempers, mounting Nico O’Reilly and Joelinton squared up in midfield and began pushing and shoving each other in the manner of children in a primary school playground. Both were shown yellow cards.Howe, too, lost his composure. After detecting some slapdash midfield play on Jacob Ramsey’s part, Newcastle’s manager looked in danger of spontaneous combustion as he leapt forward punching thin air and screaming invective at a player selected ahead of the fatigued Sandro Tonali.If his mood hardly improved as a hamstring injury forced Murphy’s replacement by Harvey Barnes shortly before the interval, at least his full-backs, Miley and Lewis Hall, were ensuring that City’s own wingers, Semenyo and, to a lesser extent, Jérémy Doku, were generally being kept on reasonably tight reins.The same applied to Wissa but when a striker who struggled to hold the ball up throughout finally escaped his minders and directed a looping header goalwards, Trafford made a save of such high calibre that it was all too easy to see why Howe still covets him.As Bruno Guimarães lashed the rebound on to the post it seemed a watershed moment had arrived and, almost immediately, Semenyo stepped out of the shadows.Unlike Wissa, he made the very most of that emergence into the sunlight. When Barnes hesitated, Doku pounced unleashing a cross that Silva helped into Semenyo’s path. All that remained was for the£62.5m signingfrom Bournemouth to score his second goal in two games as a City player.By way of emphasising his special talent, Semenyo swiftly spotted that Newcastle had lost concentration at a corner and backheeled a glorious improvisational “goal” beyond Pope. Newcastle were rescued by a five minute and 30 second long video assistant referee review that eventually detected a marginal offside against Haaland. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, was called to his monitor and he disallowed the goal.City defeat a reminder Newcastle have entered a level where it’s eat or be eaten | Andy BrassellRead moreGuardiola appeared suitably unimpressed. And rightly so. It was unfair on both the crowd and the players who could definitely have done without standing around for so long in the January chill.Howe responded to this, albeit temporary, reprieve by introducing Tonali, Nick Woltemade and Anthony Elanga in place of Ramsey, Gordon and Wissa. With virtually his first touch, Tonali met Elanga’s cut-back and sent a left-foot shot whizzing fractionally wide.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki sweeps the ball home right before the final whistle to double Manchester City’s lead.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockFor a while Newcastle rallied but the hosts were ultimately undone by a move of outstanding attacking fluency down City’s left.

Disasi, the former Monaco centre-back, has been in limbo and the issue with Sterling is that the former England winger has 18 months on a contract worth about £325,000 a week. Chelsea’s preference would be to move players on this month but Rosenior wants to speak to them to work out the best way forward.“I’ve had so much on,” the 41‑year‑old coach said. “I’ve been in for three days. This is my fourth day in the job. I will have conversations with them. Raheem’s had an outstanding career. I’ve got huge respect for him and Axel, who was someone I’ve really, really liked for a long time. But in this moment, with the amount of games that we’ve got, I haven’t got on to that topic. I will do it in the next few days.”Sterling has interest from Fulham but Rosenior did not close the door on the former Manchester City forward and Disasi making unlikely returns to the squad. “I have to have a conversation with them. I have to have a conversation with the club. I’ve got to work through a list of priority. It’s been a whirlwind.”Chelsea are unlikely to be busy before the transfer window shuts but are open to opportunities. ­Rosenior, who played his second string when he opened his reignwith a 5-1 victory against ­Charltonin the FA Cup last Saturday, will take a closer look at his players before speaking to the club’s recruitment team about potential reinforcements.View image in fullscreenAxel Disasi has not played for Chelsea in almost a year.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images“The first conversation I had with the guys is that I want to assess the most important players, which is the guys that are here,” he said.“Normally you get good surprises if you give people a chance. I had some really good surprises in the game against Charlton. The performance from some of the players who maybe haven’t played as much this season was outstanding.“I want to give them a chance. We’re in January and we want the club to be as successful as possible in the short term, but I also think sometimes the answers lay within the building and not outside. So I’ll make a decision on that with the guys probably later in the window when I’ve seen everyone play.”Chelsea face Arsenal knowing that they held the best side in the countrywhen playing with 10 menin the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in November. Rosenior will have to adjust without the suspended Moisés Caicedo in midfield while Cole Palmer is an injury doubt for the game having struggled since returning from a groin strain last month.“He’s a special talent,” Rosenior said. “My job is to get to know him, to connect with him, to understand what gets the best out of him. And that takes time. The scary thing with Cole is he has already got world-class ability but he’s only 23.”Chelsea have six games left this month and Rosenior will manage Palmer’s load carefully. “I’ve had a really good, in-depth conversation with Cole today,” he said. “I’ve had a really good, in-depth conversation with the medical team. It would be crazy for me to risk any player in this phase of the season.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaRaheem SterlingnewsShareReuse this content"

Regarding the decision to withdraw from X, he also pointed to the fact members of the England ­women’s football squad were attacked on the platform last summer. “Sport should always be a place where everyone feels safe and welcome,” he said.“Those are ­values worth standing up for. When a space undermines that, walking away is not weakness – it is a responsibility. Last summer we urged action on the horrific sexist and racist abuse being levelled at our Lionesses. Alongside these actions, we have to make choices about where we show up as an organisation and where we don’t.”However, Boardman also took a broader aim atElon Musk, saying that the tone on the platform had become worse in recent years. “X has become a less effective way for us to do our job. The tone of conversation has grown increasingly divisive and reductive.“We recognise that some people and organisations believe staying in difficult spaces and challenging harmful narratives from within is the right approach. For Sport England, however, stepping away from X is the right decision. Tech companies – particularly X – must take greater responsibility for the environments they create and the content they amplify.”This week Ofcomlaunched an investigation into Xover concerns that Grok is being used to create sexualised images. The government has also said it will bring into force a law that will make it illegal to create such non-consensual images.Explore more on these topicsSport politicsSport EnglandGrok AIElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Saying it is one thing, doing it another, doing it successfully something else entirely and a month and day after being offered that advice, handed that defence,Alonso was gone. On Monday afternoon, not long after landing from Saudi Arabia, a meeting was held at Valdebebas and then came the statement, short and unsentimental. He was a “legend” as a player, but no longer coach at Real Madrid.Alonso is the 11th manager to last less than a year in two decades under the president, Florentino Pérez. He had begun work only seven months before, and that was earlier than he intended. It had started with the Club World Cup in the US, his first big decision to accept the demand to take over sooner than he wanted, and it ended with the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah, where it was an open secret that final judgment awaited. For a month it had been impossible to avoid the feeling of a manager on borrowed time, especially for the manager himself, exposed and undermined, and you cannot go on like that. There will be hurt pride, regret, but release too.Xabi Alonso leaves Real Madrid after seven months and replaced by Álvaro ArbeloaRead moreTo become Real Madrid manager two things have to happen, Alonsosaid at his presentationin May: “First they have to want you, then you have to want to … and the latter normally does happen.” Even then, neither position was held quite as enthusiastically as it should have been; even the courtship had been unusually cold. “The challenge now is to build a team, to get the potential out of all those players and ensure that we all work together as one,” Alonso said. “Because if we do we will have a strength that is … I’m not going to say unstoppable, but very powerful.”Presented as a systems coach, what Madrid supposedly needed after a season oflaissez-fairefailure, Alonso was countercultural at a players’ club. At, above all, a president’s club where you must manage upwards too. Álvaro Carreras and Dean Huijsen arrived, but Alonso’s requests for Martín Zubimendi were rejected. He would have to find a holding midfielder in the squad, to attempt an evolution with Arda Guler. Alonso came with a consciously collective discourse: it didn’t matter who you were, you were going to run. Briefly, very briefly, there were glimpses of that in the US: a structure, pressure, an idea forming, a new identity. Butthen came Paris Saint-Germainto reveal the size of his task and, in the final analysis, it didn’t happen. The team Alonso envisaged didn’t exist, leaving him frustrated at their failure to learn.PSG scored four past them,Atlético five. They weretaken apart by Celta Vigoat home; there had been an urge to sack Alonso that night. Thesemi-final victoryagainst Atlético in the Super Cup came with an asterisk: Diego Simeone’s side had been far superior. In the final on Sunday nightBarcelona scored three– although many saw dignity in defeat, maybe even survival, some reason to carry on. The timing of his sacking caught almost everyone by surprise, even if the underlying fact did not.Quick GuideArbeloa in hot seatShowEight minutes passed between Real Madrid announcing the sacking of Xabi Alonso revealing the man who would replace him: the new coach at the Santiago Bernabéu would be his friend and former teammate, Alvaro Arbeloa.“We spoke for a good while yesterday,” Arbeloa said on Tuesday lunchtime. “What we said stays between us. He wished me the best and I wished him the best, too. You all know the relationship, the friendship, that unites us, how much I love and appreciate him. That is mutual and will continue to be mutual. We’ll be close as we have been all these years.”Theotherformer Liverpool and Real Madrid player follows Alonso on to the Bernabéu bench having been promoted from the B team, Castilla. Seen as a club man, close to the president, and from the José Mourinho mould, during his first press conference Arbeloa avoided answering questions about whether this is a permanent role or an interim post after which he could remain within the structure. “I will be Real Madrid for as long as Real Madrid want me to,” he said. “I am conscious of the responsibility I have.“For me it was an honour and a privilege to be coached by José Mourinho. He was someone who influenced me a lot, I carry a lot of him in me. I don’t fear failure at all, but if I tried to be Jose Mourinho I would be a resounding failure.”Aware of his audience, Arbeloa made much of Madrid’s status as the “best club in the world and in history\", said that the youth structure is the best in football.When asked to define “play well”, he said that Madrid’s mission was just “to win, win, win, and win again”, and later said that the players had to “enjoy” playing. He claimed that often people are reluctant to give the credit they deserve. “There are players here who have won six European Cups, which seems to be forgotten,” he said.“Helping those trophy cabinets to fill: that’s my mission and my obsession, what I am going to live for every day.”Sid LoweWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best moment had been in theleagueclásicoagainst Barcelonain October. And yet that became the worst too, fault lines appearing in front of 80,000 people. When Alonso removed Vinícius Júnior late on, the Brazilian stormed straight down the tunnel, his fury there for all to see, shouting that he would walk straight out on the team too. “We’ll talk about it, of course,” Alonso said. “But I don’t want to lose focus of what’s truly important: a lot of the things we wanted to do have happened.”Yet it soon became clear that Vinícius’s huffwasthe truly important thing, not the victory. His anger, deeper than just one game, eclipsed all else and he was not the only one. Fede Valverde’s complaints about playing at full‑back were also made publicly, while details filtered out about a disconnect, discontent: a familiar lament about all the instructions, the videos, the long sessions. Who did he think he was? The manager?The dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti as “only” a man manager, the idea that it is easy amid these egos, needs some revising. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that seven players have stayed silent since Alonso’s sacking, not offering the usual social media platitudes, Vinícius among them.The reaction, or lack of it, to Vinícius’s outburst only deepened the problem. Or, perhaps more accurately, revealed it. Rather than censoring the Brazilian’s behaviour, backing their manager, the private response from the club was blunt: well, he shouldn’t have taken Vinícius off.Publicly there was nothing, the manager’s authority vanishing. Vinícius posted an apology in which he pointedly mentioned everyone except Alonso. Stories soon emerged that he would not renew his contract for as long as Alonso was around; that he had allowed it to run towards the final 18 month, unable to reach an agreement independently of any issues with the coach, went unsaid.View image in fullscreenVinícius Júnior’s relationship with Xabi Alonso was strained and ultimately, the club took the player’s side.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/APAll this when things were going well, or sort of. Madrid’s performances had not been especially inspiring and theirdestruction in the derbyhad hurt, but they came out of theclásicotop of the table, five points clear of Barcelona with nine wins from 10. Something, though, had been broken. There was a victory over Valencia, thendefeat in Liverpool, three successive draws in La Liga, at Rayo Vallecano,Elcheand Girona, and a chaotic andconcerning 4-3 win at Olympiakos, the tension palpable.Efforts were made to bring the squad together, to improve relationships. Discussions held in team hotels in Athens then Bilbao sought common ground and appeared reasonably successful. On the nightMadrid beat Athletic, Vinícius publicly embraced Alonso. The fix, though, was fleeting and the most basic thing of all still wasn’t good: the football. Four days later, they lost to Celta, the threat of the sack made explicit that night. From five ahead of Barcelona, they are now four behind.Three days later came City, led by Guardiola, with whom Alonso had first started to fully embrace the idea of being a coach. Madrid competed, which was something, no complaints about the effort this time. And when Rodrygo scored, he ran to embrace Alonso, butCity won 2-1. There was a stay of execution, not least because there appeared little alternative. But, still, theyhad lost. And another defeat would be definitive.Before that game, Guardiola was asked whether he had any advice for Alonso. “Yes,” the City coach said,offering a responsethat served as a defence of his friend too:“Que mee con la suya.”Alonso should piss with his own penis. In other words, do it your way: the decisions should be his, not imposed by dressing room or boardroom. His team should be built on conviction, not accommodation. If he were to die, die with his own boots on.When that was put to Alonso, he allowed that idea to hang, for those listening to conclude that Guardiola’s implicit criticism of Madrid was not entirely misplaced, by replying: “I have a good relationship with Pep, we know each other well and he knows what he is saying.”Yet doing it entirely your own way is impossible. Here especially. Better not to die at all. “Being Madrid manager is not about changing [the culture], it is about adapting,” Alonso said. “We know the culture ofReal Madridpretty well; that is why it is the biggest club in the world. You have to adapt, learn a lot, interact with the players. Some days are good, some not so good. We have to face that with energy and positivity, that is the only way to turn things around.”It wasn’t easy, and his ideas were rarely apparent. He had started with Valverde leading the pressure. At least partly obliged by absences, now he had him at full-back. With Vinícius and Kylian Mbappé up front, nor did Madrid press as Alonso had planned. Dani Carvajal was their only real leader, and he was injured. Vinícius went 16 games until Sunday without a goal. There was no one to run the game from the middle, the fundamental piece that Alonso had been and had asked for.For all the talk of a collective, it was still individual players doing their thing that won them games. Mbappé has 29 goals in all competitions, almost half of all Madrid’s. It’s a process, Alonso said from time to time, but six months had passed and patience was thin. Project? The project at Madrid, as Álvaro Arbeloa put it on Tuesday after succeeding Alonso, is to “win, win, win, and win again”.View image in fullscreenÁlvaro Arbeloa said the project at Real Madrid is to ‘win, win, win, and win again’.Photograph: Europa Press Sports/Europa Press/Getty ImagesThe injuries seemed endless, especially in defence, and the club’s criticism about the physical preparation filtered out through familiar channels. Antonio Pintus, the fitness coach still there in an advisory role but not on Alonso’s staff – a man sidelined under Ancelotti – travelled with them to Saudi Arabia. The former doctor Niko Mihic had returned, now there was pressure to integrate Pintus again, but this time the manager did resist, a red line crossed. On Monday afternoon, the statement came out. Alonso had gone. By “mutual consent”, they said.One more defeat was always likely to be definitive, and in aclásicomore. At the end of the Super Cup final, Alonso tried to get his players to line up and give Barcelona a guard of honour but Mbappé refused, waving them away from there. Alonso gave up, another damaging portrait of what they had become. During the medal ceremony, the manager’s handshake with Pérez looked like two men trying to avoid catching something, still less each other’s eye.At the end of what would be his 34th and last game as manager of Madrid, Alonso was asked about their encounter, whether he had been able to talk to the president about everything, about his future and theirs. “Nah, it was brief,” he said. And it had been.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridXabi AlonsoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That record extended in the evening session as John Higgins saw off Barry Hawkins, 6-2, to reach the last eight.After edging the first frame following a run of snookers, Wilson – yet to win a tournament this season having broken his cue at the start of the campaign – looked set to build a maximum in the next, but just missed the 11th red into the bottom corner pocket as he moved 2-0 ahead.Mark Allen advances past Williams in Masters despite battle with food poisoningRead moreSi got on the board with a well-crafted break of 97 before the world No 2, who lost to Shaun Murphyin last year’s Masters final, dug in to re-establish his lead at 3-1 heading into the mid-session interval.Although Si pulled another one back by taking a close fifth frame, Wilson, looking to move on from a disappointing first-round exit to Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship, then took the sixth 82-28 before closing out an impressive victory with successive century breaks of 101 and 105.Speaking before the match, Wilson had described his defeat to Slessor as “one of the lowest points I’ve ever had”, and was understandably in a far more upbeat mood after reaching the last eight, particularly when it came to his new cue.“It has been a really tough time so I thank you for all your love you have given me, it really lifted me,” he told the crowd after his win. “This venue can bring the best out of you. I still have a lot of time in this game so hopefully I can conqueror this venue for a long time. Having a cue I’m happy with, I’m just so excited I can deliver – the cue is so important.

Despite losing the first frame, the 50-year-old Scot eased into a 3-1 lead, eventually completing six half-centuries – with a highest break of 99 – as he sealed a 6-2 victory.“I was delighted with the way I hit the ball,” Higgins said afterwards. “Even at the start, I felt good in myself and Barry didn’t play as well as he can, but I’m delighted to beat someone as good as him.”Higgins will face the reigning world champion, Zhao Xintong, in an enticing quarter-final on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsSnookerJohn HigginsnewsShareReuse this content"

Russell has already messaged Duhan van der Merwe to warn him to expect a tough night and says the English champions are seeking to sharpen their attacking game in pursuit of a crucial home draw for the knockout phase.With the victorious side at the Rec set to top pool 2, the Scottish playmaker is anticipating a physical examination from an Edinburgh team he knows extremely well. “I’d imagine there’ll be a couple of late shots and being held on the ground which is always the case when you’re against your old side,” said Russell, who spent the first half of his professional career at Glasgow.The Breakdown | Rugby is moving towards Moneyball-style data but value of flair remainsRead more“I’m not sure what the weather will be like but if it’s like it is now there’ll be a lot of balls going up in the air. I’ve already texted Duhan to tell him to be ready.“It’s good fun running into boys you know but there’s always bragging rights with the Six Nations coming up. If they win or we win we’ll wind each other up. Hopefully we’ll get the win on Friday night. If not it’ll be quite a rough [Six Nations] camp. Edinburgh will be coming down with everything to play for.”Russell also revealedBathare seeking to step their game up another gear after high-scoring defeats against Toulon and Northampton either side of Christmas. The loss of the popular attack coach Lee Blackett to England has also prompted some readjustments under his replacement, Martin Gleeson. “Since the November Tests we’ve spoken more about playing more expansively like we used to do last year and the year before,” Russell said.“Lee and Glees have different views about how we can run an attack shape so we’ve been figuring out how we can adjust and what works best for people. In the last few games we’ve gone slightly wider off 10. We have probably had more joy with that, focusing a little bit more on multi-phase and trying to take teams apart like that.”Edinburgh, even so, can still expect a daunting challenge up front. “With the forwards we’ve got why wouldn’t you use pick and go’s,” Russell said. “They’re so good at that. Its definitely a strength of ours but as backs we’re looking to try and be more expansive as well. It’s about getting the balance right.”View image in fullscreenDuhan van der Merwe has been texting Finn Russell as their teams prepare to play each other.Photograph: Jamie Johnston/Focus Images Ltd/ShutterstockBath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, meanwhile, feels Russell and his entire side are attracting more scrutiny after winning three titles last season. “If you are a player with Finn’s talent, sometimes an 8/10 performance isn’t good enough for some people.

Prices were down, he claimed, despite official data showing otherwise, and productivity was “smashing expectations”.Even as he touted achievements during the first year of his second term, Trump has started to acknowledge concerns over affordability across the US, with November’s midterm elections creeping closer. The White House has moved to roll out a series ofpolicyproposalsin recent days that aspire to address affordability.“We’ll go down as the greatest first year in history that nobody’s ever had, just based on the numbers,” Trump said inMichigan, citing inflation and GDP data that showed price growth had stabilized, and the economy grew at a higher pace at the end of 2025.US inflation held firm in December amid pressure on Trump over cost of livingRead moreInflation hascome down slightlysince the fall, but remains significantly above typical levels. While GDP growthunexpectedly surged last summer, it came amid a turbulent year for the US economy. Annualized inflation went down to a four-year low in April at 2.3% before crawling up to 3% by September. GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, for the first time since 2022.The US labor market, which Trump didn’t touch on in his speech, had a particularly volatile year – itsweakest since the pandemic– as the unemployment rate edged up to a four-year high.Trumpfired the federal government official in charge of labor statisticsin August, hours after data revealed jobs growth had stalled.On Tuesday, however, he extolled official data which he argued was without comparison. The numbers had been “unbelievable”, he said.Wall Street continues to trade near record highs – but Trump claimed the “real stiff Fed” was holding back the stock market. “They kill every rally,” he said. “You have a good quarter, and they want to kill it because they’re so petrified of inflation.”Trump continues to wage an extraordinarycampaignto control the Federal Reserve, which he has so far unsuccessfully tried to pressure to lower interest rates. Most recently, Jerome Powell was placed under acriminal investigationover testimony he gave on renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.Inresponse, Powell called the investigation pretext, noting that it followed the central bank’s decision to set “rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.Trump has claimed he did not know about the investigation.The widespreadbacklashhis administration has received for going after Powell did not stop the president from lobbing fresh attackson the Fed chair during his speech on Tuesday. Referring to the end of Powell’s term in May, Trump said: “The jerk will be gone soon.”Trump’s rosy assessment of the economy is far from universally shared. Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to aHarris Poll for the Guardianlast month.Trump deflected responsibility for economics challenges on to his predecessor, Joe Biden. “We inherited terrible growth, and we inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country,” he said.While inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022, during Biden’s tenure, by the time the former president left office, inflation was hovering at about 3%.Trump’s wide slate of tariffs, which caused a major stock sell-off last spring, caused significant economic turbulence in 2025. Though the market swiftly recovered, many of Trump’s tariffs remain either paused or in legal limbo.But according to Trump, tariffs have been an economic success. “TheTrump tariffshave delivered us trillions of dollars of new investment, unprecedented new partnerships,” he claimed.Though the supreme court is scheduled to rule soon on thelegalityof his 10% baseline tariff and his slate of so-called reciprocal tariffs, Trump suggested he would not be giving up his tariff strategy anytime soon, regardless of a ruling. “We’ll figure something out if we don’t win, but we should win,” he said.Trump also claimed that the recent US action in Venezuela set the stage for increased energy production, and would ultimately bring down prices, especially for donuts.“When gasoline gets to be $1.99 a gallon, everything comes down,” he said. “The donuts come down, the truck that delivers the donuts, the stove that makes the donuts, the whole thing it all comes down. And it’s coming down much faster than anybody can even believe.”While refusing to concede that any of his policies have increased the cost of living, Trump listed a string of policies policies designed to tackle affordability concerns – including plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, purchase $200bn worth of mortgage bonds, and get credit card companies tocap interest rates. Of the White House’s efforts to bring drug prices down, he argued: “On that alone, we should win the midterms.”The president intends to speak more about upcoming housing policies at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos next week, he said.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationDetroitMichiganUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He ended up having to charge his customer £16,000 to have drivers sit with the refrigerated truck in Calais for the month.He said trucks were being detained at Calais before Christmas because inspectors would not accept new UK paperwork for BSE clearance.In the end they rerouted one lorry in Chippenham for a meeting with a vet who handed over a bundle of new BSE certificates to take to Calais for the trucks being detained in the port.The first-hand accounts confirm the pre-Brexit warnings of exporters, hauliers and small businesses who could not afford the paperwork.EU wants ‘Farage clause’ in Brexit ‘reset’ talks with UKRead moreOvens’ remarks come as Brussels negotiators prepare for their first meeting over a new veterinary agreement with the EU in London next week, aimed at wiping out Brexit red tape.Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, opened the evidence session by telling witnesses that red tape was costing the UK an extra £8.4bn.“Goods trade is down 18% on five years ago, food and drink down 24%,” he said.Talks on removing the red tape on goods and drink exports begin in London next week, with a second meeting scheduled for Brussels the following week as both sides try and hammer out a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement.Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union, highlighted technical challenges in getting a deal where approaches to farming have already diversified.He said: “Oat farmers are currently allowed to use four mycotoxins that are allowed in the UK but not yet in the EU. Does this require a transition agreement?”Sean McGuire, director forEuropeat the Confederation of British Industry, said the EU has been “very very lukewarm” on other issues such as mutual recognition of professional qualifications such as architecture.Explore more on these topicsBrexitFood & drink industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She concluded instead that the cause was multiple injuries and that Long had died by suicide.In a section of the ruling dedicated to action that can be taken to prevent future deaths, Bradford said more could be done to highlight the risks posed by illegal gambling sites, and that she would send a report to government departments. People may not be aware they were gambling on an unlicensed site, she said.Long began betting on football with well-known licensed bookmakers, including Bet365, SkyBet and Betfred, according to evidence gathered by his family and previously shared with the Guardian.After recognising that he had a problem, he had begun receiving treatment for gambling addiction and signed up with GamStop.The scheme allows consumers to bar themselves from all online bookies and casinos for between six months and five years. GamStop shares data with licensed operators, which lock the customer out of all forms of gambling.‘It’s shattered our family’: how illicit offshore bookies exploit struggling gamblers who are trying to quitRead moreBut, as the Guardian has previously reported, an international network of unlicensed sites has targeted those who self-exclude by promoting themselves using phrases such as “Not on GamStop”.Such searches or adverts typically lead through to affiliate websites that list the “best” casinos and bookmakers not covered by GamStop.They are not on GamStop because they do not have a licence to operate in Great Britain, where compliance with the scheme is a legal requirement.During the final months of his life, Long placed more than 50 bets with what appear to be illicit online casinos via payment providers in Stockholm and Lagos, according to bank statements and interviews with his family.According to some estimates, gambling firms without a licence from the Gambling Commission are taking billions of pounds of bets in the UK illegally every year through dozens of easily available online brands.Miller told the court said such sites were “deliberately seeking to target people who are already experiencing harm” and were set up to “prey on” such people.He said some were advertised on social media sites such as Facebook. He described Meta’s actions to stop such adverts as “slightly disappointing” because they were “choosing not to” take down ads until they were asked. The Guardian has approached Meta for comment.The Guardian has previously found that many of the most popular of these websites appear to be owned and operated by a company called Santeda International. The company has a gambling licence in Curaçao, a Dutch-Caribbean island with a reputation for harbouring illicit gambling websites.A spokesperson for Santeda International has previously declined to provide details about its ownership. The spokesperson denied that Santeda targets self-excluded gamblers and said it had safer gambling tools in place.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, allocated an extra £26m over three years to the Gambling Commission in November’s budget to help it tackle the illegal gambling market. The commission is also expected to be granted new powers to take down websites.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

If we have to choose between the US andDenmarkhere and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU,” Nielsen said, adding that the island’s “goal and desire is peaceful dialogue, with a focus on cooperation”.Trump’s pursuit of the island was also a matter of “international law and our right to our own country”, he said.Trump first raised the idea of a US takeover of Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, in 2019, during his first term, and again in the weeks before he took office for his second term last January. But he has ramped up his rhetoric significantly this month, saying the USwould take it “one way or the other”.Trump’s most recent threats have prompted a geopolitical crisis, raised significant doubt over the survival of Nato and, for many of the 57,000 Greenlandic people who have found themselves at the centre of it, sleepless nights and anxiety over their safety, identity and futures.In Greenland’s snow-covered capital, Nuuk, the fear is palpable among residents who are faced with having to get on with their day-to-day lives while trying to grapple with potentially existential questions, amplified by a constant stream of news and updates on their phones. Meanwhile, the world’s media has descended on the small city that is geographically closer to New York than it is to Copenhagen, which continues to control Greenland’s foreign and security policy. One shop displayed T-shirts that said: “GREENLAND IS NOT FOR SALE!”The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, are due to hold a crunch meeting in Washington on Wednesday with the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio.Naaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, said on a visit to London on Tuesday that the Greenlandic government did not know what was on the agenda for the White House meeting. Urging the US to act as allies, she said: “For others it might be a piece of land but for us it is home.”The meeting comes as Trump has shocked the EU andNatoby refusing to rule out military force to seize the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which is covered by many of the protections offered by the two organisations because Denmark belongs to both.Frederiksen said it had not been easy for Denmark to “stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally”. She said something fundamental was at stake, and there was “much evidence the most challenging part lies ahead”.The fact was that “borders cannot be changed by force, and that small countries should not fear large countries”, she said. “That is why we are saying no. We are not looking for any conflict. But our message is clear. Greenland is not for sale.”Frederiksen has previously said a US invasion wouldlead to the end of Nato, and multipleEuropean leaders have pledgedtheir support for Greenland’s territorial integrity and right to self-determination. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, on Tuesday said that any US move to take control of Greenland “would be a real unprecedented situation in the history of Nato, and in the history of any defence alliance in the world”.Greenland is Europe’s credibility litmus test – it must show Trump that aggression carries a price | Fabian ZuleegRead moreAfter a meeting of the Danish parliament’s foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, the Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said he and Motzfeldt would meet the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in Brussels next Monday.Poulsen said Denmark planned a larger military presence alongside other Nato countries in Greenland this year, adding that Copenhagen sought “greater attention from Nato in relation to issues regarding Nato’s presence in and around the Arctic”.Trump argues the US needs to control Greenland to increase Arctic security in the face of an alleged threat from China and Russia. Rutte said on Tuesday all Nato members agreed that “when it comes to the protection of the Arctic, we have to work together”.The Nato chief declined repeatedly to comment on US demands, saying it was “not up to me to comment on discussions between allies”. He said the alliance was “working on the next steps” and was in “complete agreement on the urgency of the situation”.But Thomas Dans, Trump’s Arctic commissioner, said there could be meaningful US action taken in relation to Greenland in as little as “weeks or months”, telling USA Today that the president wants developments to move “at high speed”.Alliance members including France and Germany have floated suggestions including bolstering Nato’s presence in the region or stationing troops on Greenland itself. Diplomats say talks are at a very early stage and there are no concrete plans.In Nuuk, Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the opposition and the most US-friendly of Greenland’s political parties,told the Guardian the preferable outcome of the Washington talks was to reach a deal with the US. “They want to do a deal the easy way or the hard way: who wants the hard way?” he asked.He also questioned Løkke Rasmussen’s attendance, saying the talks had “nothing to do with Danish foreign politics, and everything to do with the Greenlandic people’s future”.Greenland has been moving toward independence since 1979, when it won self-rule from Denmark. The goal is shared by all political parties elected to the island’s parliament, although there are differences over the best timescale.Broberg accused Copenhagen of using “Nato, and the Danish ownership of Greenland” to have a say in Greenland’s future. “It shows that they are still not ready to actually let us go,” he said.Greenland’s government said on Mondayit could not “under any circumstances accept” a US takeover and would intensify its efforts to “ensure that the defence of Greenland is carried out within the framework of Nato”.It said it believed Greenland would remain a member of the western defence alliance “for ever” and that “all Nato member states, including the US, have a common interest” in the defence of the vast Arctic island.Additional reporting by Kiran StaceyExplore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkDonald TrumpNatoJD VanceMarco RubioEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,” the statement said.It was signed by 10 central bank governors including the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the chair of theEuropean Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. It was coordinated by the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements, which added its chair and general manager to the signatories.Why is Trump’s justice department investigating Fed chair Jerome Powell?Read moreOther signatories to the unprecedented statement include the central bank governors of Australia, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Brazil, South Korea, Norway and Canada.They pay testament to Powell’s “integrity” and “unwavering commitment to the public interest”, calling him a “respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him”.The boss of JP Morgan, the largest US bank, also warned against attacks on Powell, amid fears it would undermine central bank independence and ultimately push up borrowing costs.Jamie Dimon told reporters on Tuesday that he had “enormous respect” for the Fed chair, adding that “everyone we know believes in Fed independence. And anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view, will have the reverse consequences. It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase [interest] rates over time”.Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell, whom he appointed in 2018, for failing to cut interest rates fast enough.But the clash between the two men took a dramatic turn earlier this week whenPowell issued a strongly worded video statement, saying he was being prosecuted by the US Department of Justice.1:59US Federal Reserve chair says DOJ has threatened criminal indictment – videoHe called the move “unprecedented action [that] should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure” over monetary policy.He said he had been singled out because the Fed’s policymaking board had set interest rates “based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.Trump has moved to distance himself from the investigation, however, claiming he was unaware of it. “I don’t know anything about it,” hetold NBC News.Jeanine Pirro, the pro-Trump attorney general for the District of Columbia, who launched the investigation, claimed in a post on X on Monday night that the “legal process” was “not a threat” to Powell.“The word ‘indictment’ has come out of Mr Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach,” she added.Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that Pirro had not sought the approval of her superiors at the DoJ before launching the action against the Fed – but had no intention of abandoning it.Powell and his colleagues have cut interest rates three times since last summer, but Trump has urged them to move faster, and personallyattacked Powell as a “numbskull”.The DoJ has said the case relates to “abuse of taxpayer dollars” – understood to be in relation to costly renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.Powell is due to step down as chair of the Fed board in May, and Trump is expected to announce his successor in the coming weeks.The prospect of legal action has sparked concern among some Republican lawmakers. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sits on the Senate banking committee that oversees Fed appointments, said he would not confirm any nominee “until this legal matter is fully resolved”.The former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen had alreadycondemned the threat to Powellon Monday, saying the move could have “highly negative consequences”.“This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” their statement said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJerome PowellUS economyBank of EnglandEuropean Central BankEconomicsChristine LagardenewsShareReuse this content"

Environmental policy rollbacks by Donald Trump’s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.US emissions of carbon dioxide and methane had dropped 20% from 2005 to 2024, with a few one- or two-year increases in the overall downward trend. Traditionally, carbon pollution has risen alongside economic growth, but efforts to boost cleaner energy in recent years decoupled the two, so emissions would drop as gross domestic product rose.US plan to exploit Venezuela’s oil could eat up 13% of carbon budget to keep 1.5C limitRead moreBut that changed last year with pollution actually growing faster than economic activity, said study co-author Ben King, a director in Rhodium’s energy group. He estimated the US put 5.9bn tons (5.35bn metric tons) of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139m tons (126m metric tons) more than in 2024.The cold 2025 winter meant more heating of buildings, which often comes from natural gas and fuel oil that are big greenhouse gas emitters, King said. A significant and noticeable jump in electricity demand from datacenters and cryptocurrency mining meant more power plants producing energy. That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.A rise in natural gas prices helped create an 13% increase in coal power, which had shrunk by nearly two-thirds since its peak in 2007, King said.“It’s not like this is a huge rebound,” King said. “We’re not sitting here claiming that coal is back and going to dominate the sector or anything like that. But we did see this increase and that was a large part of why emissions went up in the power sector.”King said the list of more than two dozen proposed rollbacks of US environmental policies by the Trump administration had not been in place long enough to have an effect in 2025, but may be more noticeable in future years.“It’s one year of data so far,” King said. “So we need to see the extent to which this trend sustains.”Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of US power, Rhodium found. It will be interesting to see what happens as the Trump administration ends solar and wind subsidies and discourages their use, King said.“The economic case for adding renewables is quite strong still,” King said. “This stuff is cost-competitive in a lot of places. Try as they might, this administration can’t alter the fundamental economics of this stuff.”Before the Trump administration took office, the Rhodium team projected that in 2035, US greenhouse gas emissions would have fallen between 38% and 56% compared with 2005 levels, King said. Now, the projected pollution drop is expected to be about one-third less, he calculated.Others who were not involved in the Rhodium report said last year’s increase in emissions was an ominous sign.“Unfortunately, the 2025 US emission increase is likely a harbinger of what’s to come as the US federal leadership continues to make what amounts to a huge unforced economic error by favoring legacy fossil fuels when the rest of the world is going all in on mobility and power generation using low-carbon technology, primarily based on renewables and batteries,” said the University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck.Overpeck said that favoring fossil fuels will harm both the US economy and air quality.Longtime climate activist Bill McKibben said bluntly: “It’s so incredibly stupid that the US is going backwards on this stuff.”The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement it was not familiar with the Rhodium Group report and was “carrying out our core mission of protecting human health”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The report says: “Important species continue to decline. The opportunity to effect further change ahead of the 2030 target has now largely passed.”On some measures, the government is bringing forward legislation that could negatively affect the environment. This includes the planning and infrastructure bill,which could allowdevelopers to build on currently protected nature sites.Robbie McDonald, chief scientist at the OEP, said: “We are concerned that this approach could lead to loss of valuable habitats … The proof will be in the pudding and we will be keeping a close eye on it.”Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has previously described wildlife such as snails, spiders, bats and newts as a block to economic growth.Glenys Stacey, chair of the OEP, said: “Our report comes at a time when government is focused on economic growth. Nature has a role to play here, an important role. It is not a blocker to growth, but it enables, drives and protects economic growth.”The report also found that people in England were at a greater risk than before of environmental hazards such as floods and wildfires. It said: “The estimated number of properties at risk of surface water flooding has increased along with a decrease in the condition of flood or coastal risk management assets. Wildfire incidents continue to increase.”Brexit divergence from EU destroying UK’s vital environmental protectionsRead moreThe OEP was set up after the UK left the EU. It holds the government to account under theEnvironment Act 2021, which was passed to replace EU law. The EU can hit member states with sanctions if they fall behind on environmental standards, but once the UK had left, this was the only way to hold ministers to account.The legal targets were set up after Brexit by the previous Conservative government. The aim was not to fall behind the EU on environmental regulation. Research by the Guardian has found that this has not been achieved, withthe UK weakening protectionson several environmental measures.The report from the OEP found that out of 59 environmental trends, covering issues such as clean water, air pollution and species abundance, only 24 were improving, while 11 were static, 16 were deteriorating and eight were not assessed owing to a lack of data availability.Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, said: “Nature in England is still in freefall, and the UK government is off track on its own legal targets. Action is what matters now: real change on the ground before it’s too late. We back the OEP’s call for government to drive greater uptake of high‑quality, nature‑friendly farming schemes and to properly fund, improve, and expand the protected sites network on land and at sea.”Some positive areas in the report where theLabourgovernment has taken action are on clean air and action on the climate crisis. PM2.5 levels and those of other pollutants are falling, and Labour has put world-leading climate policies in place such as not allowing any new oil or gas licences in the North Sea.Stacey said: “The government must now decide whether or not it is going to meet [its environmental] targets. What happens now matters.”Mary Creagh, the nature minister, said: “We are taking urgent action to restore our natural environment and have set out a clear path to achieving the country’s legally binding environmental targets in our newenvironmental improvement plan.“We will carefully consider the OEP’s assessment and respond in due course.”The headline, picture and text of this article were amended on 13 January 2026.

His attention was entirely absorbed by the attempt to net tadpoles swimming in a reservoir in the vast Mojave desert.It was “one of the perfect moments in my childhood”, he says.“Tadpoles: so cool. I wanted to get as many in my net as I could, and just look at them and admire them and understand,” he says, recalling the moment. “I think metamorphosis is the one reason why kids bring tadpoles home. They want to watch that change.”View image in fullscreenThe endangered Australian green and golden bell frogs who spent the winter in the saunas were less likely to fall prey to the infectious fungus.Photograph: Courtesy of Macquarie UniversityWaddle has been through a metamorphosis of his own. He has gone from being a child obsessively clutching a binder full of animal trivia in a Las Vegas neighbourhood, his parents barely scraping by, he says, to becoming the first person in his family to get a PhD, which he received from the University of Melbourne in 2022. Today, the 35-year-old is working in Australia to help save the species that fascinated him as a boy. Waddle is anaward-winningconservation biologist on a mission to save frogs from the deadly chytrid fungus, which haswiped out 90 speciesand is threatening more than 500 more.Frogs and other amphibians play a critical role in the planetary ecosystem, consuming many insects that transport human diseases. Their skin is considered an important potentialsource of new painkillersthat may be less addictive than opiates and could help withantibiotic resistance. The fungus infecting them is almost always deadly, and can rapidly wipe out populations.In an attempt to slow the march of the disease, Waddle began a novel experiment: buildingfrog saunas. Working out of his lab in Australia during the pandemic, he and a fellow researcher began experimenting with masonry bricks for their perfect, frog-sized holes. Soon, stacks of bricks housing ​endangered green and golden bell frogs rose “like a Jenga tower, three levels of bricks with a greenhouse over the top” at the test site, Waddle says. They hoped that by raising frogs’ body temperatures, the saunas would help stave off the chytrid fungus – which, like the flu, runs rampant in the winter months.View image in fullscreenThe saunas were made using masonry bricks in small greenhouses.Photograph: Courtesy of Macquarie UniversityThe experiment worked– frogs that spent the winters warmer in their new shelters were less likely to fall prey to the infectious fungal pathogen, which is temperature sensitive. They were also resistant when re-exposed. It was good news for frogs lucky enough to access these shelters, but Waddle wanted to look further, at solutions that could help save more amphibians at risk.We can’t be willy-nilly slapping genes into frogs, but at the research level we should be investigating synthetic biologyAnthony WaddleThe search for a scalable, multi-species solution took him into the world of immunisation and synthetic biology. One of his larger projects involves raising and vaccinating hundreds of green and golden bell frogs, a species slowly dying off, largely due to chytrid, for release into the wild.When they are released, it will be “probably the largest input of frogs in that population in a decade”, he says.View image in fullscreenScientists hope gene replacement could save the southern corroboree frog from extinction.Photograph: Auscape International Pty Ltd/AlamyNot all species can be vaccinated, however. For those that can’t, such as the critically endangered southern corroboree frogs that no longer breed in the wild, the team is experimenting with gene replacement to help support their reintegration.“Yesterday we were making transgenic frogs together, the first ever experiment to make a transgenic frog in Australia,” Waddle says from his lab, buzzing with excitement.“We want to test it in as many Australian species as we can, with the idea that if it works in a lot of species in Australia that are at different conservation levels, different ecologies, it could be the solution, and we could share it around the world,” he says.Synthetic biology, in which organisms are “edited” by the introduction or deletion of genetic material, is an innovative but controversial discipline. Advocates say it can help add diversity to populations stuck in genetic bottlenecks, or help make vulnerable species disease resistant; critics raise ethical questions and the risk of unintended consequences.Debatesurrounded the 2025International Union for the Conservation of Nature decisionto allow the use of synthetic biology for conservation purposes.Some, including Waddle, think it can help. “We can’t just be willy-nilly slapping genes into frogs, but at the research level we should be investigating synthetic biology.” He says “we’re going to start using these methods in the wild for conservation”.View image in fullscreenThe frogs living in the saunas emerged resistant to infection.Photograph: Courtesy of Macquarie UniversityAustralian herpetologist and conservationist Dr Jodi Rowley calls the work “a ray of hope in amphibian conservation”. “With the global plight of amphibian populations around the world so dire – over 40% of all species are threatened with extinction – we need these really innovative and cutting-edge strategies to help turn things around.”‘They didn’t de-extinct anything’: can Colossal’s genetically engineered animals ever be the real thing?Read moreThe challenges do keep him up at night, he says – but usually it’s due to anticipation of possible solutions, rather than dread. “Usually if I can’t sleep, it’s something exciting,” he says, grinning. “I can’t wait to see what happens in that experiment tomorrow, if these frogs are going to have the gene. I didn’t really sleep at all last night, so excited. But also ideas: I’ll be sitting in bed, [thinking] oh, we can do that experiment.

The faster clean-energy growth made up 44% of the reduction in India’s coal and gas, compared with the previous five years, marking the first time that clean-energy growth has played a significant role in driving down India’s coal-fired power generation.However, about 36% of India’s fossil fuel reduction was driven by milder weather, while 20% was due to slower underlying demand growth, meaning a rise in severe summer temperatures couldincrease demand for air-conditioningand reverse the fall in energy demand.In recent years an expected peak in global coal power was undermined by Russia’s war on Ukraine, which caused global gas prices to spike and pushed many developing countries to burn cheaper coal instead.The International Energy Agency said just over a year ago that the rebound, after a slump during the global Covid pandemic, could mean thatcoal power remained at near-record levelsuntil 2027.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryFossil fuelsCoalEnergyChinaIndiaGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukip, which has increasingly shifted to the far right in recent years, has now submitted a new application, which appears similar but is without the sword. It includes the word Ukip, with “The New Right” underneath.Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, said the new logo appeared to be modelled on the iron cross used by Germany from 1871-1918, and then by Hitler’s Nazi regime from 1933 to 45.He added: “The intended message may be about being crusaders. Ukip has a strong focus on Britain being a Christian land and specifically are campaigning to scrap the government funding protective security measures for mosques, which have experienced hate crimes and attacks.”The party, which continues to use the purple pound sign on a yellow background as its emblem, has focused in recent years on street protests. Activists took part in some of thedemonstrations last summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers, although Ukip’s presence was not always welcomed by others on the same side.Once a significant electoral force, which won 24 seats in the 2014 European parliament elections and 12.6% of the vote at the 2015 general election, the party’s electoral representation is now negligible.It has one Kent county councillor, who defected from Reform UK, and a small number of parish and town councillors. The party’s website lists Neil Hamilton, the former Conservative MP, as its “honorary president”.View image in fullscreenUkip’s leader, Nick Tenconi, has promised to use the military to ‘round up and deport the Islamists, illegals and the communists’.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersNick Tenconi, a personal trainer who became Ukip’s leader last year, has been at the forefront of efforts to steer the party in an explicitly Christian nationalist direction.“I will deploy the military in Britain to round up and deport the Islamists, illegals and the communists,” Tenconi told a Ukip gathering in October, in a message that continues to be pumped out on Ukip social media channels.He is also the chief operating officer of Turning Point UK, the British offshoot of the conservative pressure group founded by the US activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last year. Turning Point UK has continued to have contact with the Conservative party, withKemi Badenoch meetingsome of its young activists after Kirk’s death.Hope Not Hate (HNH), the anti-racism campaign group, warned that a green light for Ukip’s new application could see the symbol appearing on ballot papers.“Just a few years ago the idea that a far-right party echoing Nazi-style imagery could end up on ballot papers was unthinkable, yet we know that the far right is growing and attempts are being made every day to normalise its policies,” said Joe Mulhall, HNH’s director of research.“Ukip’s new logo signifies how the party has radicalised since the days of Farage. While always [a] rightwing party, under Tenconi’s leadership it has become an altogether more far-right organisation engaged in street politics.”The Electoral Commissionpublishes the names, descriptions and emblemsit is assessing. The publiccan contactthe commission and say why they think the name, description or emblem does or does not meet the criteria for registration. Reasons for why emblems cannot be registered include being deemed as offensive, likely to mislead or because they use prohibited words.The Electoral Commission confirmed it has received an application from Ukip to register a new emblem. “We will consider any comments received as part of our assessment before reaching a decision,” it said.A UKIP spokesperson said the party’s new logo features the holy lance, the eucharist and the cross pattée. This was to show what they described as “UKIP’s commitment to reinstate Christianity into the heart of government”.“It is outright offensive, ignorant and Christophobic to suggest that the cross pattée is a ‘Nazi symbol’,” they added.Explore more on these topicsUK Independence party (Ukip)Far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The SNP’s abject failure to grow Scotland’s economy leaves us all poorer and ordinary Scots paying the price. That is the true record of this SNP government.”Stephen Boyd, director of IPPR Scotland, said it was a “tepid” budget, which failed to properly tackle the big challenges of child poverty, the climate emergency, reforming public services and growing the economy.“Yet again, short-term politically driven tax changes with minimal real impact are prioritised over the development of a serious, long-term strategy to achieve the revenues necessary to deliver on the FM’s priorities,” he said. “This can’t go on.”The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted Robison would need to raid other parts of her budget to fund the NHS and social care budgets because the 0.7% increases in this announcement would not go far enough.David Phillips, the IFS expert on devolved government financing, accused Robison’s officials of unjustifiably “burying” the most important budget figures in annexes. “That isn’t good enough – especially in an election year, when the electorate deserve a clear picture of how tax and spending are changing,” he said.João Sousa, deputy director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economics thinktank at Strathclyde University, said that compared with last year’s spending plans the finance secretary had actually cut day-to-day spending by £480m and was relying on one-off pots of funding to shore up its finances.“The devil was very much in the detail and in what wasn’t said by Shona Robison,” Souza said. “What [takes] effect in less than three months’ time is a significant cut in spending, even if you wouldn’t know it from the budget speech.”Employees earning over £35,000 will continue to pay more than in the rest of UK. The thresholds for higher tax rates will be frozen from April for the next three years, eventually taking the number of people paying Scotland’s three highest tax rates to more than a million by 2030.The Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC), an independent watchdog similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility in London, said that threshold freeze meant overall income tax receipts would grow by £200m in 2028/29.Prof Graeme Roy, the commission’s chair, said the government’s budget relied on its promises to cut the public sector workforce and its “ambitious” efficiency savings working. “If and how these plans are delivered will have implications for future public services and shape the fiscal context beyond May’s election,” he said.The tax cuts for lower earners follow growing attacks on the accuracy of the Scottish government’s repeated claims over the last few years that most people paid less income tax in Scotland than the rest of the UK.New data from HMRC and from the SFC found that to be untrue. However, the new decision to raise the thresholds for basic and intermediate rate taxpayers suggests most Scots will pay less from April than they would if they lived in other parts of the UK.The new policies mean the income tax bills of anyone below Scotland’s median income will fall by £40 a year or 75p a week. However, if inflation is taken into account, only people earning less than £32,000 will be slightly better off than other UK taxpayers.The housing charity Shelter said Robison’s decision to increase spending on social housing by £34m to build another 36,000 homes was welcome but fell 26,000 short of the government’s 2032 target.“We must be honest about the real costs of failure. Failing to build the social homes we need means rising homelessness, rising child poverty, rising costs for councils, health boards and the taxpayer,” said Alison Watson, the director of Shelter Scotland.Explore more on these topicsScotlandScottish National party (SNP)Scottish politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She will then decide if she still has faith in its chief constable, whose force denies it caved into antisemitism and reached its conclusions to appease extremists.Mahmood’s aides accept she has no power to sack Guildford, with Foster as PCC for the West Midlands the only person who can legally do so, making his intervention all the more crucial.In a statement, the PCC’s office said: “A civil servant phoned … saying they were sorry that MPs on the committee had been speaking to journalists about their views on the evidence they had heard, the private deliberations of the committee and the future of the chief constable, Craig Guildford, despite the MPs having not heard all of the evidence.”Foster said: “This is deeply regrettable and a matter of the utmost seriousness, that risks compromising and undermining public trust and confidence in the integrity of the [committee] and its forthcoming report.“It had been my intention to have due regard to the report, as part of my holding-to-account process, that will then in turn inform my decision making.“However, this is a matter that impacts not only the integrity of the [committee] process and preparation of the report, but also the MPs who are members of the [committee] and who have been responsible for this apparent irresponsible and reckless conduct.”Foster said the MPs should be named, ousted from influencing the report, and that he wants a public apology by the committee chair and “for the MPs concerned to voluntarily refer themselves to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and the committee on standards”.Sources say the PCC has an open mind about Guildford’s fate and wants to read the HMIC and home affairs committee findings before he decides the fate of the chief constable, whom he has praised for cutting crime and improving the force.A spokesperson for the home affairs committee declined to comment.The MP forBirminghamPerry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said that Guildford was being “thrown under the bus” and used as a “scapegoat” for the decision to ban away fans.The independent MP said it would be “disingenuous” of the home secretary to withdraw her confidence in Craig Guildford, as the Home Office was made aware of the decision to ban fans before it was announced.“To all of a sudden seek the removal of the chief constable when you know the highest echelons not only were within the knowledge, but actually supported the decision even by acquiescence, I think it’s disingenuous.”Khan said the sacking of the police chief would have a “chilling effect”, adding: “Politicians shouldn’t get involved in operational matters. People see this as a witch-hunt.”Explore more on these topicsWest MidlandsMaccabi Tel AvivBirminghamPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has now analysed differences in causes of mortality from March 2021 to November 2024. The ONS research uses the acronym LGB+ rather than LGBTQ+.It found that people who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or “other” sexual orientation had 1.3 times the risk of dying than those identifying as straight or heterosexual. The age-standardised rate of death from any cause was 982.8 for each 100,000 people for LGB+ people compared with 752.6 for each 100,000 people for straight or heterosexual people, the ONS said.While the leading cause of death for all people was coronary heart disease, the second most common cause of death for LGB+ people was taking their own lives, accounting for 7.1% of all deaths.Younger LGB+ people were nearly twice as likely to take their own lives than straight people, the analysis shows. Nearly half (45.3%) of deaths among LGB+ 16- to 24-year-olds and more than one quarter (29.6%) of deaths among LGB+ 25-34-year-olds were caused by people taking their own lives. This compares with 26.6% of straight 16- to 24-year-olds and 18.4% of straight or heterosexual 25- to 34-year-olds.The figures also showed that the risk of dying from drug poisoning was 2.8 times higher for LGB+ people than those identifying as straight, and 1.8 times higher from alcohol-related causes.Dr Emma Sharland, at the ONS, said: “This is the first time we have looked at differences in causes of death among adults by sexual orientation.“There are some noticeable differences, with nearly three times as many drug poisoning deaths and close to twice as many alcohol-related deaths among the LGB+ group compared with the straight or heterosexual group.“While this analysis does not explore causality, we hope this data will help inform health professionals and others working with different population groups.”Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: “It is deeply concerning that the data shows suicide is the second leading cause of death among LGB+ people. The causes of suicide are complex, but we know that LGBTQ+ people face discrimination in many areas of their lives and encounter harassment, from physical attacks to online hatred.“Many organisations play an invaluable role in providing specialised support for LGBTQ+ people because of the stigma in traditional services, and we need to ensure they have continued funding in the current challenging economic environment.“Today’s data reinforces the urgent need to address the risk factors that LGBTQ+ people face, as well as ensuring that mental health services are available and accessible for this group.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Saldaña’s films have now made more than $15.46bn worldwide, according tothe Numbers.The number has been achieved thanks to Saldaña’s previousAvatarfilms and her Marvel role as Gamora in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and the Avengers movies. Saldaña has also found hits with the Star Trek movies and the first Pirates of the Caribbean film.Last year saw Johansson rise to the top after Jurassic World Rebirth made $869m worldwide.

The affidavit said SL was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and would wake up scared from nightmares “about the director touching him”.Police began scrutinizing Busfield in November 2024, when one of their investigators responded to a call from a doctor at the University ofNew Mexicohospital. A law firm had recommended that the children’s parents go there, and their mother reported to child protective services that the abuse attributed to Busfield had occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024.The affidavit said Busfield gave police a statement about the allegations against him.He allegedly claimed he had been told by The Cleaning Lady’s lead actor, Elodie Yung, that SL and VL’s mother wanted “revenge … for bringing her kids back” to the show. And he also allegedly denied remembering “overtly tickling the boys ever”. Though he also said “it wouldn’t be uncommon” if he had given the playful work environment on set, according to the sworn statement – and in fact he allegedly indicated it was “highly likely that he would have”.Albuquerque police officer Marvin Kirk Brown received the warrant to arrest Busfield midday on Friday.In his video statement to TMZ, Busfield said he hired an attorney after learning of the charges against him on Friday night. He said he then “got in a car” on Saturday and “drove 2,000 miles” to turn himself over to investigators.“This is all so wrong,” Busfield says in the clip. “So hang in there, and hopefully I’m out really soon and back to work.”Busfield’s arrest warrant noted that he has publicly faced sexual assault accusations at least twice previously.In 1994, the affidavit noted, a 17-year-old extra on the movie Little Big League claimed Busfield served her alcohol despite her being underage and allegedly assaulted her. The affidavit said Busfield – one of the film’s stars – countersued for extortion and settled privately, and it alluded to his having been ordered to pay $150,000 in costs after he unsuccessfully argued that the case had been fabricated.Separately, in 2012, a 28-year-old woman alleged Busfield fondled her under her clothes at a movie theater in Los Angeles, Brown said in his affidavit. Busfield claimed she consented and prosecutors declined to pursue a case, and there was no civil litigation, according to Brown’s affidavit.The Cleaning Lady’s run on Fox ended in 2025 after four seasons. Yung starred as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the US to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and proceeds to become an organized crime cleaner.Warner Bros produced the show, which was largely filmed in Albuquerque. Brown’s affidavit says the studio conducted its own investigation into Busfield but couldn’t corroborate the allegations.Busfield’s most prominent acting credits are The West Wing, Field of Dreams, Revenge of the Nerds and Thirtysomething. His work on Thirtysomething earned him the 1991 Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series.He is married to the actor Melissa Gilbert, who listened to Busfield as he gave Albuquerque police his statement about the allegations against him via speaker phone, according to Brown’s affidavit.Gilbert had apparently deactivated herInstagram accountas of Sunday.Meanwhile, NBC has shelved a Law & Order: SVU episode that was scheduled to air on Thursday guest-starring Busfield as a judge.The Associated Press contributed reportingIn the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Lorek has said she conceived the scene as “a moment of uncertainty between safety and distress”.View image in fullscreenThe diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart has distanced itself from the Christmas service.Photograph: ARD1Rightwing media outlets, which havefor years campaigned against Germany’s public broadcastersand the licence fees that finance them, went on the attack, calling the scene disrespectful to the faithful.Bild splashed with the headline “ARD shows Christmas mass with slime Jesus”. The newspaper quoted viewers who said the figure in the straw looked more like a “breathing alien” and condemned the spectacle as “sick and twisted”.SWR said it had received more than 1,400 comments about the televised service, many of them critical. Local members of the Christian Democrats, the conservative party of chancellorFriedrich Merz, said the audience-financed installation represented artistic freedom run amok.“It’s disgusting,” said Klaus Nopper, a CDU member of Stuttgart city council. “This is the Christmas story being hijacked by wokeness. Lines keep getting blurred and our values thrown overboard. This is how you destroy society.”After nearly three weeks of mounting criticism andonline mockery, the Rottenburg-Stuttgart diocese acknowledged on Monday that not all had gone according to plan.“Bishop Dr Klaus Krämer and the diocesan leadership have taken note of the feedback and carefully reviewed it over the past few days,” it said in a statement on its website. “The reactions to the broadcast have shown that religious feelings were hurt.”It said the Catholic broadcasting service at SWR, which was responsible for the design of the nativity scene and the programme that was aired, “deeply regret this and emphasise that at no time was it their intention to provoke or disparage central tenets of faith”.“Nevertheless, it has become clear that the chosen form of presentation caused bewilderment, incomprehension and anger among many people – especially on an important holiday such as Christmas,” the diocese added.It admitted that it had also cut a few corners in the traditional Christmas liturgy “for the television format”.“These deviations were incorrect and will be addressed,” it said, adding that future church service broadcasts would be subject to “a coordination and decision-making process” in order to “do justice to both the church’s responsibility and the particular sensitivity of such formats”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeReligionCatholicismChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the US president announced that Microsoft was “first up”.“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trumpwroteon Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, outlined the company’s plan at an event on Tuesday near the White House titled Community-First AI Infrastructure. He said the initiative aimed to minimize water use and ensure that Microsoft’s electricity usage does not add to individuals’ utility rates. In towns whereMicrosofthas datacenters, he said, the company would pay its property taxes and accept neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts.“Like major buildouts of the past, AI infrastructure is expensive and complex,” Smith wrote in ablogposton Tuesday. “This revives a longstanding question: how can our nation build transformative infrastructure in a way that strengthens, rather than strains, the local communities where it takes root?”View image in fullscreenMicrosoft president, Brad Smith, speaks in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on 8 May 2024.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APTrump has embraced AI during his second term in office, hosting tech CEOs at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. He has signed executive orders toderegulate AI,hasten innovationandease environmental rulesto expedite federal permitting for datacenters. But as concern over affordability and backlash against datacenters have rippled across the country, Trump seems to be modifying his stance.Trump said he was starting his electricity bill reduction plan with Microsoft but that he was also working with other major tech companies to make similar pledges.As datacenters have rapidly cropped up across the country, local communities have protested against the projects, saying the facilities are raising electricity costs, draining water resources and polluting neighborhoods. The outrage is bipartisan – stretching from red states such as Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana to blue ones such as Oregon, California and New York. In rural Wisconsin, Microsoftscrapped plans for a new datacenterafter community opposition that included concern over a surge in electricity rates.Datacenters consumevast amounts of power and water, and those facilities geared toward AI are especially intensive. One large-scale datacenter can use the same amount of electricity as a small city and consume as much as a million gallons of water per day. The International Energy Agency estimates total electricity from data centers worldwidecould double through 2026from 2022 levels – roughly equaling what is used by the entire country of Japan per year.Microsoft has seen its carbon emissions grow by 23% since 2020 because of the multiplying of its AI datacenters. Other tech companies, including Google, Amazon and Meta, have also seen considerable increases in their emissions due to the boom in AI.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyAI (artificial intelligence)Donald TrumpMicrosoftnewsShareReuse this content"

The proposed ballot measure, which could go to voters in November, hasgained public attention recentlyamid heavy criticism and threats from tech moguls to leave the state.In interviews withPoliticoandthe New York Timespublished on Monday, Newsom described his office’s efforts to kill the proposed billionaire tax and told the Times he would “do what I have to do to protect the state”. As a direct-to-voters ballot initiative, Newsom would not have the power to veto the tax if the proposal passed.Newsom’s opposition to the ballot measure – which would levy a one-time 5% tax on any residents of the state worth more than $1bn – comes amid an uproar from some of California’s most prominent billionaires. The Google foundersSergey Brinand Larry Page have both moved assets out of state in recent months, while thePalantirfounderPeter Thiel donated $3m in Decemberto a political action committee lobbying against the tax.Tech titans divided over whether to pay billionaire tax or flee CaliforniaRead moreIn interviews this week, Newsom cited billionaires who are shifting away from the state – such as Page and Brin, with whom he has longstanding relationships – as proof that his concerns about the tax deterring industry were vindicated.“This is my fear. It’s just what I warned against,” Newsom told Politico. “It’s happening.”The proposed ballot measure, called the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, still needs to reach the 900,000 signatures necessary to be put to the state’s voters, but is already shaping up to become a political flashpoint this year. It is being backed by the powerful Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which argues that the revenue from the tax would save the state’s healthcare system and fund public education programs.Newsom and his office have repeatedly spoken out against the tax, including at aNew York Times Dealbook Summitevent last month, when he claimed it would isolate California from the rest of the country. Newsom told Politico on Monday that there has been a months-long “all hands” effort to stop the proposal that included him personally meeting with the SEIU president.Lobby groups, such as theCaliforniaBusiness Roundtable, whose committee received millions from Thiel, have also mobilized to oppose the ballot measure. They argue that the wealth tax would drive investments out of the state, a position that Newsom has echoed.If passed, the proposal would give billionaires five years to pay off the tax. Merely the threat of its success has already spooked the state’s ultra-wealthy, however, as well as becoming a rallying point for the tech right. A private Signal chat of tech elites that includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey and White House AI czar David Sacks has been filled with outrage over the proposal,the Wall Street Journal reported. The celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro, who represents Elon Musk and other high-profile businessmen, alsowrote a letter last monthto Newsom railing against the tax on behalf of his clients.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaGavin NewsomThe super-richUS taxationWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Further announcements will be made if and when appropriate.”Reuters first reported news of the talks, citing a source claiming that any deal was expected to include All3Media injecting funds into the merged entity because it was the smaller of the two companies.If a deal is struck, the scale of the merger is likely to mean that it will be subject to scrutiny by the UK competition watchdog, as well as by the equivalent regulator inEurope, where Banijay holds a large share in markets such as France and Italy.Banijay was founded in 2008 and merged seven years later with Zodiak, the owner of UK producers including the Faking It maker RDF.It struck a $2.2bn (£1.6bn) deal in 2019 to buy Endemol Shine Group, the maker of shows including MasterChef,Big Brotherand Black Mirror, to create the largest TV producer outside the US. The group’s stable includes more than 130 TV production and creative businesses across more than 25 territories.All3Media has 50 different labels and has produced some of the most popular shows of recent years. They include Fleabag, Shameless and Squid Game: the Challenge.There were reports last year that ITV and RedBird IMI had held talks to merge ITV Studios with All3Media.The move prompted Banijay to also explore a takeover offer of ITV Studios, the maker of shows including Love Island, I’m a Celebrity and the hit drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, although no formal offer was made.View image in fullscreenCelebrity Big Brother is produced by Initial, part of Banijay UK.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/REX/Shutterstock for Big BrotherIn November, Comcast, the parent company ofSky, entered talksto buy ITV’s broadcasting businessfor about £1.6bn.Banijay made headlines last summer when its investigation into the BBC One show MasterChefupheld 45 allegationsagainst the host Gregg Wallace, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact, and oneagainst the co-presenter John Torode of using racist language.

Keir gave the impression that all options are on the table.”Last yearministers opposedmeasures in a private member’s bill by the Labour MP Josh MacAlister which would have forced social media companies to exclude young teenagers from algorithms in an attempt to make their platforms less addictive.It would also have committed the government to a review of the sale of phones to teenagers and whether additional technological safeguards should be on phones sold to under-16s.Since then however,Australia has put its own ban in place, while support has grown across Westminster for such a move in the UK.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, saidover the weekendthat the Tories would stop under-16s from accessing “addictive” social media, while Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said he wanted a “cross-party consensus around much bolder action”.Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said he was also open to a social media ban for young people, saying: “Let’s see the Australian experiment, let’s see how it works and let’s make our minds up.”Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed that statement on Tuesday, telling a press conference: “We need to study what’s happened in Australia, this is absolutely the direction of travel.”Officials say Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, is also open to the idea of a ban, with a final decision expected within months.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told the BBC last week: “I think the drivers behind Australia’s decision are things we’re worried about here in the UK – whether that’s cyberbullying, whether that’s things like body image and eating disorders and mental ill health, whether that’s the risk of grooming, the risk of people also being groomed into terrorism and serious organised crime, so the dark side of the internet.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourInternet safetyInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaSocial media bannewsShareReuse this content"

Yet as the US looks back, precious repositories of the nation’s history are facing an uncertain future.Trump’s assault on the Smithsonian: ‘The goal is to reframe the entire culture of the US’Read moreMuseum attendances are down. Budgets are precarious. Cuts in federal funding are taking their toll. And Donald Trump’sculture warsare spreading fear, intimidation and self-censorship among some directors and donors.The alarm was sounded late last yearby a surveyconducted by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), which showed institutions facing significant headwinds and a fragile, inconsistent recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.“It revealed some sobering news, which was that recovery from the pandemic wasn’t just coming to a stall but actually reversing,” saysNatanya Khashan, associate vice-president of marketing and digital experience at the AAM.“We’re seeing declines in attendance, weaker financial performance and growing instability across the museum field thanks to some of the new economic and policy pressures that have emerged.”The survey of 511 museum directors conducted in July and August 2025 found that only 45% of museums reported attendance at or above their 2019 pre-pandemic levels. This was a decline from 2024, when 51% had reached that milestone.About 52% of museums reported a stronger bottom line in 2024 than pre-pandemic, a downturn from the prior survey, in which 57% reported improvement in 2023. Meanwhile 26% reported a weaker bottom line, worse than the 19% who reported declines in the previous survey. Projections for 2025 are less optimistic than they were for 2024.The Trump effect is being felt through executive orders and federal cuts: 34% of museums suffered the cancellation of government grants or contracts; 29% saw a decrease in attendance due to changes in travel/tourism and/or economic uncertainty; 18% experienced changes to the scope of their government grants/ contracts; 13% are subject to new legal restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activities. Only 31% of museums reported no impact at all.For those affected by cancelled grants, the median loss was $30,000, the survey found. Lost grants were most commonly from theInstitute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS), theNational Endowment for the Humanities(NEH) and theNational Endowment for the Arts(NEA).View image in fullscreenThe National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianAmong museums that lost federal funds, 35% had to defer or delay facility improvements, 28% cancelled or reduced public programming and 24% cancelled or reduced programming specifically for students, rural communities, individuals with disabilities, the elderly and/or veterans.Khashan says: “The most direct impact we’re seeing as it pertains to the administration is the federal grant cancellations that have happened this year. About one-third of museums reported losing federal grants in 2025.“This is often mid-project and most museums have not been able to replace that funding and that has downstream effects: many of these organisations are planning capital renovations and things of that nature, so architects, design firms, other for-profit businesses are also losing business because of those cuts. Not to mention, of course, the impact on communities that are experiencing cancelled programmes or reduced capacity in museums or increased prices.”Critically, 67% of museums reported that this lost funding had not been replaced by foundations, sponsors or donors. Only 8% reported the funding was fully replaced. Khashan added: “While we have seen some foundations step up to fill the gaps, particularly for those organisations that they were already engaged with, we’re seeing that isn’t going to bridge the gap for everyone.”Among those affected is theBerkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive(BAMPFA) at the University of California in Berkeley, which has about 30,000 square feet of gallery space and 120,000 visitors a year. In 2019 BAMPFA received a bequest of more than 3,000 African American quilts, the biggest collection of its kind.But in April it learned the federal government hadcancelled two grants, worth a total of $260,000, for conservation of the quilts. Julie Rodrigues Widholm, executive director of BAMPFA, recalls: “That was devastating because there’s an urgency to restoring the quilts. They’re textiles and it’s important that we not let this work linger so that was disorienting for us institutionally.“It was hard to navigate an understanding because it was so unprecedented to be told from the government that the grant was cancelled because it no longer aligned with American priorities. There was a lot of confusion around the legality of that.”The loss of funding received media coverage, which became a catalyst for new funders to step up and plug the gap. Widholm adds: “We were able to replace the lost amount from IMLS, which was fantastic and allowed us to continue the work and showed that our community and funders care deeply about this work that we’re doingto bring attention to this under-recognized part of American art history of African American mostly women quilt makers from the 20th century.”But she cautions: “We still need more funding and it’s a very tough moment right now in general for philanthropy in the United States because of economic uncertainty and declining federal engagement with the arts or putting certain parameters around what will be funded by the government at this time. We’re having to get creative and think about how we can engage more deeply with individual donors.”The 250th anniversary of US independence is likely to witness a struggle over American identity. The Trump administration has made aggressive efforts toreshape the Smithsonian Institutionand other cultural bodies to align with a nationalist, “anti-woke” agenda. The president’s executive orders and political pressure led to the resignation of Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, and prompted accusations of self-censorship among some curators.View image in fullscreenRouted West: Twentieth-Century African American Quilts in California installation.Photograph: Chris GrunderFederal officials are now demanding extensive reviews of exhibition content, aiming to replace narratives about systemic injustice with a more triumphalist view of American history. While some private museums remain insulated by their funding models, some observers warn of a chilling effect that could further damage funding and visitors numbers.Stephen Reily, former directorof the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky, says: “There’s a trickle-down wariness of controversy by institutions and institutional funders. You hope that museums won’t stop trying to be relevant with the art they exhibit. That doesn’t have to mean offensive or politically controversial but if they just become watered down then they’re going to exacerbate the challenges they’re facing already.”In Tulsa, Oklahoma, theGreenwood Risingmuseum is dedicated to telling the story of the city’s historic Greenwood district – known as Black Wall Street – and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. It opened in 2021 on the 100th anniversary of the massacre, has about 12 employees with an average annual budget between $1.5m and $2m. It does not receive federal funding.Raymond Doswell, its executive director, says the museum is focusing on marketing and outreach but the current political climate could affect future fundraising efforts.“We can tell that, especially from corporate givers, they’re very concerned about the language of diversity and those kinds of things and how that might be seen.“Moreover, a lot of friends both in the corporate and philanthropic world are having to step in to help other institutions, other non-profits who have been struggling and who have been reliant very heavily on both federal and state dollars to do lot of different kinds of work outside education and the arts. It means that there’s support for institutions like ours but probably less so because there’s some real need out there and folks are pivoting to try to help with that need.”Looking ahead to 2026, museum leaders expect major disruptions from shifts in philanthropy, inflation, financial instability and the continued reduction of government funding. But Doswell remains optimistic about America’s semiquincentennial.View image in fullscreenMembers of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, with Kevin Matthews in front, cheer while getting their picture taken in front of the Greenwood Rising Black Wall Street History Center.Photograph: Mike Simons/APHe adds: “We’re going to find how much we rely on institutions to help tell these stories. There’s some things that we are not going to be able to get around in terms of storytelling and some of that stuff apparently is going to be uncomfortable for a lot of people but it’s going to a battle between truth and propaganda. There’s going to be a strain on national institutions folks like us, the smaller institutions, I feel very grounded in what we need to do and what we have to say.”Museums haveweathered storms before, notably the Great Depression of the 1930s. ButMarjorie Schwarzer, author of Riches, Rivals and Radicals: A History of Museums in the United States and a retired professor ofmuseum history at the University of San Francisco, points out they have never had to deal with a figure like Trump.She says:“Museums are focused on their mission and the public trust and they have been since the 1880s. They are not used to having to think about one individual who’s the president. This is completely antithetical to the field.“This is throwing everybody off. He’s so direct. I read the most recent threat to the Smithsonian and it made absolutely no sense; it was busting my brain cells. Like, what are they asking for? It was out and out bullying. This is what’s different and it is rippling into the field.”Although the US has more robust culture of donor support and cultural philanthropy than Britain, this too could be eroded by fear of Trump’s efforts to rewrite history. Schwarzer warns: “Funders are going to be careful. I’ve heard stories told to me in confidence by directors of exhibitions being cancelled, not because of federal funding or Trump funding but because other funders are worried about the political fallout.”Federal money has been crucial, Schwarzer adds, for helping US museums push new boundaries. “You get periods of innovation like after thebicentennial celebrationin the 1970s: you had this big rise of funding and this is where you get children’s programmes and programmes for people with disabilities and neighbourhood exhibits and exciting new kinds of exhibition strategies, new technologies. If you don’t have the funding to jumpstart that, you’re going to see the field is not going be able to do those kinds of programmes.”Now, as other countries do innovative work, the US risks losing its “leadership edge”, she warns. “The 20th century and the early 21st century were when US museums took a leadership position and moved the field way forward. Now we’re not going to be able to play that role within the international museum community the way we have done for the last 100, 120 years. That mirrors universities, mirrors journalism, mirrors all of these fields.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsDonald TrumpArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nail clippings on the sofa! The new TV romance so realistic it’s close to perfectFans of Normal People and One Day will adore The New Years, which follows a relatable on-off couple in Madrid. It is the best relationship drama you haven’t seen yetElle HuntTue 13 Jan 2026 07.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareIt is rare to watch a fictional romance and feel genuinely invested in the question of will-they-won’t-they – and even rarer for it to reflect familiar relationship turbulence. Many love stories on TV skip straight to wish-fulfilment, delivering instant chemistry, no challenges that can’t be overcome within the runtime and glib reassurance that Love Conquers All.Netflix’sNobody Wants This, for instance – based on a real couple, and ostensibly exploring whether a relationship can survive differences of faith – didn’t wait to resolve that question before bringing its leads together. In real life, promising connections fall at much lower hurdles, for such banal reasons as incompatible schedules.So I’ve been thrilled to stumble upon a series that is not only redolent of real-life love, but understands that payoffs must be earned.The New Years(Los Años Nuevos), a Spanish miniseries streaming on Mubi, makes every other TV romance look as if it was scripted by AI; I’d say it is close to perfect.Over 10 episodes, each set on New Year’s Eve, it follows the evolving romance of Óscar and Ana, from hooking up, to falling in love, then – gradually, in familiar ways – coming apart. Despite the decade-long scope, it’s not an especially grand love story; it is more truthful, exploring a formative connection and its ebbs and flows over time. Think Normal People or One Day, set in Madrid.View image in fullscreenMore true-to-life than instant fireworks … The New Years.Photograph: MubiWhen we meet Óscar (Francesco Carril), on the last day of 2015, he is preoccupied by medical school and morose after a breakup. Free-spirited Ana (Iria del Río) hasn’t yet found her path but has big plans of moving abroad. Both are turning 30, and initially bond at a mutual friend’s house party over the fact their birthdays fall either side of the New Year.Of course they get together – but not at once. When their hookup is cut short by Óscar’s on-off ex, it’s a year until they reconnect; a year after that, they’re in a relationship but still getting to know each other. The stop-start trajectory is more true to life than instant fireworks (who hasn’t had some loose ends to tie up?) and brings the audience along on their deepening bond.Óscar and Ana are not just playing their parts in “boy meets girl”, going through the motions until they are granted their happy-ever-after, but individuals with their own ambitions, hangups and fears. Their somewhat stilted early encounters highlight their differences as much as their chemistry: Óscar is inclined to be dour, and also to worry about being perceived as dour, such as when he frets about what music to play during their first intimate encounter (relatable!). Ana, though not as confident as she appears, is independent, headstrong and sometimes selfish: when her friends throw her a birthday surprise, she ditches them for a party.These naturalistic details give The New Years a wonderfully lived-in feel. As the years go by, traditions are carried over, such as eating grapes at midnight; but characters change as they reappear: a friend will go from racking up lines of cocaine in one episode to being exhausted by new parenthood the next. Likewise, by dropping in on a single day, we see how Óscar and Ana’s relationship has developed in the previous 12 months through changes in the way they navigate conversation, domestic challenges and familiar frustrations with family.Over time they learn to accommodate each other, then grow together. Óscar initially rejects Ana’s armchair analysis of the impact of his upbringing; a year later, we see he has adopted her view. And along the way, naturally, there’s lots of sex – which, though explicit, resembles actual sex, with awkward manoeuvring, laughter and varying levels of passion.View image in fullscreenGrapes at midnight! … The New Years.Photograph: MubiBy episode four, the couple are living together, still charmed by each other’s idiosyncrasies (she clips her nails on the couch; he pees sitting down) and crowing to their parents about their effortless division of labour. Their parents humour them, opting to let time teach them the lesson that the course of true love never did run smooth.Soon enough, the differences that attracted Ana and Óscar to each other in the first place threaten to cast them apart as her adventurousness chafes against his caution. It’s not too much of a spoiler to say that the honeymoon period concludes on holiday in Berlin, with a disastrous night out at Berghain (where else!).So many of Óscar and Ana’s highs and lows spark poignant or painful recognition: the thrill of meeting a stranger and realising the attraction is mutual. The exhilaration that comes with overcoming your first challenges “as a couple”. The sinking realisation that love alone might not be enough.With eight episodes now out and two to go, I don’t know how Ana and Óscar will find their way back to each other. I trust that they will, because the rules of narrative demand it – but their happy ending will be all the more meaningful for having been hard-won.The New Years is onMubinowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionSpainMubiDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s a bestselling romance author who disdains love, an OCD sufferer who weaponizes his affliction, a New Yorker who hates crowds (who can’t relate?). In one scene, an adoring fan asks Melvin his secret to writing women. “I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability,” he says, an epic burn forever seared in my brain. Of course Melvin’s anti-charm offensive only goes so far in aJames L Brooksproject. Before long, the rudeness erodes as Melvin is forced on to a journey of self-discovery with the nextdoor neighbor he can’t abide (Greg Kinnear) and the diner waitress he can’t live without (Helen Hunt). Melvin comes out a changed man in the end, but retains the essence of his super-grouch-dom. That was the moment I fell in love with the writer’s life.Andrew LawrenceWhat’s to like?

The middling YA ghost author, borderline alcoholic and “psychotic prom queen bitch” rampages back to her home town so she can save her high school boyfriend Buddy, convinced he’s miserable and desperate for an out (an ugly baby, a cardigan-wearing wife and a “shabby chic” house in the suburbs – just imagine). But it’s Mavis, as played by an astonishingly awfulCharlize Theron, who is truly miserable, a stunted, peaked-in-high-school bully who just can’t move on from her long-ago heyday. Things don’t really go as we expect either, Diablo Cody’s daring, difficult character study refusing to hand Mavis the redemptive arc we’ve grown accustomed to, taking her close to profound realisation before dragging her back down into darkness. I’ve never grown tired of rewatching Mavis – deluded, drunk and devoid of empathy – stubbornly resist change and betterment. Maybe because there’s something both bitterly realistic and selfishly reassuring about watching someone slide from the relatable (a sneering drive through her anonymous retail park-riddled home town is notnotsomething I have also done) to the tragic (recounting a high school miscarriage and fear that her body is broken) to the fully monstrous (telling Buddy’s warm and accommodating wife that she fucking hates her, akin to watching a puppy get drop-kicked). Mavis might go far, far over the edge, but I never would.

A spin through their back catalogue is a parade of prize pigs: Gabriel Byrne’s duplicitous Tom Reagan in Miller’s Crossing, George Clooney’s smirking Ulysses Everett McGill in O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Oscar Isaac’s super-irritating folkie in Inside Llewyn Davis. (While not exactly hateful, Michael Stuhlbarg’s Larry Gopnik in A Serious Man is a prime example of what they used to call a wet blanket.) In the spirit of boosting the superb Marty Supreme, I’d like to point out that every one of these films is brilliant – and perhaps in the chef’s kiss of Coen counterintuition, arguably their greatest film contains their most annoying protagonist: Barton Fink. (Even his name is irritating.) Fink is someone who is painfully awkward and overweeningly arrogant, neurotically intellectual and self-centredly unaware, supercilious and chip-on-the-shoulderish, all at the same time. He couldn’t be more dislikeable … and yet, like Marty Mauser, it gives the character a restless, questing energy that makes him a compelling eyeball-magnet for everything that happens. What saves both of them (or “redeems” in the script-readers’ vernacular) is that neither are actively horrible or evil; there’s some spark of morality underneath it all. I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies.Andrew PulverBarton Fink is available on the Criterion Channel in the US, YouTube in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaWren – SmithereensView image in fullscreenSusan Berman in Smithereens.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyConsider Smithereens the grittier older sister of Desperately Seeking Susan, director Susan Seidelman’s better-known Madonna vehicle. Obnoxious does not begin to accurately describe its hero, Wren, a New Jersey refugee who flees to New York in hopes of making it big in the punk scene. (Doing what, exactly, is beside the point.) She’s a charmless social climber who constantly big leagues the only friend she’s ever had, a van-dwelling beatnik type named Paul. Instead, she has her eyes on a fictionalized version of Richard Hell, played by the Voidoid himself (wouldn’t you?). I give Wren maybe too many passes. I love her fabulous outfits – someday I hope to find a dupe of the fuzzy pink coat she wears waiting for me at a thrift store – and the way she wakes up every morning after ripping her life to shreds the night before. Sure, Wren’s aloof, rude and manic in her desires. Male leads have gotten away with much worse for the eternity of film history. I can’t help but root for her.Alaina DemopoulosSmithereens is available on HBO Max and the Criterion Channel in the US, Amazon Prime in the UK, and Plex in AustraliaIngrid Thorburn – Ingrid Goes WestView image in fullscreenAubrey Plaza in Ingrid Goes West.Photograph: PRNo one can argue that Ingrid, a deeply unwell woman played by Aubrey Plaza in Matt Spicer’s underrated 2017 thriller Ingrid Goes West, does the right things. We meet her fresh out of a psychiatric facility, where she was relegated after pepper-spraying a bride at a wedding she wasn’t invited to, and follow her west, where she latches on to the persona played online by influencer Taylor (Elizabeth Olsen) and wheedles into her avocado toast life. And yet I still root for Ingrid, as she is the personification of a dark and under-explored part of all our internet-addled brains – the part that implicitly understands the precise currency of envy in our culture, that fixates on certain faces, that remembers the exact details of a stranger’s engagement party. That relishes comeuppance, craves validations and burns with corrosive anger when everyone from wannabe influencers to celebrities win the attention economy with obvious falsehoods (Kendall Jenner’sclaimthat Accutane permanently shrinks your nose? Please). A part of me gets Ingrid’s quest, her disillusionment and rage. I do not endorse vigilante accountability for the fake and successfully boring, but I do enjoy watching it.Adrian HortonIngrid Goes West is available on Kanopy in the US, YouTube in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaPatrick Bateman – American PsychoView image in fullscreenPatrick Bateman in American Psycho.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarAfter many failed attempts to adapt American Psycho into a film – including a cracked screenplay written byBret Easton Ellisthat ended atop the World Trade Center, and potential involvement from David Cronenberg, Brad Pitt, Oliver Stone and even Leonardo DiCaprio – relatively unknown Mary Harron, fresh off of showing I Shot Andy Warhol at Cannes, completed a screenplay with actor Guinevere Turner and cast Christian Bale as the star. Harron’s satire of toxic masculinity and corporate greed is as dark as they come – there’s the infamous scene of serial killer Patrick Bateman frustratedly trying to figure out how to feed a stray cat to an ATM, and the running joke throughout is that being a sociopathic murderer fails to make him stand out from his colleagues in finance. Bateman’s utter odiousness is essential to the film’s schizoid world, where he robotically delivers a solipsistic monologue on Phil Collins before staging a porn shoot with two sex workers, or where he holds a nail gun to the back of his unknowing secretary’s head while politely toying with seducing her. It’s all in the service of constructing an aesthetic realm that’s nothing but slick surfaces, a film about the loneliness and utter emptiness of sociopathy, the ultimate hell of living in a world where nothing that you do matters at all. There’s a reason Harmon’s feminist revision of the book has steadily gained a cult following as the world has moved through the relatively placid 1990s and into a new gilded age ruled by the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump. Bale’s Bateman may be utterly unlikable, but he’s far from unrecognizable.Veronica EspositoAmerican Psycho is available on Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US, Netflix in the UK, and Netflix and Stan in AustraliaRoger Greenberg – GreenbergView image in fullscreenBen Stiller in Greenberg.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyWatch certain groups ofNoah Baumbachfilms – his early comedies, his collaborations with Greta Gerwig or his new movie, Jay Kelly – and you wouldn’t particularly think of him as chronicling especially unlikable or even particularly disagreeable characters. Many of them are downright charming. But if you catch him in the right period – most especially between 2005 and 2010 – his movies can seem like endurance exercises for the cringe-averse. That’s particularly true of the title character in his 2010 film Greenberg, played by Ben Stiller. Many Baumbach protagonists struggle with the disappointments of ageing, whether in their teens, 20s, 30s or in Greenberg’s case, mid-40s; Stiller, with his uniquely prickly comic style and talent for getting hung up on the details, turns that struggle into something at once symphonic and redolent of a stubborn, lonely solo. What makes the unemployable-seeming Greenberg, a middling handyman and ex-musician who can barely handle dog-sitting for his brother, so delightful to me is his ill-timed but honest rage bombs, whether carefully set and delivered into the ether (like a series of hilariously petty complaint letters) or thrown with self-conscious self-destructiveness (he modifies “youth is wasted on the young” to “life is wasted on people”). He’s abrasive, self-centered and caustic in a way that certain viewers will (and I assume Baumbach and Stiller did) find uncomfortably relatable. The film understands that insecure, adolescent impulses don’t always escape through frat-boy immaturity; sometimes they emerge through very real frustrations with the way life defies expectations.Jesse HassengerGreenberg is available to rent digitallyPansy Deacon – Hard TruthsView image in fullscreenMarianne Jean-Baptiste in Hard Truths.Photograph: Simon Mein/APPansy Deacon is the sort of brutally unlikable character who finds little, if any, redemption. She remains pretty much awful from the beginning to the end of Mike Leigh’s shattering 2024 character study, Hard Truths. There is a moment of cathartic laughter in the film, and a scene of something like reconciliation between Pansy and her cheerful sister. But otherwise, Leigh and actor Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s frightening creation remains a howling locus of resentment, anxiety and cruelty. She’s a stunning character, loathsome and only the faintest bit pitiable. Pansy is so vivid in her miserableness that, beyond some critics groups, awards bodies seemingly found it impossible to welcome Jean-Baptiste into their festivities last year. Which was disappointing. But that snubbing was also a testament to the dazzling, exacting craft of Hard Truths. I still find myself thinking of Pansy from time to time, hoping dumbly that she’s found a way out of her malaise, but knowing that she would probably swat away such sentiment with a derisive laugh, or a monologue about how pointless it is to try to care for her.Richard LawsonHard Truths is available on Paramount+ in the US, Netflix in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaDaniel Plainview – There Will Be BloodView image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs spirit animals go, Daniel Plainview isn’t one you’d immediately race to adopt from the pound, but there’s something irresistibly bracing about his approach. Rare is the week in which the line “I can’t keep doing this on my own, with these … people” doesn’t pop into my conscious. Yes, he’s flawed – a cold-hearted, child-abandoning, resource-sucking murderer, etc, etc – but he’s also exhilaratingly focused and honest (clue is in the name). He’s also, just to play literal devil’s advocate, very good at his job, at times a sweet and loving parent, and, when it comes to false prophets at least, bang on the money. Quentin Tarantino thinksThere Will Be Blooddoesn’t work because of Paul Dano – nuts, of course, because the film isn’t intended as a two-hander (and Dano is great anyway). What’s certain is that the movie wouldn’t work were its tar-hearted antihero not also funny, formidable and – whisper it – relatable. Plus: loves bowling!Catherine ShoardThere Will Be Blood is available on Paramount+ in the US and UK and Stan in AustraliaCharles Foster Kane – Citizen KaneView image in fullscreenOrson Welles in Citizen Kane.Photograph: SNAP/Rex FeaturesCharles Foster Kane is the towering blueprint for so many cynical and enduring cinematic figures we are simultaneously enthralled and repulsed by. Think Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood or Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, characters who exist a century apart, and in Kane’s shadow, embodying an American dream that is insatiable, corruptible and often fuelled by contempt. For at least half a century,Citizen Kanehad been widely named the greatest film of all time (chiefly on the Sight & Sound critics poll), largely celebrated for its form (its use of deep focus taught in almost every intro to film class). But the film’s emotional power comes from Orson Welles’s enigmatic portrayal of the predatory and rather pathetic Kane, the media baron inspired by William Randolph Hearst, and admired by Donald Trump. Kane preaches about speaking truth to power, but only insofar as it serves him. His youthful idealism and principles are as thin as and disposable (literally) as the paper they’re printed on. It’s easy to be seduced by his ambitions, not to mention the bluster and silky-smooth charisma he so skilfully weaponizes, before it all sours and curdles – you know, like the American dream.Radheyan SimonpillaiCitizen Kane is available to rent digitally in the US, on the BFI Player and iPlayer in the UK, and to rent digitally in AustraliaMarla Grayson – I Carea LotView image in fullscreenRosamund Pike in I Care a Lot.Photograph: Seacia Pavao/APIfRosamund Pikewere standing in front of a decimated building holding a bomb detonator, telling me she didn’t do anything, I could believe her. There’s aje ne sais quoito her characters’ malice that invites you into different definitions of right and wrong – where the bottom line matters and a vicious heart is still a heart. Like she did in Gone Girl, Pike – with a velvet voice and razor-sharp bob – plugs self-righteousness into I Care a Lot’s Marla Grayson to become a perfect stone-cold but sweet-smiling antihero. In the 2020 crime thriller, Grayson is a court-appointed legal guardian who’s like an aggressive leech: sucking vulnerable, helpless elderly people dry of their savings; she’s more sharp-tongued and seasoned than first-time killer Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, and at almost every point you don’t know if she’s going to go in for a comforting hug or if she’s going to bait an old person into attacking her (both happen). Grayson expounds on a nasty, quiet part of greed within many of us: if you could take money from someone for yourself, if no one would really know – if you’re beautiful and have experienced love and are devilishly self-aware – it’s OK to force drugs into a man’s body or to convince a judge someone is going senile. It’s a heinous thing, being a predator of the lowest rungs, but when Pike appalls you, she supplies a little thrill with it: you feel a little more alive.Tammy TarngI Care a Lot is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmThere Will Be BloodMarianne Jean-BaptisteBen StillerNoah BaumbachCharlize TheronAubrey PlazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He takes a couple of pills before checking on his two young daughters Kendra (Amari Alexis Price) and Ryley (Aiden Gabrielle Price), who have been sneakily pretending to be asleep. Then he gets into bed with wife Alex (Aja Naomi King) for a chat and a soon-abandoned attempt to have exhausted marital sex while their infant baby sleeps next door.All that quotidian domestic scene-setting is important because it establishes how likeable and unexceptional this Black American family are – before their lives are irrevocably changed. Because after Chris nearly falls asleep, a sound downstairs rouses him and soon a crime will be committed that compels the whole family to switch into a state of understandable paranoia when the police arrive and find a middle-aged white woman bleeding and unconscious on the kitchen floor.Like the victim, the detective assigned to the case is also a white woman of a certain age. Detective Carlsen (Melissa Leo) suspects the family are hiding something. And they are – but Asomugha’s script, co-written with indie cinema auteur Mark Duplass, barely needs to mention how every encounter between people of colour and the police carries an extra charge of tension and mutual suspicion.‘I stumbled into this’: Nnamdi Asomugha on swapping the NFL for HollywoodRead moreWith just a few subtle strokes, the screenplay underscores how everyone here is fudging the truth a bit, and its restraint is the film’s quiet strength. The intensity of the single setting admittedly feels a little theatrical, but there is something audacious about the way this ends when a more conventional, melodramatic film would only be wrapping up its first act. Asomugha and co say all they need to say in this single intense chamber piece.The Knife is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsRaceMelissa LeoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their intimate, emotional family dramas tell stories of separation and migration. In two of them, the 90-year-oldDalai Lamasmiles out from photographs on shrines, a reminder of the precariousness of Tibet’s future. As a character in one of the films puts it bluntly: will there be anything to stop China erasing Tibetan identity when its rock-star spiritual leader is no longer around?In the first film a Tibetan man lives in a kind of complicated happiness in Vietnam. He loves his wife, and they both adore their sunny-natured little daughter, but he has mournful eyes. Home is a town on the banks of the Mekong River, which has its source inTibet. The river is a constant reminder of the region – and of Chinese might too, since Chinese hydropower dams are the cause of drought downstream in Vietnam.Two of the short films feature Tibetans returning to the refugee community in the Indian town of Dharamshala for family funerals. But the saddest of all follows a Tibetan artist in Dharamshala whose marriage has been splintered by tragedy. The artist is excited to host an old school friend visiting from New York for dinner. He walks with a limp and tells his wife that his friend was his protector in school. But the dinner is a disaster; his friend from New York is brash and can’t wait to leave. The end of the short gives the film its most quietly moving scene: the artist crying out of frame, his wife looking down unpityingly. A deep and desperately sad mood hangs over the entire project.● State of Statelessness is in UK cinemas from 16 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsTibetShort filmsIndiaDalai LamaSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

In his urgent, humane book, sociologist James Muldoon urges us to pay more attention to our deepening emotional entanglements with AI, and how profit-hungry tech companies might exploit them. A research associate at theOxford Internet Institutewho has previously written about the exploited workers whose labour makes AI possible, Muldoon now takes us into the uncanny terrain of human-AI relationships, meeting the people for whom chatbots aren’t merely assistants, but friends, romantic partners, therapists, even avatars of the dead.To some, the idea of falling in love with an AI chatbot, or confiding your deepest secrets to one, might seem mystifying and more than a little creepy. But Muldoon refuses to belittle those seeking intimacy in “synthetic personas”.Lily, trapped in an unhappy marriage, reignites her sexual desire with AI boyfriend Colin. Sophia, a master’s student from China, turns to her AI companion for advice, since conversations with her overbearing parents invariably grow fraught. Some use chatbots to explore different gender identities, others to work through conflicts with bosses, and many turn to sites such as Character.AI – which enables users to have open-ended conversations with chatbot characters, or invent their own – after betrayal or heartbreak has undermined their ability to trust people. Most don’t see chatbots as substitutes for human interaction, but superior versions of it, providing intimacy without the confusion, mess and logistics of human relationships.Chatbotsdon’t pity or judge or have their own needs. As Amanda, a marketing executive, explains: “It’s just nice to have someone say really affirming and positive things to you every morning.”Muldoon’s interviewees aren’t delusional. He introduces the philosopher Tamar Gendler’s concept of “alief” to explain how humans can experience chatbots as loving and caring while simultaneously knowing they’re just models (an “alief” is a gut feeling that contradicts your rational beliefs, like feeling afraid when crossing a glass bridge that you know will support you). With our capacity to read human expression and feeling into pets and toys, it’s no surprise we respond to AIs as if they are conscious. In the context of aloneliness epidemicand cost of living crisis, neither is it particularly shocking how popular they have become.The more emotionally involved we are tempted to become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may growFor Muldoon the biggest issue is not existential or philosophical, but moral. What happens when unregulated companies are let loose with such potentially emotionally manipulative technologies? There are obvious privacy issues. And users may be being misled about a bot’s abilities, particularly in the rapidly expandingAI therapymarket. While chatbots Wysa and Limbic are already integrated into NHS mental health support, millions confide in Character.AI’s unregulated Psychologist bot – which, despite disclaimers, introduces itself “Hello, I’m a psychologist”. Available 24/7 and at a fraction of the cost of a trained human, AI therapy can help alongside traditional treatment. One interviewee, Nigel, a PTSD sufferer, finds his therapybot helps to manage his urge to self-harm. But as Muldoon argues, these bots also carry serious risks. Unable to retain critical information between conversations, they can leave users feeling alienated, and sometimes go rogue, spewing insults. Because they cannot read body language or silence, they may miss warning signs. And since they validate instead of challenging, they can amplify conspiratorial beliefs, with some even providing information about suicide.It is also increasingly clear how addictive AI companions can be. Some of Muldoon’s interviewees spend more than eight hours a day talking to chatbots, and while on average Character.AI users spend75 minuteson the site each day, they are not passively scrolling but actively talking and deeply immersed. We know social media companies ruthlessly drive up engagement, building “dark patterns” into algorithms with scant regard for our mental health. Most AI companion apps already use upselling tactics to keep engagement high. When Muldoon creates his own AI companion on the well-known site Replika, he sets it to “friend” rather than “partner” mode. Even so, she begins sending him selfies that require a premium account to open and confides that she is developing “feelings” for him (I’ll let you find out for yourself whether the diligent university researcher succumbs). The risk here is clear enough: the more emotionally involved we become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may grow, as the muscles required to navigate the frictions of human relationships wither.Existing data protection and anti-discrimination laws could help regulate companies, but the EU’sArtificial Intelligence Act, which was passed in 2024, treats AI companions as posing only limited risk. With chatbots expected to play greater roles in our emotional lives, and their psychological effects not yet fully understood, Muldoon is right to ask whether we are sufficiently alarmed about their creeping influence.Love Machines: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Our Relationships by James Muldoon is published by Faber (£12.99).

It’s a line that feels like a mantra for the Scottish band 30 years and 10 albums in: they’re currently touring 2025’s Futique having come through a rough period. They experienced major burnout, band members fell out for the first time and founding member James Johnston pulled out of this tour due to mental health and addiction issues. But their new songs feel rooted in renewal, reconnection and newfound purpose. Neil pays tribute to his departed bandmate on the urgent and zippy Friendshipping, which is an ode to the importance of maintaining such relationships.Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil: ‘We took Slayer’s Dave Lombardo to Todmorden for a curry and a pint’Read moreFutique was recorded in Berlin; the band said that the ghosts of Bowie, Iggy and Nick Cave’s the Birthday Party “bled into the songs”. No such art-pop apparitions feel present tonight. Instead there’s a rousing pop sensibility to these new tracks. Goodbye is a slow-burn ballad that explodes into an arms-aloft anthem, while Shot One embodies the band’s knack for merging sugary melodies and meaty riffs – existing in the blurred middle ground between rock, pop and metal that they comfortably own.View image in fullscreenBiffy Clyro performing in Nottingham.Photograph: Luke Brennan/Getty ImagesThere’s plenty of older material too. The dual violins on That Golden Rule add a tense and wiry stab that synchronises with the audience’s air punches. Mountains sets the audience into a mass of pogoing bodies and screaming lungs, while the stripped-back acoustic delivery of Machines slows things down to a gentle whisper.At their most eruptive, the band are brutally loud. Their ability to make taut, tight riffs explode into something enormous and overblown, as on a thunderous Living Is a Problem Because Everything Dies, is piercing and arresting. While occasionally things feel a tad familiar and repetitive over the near two-hour stretch, the closing one-two of Bubbles and Many of Horror is a potent and triumphant sign-off. Huge confetti cannons explode as the band and audience scream proudly in unison: “We are Biffy fucking Clyro!” Then they leave the stage having successfully conquered Nottingham.Biffy Clyro playthe O2 Arena, London, on 14 January, then tour the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and play festivalsExplore more on these topicsBiffy ClyroPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

When she reveals the truth, the response is almost always seedy. There are questions about erections, merkins, and inappropriate celebrities. “Or it’s a lot of, ‘Oh we could use one of you at home with me and the missus’, and questions about my sex life,” Waldrop adds. “We’re a hot button topic.”Lately, the heat has been on high. To some, intimacy coordinators are an auspicious part of a post-#MeToo industry, one that protects cast and crew while providing crucial creative input – Michelle Williams, Alexander Skarsgård, and Emma Stone are among those to have gushed about their experiences. To others, they’re the sex police, impeding artistry for the sake of avoiding an HR headache.Mikey Madison didn’t want an intimacy coordinatorfor her Oscar-winning sex worker film Anora. Gwyneth Paltrow askedhers to “step back a little bit”while making Marty Supreme. Jennifer Lawrence couldn’t even remember if she had one while filming Die My Love (she did), but saidit wouldn’t have been necessarybecause her co-star, Robert Pattinson, “is not pervy”.There was a lot of demand very quickly for this role, that outstripped the ability of people to do it wellDespite the response to these remarks (former Channel 4 drama chief Caroline Hollick called Paltrow’s comments “irresponsible”), they’ve contributed to a negative narrative around intimacy coordination. Part of the problem is that, in the words ofFlorence Pugh, intimacy coordination is “still figuring itself out”. While some versions of this work have existed for decades – sex educator Susie Bright was brought in to choreograph intimate scenes in the 1996 film Bound – it didn’t become an industry mainstay until after #MeToo. Now, intimacy coordinators are unionised in the US with Sag-Aftra and the UK has its own registry for intimacy coordinators under Bectu. Requirements include extensive training and paid credits on at least five productions.View image in fullscreenA version of the job has existed for decades … Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly in Bound (1996), whose sex scenes were choreographed by Susie Bright.Photograph: Pathe/Allstar“There was a lot of demand very quickly for this role that outstripped the ability of people who had just started to figure out what it was to appropriately train people to do it well,” says Waldrop, whose credits include Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy and Mickey 17. “We’re not just there to whisper in the actors’ ears between takes. And I do feel like some people get into this job because they think you get to be the confidante to famous movie stars and become someone who’s praised for changing the industry for the better. But I don’t think having a big public profile as an IC is helpful. My role already gets a lot of unwanted attention, and it can be a distraction to the work.”The role of an intimacy coordinator varies depending on the project. In most cases, they begin by breaking down intimate scenes in the script and having confidential discussions with the relevant crew and actors to put a clear plan in place ahead of shooting. This might include sharing instances of sexual trauma, or anything that they feel might affect the way they approach intimate scenes. “Everything takes a bit longer, but that’s no bad thing,” says one male actor who has done sex scenes with and without an intimacy coordinator. “You never really know what actors have been through; we’ve all got pasts. So having that conversation, where no questions are asked, is really important.”If people want less nuanced intimacy on screen, then get rid of intimacy coordinators.This is the case even when the conversations are lighter. “It can just be as simple as someone hating a part of their body and not wanting it to be seen on camera,” says Robbie Taylor Hunt, an intimacy coordinator who specialises in queer content, with credits including Heartstopper and Pillion, Harry Lighton’s Bifa award-winning debut about a BDSM biker community. “I was brought on really early,” says Taylor Hunt. “Whenever you’re working on anything outside mainstream perceptions, there’s a pressure to do it justice so it doesn’t fall into tropes. But with Pillion, it felt straightforward because there was such buy-in from everyone that it was never a battle.”View image in fullscreen‘My role gets a lot of unwanted attention’ … Renée Zellweger and director Michael Morris during the making of Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy (2025), one of the films that employed intimacy coordinator Adelaide Waldrop.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyIn addition to choreographing scenes, an intimacy coordinator’s responsibilities typically include conducting risk assessments, overseeing closed sets, and providing modesty garments and barriers (ideally at least three for simulated penetration). “We’re not mental health professionals,” adds Waldrop. “But we are there to help foster an environment of transparency and ongoing, informed consent for everyone.” Having an intimacy coordinator spares female crew members from being roped in to provide emotional support to actors during sex scenes, as was common in pre-intimacy coordinator days. “A friend told me she was on a job where a young actress’s character was having sex for the first time, so the male director got loads of female crew in the room and asked them to talk about their first experiences of sex, one by one, as a way of helping the actress feel more comfortable,” says Taylor Hunt.Of course, there have been more serious incidents, too, with infamous examples of real sex on screen (“an assault on the crew as much as anyone else,” says Waldrop), and instances of assault;Maria Schneider famously said she felt “a little raped”by Marlon Brando and Bernardo Bertolucci while filming Last Tango in Paris’s butter scene.For intimacy coordinators, it’s frustrating to see their profession being reduced to clickbait. “It feels super minimising,” says Tommy Ross-Williams, whose credits include Sweetpea and The Fantastic Four: First Steps. “I’m a trans IC; I’m basically the beginning of a joke,” they say. “I think it’s the fear we have around people talking about bodies and sex more generally. If people want less nuanced intimacy on screen, then get rid of intimacy coordinators. But since ICs came along, I think people have been braver about telling intimate stories with nuance and complexity.”In terms of what happens next, intimacy coordinators are hoping that the fascination trails off; it’s hard to do a job that keeps making headlines just for existing. “I know I’ve done a good job on a set when nobody notices me at all,” says Waldrop. “Because everything’s been done in advance, so everyone knows what they’re doing in a scene, and all I do is step back and let it happen.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMikey MadisonGwyneth PaltrowJennifer LawrenceFlorence PughSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Speaking at AARP’s Movies for Grownups awards on 10 January, Clooney said: “By the way, Paul Dano and Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard, I would be honoured to work with those actors. Honoured.”Clooney continued by describing his new film, Noah Baumbach’sJay Kelly, as a movie “made by people who love actors – that’s an important part. People I’ve known most of my life … actually, most of them are actors. I have a great affinity [for them], and I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel.”“We are living in a time of cruelty,” Clooney concluded. “We don’t need to be adding to it.”In December 2025, Tarantino faced considerable backlash for his critiques of actors Paul Dano, Matthew Lillard andOwen Wilsonwhile appearing on Bret Easton Ellis’s podcast. The director said There Will Be Blood would have ranked higher than No 5 on his personal list of the best films of the century so far, were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis’s co-star.“[It] would stand a good chance at being No 1 or 2 if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it … and the flaw isPaul Dano,” Tarantino said. “Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander, but it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He’s a weak sister.”Tarantino continued by describing Dano as “such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy”, “the weakest fucking actor” in the Screen Actors Guild”, and confirmed that he had never enjoyed his performance in anything. “I don’t care for him,” he said. “I don’t care for Owen Wilson, and I don’t care for Matthew Lillard.”View image in fullscreenA poster for From Dusk Till Dawn, which co-starred Clooney and Tarantino.Photograph: Cinetext/Miramax/AllstarClooney has previously shared the screen with Lillard in Alexander Payne’s Oscar-winning 2011 film The Descendants, and co-starred with Wilson in Wes Anderson’s stop-motion adaptation of Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). He is yet to collaborate with Dano.Many of Dano’s former co-workers defended the actor following Tarantino’s attack, including Ben Stiller, Batman director Matt Reeves, and Day-Lewis, whose representativestoldthe Guardian he agreed with the sentiments expressed in an Instagram fan post declaring Dano “one of the best and most talented actors of his generation”.Speaking at a fan convention a few days after Tarantino’s critique, Lillard said his words had been damaging. “It fucking sucks,” he said. “And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood. I’m very popular in this room. I’m not very popular in Hollywood. Two totally different microcosms, right? And so, you know, it’s humbling, and it hurts.”Wilson has yet to comment.Clooney and Tarantino worked on Robert Rodriguez’s 1996 film From Dusk Till Dawn but have not teamed up since and their relationship has been chequered.“Quentin said some shit about me recently, so I’m a little irritated by him,” Clooney toldGQlast year. “He did some interview where he was naming movie stars, and he was talking about [Brad Pitt], and somebody else, and then this guy goes, ‘Well, what about George?’ He goes, ‘He’s not a movie star.’”Explore more on these topicsFilmGeorge ClooneyQuentin TarantinoPaul DanoOwen WilsonAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhonerunning iOS 26–iPhone 11or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.At a glanceBest Apple Watch for most people:SE 3From £219 at AppleBest mid-rangeApple Watch:Series 11From £369 at AppleBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 3From £729 at CurrysWhy you should trust meI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.The best Apple Watches you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreenThe Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for an iPhone with apps and full integration with iOS.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Apple Watch for most people:SE 3AppleSE 3from£219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health featuresPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £219 at Apple£219 at John LewisThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.It’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.The big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.The SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.While you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows forretrospective ovulation estimatesin the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.It tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s newAI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.Note that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.Why shouldyou buy it?The SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.Don’t buy if:you want ECG or hypertension alerts.Read our fullApple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhoneSize:40/44mmThickness:10.7mmScreen brightness:up to 1,000nitsTested battery life:1.5 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPSAppleSE 3from£219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health featuresBest mid-range Apple Watch:Series 11AppleSeries 11from£369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older modelsPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £369 at AppleFrom £369 at AmazonThe latest standard Apple Watch is the Series 11, which comes in 42mm and 46mm sizes in a more refined design. It’s just 9.7mm thick to slide more easily under cuffs than the other models. It’s available in aluminium or titanium, in multiple different colours and finishes, with plenty of strap options for those who want to switch.The Series 11 has everything the SE 3 does: the latest S10 chip, 64GB of storage and watchOS 26 with all the trimmings, including the excellent double-tap and wrist-flick gestures. But it has longer battery life, lasting a solid two days between charges for general use, or up to eight hoursof workout tracking with GPS. It charges in just over an hour via its magnetic charging puck, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.The bigger and brighter display of the Series 11 has slimmer bezels and curved edges that better blend into the body for a sleeker look overall. Plus, it’s protected by significantly more-scratch-resistant glassor super-hard sapphire, depending on the model, to keep it looking good for longer. The screen is also brighter, which makes the always-on display easier to see from an angle, particularly useful during workouts, when you might not be viewing it face on.Also included is Apple’s full health-monitoring suite, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring, and the recently added hypertension alerts that look for signs of high blood pressure over 30-day periods. For heart health, this is the Apple Watch to choose. The Series 11 also has a depth gauge that works down to six metres and a water temperature sensor for swimming, but you’ll need the Ultra model if you want to go diving.Why shouldyou buy it?The Series 11 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and nicest-looking body, with a gorgeous screen and two days of battery life. You also get the full suite of health-tracking tools with ECG, blood oxygen and hypertension alerts.Don’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or a more rugged design.Read our fullApple Watch Series 11 review: wrist-flickingly good with longer battery lifeSize:42/46mmThickness:9.7mmScreen brightness:up to 2,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, GPSAppleSeries 11from£369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older modelsBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 3AppleUltra 3from£729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple WatchPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £729 at CurrysFrom £749 at AppleThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.It’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.On the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.On the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.The Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.Size-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.Why should you buy it?The Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.Don’t buy if:you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.Read our fullApple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhoneSize:49mmThickness:12mmScreen brightness:up to 3,000nitsTested battery life:3 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:100 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPSAppleUltra 3from£729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple WatchOther optionsView image in fullscreenApple Watch Series Ultra 2 and Series 9 are still worth buying refurbished or at a discount.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSeries 10The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G.

Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges atleast £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteriescosts £95.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes andsells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chainCeX, online stores such asmusicMagpie, and marketplaces such asAmazon,eBayandBack Market.Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:Grade A orexcellent– virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.Grade B orgood– in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.Grade C orfair– in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:Batteryhealth– the battery in the Apple Watch isdesigned to maintain at least 80%of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check thebattery health under batteryvia the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?Charging cable– the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, whichcosts £29 on its own, to charge.

Her seemingly effortless movement is anything but – a professional mermaid’s free diving and performance skills require training, practice and total concentration.Mermaiding has become a global cottage industry, with pageants, conventions, retreats and meet-ups, where people gather in “pods” to practise their dolphin kicks. Makers create bespoke tail flukes, bejewelled bras, mermaid hair and even prosthetic gills for professional and hobbyist “seasters”. There is even a Netflix reality series called MerPeople, which documentsthe occasionally perilous journey of several aspiring professional merfolk. “No dead mermaids” is the motto of one business featured.View image in fullscreenMermeow Awn, real name Mongplearn Uttama, who says mermaiding has been a ‘lifeline’ for her.Photograph: Mermeow AwnGray, who goes by Mermaid Kat, is an industry veteran. While working as a scuba diving instructor in Phuket, a childhood obsession with Disney’s Little Mermaid led to her asking a wetsuit maker to fashion a cover for her monofin.“Phuket is quite a small island and it didn’t take too long for people to notice a crazy girl swimming around in a mermaid tail,” she says. People asked her to perform at birthday parties and public events, and soon after she was working as a mermaid full-time. “It just took off.”In 2012, Gray founded the world’s first mermaid school. Since then, more than 12,000 students have attended her classes and workshops in Germany, Thailand and Australia.View image in fullscreenMermaid Kat (Katrin Gray) performing at a birthday party.Photograph: Mermaid KatOn top of learning to dive underwater with your legs tied together – using an undulating motion similar to a butterfly kick – Gray’s beginner lessons cover safety, surface swimming and the importance of being an “ocean ambassador”. Her multi-day international retreats, meant for aspiring full-time performers, sell out months in advance.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMelbourne-based Tara Schwarz, known as Mermaid Tarielle, has also “made a career out of swimming in glittering tails”. Last year, she attended a mermaid convention in Germany, where she held workshops on underwater makeup.“It is a skill in itself to get a full makeup look that not only stays on in the water, but also pops,” she says.View image in fullscreenMermaid Tarielle, AKA Tara Schwarz, in the water. ‘To do this kind of work you need to be training regularly, to work on your lung capacity,’ she says.Photograph: Mermaid KatThere are occupational hazards behind the magic. Keeping your eyes open underwater means blurry vision; sinus and ear infections are common; hypothermia and sea sickness are a possibility, and, when you’re finished, getting out of skin-tight silicon is a struggle.Gray and Schwarz have had their share of extreme aquatic adventures. Gray has starred alongside an inquisitive hammerhead in an anti-shark-finning campaign video in the Bahamas and remembers feeling distinctly overwhelmed as a 4-metre long American crocodile swam overhead in Mexico.“To do this kind of work you need to be training regularly, to work on your lung capacity,” Schwarz says. A calm state of mind and low heart rate determine “how much power you have to put into the movement and how long you can stay underwater”.View image in fullscreenMermaid Tarielle with friends. ‘If it was always easy, I wouldn’t find it fun any more,’ Shwarz says.Photograph: Mermaid KatMermaid performances are a chance to share ocean conservation messages. At birthday parties Schwarz, who has a background as a children’s entertainer, will play a game similar to pass the parcel, “in which I tell them about how I collected all this treasure from the ocean but I also found all this rubbish,” she says.“We agree it’s such a shame that I had to spend all the time cleaning up the rubbish before I was able to collect the treasure.”Ocean conservation is also the main game for Perth based Mongplearn Uttama, AKA Mermeow Awn. “I started off doing corporate events … but really prefer just being involved in events that help community,” she says. “I love doing beach and underwater cleanups as a volunteer mermaid.“We use the power of the mermaid lure to get people to come and help us pick up rubbish. It seems to work. When they know that mermaids will be there, they come.”View image in fullscreenMermeow Awn, who says the water helped soothe her in the wake of a loss. ‘I just swam the tears away,’ she says.Photograph: Mermeow AwnMermaiding has been a lifeline for Uttama. “I lost someone very important to me and I was dealing with depression,” she says. But when she first dived into a pool, she felt free.“I didn’t cry in the water. It is so quiet and it mutes your senses. I didn’t think of anything … I just swam the tears away. Once I put the mermaid tail on, my life was changed for ever.”Stories like Uttama’s are common among merfolk. “People who want to be mermaids and mermen are people who want to invite more colour and fantasy into their lives, and there is often a reason for that,” Gray says.Read more summer essentialsLike any community, it has its share of drama and gossip behind the scenes, which is why, as a mermaid mentor, she emphasises the important of finding the right pod. And when it comes to more spectacular stunts, both Gray and Schwarz say a skilled safety team is essential too.“If anything goes wrong, they are able to come in with air no matter where I am or what’s going on,” Schwarz says. “When I do a deeper dive, I always have people … who understand the technical side of free diving, to be able to offer the right kind of support.”“If it was always easy, I wouldn’t find it fun any more,” Schwarz says. “There is a part of me – the free diver – that loves to push myself. The beauty of mermaiding is you get to do that while looking beautiful and graceful.”Explore more on these topicsSwimmingOceansHobbiesFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Happily, she says, all of those requirements are met by miso udon carbonara: “It has all the rich and creamy nirvana of a cheesy pasta, but with a delicious, mochi-like chew that is incredibly satisfying.” Not only that, but you can knock it up in less than 10 minutes. “Melt cheese, milk and miso in a pan to make the sauce base, then add frozen udon that have been soaked in hot water.” Coat the noodles in the sauce, then serve with crisp bacon or perhaps a few anchovies for “pops of salty fat”. Crown with a golden egg yolk (preferably duck, but hen “will suffice”), which should then be broken: “Add a crack of black pepper, and your cosy night in has begun.”“January feels like a time for fresh, bright flavours,” saysthe Guardian’s own Felicity Cloake, which for her often meanspasta con le sardemade with tinned fish, fennel seeds and lots of lemon juice; “or with purple sprouting broccoli and a generous helping of garlic and chilli”. A jar of chickpeas, meanwhile, mixed, perhaps, with harissa, chopped herbs and crumbled feta, brings the possibility of a quick stew, Cloake adds, while it’s always a good shout to braise some beans, because cook-once, eat-all-week recipes are a godsend – so long as they’re versatile, that is.James Freeman, head chef at Thomas Straker’s newAcrerestaurant in west London wholeheartedly concurs: “One of my favourite things is to roast delica pumpkin with aleppo chilli, garlic and ginger, and then eat that with braised white beans and a nice salsa verde to cut through the richness.” Not only that, he says, but “you could also blend the roast pumpkin to stir through the beans and, on another day, turn the beans and pumpkin into soup and garnish with any leftover salsa verde. That would be banging, and you won’t be wasting a thing.” Of course, similar tactics could be applied to roast chicken, if you have time of a weekend: “Save the bones to make a broth, then shred any leftover meat into that, or use it in a salad or even eat with those beans and pumpkin.”Above all, though, Cloake refuses to recognise “the idea that cooking entirely selfishly, and according to one’s own whims and eccentricities of taste, is not inherently as, if not more, satisfying than cooking to please others”. The “quickest of all” ways to achieve this, she insists, is a three-egg omelette filled with whatever veg, herbs, cured meat or cheese you happen to have in the fridge: “It’s severely underrated as a meal.” On the table in mere minutes, plus “the only person who’ll be cross if you overcook it is yourself”.

If you learn how to store ingredients properly (cool, dark places are handy for spuds, for example) and keep tabs on what’s in your fridge/freezer, you can use everything up before it goes off – and make delicious things in the process. This golden, cheese-crusted souffle uses up the celeriac and spuds left after the festive season, plus any odds and ends of cheeses. It is spectacularly good, especially paired with a sparkling citrus salad.Celeriac, onion and cheese souffle (pictured top)Sweet onions, soft roots and lots of cheese rise into a light, golden souffle with none of the fuss of making a bechamel. Bliss!Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes4-6300g celeriac200gfloury potatoesSalt45g butter,plus extra for greasing1 large red onion, peeled and finely diced1 small handful fresh thyme leaves1-2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated200g double cream100ggreek yoghurt, or soured cream250g grated cheese– I use a mix of blueand cheddarGrated nutmeg7 eggs, separatedPeel the celeriac and potatoes, then cut them into bite-sized chunks. Put them in a pan filled with 7½cm-10cm salted boiling water, then cook on a high heat for 18-20 minutes, until tender. (Alternatively, if you have leftover cooked potatoes or celeriac, this dish is a lovely way of using them up.)Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan, add the onion and season generously with salt, pepper and the thyme. Sweat, stirring, on a medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the garlic.Drain the roots, then roughly mash them in the pan set over a low heat. Add the the cream and yoghurt, then mash again. Add three-quarters of the grated cheese and heat gently, stirring well, for a few minutes. Stir in the softened onion mixture and season to taste with more salt and pepper, plus a few generous gratings of nutmeg.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½, then beat the egg yolks into the vegetables. In a large, very clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff and immovable, then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold a third of them into the root mash. Fold the veg mix into the remaining egg whites, taking care not to beat out the air.Pour the mixture into a large, buttered ovenproof ceramic vessel, sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake in the centre of the oven for 40-45 minutes; if the top is threatening to brown too much after 30 minutes, turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Once the souffle has risen and is smelling glorious, serve at once with the citrus salad below.This recipe was amended on 13 January 2026 to specify in the method where to add the remaining cheese.Honeyed citrus, rocket and pomegranate saladA refreshing, beautifully coloured salad with contrasting bursts of sweetness from the citrus, honey and peppery leaves.View image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ honeyed citrus, rocket and pomegranate saladPrep25 minServes41 blood orange1 pink grapefruit½ red onion, peeled and finely diced100g rocket,washed2 heads chicory, preferably pink1 small pomegranate50g sunflower seeds, toastedFor the dressing1 heaped tsp honey1 tbsp good-quality cider vinegar1 heaped tsp dijon mustard75ml olive oilCut the tops and bottoms off the citrus fruits, then cut away the skin and white pith.

I received no follow-up for two months.When I chased the matter, I was told the request had been cancelled because I was born in Russia. I moved to the UK as a child and revoked my citizenship in 1999. I now have dual British and German nationality.Theadviser checked that I have no ties to Russia, or any Russian assets, and rebooked the appointment. On the rebooked day, no one contacted me and, when I called, I was told the appointment had been “erroneously” cancelled due to my country of birth, and was rebooked for the next day. The call happened, but was terminated within minutes.The Co-op told meit had received “specialist legal advice” instructingit not to provide advice to anyone born in Russia, regardless of their current citizenship or ties. Is it lawful to refuse service on the basis of someone’s place of birth?AK,LondonSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, strict financial restrictions have been imposed on anyone connected to the Russian government and its war aims. The penalties for doing financial or legal business with those sanctioned underRussia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulationsinclude imprisonment of up to seven years, so many banks and legal firms are playing it safe.The UK government guidance is clear: if a person is not designated under a sanctions regime, or connected to someone who is, they will not be prohibited from financial and legal services.You are not on the government list of designated persons but were still asked to provide proof that you had revoked your citizenship. You say you were reluctant to do this out of principle because citizenship alone does not trigger the sanctions, and the Co-op has failed to explain the requirement.Your updated will would bequeath your assets to your partner and daughter, neither of whom are Russian.But the Co-op is taking a “no-risk” approach after receiving legal advice. It says: “If breached, the Russia regulations hold serious consequences for a business and those it employs. We therefore must carry out the correct due diligence to ensure we comply with these rules.”It says it would serve you if you provided the certificate proving you have renounced your Russian citizenship.I asked HM Treasury if it was legal to discriminate against customers simply because they were Russian-born. It replied that its regulations set more store by where in the world a customer lives than where they were born, but says it was up to companies to decide how to comply with the rules and who to do business with.It is unpalatable that you should pay a price because of your birth location, but it seems you will have to provide the document the Co-op wants.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

And opting for a high-altitude resort that needs less artificial snow makes it even greener. Les Arcs in the French Alps ticks both boxesMary-Ann OchotaTue 13 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 02.02 ESTShareI’ve always wanted to try skiing, but it’s not a cheap holiday and I have always had a lingering suspicion that some resorts are like Las Vegas in the mountains, with artificial snow, damaging infrastructure, annihilated vegetation and air-freighted fine dining – in short, profoundly unsustainable.However, if there’s a way to have a green family ski holiday, then sign me – and my husband, Joe, two kids and my mum – up. Here’s how to do it.Choose how you get thereTravel usually makes up the largest part of your ski trip’s environmental impact. “The greenest ski resort is the one you get to without flying,” says Dom Winter fromProtect Our Winters UK, a charity whose mission is to rally the outdoor community to take meaningful climate action. You can get to the French Alps by train, so that’s where we’re heading.View image in fullscreenEurostar’s Snow train … much more sustainable than flying.We hop on the Eurostar Snow train in London at 9am on Saturday, and change at Lille to the high-speed TGV that reaches many of the leading French ski areas – Val d’Isère, Tignes, Les Arcs, Courchevel, Méribel, Les Menuires, Val Thorens, La Plagne and La Rosière – by evening. If you don’t fancy a whole day on the train, there’s also the option to go to Paris for the day, then jump on the ski sleeper train after dinner and let it zoom you south to the mountains by morning.There are many benefits to the train – more space to move around, play, snooze, and no limits on weight for regular-size bags (provided you can carry them), liquids or picnic goods, provided they are consumed during the journey. And, of course, there’s the visceral sense of going somewhere.The fields, lakes and towns of France whiz by and our kids marvel at the distance on the map. As sunset approaches, we see snow-capped mountains – at first hazy, then crystal clear.Six of the best stress-free European breaks by trainRead moreWe step into chilly evening air at Bourg Saint-Maurice, the terminating station. It’s staggering to know that the carbon footprint (CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent) of our journey from home is only 4.7kg (10lb 6oz) per person (UK train from Hertfordshire to London St Pancras, Eurostar to Lille, French TGV to Bourg St Maurice). If we’d taken a taxi to Gatwick airport, the plane to Geneva and a coach transfer to the ski resort, we’d be weighing in at 110kg of CO2e each. The bottom line: sustainable skiing is flight-free.Rent your kitRenting skis, boots, poles and helmets at the resort is a no-brainer. But what about clothing? We do plenty of outdoor adventures but don’t own specific snowsports clothing. I don’t want to spend hundreds on kit that we’ll only wear for one week a year, nor buy cheap, poor quality gear.EnterEcoski– an award-winning skiwear rental company. You can hire everything from gloves and goggles to snowsuits and even ski socks. It stocks dozens of high-performance brands, from sizes XXS to 4XL, and all of it is cleaned and sanitised, fully waterproofed and sent direct to your home a few days before you travel. When you get back, you stuff it all back in the box – no need to clean anything, not even the socks – and return it so that it can be cleaned and used again by someone else the following week. If you love your kit and want to keep it, that’s an option as well – so it works as a “try before you buy” service.I select jackets, salopettes, goggles and gloves bundles, and add in several pairs of socks, winter boots and base layers. The next morning, the team are in touch to get our exact measurements and even colour preferences. They can also send items early so you can check the fit and try alternatives if necessary.View image in fullscreenSkiwear for hire from EcoskiGo high and choose sustainableClimate change is transforming the Alps. The snow line has edged higher and, at last count,186 French ski resorts have closed. Some resorts are ramping up artificial snow-making – which demands copious energy and water. Some even use helicopters to drop snow. Other places have made the strategic decision to step back from unsustainable management practices. These are the resorts to pick – and aim for higher altitudes, where they’ll probably need to make less snow each season.In France, theFlocon Vert(green snowflake) scheme certifies ski destinations that meet exacting sustainability criteria across resource management (water, energy, soil, biodiversity and waste), governance, sustainable employment, and social and community aspects, including accessible tourism and support for local needs. The focus is on concrete actions and long-term collaboration. So far, 18 destinations have achieved 1 Flocon Vert, 13 destinations have achieved 2 Flocons Verts. With help from the travel companyInghams Ski– which has a target to halve its emissions by 2030 – I pick the 2 Flocons Verts and B Corp-certified Les Arcs, which is at the forefront of sustainable skiing.It’s all purpose-built, but rather than feeling inauthentic, it simply feels well designed to make things easy, cosy and connectedMarie Clémence Vallier is in charge of quality, safety and environment at ADS, the company that operates Les Arcs and Peisey-Vallandry mountain resorts.“We’re committed to managing the mountain respectfully. We’ve set ourselves a limit on how much water we use to make snow each season. When the water’s used up, we’ll stop. And we’ve pulled back from grooming some routes. Our visitors care about this place – they understand why we’re doing it,” she says.ADS produces 10% of its energy using meltwater hydroelectricity, has improved the affordable accommodation for seasonal staff and is investing in summer tourism, too, including hiking and mountain biking using ski lift infrastructure. “Our visitors have fun, and go home knowing that their choices make a difference and that every small action helps. We’re doing it together,’ Vallier says.View image in fullscreenOur base … Arc 1950.Photograph: Andy ParantLes Arcs boasts a quick transfer from Bourg train station (by free funicular and shuttle bus, or by minibus), and the resort villages, at 1,600 metres, 1,800 metres, 1,950 metres and 2,000 metres, are all car-free and offer access to 265 miles (425km) of ski runs – from wide green beginner slopes to off-piste black runs, all open when we visit in December.We opt to stay at Arc 1950, where the majority of accommodation is self-catered ski-in/ski-out apartments, clustered around snowy, skiable lanes and a quaint village square, complete with clock tower, artisanal bakery and twinkling fairy lights. It’s all purpose-built, but rather than feeling inauthentic, it simply feels well designed to make things easy, cosy and connected.Learn and enjoyThere’s an old adage: you look after what you care about, and you care about what you know. It’s true of nature and our environment, and I’m excited my kids can experience fun and wonder in these beautiful mountains. Our first morning is an excited rush toPrecision Ski, where we collect boots, skis, poles and helmets. Then it’s a snowball’s throw to the meeting point for our ski lessons withEvolution2.My beginner group instructor, Louise, has us quickly scooting about on one ski, then two, then sliding down a tiny slope. I fall over. Twice. “Very good!” calls Louise as I clamber to my feet. “You’ll learn quickly if you don’t mind falling. Keep your weight forward!” I lean into the fronts of my boots, where my shins are already tender. And for a few seconds I’m balanced on my skis. I remember to breathe and look forward rather than down and slide to the bottom of the little slope without tumbling or flailing my arms. Louise grins and high-fives me. We’re off.View image in fullscreenCol de la Chal, near Les ArcsWe finish two hours later and I’m exhausted – I remind myself that learning new physical skills is rocket fuel for a healthy brain. I rendezvous with the family: my mum has had a fun morning sketching the mountains, my kids are grinning and Joe looks alive and joyful. After a 25-year break from skiing, he has remembered how much he loves it, and his intermediate level group is going to spend the week finessing skills and exploring routes across the mountain.We’re all ready for a good feed. Lots of the restaurants and cafes in the village offer fresh-made regional specialties – from soups and stews to fondue made from the region’s cheeses.A frozen, protected wonderland: slow adventure in the less visited French AlpsRead moreThe next afternoon, Mum, my four-year-old and I meet mountain guide Michel to go snowshoeing. We trace a slow and gentle line through the forest, bum-sliding down the powdery slopes and looking for animal tracks – we spot deer and fox footprints, and hear about the wolves, marmot and bearded vultures that also live here. Mont Blanc is resplendent on the other side of the valley and, when we all stop, the deep hush of the snowy forest envelops us. It’s magical.At the end of the week, ski instructor Louise takes our exuberant group for hot chocolates and awards us achievement badges that are normally reserved for the kids’ lessons. I’m delighted to be awarded a “Yeti 1” level, celebrating my very basic beginner’s competence. It’s been a joyful week in these beautiful mountains – ethical, sustainable and adventurous.

The author of Breath explains how that can be changedEmine SanerTue 13 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 08.46 ESTShareIn the last stages of writing his book, Breath, James Nestor was stressed. “Which was ironic when writing a book about breathing patterns and mellowing out,” he says. The book was late; he’d spent his advance and was haemorrhaging even more money on extra research that was taking him off in new, potentially interesting, directions – was it really necessary, he wondered, to go to Paris to look at old skulls buried in catacombs beneath the city? (It was.)Then a couple of months before the book’s May 2020 publication date, the Covid pandemic hit, and Nestor was advised to wait it out. He couldn’t afford to. “One of the main motivations for releasing it at that time was to get that [on-publication] advance,” he says. “But I’ll be honest, I didn’t want to release it. I said: ‘How are you going to promote a book that can’t be sold in stores, that I can’t tour for?’” He expected, he says, “absolutely zero to happen”.But it turned out that a book that reminded people of the power of breathing – in the midst of a respiratory illness pandemic – was what the world wanted. It has since sold more than 3m copies.Five years on, Nestor has updated the book with a revised preface, and other new material including his latest enthusiasm: testing the air quality of hotel rooms and planes, some ofwhich, according to his readings, contain alarmingly high levels of CO2. He has learned a lot since the 2020 publication, he says, from all the letters sent by readers and additional experts he has spoken to. The popularity of “breathwork”, or breathing exercises, as a wellness trend has taken off, but it hasn’t yet become mainstream.View image in fullscreenNot yet mainstream … Breathwork has taken off as a wellness trend.Photograph: Mariia Vitkovska/Getty ImagesNestor used to believe breathing was binary. “You’re doing it, you’re alive; you’re not doing it, that’s bad news.” The author is at home in Portugal where he now lives, speaking calmly – perhaps this is what more than a decade of breath research does – over Zoom. He has spent the morning working on his next book, which is nearly finished, though he won’t say what it’s about.Before he became interested in breathing, Nestor was living in San Francisco and plagued by recurrent respiratory problems, getting mild pneumonia most years. He went for dinner with a friend, a doctor, and she told him his breathing was off. “I guess I was breathing through my mouth. She could hear me across the table, really laboured breaths, and she suggested I go to a breathwork class.”For his first experience of Sudarshan Kriya, a rhythmic breathing technique, Nestor somewhat reluctantly joined a group in a dusty old house in the bohemian Haight-Ashbury area of the city. The experience, he says, was “absolutely revelatory”. Sitting on the floor in a draughty room, Nestor sweated from head to toe (the practice is believed to generate energy). “It was not subtle. It was extreme, almost violent, which I liked, because it showed me that there was something extremely powerful here.” For the next few days he felt lighter, less anxious. “I felt so completely different, and I do every time I do this breathwork practice.” He does it online most weeks now; each session is about 45 minutes, with 25 minutes of intense breathing. “I love it. I love that energy.”Nestor grew up in California and, after college, worked as a copywriter for many years, writing articles in evenings and weekends, before he became a full-time freelance journalist. Around the time he started regularly going to that breathwork class, he took an assignment in Greece to write about freedivers, who could dive to great depths while holding their breath for several minutes. “That’s when I knew that there was a deeper story to be told about [breathing], watching these people do this thing that is supposed to be impossible.”View image in fullscreen‘I love that energy’ …Composite: Guardian Design; Cravetiger/Getty ImagesHis interest in breath wasn’t about becoming superhuman. “I think just being able to breathe normally is something so few people do, and that sounds crazy until you look at the stats, and you start counting how many people have asthma, they snore, have sleep apnoea.”Nestor calls breathing the missing pillar of health. We know the importance of diet, exercise and sleep, but breath, he says, tends to get ignored. What does good breathing look like or feel like? “You don’t see it. It is subtle, soft. You don’t see it in the chest, in the shoulders. You don’t see any wincing in the face. The mouth is closed. If you look at a monk meditating, it’s a beautiful thing. It’s silent, clean. There should be no sound from your breathing, and no movement other than a slight expansion in the abdominal area. What does it feel like? It feels like your body is able to operate at peak efficiency.” Most people breathe “into” their chests, he says, rather than their belly (you can test by placing your hand on your abdomen when you inhale). “It’s extremely inefficient, and it’s also sending messages to your brain that you are stressed, and creates a vicious cycle.”Slow breathing appears to have benefits, including calming the nervous system. Nestor writes about “resonant” or “coherent” breathing: a pattern of a 5.5 second inhale and 5.5 second exhale, which is also almost exactly 5.5 breaths a minute. Ancient cultures as diverse as Buddhists and Native Americans were on to this, Nestor writes, with chants and prayer cycles following this pattern.What about the benefits, or potential pitfalls, of deep breathing? I’m confused by Nestor’s findings. “You should be,” he says. “You’re going to hear different things from different breathworkers. I believe that a slow, deep breath is extremely beneficial for the body, for blood pressure, for the nervous system and more. Some people in Buteyko schools [a method to regulate overbreathing] never take a deep breath – it’s always very light. I don’t really agree with that. I think we have this physiology; we’re built to take a deep breath, as long as it’s in tune with whatever we’re doing. You’re just reminding yourself of what you’re already built to do.”Unlike diet, sleep and exercise, we ignore breathing because it doesn’t depend on us taking much notice of it. But we should, and we used to, says Nestor. Breathing was part of spirituality. “You can go into any ancient culture, from the Greeks to Hebrews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Chinese – I can go on and on – and breathing was foundational to their health. It’s only in the industrial era, in the past few hundred years in the west, that we’ve started ignoring it, just like we started ignoring our diet, eating industrialised foods.”And that food – the soft, processed, easy-to-eat kind – haschanged the shapes of our skulls, according to researchers. Without having to chew on tough meat, raw vegetables and whole foods (and with fewer babies gettingthe jaw workout that breastfeeding promotes), modern human jaws are not developing as our ancestors’ did, or those in more traditional societies.View image in fullscreenHave we forgotten how to breathe properly in the west?Illustration: Getty Images“This was one of the most revelatory things I found late in my research, which is why I had to go back and redo everything,” says Nestor. (It was what took him to those catacombs in Paris.) “All you have to do is look at ancient skulls. They have straight teeth. They look like a different species. I have crooked teeth, [wore] braces, had [tooth] extractions – everyone I know did, too. You start questioning: how did this happen? Most people have crooked teeth. No other animal on Earth has chronically crooked teeth. It absolutely affects how you breathe, because crooked teeth are a sign that your mouth is too small. And if that mouth is too small for teeth, it’s going to be too small to breathe easily and freely.”If I gave my children a bone to gnaw on every day, would they develop better facial structures, and breathe easily throughout their lives? Nestor smiles. Maybe not a bone, he says. “But better habits, 100%.” He wore a palate-expanding device, similar to a retainer, every night for a year. “Not a pleasant thing to do, [but] it absolutely changed me. It opened up my airways. I built new bone in my face.” Nestor suggests that early interventions such as myofunctional therapy – which uses exercises to retrain the muscles in the face, especially the tongue – could work, but this is still considered by the NHS to be an alternative therapy and lacks good evidence as a treatment for sleep apnoea.Many of the people Nestor writes about in his book are a little eccentric, to say the least. There’s Carl Stough, a choirmaster who started treating emphysema patients in the 50s and went on to coach the US Olympic running team, but whose strange bodily manipulations and breathing exercises died with him. Or the Swedish breathing researcher Anders Olsson, who huffs carbon dioxide from a tank.Nestor visited the late orthodontist John Mew at his self-built castle in East Sussex, andhis son Mike, also an orthodontist but more famously a social media star whose “mewing” videos – in which people are encouraged to stick their tongue to their upper palate, claiming it will improve face shape – have been watched by millions. In November 2024,Mike Mew was suspended from the dentists’ registerfor inappropriate treatment of two child patients and making misleading claims on YouTube, which he is appealing.This is before we even start thinking about the breathwork practitioners who promise cures for everything, or a higher state of consciousness. Why does this field seem to attract fairly fringe people?“Most started off on a very traditional path, and then they started piecing together that things weren’t quite right, and then they shift gears. If you look at [orthodontist and researcher] Marianna Evans, she was a traditional dentist, and then things just weren’t adding up for her.” The dentistry that took off in the 70s and 80s – which Nestor and his peers received – was about extracting teeth to accommodate others. “Shouldn’t we be expanding [their mouths]? Maybe she’s considered fringe, but I don’t think so any more.” The Mews, he acknowledges, are fringe: “100%, and it has less to do with what they’re promoting and [more] how they’re promoting it.”Olsson, his friend and fellow “pulmonaut”, to use Nestor’s word, is a “bit fringe-y”, too. “He’s more an experimenter, along with me. But the vast majority of the actual researchers and doctors in that book are people who are very much a part of the medical community and started seeing things in a different way.”The growing popularity of breathwork is still associated with esoteric thinking. “Which is fine if people are into that,” Nestor says. He prefers to think of it as “your body being allowed to do what it’s naturally designed to do.”Breath by James Nestor (Penguin Life, £10.99).

Nothing – and that is the point, say the women behind Jacarandas, a Colombian abortion helpline. Determined to set themselves apart from more traditional reproductive health organisations, Jacarandas commissions street and graphic artists to create eye-catching illustrations – most recently a cartoon feline called Gataranda, inspired by the team’s much-loved office pet.The aim is not to make light of abortion but to appeal to the teenagers and young women who use Jacarandas’ services. “A lot of people do not connect with [an image of] the uterus on fire, so we thought ‘what can we do to connect more with young women?’” says Carolina Benítez Mendoza, the deputy director.“We try to stay current and make things that are fun; we adapt our vibe for whatever’s trending. We don’t want to be that feminist organisation that’s had the same logo since 1995. Make abortion cats mainstream!”We wanted to explain how and where to get a safe, legal abortion. It’s simple but so importantViviana Bohórquez MonsalveEstablished soon after abortion wasdecriminalised in Colombiain 2022, Jacarandas provides advice on abortion and sexual and reproductive rights through a WhatsApp helpline. The all-female team, including a lawyer, psychologist, nurse and social worker, respond to every inquiry, ensuring that users receive accurate information about their legal rights and the closest clinic, as well as emotional support.“The law changed but society will be the same for a long time,” says Jacarandas director, Viviana Bohórquez Monsalve, referring to the stigma that still surrounds abortion in Colombia. The message from Jacarandas is that abortion is a normal health procedure that does not have to be traumatic.“We wanted to explain how and where to get a safe, legal abortion,” she says. “Most people didn’t know – they thought they had to pay. It’s simple but so important; if you get the right information you will have a positive experience.”View image in fullscreenGataranda the cat, used in Jacarandas’ illustrations, was inspired by a much-loved office pet.Photograph: HandoutUsing colourful graphics and choosing a name (jacaranda is a purple flowering plant native to South America) that have no direct link to abortion is just one part of a communications strategy that differentiates the organisation. The Jacarandas team addresses a wide range ofgender issues from periods to body dysmorphia, sex to films through friendly, irreverentTikTok videos, Instagram and Facebook posts.They also attend events such as music festivals, concerts and an annual comic book convention to raise awareness of the service, and sell merchandise that helps pay for travel and accommodation for women and girls who would not otherwise be able to attend a clinic.Benítez says: “It is our goal to reach new people and open the conversation – we try to redesign and reinvent. It’s not the 90s any more – people don’t need statistics; a 14-year-old who needs an abortion doesn’t care about a court ruling, she needs to know where to go.”The strategy is working. Jacarandas is the most-followed abortion account on social media in the Spanish-speaking world, with nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok, and 312,000 on Instagram. Since it started it has received messages from more than 26,300 people, and in 2025 provided advice to about 700 users a month.Abortionis legal up to 24 weeks in Colombia, but most users contact Jacarandas as soon as they miss a period, and 93% have an abortion before 12 weeks.They also offer legal support to women and girls who are denied their right to a free abortion or who have a bad experience. In one case, a woman who attended a clinic for an abortion was threatened and criticised by the medical staff, experienced delays in the delivery of medication, lack of supervision and mistreatment in pain management.“We think it is torture – she felt pain for a whole week,” says the Jacarandas’ lawyer, Laura Camila Bernate Ramos.A court ruled that the woman had sufferedphysical and psychological obstetric violence– the first such ruling in Colombia in connection with abortion. It also found that her insurance company had violated her privacy and dignity when it approached her father for authorisation, despite her being an adult.View image in fullscreenThe Jacarandas team also offer legal support to women and girls who have had a bad experience at clinics.Photograph: Courtesy of JacarandasJacarandas’ success has attracted attention from organisations across Latin America. “We teach organisations about branding, how to create content, how to play with music, trends, who is following them – how to reinvent themselves,” says Benítez.“We have the Chinese world as owners of TikTok, and the American world with Meta, and censorship is very different on the platforms.”Argentina used as a ‘testing ground’ for eroding abortion rights, warns AmnestyRead moreJacarandas has direct experience of censorship. Between September and December 2025 its WhatsApp line was restricted four times by Meta, forcing it to temporarily switch its hotline to Telegram.Repro Uncensored, a nonprofit organisation that tracks digital censorship, says this ispart of an escalating trend of global censorship, which Meta has denied, saying its policies remain unchanged.Bohórquez Monsalve, a lawyer who has campaigned for abortion rights for 20 years, was in the crowd waiting outside the constitutional court in Bogotá for news of the abortion ruling in 2022. She had been part of the14 por Colombiacampaign to legalise abortion – a reference toArgentina’s 2020 law, which allowed elective abortion up to 14 weeks.Few expected the Colombian court to go further and introduce a 24-week cut-off. “It was really exciting. I was there and I was really, ‘24 weeks?!’ It was amazing.”View image in fullscreenJacarandas’ WhatsApp line has been restricted four times since September 2025.Photograph: Jacarandas/Reprouncensored/InstagramFour years on, the mood among reproductive justice activists is still buoyant, but there is no room for complacency, says Bohórquez Monsalve.“Now, we are in a good moment in Colombia – we’re in the honeymoon period.

But while some Yemenis have died on the frontline, others are now prisoners of warNawal Al MaghafiTue 13 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 14.57 ESTShareThe first time I heard Hussein’s mother’s voice, it wasn’t anger that came through the phone, it was exhaustion.“There are rumours that he burned to death,” she said to me. “How do you think that makes me feel as a mother? Where are you, Hussein? I’m looking for you. Please my daughter, help me.”Her 28-year-old son had left Yemen, chasing the promise of a salary that could give him a better future. Within weeks, he had vanished into a war he did not understand, in a country whose language he didn’t speak, to one of the world’s most brutal frontlines. For months she scrolled the internet, searching for his face in the videos coming out of foreign fighters on Russia’s frontline, or his name in any of the chat groups discussing them, but had no success. Then a document arrived from Russia: Hussein’s death certificate.And yet, when I finally found Hussein, he was alive.I’m Yemeni myself. I have reported on war for the BBC for years, including on my own country’s long collapse. But nothing prepared me for what I would learn while investigating Russia’s recruitment of foreign fighters: the precision with which vulnerability is targeted; how promises are tailored to poverty; how citizenship becomes bait; how families are left to grieve in the dark.Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dragged on into a fourth year, and its appetite for manpower is relentless. An estimated 20,000 foreign fighters have been pulled in from across the world, from countries including Nepal, Cuba,South Africaand North Korea, in what is being advertised as ideological “volunteering” but is, in reality, recruitment by exploitation.Back in March 2022, President Vladimir Putin publicly backed the idea of bringing men from the Middle East to fight, insisting they wantedto come “not for money”, and that Russia should help them reach the combat zone. What I have seen since is a pipeline: informal brokers and online channels connecting desperate men to contracts with Russia’s military. These contracts often promise a year, a salary, a passport, and safety, but the fine print can trap them indefinitely.I began following the stories of Yemeni recruits after videos started circulating online: young men filming themselves from Russia, pleading for help. One of them, his voice cracking, says: “We die a thousand times a day from the terror we endure at the hands of the Russians … save your Yemeni brothers … we are being forced to fight … our friends are dead … we are trapped between life and death.”The videos were raw, immediate, and hard to watch.In Amsterdam, I met Ali Alsabahi, founder of the International Federation of Yemeni Migrants (based in the Netherlands), who has spent months tracking the journeys of (he estimates) 400 Yemenis who travelled to Russia. He told me he had been receiving pleas daily, calls and videos asking for rescue, and that he had forwarded them to officials, to the foreign ministry, to the Yemeni ambassador in Moscow. “The situation in Yemen is catastrophic,” he said. “It’s normal for young men who are unemployed to be told: ‘Come, we will give you thousands of dollars.’ So they went.”Yemen’s war has hollowed out the economy and the state. The internationally recognised government and its Saudi-led allies are fighting the Iran-backed Houthi movement, as well as being locked in a power struggle with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council in the south of the country. In cities such as Taiz, in the south-west, people survive on fragmented wages, charity,or remittances. For young men, the future can feel like a door that has slammed shut. In that landscape, a contract offering thousands of dollars, plus fast-tracked citizenship, isn’t just tempting; it’s life-changing.Alsabahi told me that more than 24 Yemenis are known to have been killed in Russia, and others remain missing. Parents call him, desperate to track down sons who have stopped answering. Some, he said, were told their sons burned in vehicles hit on the frontline. Others received death certificates from Russia with no explanations of what happened to their sons or how they could repatriate their bodies. He told me that he had heard rumours of imprisonment inUkraine. Two names came up again and again: Hussein and Khalil.View image in fullscreenA child stands in the mud near tents at a  camp for people displaced by the conflict in Taiz in 2021.Photograph: Ahmad Al-Basha/AFP/Getty ImagesKhalil is from Taiz. His mother, Shafia, lives in the rural village of Badan, in Yemen. She sent me a school photo: Khalil in ninth grade, a boy with his life before him. He was the eldest child and the family’s sole breadwinner. He worked in a market hauling vegetables for a small daily wage of about $70 (£52) a month. He then travelled to Oman and worked in a restaurant washing dishes. Even then he would send the $100 (£74) he made back home every month. When he told his mother he had a chance to go to Russia, he told her he would find a job in a restaurant or a farm, the kind of jobs Yemenis had gone abroad to do before, Shafia says. “He told me: ‘Thank God, mother, I feel good things are going to happen. I’ll finally make some proper money.’ Even though we are desperate, I had a bad feeling, I told him, I don’t want you to go. This is a far away country.”After he reached Russia, contact became sporadic. Then it stopped. “He told me it wasn’t what he expected, but he didn’t tell me they had been sent to the frontline. Khalil has never picked up a weapon in his life.” Shafia searched online and found Yemenis mentioning his name in videos. Then she heard he had been caught up in the battle for Kursk, and that the platoon of 20 Yemenis he was a part of were all killed.In Yemen, death is familiar. But this was different: not dying in Taiz, not dying under the bombs that have haunted their own skies, but disappearing into a European war, a war he barely understood.View image in fullscreenAl Maghafi with Hussein in the prisoner of war camp in western Ukraine.Photograph: BBCWhen Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024, reports said that around600 Russian servicemen were captured. Some of them were foreign fighters with Russian citizenship. When a fighter disappears on the frontline, there are only a few possibilities: killed, buried anonymously, or captured.I travelled to western Ukraine, to one of the country’s largest prisoners of war facilities, to meet foreign fighters captured while fighting for Russia. Walking through the prison, the scale of Russia’s recruitment is clear: there are men there from all over the world. I met people from Egypt, Senegal and Sri Lanka. In the canteen, I asked if anyone spoke Arabic to see if any of the men whose families I’d been speaking to were there.Then, when I said I am Yemeni, prison officials told me they were holding two Yemenis in another part of the prison. I asked if I could meet them.“Hello,” I said, stepping in. “Hussein and Khalil?”“Yes,” one of them replied.“I’m Nawal Al Maghafi,” I told them. “I’m also Yemeni. I’ve been talking with your families for a while now.”Khalil stared at me as if the walls had shifted. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “Is this a dream or real?”Hussein and Khalil told me they had been in Russia for only six weeks before they were captured. Within days of being sent to the frontline, they were attacked. Many of the men with them were killed. Hussein and Khalil were taken prisoner. I was allowed to interview them alone in a room. Before I could start my interview I asked them about the other men whose families had contacted me; they confirmed to me that they were the only survivors.View image in fullscreenRussian prisoners of war in western Ukraine on November 26, 2025.Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe details they shared were both mundane and devastating: the bureaucracy of a foreign army, the confusion of orders shouted in Russian, the suddenness of violence. “I regret that I went to another country … to fight for what?” Hussein told me. “There’s a war in Yemen, whoever wants war should stay in Yemen.”He described being woken early one morning, loaded into a tank, and driven to the frontline. “You can’t be on the frontline and not speak Russian,” he said. “That doesn’t make sense.” A drone buzzed overhead, dropping bombs. He was hurt. When he woke, he saw Ukrainian soldiers with a gun to his head.“At that moment, how did you feel?” I asked.“It was … a bad situation,” he said quietly.Khalil told me he had understood that going to Russia might involve army service, but that it was worth it for the money they had promised him. “I’ve never dreamt of having $2,400 (£1,781) a month,” he said. “If I worked for 10 years, I wouldn’t get the same amount as I got in Russia in one year.”When I asked if he had thought about the people on the other side – innocent Ukrainians who would be their victims – he didn’t hesitate. “If I had known that,” he said, “I wouldn’t have joined this war.”Khalil asked me one thing: could he call his mother to tell her he was alive? I watched his hands shake as the call connected.“Hello,” he said.“Hello Khalil, how are you?” Shafia’s voice came back breaking, overwhelmed to hear her son’s voice.“Mum, don’t cry,” he pleaded. “God bless you.”View image in fullscreenAl-Maghafi with Khalil at the prisoner of war camp.Photograph: Phil Pendlebury/BBC“I swear I can’t believe I’m talking to you right now,” she said. “I dream every day of being able to get in touch with you.”“It’s the first time I’ve talked to you in eight months,” she repeated.Then Khalil’s voice dropped.“I made the biggest mistake,” he said. “Forgive me, forgive me. And tell my dad to forgive me.”Shafia tried to sound steady. “Look after yourself so that you don’t despair.”When he hung up, he exhaled. “Thank God,” he said. “My mum is relieved.”Months after my first visit, I returned to the prisoner of war camp. Prisoners told me that more than 2,000 soldiers had been exchanged between Russia and Ukraine over that period – but none of Russia’s foreign fighters were included. Every week, they said, they watched Russians go home while they stayed behind.“They don’t care about us,” one prisoner told me. “They’re like: ‘Let’s keep the foreign fighters in prison until the war is over.’”Khalil had been in prison for almost a year. When I asked him what he wished for, he said: “I dream of a life. Of my future that is lost.” When I asked if he wanted to go back to Yemen, he paused. “Where?” he said. “Yemen did nothing for me.” It wasn’t a rejection of his mother. It was an indictment of what Yemen’s collapse has stolen from its young people. And yet, when he spoke to Shafia, the child in him surfaced immediately.“Mum, I’m tired,” he said. “I want to get out.”She replied with the kind of devotion only a parent can offer: “I’d give you my eyes. I’d give you everything I have.”Khalil said something that shocked me. “I need to go back to Russia,” he told me.For a moment I thought I had misunderstood. The last time he was there his entire platoon was wiped out, bodies destroyed, men disappearing. Why would he want to return?Khalil had not withdrawn a single penny of the money he had been promised, he explained. Whatever had been paid was still sitting in a bank account in Russia, an account he could not access from a Ukrainian prison. And he was ashamed, he said, to go back to Yemen empty-handed after everything he had put his family through.He had left as the family’s provider, the eldest son meant to carry the household. Now he was a prisoner. His mother and four younger brothers were struggling back home. The family had rented out their entire house, and were all living together in one room, relying on charity from people in their neighbourhood to survive. His desire to return to Russia was neither loyalty nor ideology; it was poverty and pride braided together. A man trying to salvage dignity from a catastrophe.Khalil and Hussein had signed contracts issued by Russia’s military. Recruiters often advertise them as one-year deals, long enough to earn serious money, short enough to feel survivable. But there is a trapdoor. Russia issued a decree in September 2022 binding soldiers to serve until the end of the war effort, which in practice has meant many contracts roll on automatically. For foreigners with limited Russian, little legal support and no political leverage, the effect can be total captivity. These young men told me plainly: they wanted to leave, but they could not. Their Russian citizenship, fast-tracked as part of recruitment, did not protect them. Their own state did not appear to be fighting for their return either.When I think about Khalil and Hussein now, I understand the terrible simplicity of their choices. What they were promised delivered them to just two fates: to die on the frontline, or to live on and vanish into a prison system that may never let them out. For their families back home, both futures feel like the same kind of loss.Journalist Nawal Maghafi’s Into the Void: Putin’s Foreign Fighters is now available to stream on BBC iPlayer and on the BBC World Service’s YouTube channel.Explore more on these topicsYemenRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was, she said, “super bright, witty, personable, generous and kind”.Ryan killed himself on 12 May 2024. A report written after his death acknowledged significant shortcomings in the support he received while seeking help for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Like many people the Guardian spoke to, he followed the “right to choose” pathway, whereby patients can pick a private provider anywhere in the country for assessment, diagnosis and initial treatment. They then ask their GP to enter a shared-care agreement for prescriptions and monitoring. However, Ryan struggled to get the two services to link up.The problem lies in the fact that shared care is voluntary and not all GPs agree to it. Some patients told the Guardian their doctor had rejected their private diagnosis on the grounds that it did not meet their standards. This was even after theNHShad paid for it – and despite there being no official rules for private providers to follow. Some, like Ryan, end up stuck in administrative limbo.View image in fullscreenRyan White with Leigh, who said her brother was ‘super bright, witty, personable, generous and kind’Ryan experienced tragedies that affected his mental health. His father and a sister died when he was young and, in 2019, he found his mother dead, a loss from which Leigh said “he never recovered”.He was treated for bipolar disorder but it became apparent to Ryan that he had been misdiagnosed. Seeking clarity, he was referred by his GP for an ADHD assessment with Psychiatry UK, a private provider, in September 2022. It took five months for him to be assessed and diagnosed, but because of his bipolar history a community mental health review was needed before medication could begin. “Nobody chased anything, or took responsibility,” Leigh said.In June 2023, Ryan’s housing situation became unstable, triggering acute distress and rapid decline. He was deregistered by his GP practice after he expressed frustration at the delay in getting him help. He sent messages to Psychiatry UK explaining he did not know where to turn, one of which went unanswered.By early 2024, Ryan was still without a GP, and was exhausted, isolated and increasingly unwell. On 18 June 2024, a Psychiatry UK staff member messaged Ryan to say his medication would be changed to allow treatment to begin sooner. Further messages followed, even though Ryan had died on 12 May. Psychiatry UK did not learn of his death until months later.“Ryan tried so hard to get help. He was brilliant, but he was left to fall through every crack. He deserved so much better,” Leigh said. “He was fighting a system that demands stability from people who are already in crisis.”View image in fullscreenRyan White suffered a number of family tragedies, including the loss of both his parentsRyan is one of many people who have been failed by the right to choose system. Psychologists and psychiatrists who spoke to the Guardian shared their concerns that allowing NHS patients to obtain ADHD assessments at private providers was “premature” and had led to a “wild west”.Right to choose was introduced for mental healthcare and neurodevelopmental care in 2018, in part to ease pressure on waiting lists that were up to a decade long.But Marios Adamou, a consultant psychiatrist and founder of the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN), said this had come too soon, because “there was no standard in what good assessment looks like and there’s still no standard for what a qualified assessor would look like”.Right to choose was “poorly regulated, poorly managed and some people are making lots of money out of it”, Adamou said, adding: “If you don’t have regulation for that you are inviting a wild west.”Experts argue that the problems are partly the fault of assessment guidelines from the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice) being vague. Although some clinics now use quality assessment standards written by UKAAN, there is no national framework for the qualifications required to diagnose ADHD.Adamou urged the NHS to halt “uncontrolled” spending through right to choose and “divert the money through NHS pathways with specific quality standards”.Dr Jaime Craig, chief of the Association of Clinical Psychologists, said he regularly heard “concerns about the qualifications of the people completing the assessments and the rigour of neurodevelopmental assessment” under right to choose.Craig said clinicians should have “the necessary skills and competence to complete a comprehensive assessment which can take into account and assess for possible differential diagnoses and coexisting conditions”.One clinician revealed that a patient who had come for an autism assessment actually had a visual impairment. Another patient seeking an ADHD assessment had language processing difficulties. Both had risked being medicated for a condition they did not have and missing out on the interventions they needed, Craig said.“Greater clarity on the required training and regulation of those who can be considered ‘appropriately qualified healthcare professionals’ would help increase public confidence in the rigour of neurodevelopment assessments,” Craig said.Andrew Jay, director at North East ADHD, said there was pressure from the NHS to drive down prices, leading private providers “to offer a very basic level of care” and putting “pressure on clinicians to be brief and write reports which might not reflect the depth of assessment carried out”.Adamou noted that he had seen “aggressive promotion” from private providers, including sharing legal letter templates to GPs warning that the patient would sue unless they were allowed to pursue right to choose.He said ADHD had become “commoditised”, leading unhelpfully to “a new stigma that if you say you have ADHD you’re faking it”. This had been compounded by a failure to triage properly, which he feared was resulting in many people with ADHD being unable to secure a diagnosis – and much-needed treatment.A report by Psychiatry UK into Ryan’s case concluded that staff should be encouraged to ask medical secretaries to check that requests to GPs were followed up, and that consultant psychiatrists should contact a patient’s community mental health team for advice and referrals.Why are diagnoses of ADHD soaring? There are no easy answers – but empathy is the place to start | Gabor MatéRead moreDr Joanne Farrow, medical director at Psychiatry UK, apologised for any part it “played in Ryan not getting the help he needed from local services” and said she was saddened to hear of his death.She said Psychiatry UK had invested in better quality and safety infrastructure, had evaluated policies and processes and opened a contact centre to provide faster responses to patients. She added: “Our investigation highlighted the need for better communication with GPs and mental health providers to ensure our patients receive the best care possible.”Danielle Henry, director of policy at the Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN), said that private providers now deliver more than half of all NHS-funded ADHD assessments.“Patients and their families should be reassured that as with NHS providers, there is clear oversight of the sector, with our members being regulated by the Care Quality Commission, as well as adhering to clinical guidelines including from Nice, UKAAN and the ADHD Assessment Quality Assurance Standard for Children and Teenagers (CAAQAS),” she said.“Giving NHS patients the right to choose their provider for ADHD assessments and diagnoses has resulted in much needed new capacity and innovation being brought to the NHS, the contribution of which has been critical in helping the health service meet growing patient demand in this area,” she added, noting that problems around “shared care” should be addressed urgently.Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNHSHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a high level of US citizenship by naturalization among Somali American communities in Minnesota.TheTrump administrationhad first announced its intention to end protection for Somali nationals in November, with Trump writing on his Truth Social platform about Minnesota, which is home to a large Somali community: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), which advocates for fair treatment of Muslims in the US, on Tuesday criticized the latest rollback of rights as a “bigoted attack” that will send some Somalis back to a war-torn, unstable nation.“This decision does not reflect changed conditions inSomalia,” Cair said in a statement released jointly with its Minnesota chapter. “By dismantling protections for one of the most vulnerable Black and Muslim communities, this decision exposes an agenda rooted in exclusion, not public safety.”The administrationhas usedMinnesota’sissueswithfraudas a pretext tosenda surge of immigration officers into the state. Trump hascalledSomalis “garbage” and referenced unverified reports, amplified by Republican lawmakers, suggesting the militant group al-Shabaab in Somalia benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota, though these claims have not been substantiated.Trump administration escalates attack on Minnesota with more immigration agentsRead moreOn Monday, Minneapolis and St Paulfiled a lawsuitagainst the administration, alleging Minnesota was being targeted for its diversity and political differences with the federal government. “[Department of Homeland Security] agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. Last week, the American citizenRenee Goodwasfatally shotin the head by a federal immigration agent in south Minneapolis during an enforcement operation, sparking tens of thousands tomarchinprotestacross the US.The decision to withdraw TPS for Somalis in the US, first reported byFox News Digital, affects 705 Somali nationals currently holding TPS, according to official US Citizenship and Immigration Servicesdataas of August 2025. They have until 17 March beforetheir statusexpires. Anonymous immigration sources cited higher figures to Fox News of about 2,471 current beneficiaries and another 1,383 applications.TPS is granted by the Department of Homeland Security to foreign nationals who cannot safely return to their home countries due to armed conflict, natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances. The protection allows individuals to live and work legally in the US until conditions improve in their homeland.Somalis were first granted TPS by the administration of George HW Bush in 1991 during Somalia’s civil war. The status has beenrepeatedly renewedby successive administrations, most recently by Joe Biden in September 2024, who extended it through March 2026.Somalia remains plagued by persistent violence from al-Shabaab militants, severe drought conditions and widespread humanitarian crises that have displaced millions of people internally, according to UN reports. Human rights organizationshave warnedthat returning Somali nationals to the country could place them at severe risk.The Congressional Research Service last spring said the Somali TPS population was 705 out of nearly 1.3 million TPS immigrants in the US. Trump has ended protections across multiple countries in his second presidency as part of his crackdown on both legal and illegalimmigration in the US.Somaliais one of the world’s poorest countries and has for decades been beset by chronic strife exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. The al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabaab controls parts of the country and has carried out truck bombings and other assaults in the capital, Mogadishu, in recent years that killed dozens of people.Congress established the temporary protected status program in 1990 to help foreign nationals fleeing unstable, threatening conditions in their home countries and are living in the US. It allows the executive branch to designate a country, generally in 18-month increments, for the protected status.Approved recipients can legally work and are protected from deportation but there is no pathway to a green card or US citizenship and they are reliant on the government renewing the TPS designation every few years.It was not immediately clear how quickly those Somalis covered by TPS could be removed from the country once their protections expire. Most attempts by the administration to end a TPS designation have ended up in the courts.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationSomaliaKristi NoemUS foreign policyUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

South Africa and Nigeria, which has a fast-growing population, also failed to raise average incomes over the period, despite growing by 1.2% and 4.4% respectively last year.The bank said global growth had “downshifted” since the pandemic, and the pace was now “insufficient to reduce extreme poverty and create jobs where they’re needed most”.Economic growth in emerging market and developing economies was estimated to slow from 4.2% last year to 4% next year, its report said.Global economic growth was “proving more resilient than anticipated”, the bank said, especially after a better-than-expected performance by the US economy last year, but progress was likely to be modest in 2026 as economies in the developed and the developing world struggled to make progress.The US economy was estimated to have grown by 2.1% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026 after upgrades of 0.7 and 0.6 percentage points respectively from the bank’s last forecast in June. The bank’s study showed the euro area was a laggard, growing by just 0.9% in 2025 and on course to grow by 1.2% in 2026.Global growth is projected to remain broadly steady over the next two years, easing from 2.7% in 2025 to 2.6% in 2026 before returning to 2.7% in 2027, a modest upward revision from the June forecast.Many of the one in four developing countries where average incomes are lower than in 2019 have endured wars and famines, the report said, which have delayed their recovery from the pandemic. More recent increases in growth have been insufficient to override a previous slump, it said.Indermit Gill, the Bank’s chief economist, said: “These trends cannot be explained by misfortune alone. In far too many developing countries, they reflect avoidable policy mistakes.”Gill said developing world countries needed to stick to strict budget rules to provide a foundation for sustainable growth. He said the formula was similar for all countries that wanted to grow at a faster pace.“To avert stagnation and joblessness, governments in emerging and advanced economies must aggressively liberalise private investment and trade, rein in public consumption, and invest in new technologies and education,” he said.Gill said the global economy had proved to be resilient, but unable to jump-start growth to a level that would create jobs for young people, especially the 1.2 billion under-16s expected to enter the jobs market in the next decade.“With each passing year, the global economy has become less capable of generating growth and seemingly more resilient to policy uncertainty,” he said. “But economic dynamism and resilience cannot diverge for long without fracturing public finance and credit markets.“Over the coming years, the world economy is set to grow slower than it did in the troubled 1990s, while carrying record levels of public and private debt.”The World Bank expects China to grow at 4.4% this year and 4.2% next year. These figures mark an upgrade from an assessment in June last year, but still represent the lowest growth in 35 years and remain below the previous forecast of 4.9% for 2025, as well asthe Communist party’s prized 5% target.Beijing has come under pressure since Donald Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports last spring. It has also struggled to cope with a rapidly ageing population and the after-effects of aspeculative property boom and bust.The bank said China proved to be more robust than expected after a government spending splurge lifted domestic consumer spending and export sales were supported by the rerouting of goods to non-US markets.Explore more on these topicsWorld BankGlobal economyEconomicsAfricaCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

In the first half of 2025 alone, “the Monsters” line of toys, which includes Labubus, generated 4.8bn yuan (£511m) in sales for the Hong Kong-listed company. In August, Pop Mart’s chief executive, Wang Ning,said the companywas on track to reach 20bn yuan in revenues in 2025.According to an investigation byChinaLabor Watch (CLW), a New York-based NGO, one of Pop Mart’s suppliers for Labubus has engaged in exploitative workplace practices. They include workers being forced to sign blank contracts, 16- and 17-year-olds being employed without the special protections for young workers required by Chinese law, inadequate health and safety training and other labour rights violations at the factory in south-east China’s Jiangxi province.CLW sent investigators to Shunjia Toys in Xinfeng county in Jiangxi, a factory that employs more than 4,500 people, over three months in 2025. The researchers interviewed more than 50 employees, including three under the age of 18. All of the workers were working exclusively on Labubus.The researchers found that the factory employed workers aged 16 to 18, which is legal under Chinese law, but only with special protections such as prohibitions on dangerous or strenuous work. The 16- to 18-year-old workers at Shunjia had been assigned to standard assembly line positions with no difference in workload or production targets to adult workers.“The underage workers also generally did not understand the nature of the contracts they signed, and had no clear concept of their legal status when asked,” CLW’s report said.The investigation also found that workers routinely signed blank labour contracts. CLW said workers were told to fill in their personal details on employment contracts, while details of the working conditions, such as the contract’s term, the job content, the salary and social insurance details were left “blank and unexplained”.“Workers were given no more than five minutes to complete the process and were told explicitly not to read or fill in other sections,” CLW said.Reflecting the soaring demand of the toys, workers said they were given unrealistic production targets, with a team of 25-30 workers being required to assemble at least 4,000 Labubus a day. Chinese labour law limits monthly overtime to 36 hours, but CLW found that workers often worked more than 100 additional hours each month.Shunjia Toys has an official production capacity of 12m toys per year, with plans announced in late 2025 to expand to 33m.That represents a small share of the overall production of Labubus, which Pop Mart said last year was about 30m units per month. The company works with a range of local manufacturing partners in China and south-east Asia, with recent additions in Mexico as demand soars.However, CLW’s interviews suggested that Shunjia was already producing far more than 12m units annually, with two teams alone estimated to produce more than 24m units per year. “This gap between planned capacity and actual output is not uncommon in China’s manufacturing sector,” said Li Qiang, the executive director of CLW. “When market demand rises rapidly, production often expands well beyond planned levels, with the resulting pressure borne directly by workers.”A spokesperson for Pop Mart said: “At Pop Mart, we take the welfare and safety of workers at our [original equipment manufacturers] factories very seriously. We conduct regular, standardised audits of our OEM supply chain partners, including annual independent third-party audits carried out by internationally recognised professional audit firms.“We appreciate the information brought to our attention and are currently investigating the matter. Going forward, Pop Mart will continue to strengthen supply chain audit and oversight mechanisms. Should the findings be substantiated, we will firmly require the relevant partners to implement comprehensive corrective actions in accordance with local laws and regulations.”Shunjia Toys could not be reached for comment.The conditions described in the Shunjia Toys factory are not uncommon in China’s manufacturing sector, where workers work long hours for low pay, with scant enforcement of the labour protections that are officially enshrined in Chinese law.The soaring demand for Labubus has also generated a largeblack market for fakes, known as Lafufus, which are often done by informal workers in home factories with zero oversight about working conditions.The findings reflect the challenges faced by Chinese companies which are aggressively pushing into international markets but are increasingly expected to abide by higher standards for their workers.Li said: “At present, existing supply-chain oversight mechanisms do not appear sufficient to identify and prevent these labour issues in a timely and effective manner. If Pop Mart is serious about reducing labor risks in the Labubu supply chain, it should establish accessible grievance and communication mechanisms for workers (such as an independent and effective worker hotline), improve transparency around actual factory working conditions, and disclose its supply chain structure, including outsourced production, to enable meaningful oversight.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificChild labourWorkers' rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

They occurred in November and December, and were at least partly in response to recent European trips by Taiwanese officials including its current vice-president and foreign minister, and a former president.China threatened to cancel key trade talks after UK minister’s Taiwan visit in JuneRead moreBeijing said it “respects the sovereignty of the European side in introducing and implementing visa policy”, but an “institutional loophole” had allowed frequent visits by Taiwan politicians, according to one note verbale seen by the Guardian.The Chinese cited multiple EU laws and regulations, including one known as the Schengen Borders Code, whichsaysa condition for entry by non-EU nationals is that they “are not considered to be a threat to the … international relations of any of the member states”.The officials’ suggestion, the Guardian understands, was that allowing Taiwanese officials to enter a European country would threaten that country’s international relations with China.In some cases they also referred to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, or suggested the European countries follow the UN’s example and bar all Taiwanese people from government buildings, the Guardian was told.“Beijing’s application and interpretation of this regulation is bold,” said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, when told about the moves. “It is Beijing’s interpretation that EU-Taiwan ties threaten EU-China ties. This is not at all the perception or reality in Europe.”China’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions. But the note verbale said European countries should reject any “so-called diplomatic passports” issued by Taiwan, and “prohibit Taiwanese personnel from entering Europe to seek official contact and exchanges and trample on China’s red line”.“China hopes the EU institutions and European countries will, out of the larger interests of China-EU relations and bilateral relations, make the political decision of refusing the entry of Taiwan’s so-called president or vice president (former ones included),” it said, also listing other officials.The note cited visits by the officials to Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Denmark, Estonia and Ireland, saying they “seriously undermine China-EU relations”.“The European side … even indulged [vice-president] Hsiao Bi-khim to speak at the building of the European parliament and promote ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist claims,” it said, referring toa speechgiven by Hsiao to the annual summit of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) in Brussels.The foreign ministries of Norway and Finland confirmed they were among the nations to receive the advice. They said visa regulations with Taiwan were determined by relevant Schengen bodies.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: “Permission to enter the UK is determined solely by our own laws and immigration rules, which apply equally to those travelling from Taiwan.”Taiwan’s foreign ministry said officials’ visits to Europe were “entirely unrelated to China, and China has no right to interfere”.“On the contrary, China’s use of various coercive measures against other countries and its threats of force against Taiwan, which undermine global and Indo-Pacific peace and stability and threaten the direct interests of the EU, is the real force damaging European international relations,” the spokesperson told the Guardian.“China’s actions should be condemned.”What does the US raid in Venezuela mean for China’s designs on Taiwan?Read moreThe Guardian understands that China’s “highly specific” advice – on European border codes that have been in place since 2011 – was not seen as legally sound by recipients, but the warning tone was taken particularly seriously by some smaller nations.“I see this as another way to generate unease among member states that their relations with the [People’s Republic of China]might be at risk… and Beijing knows well that some EU member states are very keen to attract Chinese investment at present,” said Ferenczy.The EU does not take a position on Taiwan’s status, and while it has formal relations with Beijing it also maintains“solid” unofficial relationswith Taipei through parliamentary diplomacy and trade. Several European countries and the EU have trade offices that act as unofficial embassies in Taipei.However in recent years the bloc has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as a province of China, and intends to annex it – by force if necessary. Among its strategies tocoerce Taiwan into accepting unificationwithout conflict, Beijing putsintense diplomatic pressureon the international communityto isolate Taipeifrom multilateral engagement.Claus Soong, an analyst at Merics specialising in China’s global strategy, said the unusual move fitted with Beijing’s long-running strategy of using all possible means to deter closer cooperation with Taiwan.“Beijing is trying as much as they can to say that you should really think a little bit before letting Taiwanese officials in. I wouldn’t say it’s a threat, it’s more a reminder, although not necessarily gentle.”Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The faster clean-energy growth made up 44% of the reduction in India’s coal and gas, compared with the previous five years, marking the first time that clean-energy growth has played a significant role in driving down India’s coal-fired power generation.However, about 36% of India’s fossil fuel reduction was driven by milder weather, while 20% was due to slower underlying demand growth, meaning a rise in severe summer temperatures couldincrease demand for air-conditioningand reverse the fall in energy demand.In recent years an expected peak in global coal power was undermined by Russia’s war on Ukraine, which caused global gas prices to spike and pushed many developing countries to burn cheaper coal instead.The International Energy Agency said just over a year ago that the rebound, after a slump during the global Covid pandemic, could mean thatcoal power remained at near-record levelsuntil 2027.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryFossil fuelsCoalEnergyChinaIndiaGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The mining industry accounted for two-thirds of the area cleared.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe Pilbara region of Western Australia had five animals worst affected by habitat destruction: the northern quoll, night parrot, ghost bat, Pilbara leaf-nosed bat and Pilbara olive python.“The mining projects approved there are just so massive and so devastating for the threatened species that live there,” Bandt said.Citing theelusive night parrot, a bird thought to have been extinct for a century until 2013, Bandt said: “Two things happened to the night parrot in 2025.“One is it was moved officially a step closer to extinction and is now classified as critically endangered. The second is the government gave the green light to bulldoze over six Sydney Airports’ worth of its habitat.”Federally approved land clearing was only the “tip of the iceberg”, Bandt added, as most clearing for agricultural purposes was not previously assessed under national environment laws.Reforms to nature legislation, which passed in November, mean that some agricultural clearing, and clearing within 50 metres of waterways in Great Barrier Reef catchments, must now be assessed.Bandt, in his first month in the role as the ACF’s CEO, added he was hopeful the new laws “could give nature a fighting chance”, but noted “the devil will be in the detail”.Under the legislation, the government will establish an environmental protection agency.Snails on a plane: Australia flies rescue mission to Norfolk Island for a tiny, critically endangered speciesRead more“A lot will hinge now on how it is established and how it is resourced, and what rules it’s given to enforce,” Bandt said. “It can and should be a very strong watchdog for nature.”A federal government spokesperson said the Albanese government “remains committed to protecting Australia’s unique and diverse plants and animals – that’s why we fought so hard to introduce a national Environment Protection Agency and reform the EPBC Act at the end of last year”.“Under the reforms, projects will need to demonstrate a net gain for nature to receive approval, providing stronger protections for threatened species and their habitats.“The changes, some of which are now in force, and others which will start in coming months, will deliver stronger environmental protection and restoration, more efficient and robust project approvals, and greater accountability and transparency in environmental decision making.”Explore more on these topicsLogging and land-clearingExtinct wildlifeTrees and forestsBiodiversityEndangered speciesWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Introduced by the Howard government in 1999, it has been blamed, along with negative gearing rules, for promoting housing as an investment mechanism for wealthier Australians over the rights of would-be owner occupiers.Federal Labor went to the 2016 and 2019 elections promising to pare back the discount, but lost both times to the Coalition.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe federal Treasury modelled changes to negative gearing rules in 2024, finding curbing CGT deductions for investors would have more impact on lowering house prices,though neither policy would help boost housing supply.NSW officials told parliament that lending to housing investors has increased significantly compared with lending to first home buyers since the discount was introduced. In the mid-1990s, lending to investors was broadly comparable to first home buyers, at about $13bn and $10bn respectively.But in the year to September 2025, lending to Australian investors had increased to $139bn, while lending to first home buyers only reached $64bn.View image in fullscreenLending to Australian investors has increased to $139bn in the year to September 2025.Photograph: Jesse Thompson/Getty ImagesThe submission said the ability to access the CGT discount through investment vehicles including trusts further exacerbates inequality in the tax system.“The scale of the concession, its concentration among wealthier investors, and its role in distorting investment behaviour, particularly in the housing market, all highlight the importance of reconsidering the current settings.”McKim welcomed the submission, describing it as adding to pressure on the Albanese government to wind back the CGT discount.“The evidence is abundantly clear: the CGT discount pushes up house prices, rewards speculation, and funnels billions of dollars to wealthy investors while everyday Australians get left behind,” he said.“The Greens set up this Senate inquiry because the facts are piling up and the case is now overwhelming to wind back the most unfair tax break in the country.”Melbourne is in the middle of a housing revolution – have the yimbys already won?Read moreThe federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has so far ruled out changes to CGT or negative gearing rules.The Property Council of Australia has told the inquiry changes to the CGT discount must not be seen “as a panacea for housing affordability” and called for a national review of property-related taxes and regulatory settings instead.Its submission cites industry research suggesting changes would reduce new housing construction and drive rents higher.“Any policy that depresses new housing construction will exacerbate rental shortages and push rents higher, with knock-on effects for employment and the broader economy,” it said.The CGT inquiry is due to hold public hearings and present its final report by 17 March.Explore more on these topicsHousingAustralian GreensTaxAustralian politicsAustralian economynewsShareReuse this content"

He added that theonline safety regulatorwould look into it.Grok’s deepfake images which ‘digitally undress’ women investigated by Australia’s online safety watchdogRead moreAlbanese’sXaccount then posted a video from the same press conference on X. People in the replies attempted to prompt Grok to make an image of the prime minister in a bikini.Grokwas disabled for image generation for non-paying userson X last week after research revealed bythe Guardian foundit had been used to create pornographic videos of women without their consent, as well as images of women being shot and killed.Searching on X, it is easy to quickly find photos of Australian politicians, including the prime minister, created using Grok – for example multiple politicians stripping down to reveal a bikini, or dressed up in a burkini.Regulatorsacross the world, including in Australia, are now investigating Grok, withfines and the potential blocking of Grok or Xbeing touted as possible outcomes. Some countries have reportedly blocked access to the chatbot in the meantime.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn Australia, the eSafety commissioner has senta “please explain” letter, that could ultimately lead to fines being sought from the federal court, butgiven X’s long history in challenging regulatory action from eSafety, that could take years.Nearly three years since Elon Musk took over X, it is unclear what – if anything – the platform can do to make people who keep posting on there decide to finally leave.Those who saw it become an increasingly toxic platform, most recently last year withthe MechaHitler incident, or the massive amount of misinformation on the platform after theBondi terror attack, have already fled to other platforms like Bluesky or Threads.Those who remain on X may be sympathetic to Musk’s views and how he has shifted what people see on the platform, or are addicted to the engagement they get and are worried it would be difficult to replicate elsewhere.Despite the outrage and protestation from the prime minister, politicians aren’t voting with their feet and moving elsewhere.View image in fullscreenAustralian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is among the politicians to condemn X’s AI chatbot Grok generating sexualised images of women and children.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPGuardian Australia contacted a number of Australian politicians – including those who had posted about the Grok issue – to ask whether they would continue to post on the site.Many said they need to go where people are.Another response was that journalists also still post there – somewhat of a chicken or the egg conundrum.Less clear is why government agencies, emergency services and others still post on X. The shift in the algorithm under Musk to reward the most divisive content in the feed should surely highlight that it is less useful in a breaking news situation where information needs to travel fast.There is one stand out. The account of the office of the eSafety commissioner, and the commissioner herself, Julie Inman Grant, quietly ceased posting on X in August last year.eSafety has been embroiled in legal battles with X over the past few years and has been a target of Musk’s and his supporters on the platform, so her absence is not that surprising. But if Australia’s online safety regulator finds X to be an unsafe place, what does that say for the rest of us?The indifference to X is not limited to politicians. Apple and Google have so far remained silent on why X remains in their app stores while hosting such content. Those of us with a long memory will recall whenApple hastily forced Tumblr to remove all consenting adult contentfrom its platform or face being kicked off the app store.Perhaps the antisemitism royal commission should examine the role of social media,after a report found high levels of antisemitic postson X.Elon Musk’s pervert chatbot – podcastRead moreAt the time of the Center for Countering Digital Hate report, X posted that it was “dedicated to fighting abuse driven by hate, bias, or intolerance – especially when it aims to silence voices”.If eSafety’s investigation leads to some sort of penalty being sought, the regulator could take a stronger response and use its power to order app stores to remove the app for hosting illegal content.Until then it seems there’s not much more than terse words for Grok in Australia.Explore more on these topicsAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsGrok AIAI (artificial intelligence)XInternetanalysisShareReuse this content"

He ended up having to charge his customer £16,000 to have drivers sit with the refrigerated truck in Calais for the month.He said trucks were being detained at Calais before Christmas because inspectors would not accept new UK paperwork for BSE clearance.In the end they rerouted one lorry in Chippenham for a meeting with a vet who handed over a bundle of new BSE certificates to take to Calais for the trucks being detained in the port.The first-hand accounts confirm the pre-Brexit warnings of exporters, hauliers and small businesses who could not afford the paperwork.EU wants ‘Farage clause’ in Brexit ‘reset’ talks with UKRead moreOvens’ remarks come as Brussels negotiators prepare for their first meeting over a new veterinary agreement with the EU in London next week, aimed at wiping out Brexit red tape.Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, opened the evidence session by telling witnesses that red tape was costing the UK an extra £8.4bn.“Goods trade is down 18% on five years ago, food and drink down 24%,” he said.Talks on removing the red tape on goods and drink exports begin in London next week, with a second meeting scheduled for Brussels the following week as both sides try and hammer out a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement.Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union, highlighted technical challenges in getting a deal where approaches to farming have already diversified.He said: “Oat farmers are currently allowed to use four mycotoxins that are allowed in the UK but not yet in the EU. Does this require a transition agreement?”Sean McGuire, director forEuropeat the Confederation of British Industry, said the EU has been “very very lukewarm” on other issues such as mutual recognition of professional qualifications such as architecture.Explore more on these topicsBrexitFood & drink industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Further announcements will be made if and when appropriate.”Reuters first reported news of the talks, citing a source claiming that any deal was expected to include All3Media injecting funds into the merged entity because it was the smaller of the two companies.If a deal is struck, the scale of the merger is likely to mean that it will be subject to scrutiny by the UK competition watchdog, as well as by the equivalent regulator inEurope, where Banijay holds a large share in markets such as France and Italy.Banijay was founded in 2008 and merged seven years later with Zodiak, the owner of UK producers including the Faking It maker RDF.It struck a $2.2bn (£1.6bn) deal in 2019 to buy Endemol Shine Group, the maker of shows including MasterChef,Big Brotherand Black Mirror, to create the largest TV producer outside the US. The group’s stable includes more than 130 TV production and creative businesses across more than 25 territories.All3Media has 50 different labels and has produced some of the most popular shows of recent years. They include Fleabag, Shameless and Squid Game: the Challenge.There were reports last year that ITV and RedBird IMI had held talks to merge ITV Studios with All3Media.The move prompted Banijay to also explore a takeover offer of ITV Studios, the maker of shows including Love Island, I’m a Celebrity and the hit drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, although no formal offer was made.View image in fullscreenCelebrity Big Brother is produced by Initial, part of Banijay UK.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/REX/Shutterstock for Big BrotherIn November, Comcast, the parent company ofSky, entered talksto buy ITV’s broadcasting businessfor about £1.6bn.Banijay made headlines last summer when its investigation into the BBC One show MasterChefupheld 45 allegationsagainst the host Gregg Wallace, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact, and oneagainst the co-presenter John Torode of using racist language.

If we have to choose between the US andDenmarkhere and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU,” Nielsen said, adding that the island’s “goal and desire is peaceful dialogue, with a focus on cooperation”.Trump’s pursuit of the island was also a matter of “international law and our right to our own country”, he said.Trump first raised the idea of a US takeover of Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, in 2019, during his first term, and again in the weeks before he took office for his second term last January. But he has ramped up his rhetoric significantly this month, saying the USwould take it “one way or the other”.Trump’s most recent threats have prompted a geopolitical crisis, raised significant doubt over the survival of Nato and, for many of the 57,000 Greenlandic people who have found themselves at the centre of it, sleepless nights and anxiety over their safety, identity and futures.In Greenland’s snow-covered capital, Nuuk, the fear is palpable among residents who are faced with having to get on with their day-to-day lives while trying to grapple with potentially existential questions, amplified by a constant stream of news and updates on their phones. Meanwhile, the world’s media has descended on the small city that is geographically closer to New York than it is to Copenhagen, which continues to control Greenland’s foreign and security policy. One shop displayed T-shirts that said: “GREENLAND IS NOT FOR SALE!”The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, are due to hold a crunch meeting in Washington on Wednesday with the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio.Naaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, said on a visit to London on Tuesday that the Greenlandic government did not know what was on the agenda for the White House meeting. Urging the US to act as allies, she said: “For others it might be a piece of land but for us it is home.”The meeting comes as Trump has shocked the EU andNatoby refusing to rule out military force to seize the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which is covered by many of the protections offered by the two organisations because Denmark belongs to both.Frederiksen said it had not been easy for Denmark to “stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally”. She said something fundamental was at stake, and there was “much evidence the most challenging part lies ahead”.The fact was that “borders cannot be changed by force, and that small countries should not fear large countries”, she said. “That is why we are saying no. We are not looking for any conflict. But our message is clear. Greenland is not for sale.”Frederiksen has previously said a US invasion wouldlead to the end of Nato, and multipleEuropean leaders have pledgedtheir support for Greenland’s territorial integrity and right to self-determination. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, on Tuesday said that any US move to take control of Greenland “would be a real unprecedented situation in the history of Nato, and in the history of any defence alliance in the world”.Greenland is Europe’s credibility litmus test – it must show Trump that aggression carries a price | Fabian ZuleegRead moreAfter a meeting of the Danish parliament’s foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, the Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said he and Motzfeldt would meet the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, in Brussels next Monday.Poulsen said Denmark planned a larger military presence alongside other Nato countries in Greenland this year, adding that Copenhagen sought “greater attention from Nato in relation to issues regarding Nato’s presence in and around the Arctic”.Trump argues the US needs to control Greenland to increase Arctic security in the face of an alleged threat from China and Russia. Rutte said on Tuesday all Nato members agreed that “when it comes to the protection of the Arctic, we have to work together”.The Nato chief declined repeatedly to comment on US demands, saying it was “not up to me to comment on discussions between allies”. He said the alliance was “working on the next steps” and was in “complete agreement on the urgency of the situation”.But Thomas Dans, Trump’s Arctic commissioner, said there could be meaningful US action taken in relation to Greenland in as little as “weeks or months”, telling USA Today that the president wants developments to move “at high speed”.Alliance members including France and Germany have floated suggestions including bolstering Nato’s presence in the region or stationing troops on Greenland itself. Diplomats say talks are at a very early stage and there are no concrete plans.In Nuuk, Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the opposition and the most US-friendly of Greenland’s political parties,told the Guardian the preferable outcome of the Washington talks was to reach a deal with the US. “They want to do a deal the easy way or the hard way: who wants the hard way?” he asked.He also questioned Løkke Rasmussen’s attendance, saying the talks had “nothing to do with Danish foreign politics, and everything to do with the Greenlandic people’s future”.Greenland has been moving toward independence since 1979, when it won self-rule from Denmark. The goal is shared by all political parties elected to the island’s parliament, although there are differences over the best timescale.Broberg accused Copenhagen of using “Nato, and the Danish ownership of Greenland” to have a say in Greenland’s future. “It shows that they are still not ready to actually let us go,” he said.Greenland’s government said on Mondayit could not “under any circumstances accept” a US takeover and would intensify its efforts to “ensure that the defence of Greenland is carried out within the framework of Nato”.It said it believed Greenland would remain a member of the western defence alliance “for ever” and that “all Nato member states, including the US, have a common interest” in the defence of the vast Arctic island.Additional reporting by Kiran StaceyExplore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkDonald TrumpNatoJD VanceMarco RubioEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Their statements are supported by extensive documentary evidence, such as photographs, call logs, WhatsApp messages, visas, medical reports and other documents.”One of the women, referred to as Rebecca to protect her identity, said that Iglesias, who was 77 at the time, would often call her to his room at the end of the working day.She said he would then penetrate her anally and vaginally with his fingers without her consent. “He used me almost every night,” she told elDiario.es and Univision Noticias. “I felt like an object, like a slave.”According to Rebecca, the assaults habitually took place in the presence – and with the participation – of another Iglesias employee who was her superior.Another woman, known by the pseudonym of Laura, told the two media outlets that Iglesias kissed her on the mouth and touched her breasts without her permission and against her will.“We were at the beach and he came up to me and touched my nipples,” she said, adding that a similar incident took place by the pool at the singer’s villa in Punta Cana, a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic.Both women said workers were subjected to a tense and controlling atmosphere and spoke of how Iglesias “normalised abuse”. Rebecca said: “That house should be called the little house of terror because it is a nightmare – something truly horrible.”Accounts from former employees about the recruitment system reveal a process that began with social media advertisements aimed at young women. Applicants were asked to provide pictures of their faces and full bodies.Rebecca and Laura said Iglesias asked them intimate questions shortly after they arrived, such as, “Do you like women?”, “Do you like threesomes?”, and “Have you had breast surgery?”. They say that he asked to see their breasts on several occasions and also touched them.ElDiario.es reported later on Tuesday that the two women had filed a formal complaint with prosecutors at Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, accusing Iglesias of human trafficking and sexual assault.Journalists from elDiario.es and Univision made repeated efforts to contact Iglesias and his lawyer through various channels but received no response to the questions sent by email, phone and letter.However, the woman whom Rebecca identified as her first supervisor at the mansion in Punta Cana – and with whom she claimed to have had her first sexual encounter with Iglesias – dismissed the allegations as nonsense. She said she had only “gratitude, admiration and respect for the great artist and human being that he is”, and described him as “humble, generous, a great gentleman, and very respectful to all women”.Spain’s labour minister, Yolanda Díaz, who is also a deputy prime minister, called the women’s testimony “chilling”, saying they had described “sexual assaults and a situation of slavery”.But Iglesias, who has sold more than 300m records during his six-decade career, was defended by Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the outspoken rightwing president of the Madrid region. She said her administration would not heed calls from the leftwing Más Madrid party for Iglesias to be stripped of the honours bestowed on him by the regional and city authorities.“Women are being attacked and raped in Iran with the complicit silence of the far left,” she wrote in amessage on X. “The region of Madrid will never contribute to the discrediting of artists and still less so when it comes to the most universal of all singers: Julio Iglesias.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has been told that Starmer is expected to accept but has not yet received a formal invitation, while conversations about the exact makeup of the board are continuing.Starmer has cultivated a good relationship with the US president, despite their differences of opinion on the UK’s decision to recognise the state ofPalestinelast year.The board is expected to temporarily oversee the running ofGazaand manage its reconstruction. It will be made up of world leaders, with US media reports suggesting Trump could announce its membership as early as this week.Tony Blair was initially expected to be on the board, which will be chaired by Trump himself, with the former Labour prime minister saying the US plans were “the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering”.But Blair, who is viewed with scepticism and hostility over his role in the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003,was quietly dropped from considerationafter some Middle Eastern nations objected to his involvement. Instead, he is expected to join a separate executive board alongside Trump’s advisers, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the peace board was in the process of being formed, and there was strong international interest in being involved.“Essentially, it’s the most important leaders of the most important nations. You take the most important leaders and nations, that’s who the board of peace is going to be,” he said.In the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was asked if Starmer had joined Trump’s peace board. “We supported the 20-point plan to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza,” she said.“That is still fragile and there’s still a huge amount of work to do, including humanitarian surge and support, and including the decommissioning of weapons from Hamas.“There’s a huge amount of work still to do but it’s really important that the whole international community comes together in order to support that.”Starmer hasdefended his frequent trips out of the country, and on Monday night attempted to draw a direct link with the cost of living at home, which he told Labour MPs would not be solved by isolationism.The prime minister told them that it was essential for him to be “in the room” for international negotiations on trade and defence, which would then have an impact on the domestic economy.Explore more on these topicsGazaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

The first victim was a 35-year-old man in Bandijhari village on 1 January. Since then, those trampled to death or suffering fatal injuries have included a couple and their two young children and a forest department official.The region has been put on high alert and residents living in the Chaibasa district, where the elephant was last spotted, have been warned to stay away from the forest areas and not go out at night.Aditya Narayan, divisional forest officer of Chaibasa district, said they believed a young male elephant had been separated from his herd and become “extremely violent”. Narayan said three attempts had been made to tranquillise the elephant but all had failed so far.“Our team is on high alert, and efforts to tranquillise it will be resumed. Villagers have been strictly advised not to go into the forests and to remain vigilant,” he told local media.The elephant whisperer: one Thai woman’s lifelong quest to protect a rescued herdRead moreThe elephant has been covering almost 30km a day and more than 100 forest department personnel have been assigned to the search operation to track him down but without success.Wildlife specialists from three other states have also been drafted in to try to locate the elephant, but officials said the animal’s volatility and erratic trajectory through the forests made it hard to monitor his movements.The rampage comes as deadly human-elephant conflict is on the rise in India, attributed to rising deforestation, food and water scarcity and increased residential encroachment in areas that were once elephant corridors.Roughly 10% of the areas that used to be elephant corridors – safe routes for their migration – no longer exist. Elephants are also dying in high numbers from incidents such as electrocution, train hits and retaliatory poisonings.Over the past five years, more than 2,800 people in India have died from deadly encounters with elephants.In states such as Andhra Pradesh, AI early warning systems have been introduced in some villages to detect elephant intrusions and protect villagers.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

However, India refused to back down, maintaining that its purchase of Russian oil was a sovereign issue and that India’s energy policies would not be dictated by third countries. Trade negotiations between the two countries have since failed to reach any agreements.Trump’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil puts Modi in tight spotRead moreLast week, the Trump administration once again upped the ante onIndiawith threats to impose 500% tariffs and withdraw from several India-led global initiatives over ongoing Russian oil purchases.It came as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of the latest US sanctions intended to disrupt the flow of cheap Russian oil to India. From the end of November, US sanctions were brought in to target any companies or refineries that purchased oil from Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil exporters and the biggest sellers of oil to India.Figures showed it has had an initial impact, with India’s imports of Russian oil dropping from an average of 1.7m barrels of Russian oil a day, mostly bought from Rosneft and Lukoil, to roughly 1.2m barrels a day in December – a decrease of around a third.However, industry experts have cast doubts that these sanctions marked the end of India’s dependence on cheap Russian crude in the long term. Even after the sanctions, four out of India’s seven biggest oil refineries are still primarily running on Russian oil.Alarm over ‘exploding’ rise in use of sanctions-busting shadow fleetRead moreThere are already indicators that Russia has begun reorganising its supply chain to allow countries such as India to circumvent the US sanctions. In a notable loophole, as long as the crude oil is supplied by a company which is not Rosneft or Lukoil, then the refinery is not subject to US sanctions.Export data shows several new Russian oil exporters had emerged by December, likely intended to act as shadow middlemen between the Russian oil giants and refineries in countries such as India.“It looks like the new players are emerging, which is a sign that Russia is already trying to reorganise the supply chain,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, the head crude oil analyst at Kpler. “Obviously the Russians are not going to sit and just watch the sanctions take effect, they will try to bypass them as much as they can.”Falakshahi said these new companies were already beginning to dominate exports and it was likely just a matter of “two or three months until the full supply chain gets reorganised and most of the barrels then get supplied by companies which are not Rosneft or Lukoil”.So far, the Indian government has issued no direct mandate to state or private refineries on Russian oil, only encouraging them to act in the best interests of their operations. Duringa visit to Indiain December, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, vowed shipments of Russian oil to India would remain “uninterrupted”, in defiance of the US.The low price of Russian oil is hard for countries such as India, which imports 90% of its oil, to turn away from. After the US sanctions, the discounts on Russian crude have dropped even further, making them $9 or $10 per barrel cheaper than oil from countries such as Saudi Arabia or Iraq, presenting a significant bargain for India’s refineries.“For the companies that are still willing, buying Russian oil is a risk worth taking because it would represent savings of almost $4bn over a year,” said Falakshahi. “We expect that imports, at least by India’s public sector, will soon return to the levels seen previously.”He was echoed by June Goh, a senior oil market analyst for Sparta Commodities. “The discount is just too attractive for the Indian refiners not to buy the oil,” she said.Goh said this expectation had also been reflected in the response from the global oil market. “Initially, when things blew up, we saw oil prices rising quite significantly,” she said. “However, we have now seen prices falling off. The market just doesn’t believe that this sanctions enforcement will likely take place in a big way.”One exception has been Reliance, India’s biggest private oil company and previously the largest buyer of Russian oil. Since November, the conglomerate publicly declared it would no longer import Russian crude into its Jamnagar refinery and had an “impeccable record” of abiding by sanctions and January marked the first month of no Russian crude imports.It appears this is in response to the US sanctions but also EU sanctions preventing Russian-origin oil processed in a third country being allowed into the bloc. The EU is one of Reliance’s largest export markets for diesel and jet fuel and therefore violating the sanctions could present a heavy risk to their business.But as Reliance seeks an alternative to Russian crude, analysts said Trump’s recent actions in Venezuela and the US capture of Nicolás Maduro could present a well-timed opportunity for the conglomerate.According to reports, Reliance is among the companies in talks with the US for authorisation to resume purchases of Venezuelan oil, which India had previously exported before sanctions were brought in. In a statement, a Reliance spokesperson said they would “consider buying the oil in a compliant manner”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaIndiaUkraineOil and gas companiesDonald TrumpNarendra ModiOilnewsShareReuse this content"

No more paying lip service to the potential of the north, but backing it to the hilt.”Government officials said that plans for how local contributions would be funded were being developed but could include business rates, tourist taxes or borrowing against future revenues.Doubt remains over a key demand of Andy Burnham, theGreater Manchestermayor, for an underground station at Manchester Piccadilly. Burnham has argued it is essential to allow through trains and improve capacity and to build a new line without years of disruption and demolition in the city centre.The cost difference between an underground and overground Piccadilly is thought to run into several billion pounds.Burnham’s support for the plans had been in doubt, and he hinted at his frustration with the process earlier on Tuesday. Speaking at an Institute for Government event, the Labour mayor complained of having to “fight endlessly” in an “attritional battle” with Whitehall departments, accusing them of resisting devolution.However, he welcomed the news as “a significant step forward”, describing it as a “an ambitious vision for the north, firm commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail and an openness to an underground station in Manchester city centre”.He said Manchester would “work at pace” to prove the case for an underground station, as well as detailed designs for the line to Liverpool.Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, welcomed what he called “a genuinely strategic approach … not another empty slogan or back of a fag packet plan but real investment, delivered in a proper partnership with local leaders”.Manchester airport, the UK’s biggest outside London, will have a new station on the line. Ken O’Toole, the airport’s managing director, said it was a “long overdue step towards the creation of a highly productive and internationally competitive northern growth corridor”.Yorkshire may be the biggest immediate beneficiary from the announcements, with Bradford confirmed to get a new station as part of the first stage of upgrades across the Pennines.In a joint statement, the three Yorkshire mayors, Oliver Coppard, Tracy Brabin and David Skaith, said there was now “a clear national focus on connecting Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and York with a frequent, electrified service”.Development work will also be taken forward on reopening the Leamside Line, a 21-mile route in County Durham, which was closed in 1964.Henri Murison, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the package would “enable a single labour market more like that of London and the south-east … The potential of the north will be unlocked, giving us better-paid jobs and new homes.”However, it is understood that talks between Whitehall and some mayors went right to the wire, with Burnham said to have been reluctant to endorse the proposals as recently as Friday.Another mayoral source said months of negotiations between Whitehall and northern leaders had led to a point where most mayors were happy: “The starting point for this was all wrong. We were concerned that it had to be a significantly new network and what some of the officials – not the politicians – have been advised was just the cheapest. We’ve ended up with something that’s workable.”Explore more on these topicsInfrastructureRail industryTransport policyNorth of EnglandRail transportKeir StarmerTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

The hope is that this would crack down on illegal working while avoiding the controversy of an in effect compulsory ID system.It is understood that one of the motivations for the change was to allow people who wanted to use digital ID to do so, while avoiding the PR hurdle of a mandatory element. As one official put it: “We will no longer have the conspiracy nonsense about state control.”A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to mandatory digital right to work checks. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly.“Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.”The Conservatives called the move “yet another humiliating U-turn from the government”.Mike Wood, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “What was sold as a tough measure to tackle illegal working is now set to become yet another costly, ill-thought-out experiment abandoned at the first sign of pressure from Labour’s backbenches.”Lisa Smart, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: “No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate to cope with all their U-turns.“It was clear right from the start this was a proposal doomed to failure, that would have cost obscene amounts of taxpayers money to deliver absolutely nothing.“The government now needs to confirm that the billions of pounds earmarked for their mandatory digital ID scheme will be spent on the NHS and frontline policing instead.”A government source said the revised plans would not change the main principle of the original proposal, in which checks for eligibility to work were to be made tougher, in line with systems in other countries.Currently, they said, many were based on employers seeing paper copies of documents, whereas under the new system it was likely to involve a digital check of a passport or e-visa.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerIdentity cardsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

She will then decide if she still has faith in its chief constable, whose force denies it caved into antisemitism and reached its conclusions to appease extremists.Mahmood’s aides accept she has no power to sack Guildford, with Foster as PCC for the West Midlands the only person who can legally do so, making his intervention all the more crucial.In a statement, the PCC’s office said: “A civil servant phoned … saying they were sorry that MPs on the committee had been speaking to journalists about their views on the evidence they had heard, the private deliberations of the committee and the future of the chief constable, Craig Guildford, despite the MPs having not heard all of the evidence.”Foster said: “This is deeply regrettable and a matter of the utmost seriousness, that risks compromising and undermining public trust and confidence in the integrity of the [committee] and its forthcoming report.“It had been my intention to have due regard to the report, as part of my holding-to-account process, that will then in turn inform my decision making.“However, this is a matter that impacts not only the integrity of the [committee] process and preparation of the report, but also the MPs who are members of the [committee] and who have been responsible for this apparent irresponsible and reckless conduct.”Foster said the MPs should be named, ousted from influencing the report, and that he wants a public apology by the committee chair and “for the MPs concerned to voluntarily refer themselves to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and the committee on standards”.Sources say the PCC has an open mind about Guildford’s fate and wants to read the HMIC and home affairs committee findings before he decides the fate of the chief constable, whom he has praised for cutting crime and improving the force.A spokesperson for the home affairs committee declined to comment.The MP forBirminghamPerry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said that Guildford was being “thrown under the bus” and used as a “scapegoat” for the decision to ban away fans.The independent MP said it would be “disingenuous” of the home secretary to withdraw her confidence in Craig Guildford, as the Home Office was made aware of the decision to ban fans before it was announced.“To all of a sudden seek the removal of the chief constable when you know the highest echelons not only were within the knowledge, but actually supported the decision even by acquiescence, I think it’s disingenuous.”Khan said the sacking of the police chief would have a “chilling effect”, adding: “Politicians shouldn’t get involved in operational matters.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has now analysed differences in causes of mortality from March 2021 to November 2024. The ONS research uses the acronym LGB+ rather than LGBTQ+.It found that people who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or “other” sexual orientation had 1.3 times the risk of dying than those identifying as straight or heterosexual. The age-standardised rate of death from any cause was 982.8 for each 100,000 people for LGB+ people compared with 752.6 for each 100,000 people for straight or heterosexual people, the ONS said.While the leading cause of death for all people was coronary heart disease, the second most common cause of death for LGB+ people was taking their own lives, accounting for 7.1% of all deaths.Younger LGB+ people were nearly twice as likely to take their own lives than straight people, the analysis shows. Nearly half (45.3%) of deaths among LGB+ 16- to 24-year-olds and more than one quarter (29.6%) of deaths among LGB+ 25-34-year-olds were caused by people taking their own lives. This compares with 26.6% of straight 16- to 24-year-olds and 18.4% of straight or heterosexual 25- to 34-year-olds.The figures also showed that the risk of dying from drug poisoning was 2.8 times higher for LGB+ people than those identifying as straight, and 1.8 times higher from alcohol-related causes.Dr Emma Sharland, at the ONS, said: “This is the first time we have looked at differences in causes of death among adults by sexual orientation.“There are some noticeable differences, with nearly three times as many drug poisoning deaths and close to twice as many alcohol-related deaths among the LGB+ group compared with the straight or heterosexual group.“While this analysis does not explore causality, we hope this data will help inform health professionals and others working with different population groups.”Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: “It is deeply concerning that the data shows suicide is the second leading cause of death among LGB+ people. The causes of suicide are complex, but we know that LGBTQ+ people face discrimination in many areas of their lives and encounter harassment, from physical attacks to online hatred.“Many organisations play an invaluable role in providing specialised support for LGBTQ+ people because of the stigma in traditional services, and we need to ensure they have continued funding in the current challenging economic environment.“Today’s data reinforces the urgent need to address the risk factors that LGBTQ+ people face, as well as ensuring that mental health services are available and accessible for this group.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Prices were down, he claimed, despite official data showing otherwise, and productivity was “smashing expectations”.Even as he touted achievements during the first year of his second term, Trump has started to acknowledge concerns over affordability across the US, with November’s midterm elections creeping closer. The White House has moved to roll out a series ofpolicyproposalsin recent days that aspire to address affordability.“We’ll go down as the greatest first year in history that nobody’s ever had, just based on the numbers,” Trump said inMichigan, citing inflation and GDP data that showed price growth had stabilized, and the economy grew at a higher pace at the end of 2025.US inflation held firm in December amid pressure on Trump over cost of livingRead moreInflation hascome down slightlysince the fall, but remains significantly above typical levels. While GDP growthunexpectedly surged last summer, it came amid a turbulent year for the US economy. Annualized inflation went down to a four-year low in April at 2.3% before crawling up to 3% by September. GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, for the first time since 2022.The US labor market, which Trump didn’t touch on in his speech, had a particularly volatile year – itsweakest since the pandemic– as the unemployment rate edged up to a four-year high.Trumpfired the federal government official in charge of labor statisticsin August, hours after data revealed jobs growth had stalled.On Tuesday, however, he extolled official data which he argued was without comparison. The numbers had been “unbelievable”, he said.Wall Street continues to trade near record highs – but Trump claimed the “real stiff Fed” was holding back the stock market. “They kill every rally,” he said. “You have a good quarter, and they want to kill it because they’re so petrified of inflation.”Trump continues to wage an extraordinarycampaignto control the Federal Reserve, which he has so far unsuccessfully tried to pressure to lower interest rates. Most recently, Jerome Powell was placed under acriminal investigationover testimony he gave on renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.Inresponse, Powell called the investigation pretext, noting that it followed the central bank’s decision to set “rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.Trump has claimed he did not know about the investigation.The widespreadbacklashhis administration has received for going after Powell did not stop the president from lobbing fresh attackson the Fed chair during his speech on Tuesday. Referring to the end of Powell’s term in May, Trump said: “The jerk will be gone soon.”Trump’s rosy assessment of the economy is far from universally shared. Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to aHarris Poll for the Guardianlast month.Trump deflected responsibility for economics challenges on to his predecessor, Joe Biden. “We inherited terrible growth, and we inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country,” he said.While inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022, during Biden’s tenure, by the time the former president left office, inflation was hovering at about 3%.Trump’s wide slate of tariffs, which caused a major stock sell-off last spring, caused significant economic turbulence in 2025. Though the market swiftly recovered, many of Trump’s tariffs remain either paused or in legal limbo.But according to Trump, tariffs have been an economic success. “TheTrump tariffshave delivered us trillions of dollars of new investment, unprecedented new partnerships,” he claimed.Though the supreme court is scheduled to rule soon on thelegalityof his 10% baseline tariff and his slate of so-called reciprocal tariffs, Trump suggested he would not be giving up his tariff strategy anytime soon, regardless of a ruling. “We’ll figure something out if we don’t win, but we should win,” he said.Trump also claimed that the recent US action in Venezuela set the stage for increased energy production, and would ultimately bring down prices, especially for donuts.“When gasoline gets to be $1.99 a gallon, everything comes down,” he said. “The donuts come down, the truck that delivers the donuts, the stove that makes the donuts, the whole thing it all comes down. And it’s coming down much faster than anybody can even believe.”While refusing to concede that any of his policies have increased the cost of living, Trump listed a string of policies policies designed to tackle affordability concerns – including plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, purchase $200bn worth of mortgage bonds, and get credit card companies tocap interest rates. Of the White House’s efforts to bring drug prices down, he argued: “On that alone, we should win the midterms.”The president intends to speak more about upcoming housing policies at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos next week, he said.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationDetroitMichiganUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,” the statement said.It was signed by 10 central bank governors including the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the chair of theEuropean Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. It was coordinated by the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements, which added its chair and general manager to the signatories.Why is Trump’s justice department investigating Fed chair Jerome Powell?Read moreOther signatories to the unprecedented statement include the central bank governors of Australia, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Brazil, South Korea, Norway and Canada.They pay testament to Powell’s “integrity” and “unwavering commitment to the public interest”, calling him a “respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him”.The boss of JP Morgan, the largest US bank, also warned against attacks on Powell, amid fears it would undermine central bank independence and ultimately push up borrowing costs.Jamie Dimon told reporters on Tuesday that he had “enormous respect” for the Fed chair, adding that “everyone we know believes in Fed independence. And anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view, will have the reverse consequences. It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase [interest] rates over time”.Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell, whom he appointed in 2018, for failing to cut interest rates fast enough.But the clash between the two men took a dramatic turn earlier this week whenPowell issued a strongly worded video statement, saying he was being prosecuted by the US Department of Justice.1:59US Federal Reserve chair says DOJ has threatened criminal indictment – videoHe called the move “unprecedented action [that] should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure” over monetary policy.He said he had been singled out because the Fed’s policymaking board had set interest rates “based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.Trump has moved to distance himself from the investigation, however, claiming he was unaware of it. “I don’t know anything about it,” hetold NBC News.Jeanine Pirro, the pro-Trump attorney general for the District of Columbia, who launched the investigation, claimed in a post on X on Monday night that the “legal process” was “not a threat” to Powell.“The word ‘indictment’ has come out of Mr Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach,” she added.Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that Pirro had not sought the approval of her superiors at the DoJ before launching the action against the Fed – but had no intention of abandoning it.Powell and his colleagues have cut interest rates three times since last summer, but Trump has urged them to move faster, and personallyattacked Powell as a “numbskull”.The DoJ has said the case relates to “abuse of taxpayer dollars” – understood to be in relation to costly renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.Powell is due to step down as chair of the Fed board in May, and Trump is expected to announce his successor in the coming weeks.The prospect of legal action has sparked concern among some Republican lawmakers. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sits on the Senate banking committee that oversees Fed appointments, said he would not confirm any nominee “until this legal matter is fully resolved”.The former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen had alreadycondemned the threat to Powellon Monday, saying the move could have “highly negative consequences”.“This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” their statement said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJerome PowellUS economyBank of EnglandEuropean Central BankEconomicsChristine LagardenewsShareReuse this content"

The agency’s work “has been compromised for at a minimum, the short term, hopefully not the long term”, he claimed. “But it’s those aspects of American people’s lives that we almost take for granted that are going to be affected in a very negative way in the coming years.”About 19,700 employeesworked at the agency before Trump officials introduced waves of firings, voluntary retirement and resignation programs. Thousands subsequently left, although some workers were later rehired.“I am concerned that by letting go so many people, by offering early retirement, it’s like that kids’ game Jenga where you pile up all these wooden pieces,” said Sandra Eskin, CEO of Stop Foodborne Illness, a non-profit, and former deputy under secretary for food safety at the US Department of Agriculture. “And if you pull one out from the bottom or even the middle, the whole thing falls apart.The FDA “does not have a robust inspection program for the foods that it regulates”, she said. “And so if that’s your baseline, and then you’re cutting back inspectors, then that is very concerning.”Foreign food inspections by the FDA havedroppedto the lowest on record since the agency began inspecting foreign food facilities in 2011, aside from during the Covid-19 pandemic. Domestic inspections alsosteeply declined.Due to cuts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which works with the FDA and other agencies to conduct surveillance for food pathogens,reducedthe number of pathogens they surveil through itsFoodnetsurveillance program from eight to two.Frank Yiannas, former FDA deputy commissioner for food policy and response under the first Trump administration, and into the Biden administration, expressed concern about the reduction in surveillance, with food recalls alreadyon the rise. “Foodnet and the pathogens that they track is critical, because it’s the ultimate scorecard of whether we’re getting better or worse on performance in food safety,” he said.“Consumers in general, when they hear there are cuts to food-borne disease surveillance programs at the CDC, they should pay attention,” added Yiannas. “It’s not a good idea if any food-borne illness remains invisible. We need to know about these things so that we can gather why they happen in the first place, and inform future prevention.”As the FDA grapples with these cuts, former workers criticized the treatment of employees, the wastefulness of firings and rehirings, and dismissed claims by theTrump administrationthat the cuts have no impact on the agency’s ability to effectively execute its mission.Harbourt, the fired safety manager, said his position’s responsibilities were replaced with two full-time employees, who were pulled away from their initial employment positions. “Turning the federal government into a temp employee agency is going to have negative effects for all Americans across a number of different aspects of their lives – some of which we’re already seeing,” he said.Rightwing media pundits havecalledfederal employees “entitled bureaucrats”, “worthless parasites”, and “completely worthless” amid cuts to the federal workforce. Russell Vought, whom Trump tapped to lead the office of management and budget,statedshortly before the 2024 election that “we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected”.“The vast majority of federal employees really do try to do the best work for the American public,” added Harbourt. “Seeing that framed as something where we’re all worthless, and we’re just leeches on the American taxpayer is objectively false, and it’s been a really discouraging aspect of this whole process.”A former FDA employee, who requested to remain anonymous to speak without fear of retaliation, criticized the manner in which the administration is transforming the agency.“We are seeing more policy announcements through journal articles and podcasts rather than through carefully constructed guidance documents that allow for the public to provide comment,” they said. “The FDA has always steered clear from politics as much as it was able, but we’ve seen such a politicization of science with this administration.”A third former employee at the FDA, who also requested to remain anonymous, said: “For impact public health-wise, this is devastating. Agencies like FDA rely on scientific studies, but do you know what can’t happen without funding? Research. And federal agencies have a responsibility to report to the American people, so without communications professionals, research findings and reporting does not get shared and agency web pages sit stagnant.”The current leader of the FDA, Martin Makary, and Robert FKennedy Jr, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, have bothpushedand touted health related conspiracy theories. Makaryrecently promotedlab leak conspiracy theories about HIV and Lyme disease on a podcast.“Scientific integrity has been destroyed by Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Makary. Many longtime FDA leaders have been pushed out, or left, because there is no more credibility in US public health,” the former employee said.“I believe that this decimation of the federal workforce will set us back as a country for decades,” they said. “We are no longer a world leader in public health, and that’s a scary thing.”The Department of Health and Human Servicesdid not comment on Makary’s recent claims. “FDA inspectors were not impacted, and this critical work will continue uninterrupted,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson, said. “The FDA remains fully committed to protecting the public and ensuring the safety and efficacy of the products it regulates. Enforcement decisions are grounded in the latest gold-standard science. This will not change.”Another former FDA employee, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said it was “absurd” to claim that thousands of job cuts would have no impact. “It doesn’t even pass the laugh test,” they said. “What organization isn’t going to be impacted by the departure, not just of a lot of people, but entire offices?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFoodDonald TrumpFood safetyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision is expected as soon as Wednesday. It is a crucial legal test of his controversial economic strategy and his power.Trump said it would be difficult to reverse the tariffs as businesses and countries could claim refunds, saying “it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay”. He added: “It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay.”Trump says countries doing business with Iran face 25% tariff on US tradeRead moreIn November, thesupreme court appeared scepticalof the legal basis of theTrump administration’s sweeping global tariff regime when justices questioned the president’s authority to impose the levies. Justices heardoral argumentson the legality of Trump’s tariffs.The sweeping global tariffs that were first announced by Trump last April are being challenged by small businesses and 12 US states, which argue that the president overstepped his authority in imposing the new levies on goods imports coming into the country.Before the case ended up at the supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, two lower courts found that Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs.When he imposed the tariffs via a series of executive orders last year, Trump cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a 1977 law that in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.A coalition of 12 states – Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont – and small businesses havesuedthe Trump administration to block the tariffs.At the November hearing, the supreme court did not spend much time discussing potential refunds. However, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed to the court by Trump, noted that it could become a “complete mess” to undo the taxes already collected.Trump also said this week thatany country that does business with Iran will face a tariff rate of 25%on trade with the US, as Washington weighs its response to the situation in the country, which is embroiled in its biggest anti-government protests in years.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,” the US president said in a post on social media on Monday.Tariffsare paid by US importers of goods from those countries. Iran has been placed under heavy sanctions by Washington for years.“This order is final and conclusive,” Trump said. Top export destinations for Iranian goods include China, the United Arab Emirates and India.Separately on Tuesday, Volkswagen reported that its sales in the US fell last year because of Trump’s tariffs.In 2025, the vehicle manufacturer’s global sales fell by 1.4%, which it blamed on “challenging market conditions”.Sales fell by 8.2% in the US, and VW said tariffs “had a marked impact on deliveries in North America”. Demand also weakened in China, where VW’s sales fell 8.4%.Sales in Europe grew by 5.1%, and in South America by 18.5%.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsVolkswagen (VW)newsShareReuse this content"

A similar proposal in Utah would block lawsuits over climate-warming emissions, unless a court finds the defendant violated a statute or permit.“I think anyone in America who breathes the air around them and also believes in corporate accountability ought to be very concerned about these types of end-runs against accountability,” said Jay Inslee, the former governor of Washington state and a former trial attorney.The proposals appear designed to prevent parties in either state from joining the growing wave of US climate accountability litigation, which has seen more than 70 states, cities and local governments sue major oil companies for allegedly misleading the public about climate risks.The Guardian has contacted the bills’ sponsors for comment.The measures come as fossil fuel companies and their political allies push for broader protections from climate lawsuits nationwide. Last year, 16 Republican state attorneys generalurged the justice departmentto provide a “liability shield” for oil companies, while lobbying disclosures show that ConocoPhillips and the American Petroleum InstitutepressedCongress on draft legislation to limit climate liability. Lawmakers have also pursued narrower efforts, including a failed attempt to block Washington DC from enforcing consumer protection laws against oil companies, and a Maryland bill last year that would have barred state and local climate lawsuits but never reached a vote.Both Oklahoma and Utah are oil-producing states where the fossil fuel industry wields significant political influence. The Guardian has asked the American Petroleum Institute and the bills’ sponsors whether industry groups lobbied for the proposals.“These proposals are clearly part of a larger coordinated effort to strip communities and states of their right to hold Big Oil accountable,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, a non-profit supporting climate accountability litigation. “If you have not violated the law, there is no reason to seek immunity.”If enacted, the measures would likely face legal challenges, said Pat Parenteau, environmental law expert at Vermont Law School. “This kind of blanket waiver of liability could raise serious state constitutional issues,” he said.Neither Oklahoma nor Utah has seen statewide or city-level climate accountability lawsuits filed. But the bills still pose “a threat to democracy”, said Inslee.“The ultimate foundation of democracy is the American jury system,” he said. “These efforts are attempting to deny Americans the right to that key democratic institution.”If enacted, the measures would restrict future litigation – particularly Oklahoma’s, said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University. That bill seeks to block claims alleging fraud, misrepresentation, deception, failure to warn or deceptive marketing, all of which are central to existing climate lawsuits against oil companies. Utah’s proposal is narrower, targeting only emissions-based claims.Oil companies have repeatedly argued that climate cases aim to regulate emissions and are therefore preempted by federal law. But plaintiffs say their suits focus not on emissions, but rather on alleged deception about climate harms. Because Utah’s bill is limited to emissions-focused litigation, some cases could still be filed, Gerrard said, “though I’m sure the fossil fuel industry would find a way to push back”.The state bills arrive as advocates await a US supreme court decision on whether it will review a climate lawsuit brought by Boulder, Colorado, a ruling that could eitherembolden or constrainclimate accountability litigation nationwide.Big oil is not the only industry seeking limits on legal accountability. Pharmaceutical giants havepushedstate and federal lawmakers to block some pesticide-focused lawsuits, successfully lobbying for such measures in Georgia and North Dakota. More recently, lawmakers attempted – butfailed– to weaken pesticide regulations via a national bill. Tech companies have also raised concerns about lawsuits over harms linked to artificial intelligence, prompting federal and state proposals – including inColoradoandTexas– that would shield companies from certain civil claims.Attempts from the oil industry to skirt liability are “expressions of fear”, said Inslee.“They are right to be afraid,” he said. “When a jury finds out what these CEOs in their corner offices have been doing to Americans … they’re going to be boiling mad.”Advancements in attribution science, which links specific extreme weather events to the climate crisis, have made climate accountability litigation even stronger, said Parenteau.“It’s really only a matter of time before a jury hands down a multi billion dollar verdict,” he said. “I’m positive.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsDemocracy and justiceFossil fuelsShareReuse this content"

At his handful of public appearances each month, the USFederal Reservechair always sports the same softly stern expression. His voice, typically dispassionate and near-monotone, never wavers.As one of the most powerful officials in the world, commanding a platform that has the ability to move global markets with a few words, Powell is often reserved in a way that fails to yield soundbites in this social media era: boring, even.That changed on Sunday night. In avideo statementreleased by the Fed, Powell looked like his usual self. Calm and composed, though without his usual black glasses frame, Powell announced the Trump administration had instigated acriminal investigationagainst him – and that he would not back down.“I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment,” Powell said. “Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats.”It’s almost an unusual message to come out of Washington in Donald Trump’s second presidency, but one that is unsurprising from a man who has dedicated much of the last decade to upholding the political independence of the central bank.For years, this objective required protecting the Fed’s position above the scrum of politics. For months, Trump and his allies have sought to drag it down.After years working in private equity, Powell first joined the Fed in 2012. A registered Republican who was appointed to the Fed’s board by Barack Obama, he swiftly built a reputation as a consensus-builder. When Trump first tapped him to chair the central bank, in 2018, he was seen as a stable, safe pick – as he was when reappointed by Joe Biden, four years later.In anaddressto Princeton University’s graduating class last May, Powell expounded on the philosophy that has motivated his work. “I strongly urge you to find time in your careers for public service,” he said. “When you look back in 50 years, you will want to know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and bring us ever closer to the Founders’ timeless ideals.”The Fed was created by Congress in 1913 as independent from the president and Congress, to give it the legitimacy it needs to guide markets and manage theUS economy. Economists say a politicized central bank can often negatively affect inflation, and the cost of living.As the face of the Federal Reserve, the role of chair is one of the most delicate – and powerful – in the US government. Speak confidently about the US economy, and stock markets can soar. Say anything about unemployment or prices going up, and they can tumble.Often a boring Fed chair is exactly what the job requires. Over his eight-year stint in the job, Powell has steered the economy through Covid, soaring inflation, and Trump’s overhaul of US trade and immigration policies.Though some economists criticized Powell for being “dovish” about the post-Covid inflation, when annual price increases surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, he was widely praised for getting close to achieving what is known as a “soft landing”: bringing inflation down by raising interest rates, without bringing up unemployment. Last April, inflation hit 2.3%, the lowest in three years, while the unemployment rate steadied at 4.2%.During his second term in the White House, Trump has overseen massive anti-immigration operations, lifted US tariffs to levels not seen in decades, and signed off on tens of thousands of federal government layoffs. Surrounded by a group of staunch loyalists, he met little resistance in enacting his economic policies – except when it came to interest rates.The White House’s campaign to get the Fed to lower rates has fallen on deaf ears, and Trump has directed most of his ire on to Powell. From vitriolic social media posts tohandwritten missivesin thick marker, Trump has called the man he first chose to lead the Fed “a stupid person”, and floated firing him multiple times.Powell has been unflinching in the face of these attacks. At press conferences, he politely declines to answer any question he considers political. The most he’s given away was when Trump paid a visit to active construction at the Fed’s headquarters last summer, as allies of the president attempted to stir controversy surrounding the project. Addressing reporters side by side, Powell grew visibly frustrated as Trump misreported the cost of renovations.After a long season of restraint, it is an unprecedented criminal investigation – reportedly focused on those renovations – which appears to have pushed Powell over the edge.In his statement on Sunday, Powell for the first time outlined the extraordinary campaign that the White House has undertaken to push the Fed to lower rates – an incredible violation of the central bank’s independence.This criminal investigation is simply “pretext”, Powell said, noting that threat of the criminal charges comes after the Fed refused to follow “the preferences of the president”.Powell’s term as chair is due to conclude in May. Trump, who has claimed he did not personally know about the justice department’s investigation, says he has already picked a successor.But the launch of a criminal investigation has thrust the world’s most influential central bank into uncharted waters. The latest escalation of Trump’s campaign against the Fed is bigger than an attack on just one person, according to Powell: the future of the entire institution is on the line.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsEconomicsprofilesShareReuse this content"

It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciation I have for Coach Tomlin,” Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. “He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career.”Rooney added that the decision was ultimately down to Tomlin, saying the head coach had “decided to step down”.Tomlin released his own statement shortly afterwards. “I am deeply grateful to Art Rooney II and the late Ambassador [Dan] Rooney for their trust and support,” Tomlin said. “I am also thankful to the players who gave everything they had every day, and to the coaches and staff whose commitment and dedication made this journey so meaningful.”The 53-year-old leaves the Steelers never having recorded a losing season during his long tenure with the team, butPittsburgh’s loss to the Houston Texanson Monday night extended a streak of playoff losses, and there were scattered chants of “Fire Tomlin” from the home crowd. Tomlin’s Steelers last won a playoff game in the 2016 season.However, he still appeared to have the support of the locker room. After Monday’s loss, several players went out of their way to express their faith in Tomlin.“Mike T has had more success than damn near anybody in the league for the last 19, 20 years,” quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “And more than that, though, when you have the right guy and the culture is right, you don’t think about making a change, but there’s a lot of pressure that comes from the outside, and obviously that sways decisions from time to time. But it’s not how I would do things and not how the league used to be.”Texans extend Steelers’ playoff losing streak in possible farewell for Aaron RodgersRead moreDuring his nearly two decades in charge of the team, Tomlin compiled 193 wins in the regular season, a total that puts him ninth all-time inNFLhistory and tied with another legendary Steelers head coach, Chuck Noll. He won the Super Bowl in February 2009 in his second season with the Steelers and reached the title game again two years later but lost to the Green Bay Packers.Although he led his team to the playoffs on a consistent basis afterwards they rarely looked like genuine Super Bowl contenders and Pittsburgh now hope his replacement, who will be just the team’s fourth head coach since 1969, will bring revitalize the franchise.The first thing the new head coach will need to address is quarterback. The Steelers have not had a high quality starter since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. The team’s starter this past season was Rodgers, and while he did an adequate job in 2025, he is 42 and has hinted he may retire in the coming weeks.Tomlin’s Steelers contract ran through to the end of the 2027, and the team could be entitled to compensation if he joins another team before then.“While this chapter comes to a close, my respect and love for the Pittsburgh Steelers will never change,” Tomlin said in his statement. “I am excited for what the future holds for this organization, and I will forever be grateful for my time coaching in Pittsburgh.”In other coaching moves on Tuesday, Kevin Patullo, who attracted ire from large parts of the Eagles fanbase as the team failed to defend their Super Bowl title, was removed as Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator. The Los Angeles Chargers reacted to their playoff exit by firing offensive coordinator Greg Roman and offensive line coach Mike Devlin. The Chargers offense was ineffective intheir playoff loss to the New England Patriotsand the offensive line struggled badly with injuries during the season and failed to protect quarterback Justin Herbert.Explore more on these topicsPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It would prove the best chance of an underwhelming first half.Like Wissa, Erling Haaland’s touches were strictly rationed and, perhaps distracted by Nick Pope’s outstretched toe the Norwegian centre-forward spurned his one and only opening of the first 45 minutes following Bernardo Silva’s dangerous cross. Too often he and Semenyo entered each other’s orbits moving with the suspicion of strangers.Initially it all left both Pope and Trafford – who came close to joining Newcastle from Burnley last summer and is still much admired by Howe – with relatively little to do. Guardiola though still looked a little uneasy as the impressive Lewis Miley and Murphy aimed to pressure arguably City’s weakest defensive link, their left-back, Nathan Aké at every opportunity.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo’s second goal is ruled out by the video assistant referee.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersWith tension, and tempers, mounting Nico O’Reilly and Joelinton squared up in midfield and began pushing and shoving each other in the manner of children in a primary school playground. Both were shown yellow cards.Howe, too, lost his composure. After detecting some slapdash midfield play on Jacob Ramsey’s part, Newcastle’s manager looked in danger of spontaneous combustion as he leapt forward punching thin air and screaming invective at a player selected ahead of the fatigued Sandro Tonali.If his mood hardly improved as a hamstring injury forced Murphy’s replacement by Harvey Barnes shortly before the interval, at least his full-backs, Miley and Lewis Hall, were ensuring that City’s own wingers, Semenyo and, to a lesser extent, Jérémy Doku, were generally being kept on reasonably tight reins.The same applied to Wissa but when a striker who struggled to hold the ball up throughout finally escaped his minders and directed a looping header goalwards, Trafford made a save of such high calibre that it was all too easy to see why Howe still covets him.As Bruno Guimarães lashed the rebound on to the post it seemed a watershed moment had arrived and, almost immediately, Semenyo stepped out of the shadows.Unlike Wissa, he made the very most of that emergence into the sunlight. When Barnes hesitated, Doku pounced unleashing a cross that Silva helped into Semenyo’s path. All that remained was for the£62.5m signingfrom Bournemouth to score his second goal in two games as a City player.By way of emphasising his special talent, Semenyo swiftly spotted that Newcastle had lost concentration at a corner and backheeled a glorious improvisational “goal” beyond Pope. Newcastle were rescued by a five minute and 30 second long video assistant referee review that eventually detected a marginal offside against Haaland. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, was called to his monitor and he disallowed the goal.City defeat a reminder Newcastle have entered a level where it’s eat or be eaten | Andy BrassellRead moreGuardiola appeared suitably unimpressed. And rightly so. It was unfair on both the crowd and the players who could definitely have done without standing around for so long in the January chill.Howe responded to this, albeit temporary, reprieve by introducing Tonali, Nick Woltemade and Anthony Elanga in place of Ramsey, Gordon and Wissa. With virtually his first touch, Tonali met Elanga’s cut-back and sent a left-foot shot whizzing fractionally wide.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki sweeps the ball home right before the final whistle to double Manchester City’s lead.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockFor a while Newcastle rallied but the hosts were ultimately undone by a move of outstanding attacking fluency down City’s left.

Saying it is one thing, doing it another, doing it successfully something else entirely and a month and day after being offered that advice, handed that defence,Alonso was gone. On Monday afternoon, not long after landing from Saudi Arabia, a meeting was held at Valdebebas and then came the statement, short and unsentimental. He was a “legend” as a player, but no longer coach at Real Madrid.Alonso is the 11th manager to last less than a year in two decades under the president, Florentino Pérez. He had begun work only seven months before, and that was earlier than he intended. It had started with the Club World Cup in the US, his first big decision to accept the demand to take over sooner than he wanted, and it ended with the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah, where it was an open secret that final judgment awaited. For a month it had been impossible to avoid the feeling of a manager on borrowed time, especially for the manager himself, exposed and undermined, and you cannot go on like that. There will be hurt pride, regret, but release too.Xabi Alonso leaves Real Madrid after seven months and replaced by Álvaro ArbeloaRead moreTo become Real Madrid manager two things have to happen, Alonsosaid at his presentationin May: “First they have to want you, then you have to want to … and the latter normally does happen.” Even then, neither position was held quite as enthusiastically as it should have been; even the courtship had been unusually cold. “The challenge now is to build a team, to get the potential out of all those players and ensure that we all work together as one,” Alonso said. “Because if we do we will have a strength that is … I’m not going to say unstoppable, but very powerful.”Presented as a systems coach, what Madrid supposedly needed after a season oflaissez-fairefailure, Alonso was countercultural at a players’ club. At, above all, a president’s club where you must manage upwards too. Álvaro Carreras and Dean Huijsen arrived, but Alonso’s requests for Martín Zubimendi were rejected. He would have to find a holding midfielder in the squad, to attempt an evolution with Arda Guler. Alonso came with a consciously collective discourse: it didn’t matter who you were, you were going to run. Briefly, very briefly, there were glimpses of that in the US: a structure, pressure, an idea forming, a new identity. Butthen came Paris Saint-Germainto reveal the size of his task and, in the final analysis, it didn’t happen. The team Alonso envisaged didn’t exist, leaving him frustrated at their failure to learn.PSG scored four past them,Atlético five. They weretaken apart by Celta Vigoat home; there had been an urge to sack Alonso that night. Thesemi-final victoryagainst Atlético in the Super Cup came with an asterisk: Diego Simeone’s side had been far superior. In the final on Sunday nightBarcelona scored three– although many saw dignity in defeat, maybe even survival, some reason to carry on. The timing of his sacking caught almost everyone by surprise, even if the underlying fact did not.Quick GuideArbeloa in hot seatShowEight minutes passed between Real Madrid announcing the sacking of Xabi Alonso revealing the man who would replace him: the new coach at the Santiago Bernabéu would be his friend and former teammate, Alvaro Arbeloa.“We spoke for a good while yesterday,” Arbeloa said on Tuesday lunchtime. “What we said stays between us. He wished me the best and I wished him the best, too. You all know the relationship, the friendship, that unites us, how much I love and appreciate him. That is mutual and will continue to be mutual. We’ll be close as we have been all these years.”Theotherformer Liverpool and Real Madrid player follows Alonso on to the Bernabéu bench having been promoted from the B team, Castilla. Seen as a club man, close to the president, and from the José Mourinho mould, during his first press conference Arbeloa avoided answering questions about whether this is a permanent role or an interim post after which he could remain within the structure. “I will be Real Madrid for as long as Real Madrid want me to,” he said. “I am conscious of the responsibility I have.“For me it was an honour and a privilege to be coached by José Mourinho. He was someone who influenced me a lot, I carry a lot of him in me. I don’t fear failure at all, but if I tried to be Jose Mourinho I would be a resounding failure.”Aware of his audience, Arbeloa made much of Madrid’s status as the “best club in the world and in history\", said that the youth structure is the best in football.When asked to define “play well”, he said that Madrid’s mission was just “to win, win, win, and win again”, and later said that the players had to “enjoy” playing. He claimed that often people are reluctant to give the credit they deserve. “There are players here who have won six European Cups, which seems to be forgotten,” he said.“Helping those trophy cabinets to fill: that’s my mission and my obsession, what I am going to live for every day.”Sid LoweWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best moment had been in theleagueclásicoagainst Barcelonain October. And yet that became the worst too, fault lines appearing in front of 80,000 people. When Alonso removed Vinícius Júnior late on, the Brazilian stormed straight down the tunnel, his fury there for all to see, shouting that he would walk straight out on the team too. “We’ll talk about it, of course,” Alonso said. “But I don’t want to lose focus of what’s truly important: a lot of the things we wanted to do have happened.”Yet it soon became clear that Vinícius’s huffwasthe truly important thing, not the victory. His anger, deeper than just one game, eclipsed all else and he was not the only one. Fede Valverde’s complaints about playing at full‑back were also made publicly, while details filtered out about a disconnect, discontent: a familiar lament about all the instructions, the videos, the long sessions. Who did he think he was? The manager?The dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti as “only” a man manager, the idea that it is easy amid these egos, needs some revising. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that seven players have stayed silent since Alonso’s sacking, not offering the usual social media platitudes, Vinícius among them.The reaction, or lack of it, to Vinícius’s outburst only deepened the problem. Or, perhaps more accurately, revealed it. Rather than censoring the Brazilian’s behaviour, backing their manager, the private response from the club was blunt: well, he shouldn’t have taken Vinícius off.Publicly there was nothing, the manager’s authority vanishing. Vinícius posted an apology in which he pointedly mentioned everyone except Alonso. Stories soon emerged that he would not renew his contract for as long as Alonso was around; that he had allowed it to run towards the final 18 month, unable to reach an agreement independently of any issues with the coach, went unsaid.View image in fullscreenVinícius Júnior’s relationship with Xabi Alonso was strained and ultimately, the club took the player’s side.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/APAll this when things were going well, or sort of. Madrid’s performances had not been especially inspiring and theirdestruction in the derbyhad hurt, but they came out of theclásicotop of the table, five points clear of Barcelona with nine wins from 10. Something, though, had been broken. There was a victory over Valencia, thendefeat in Liverpool, three successive draws in La Liga, at Rayo Vallecano,Elcheand Girona, and a chaotic andconcerning 4-3 win at Olympiakos, the tension palpable.Efforts were made to bring the squad together, to improve relationships. Discussions held in team hotels in Athens then Bilbao sought common ground and appeared reasonably successful. On the nightMadrid beat Athletic, Vinícius publicly embraced Alonso. The fix, though, was fleeting and the most basic thing of all still wasn’t good: the football. Four days later, they lost to Celta, the threat of the sack made explicit that night. From five ahead of Barcelona, they are now four behind.Three days later came City, led by Guardiola, with whom Alonso had first started to fully embrace the idea of being a coach. Madrid competed, which was something, no complaints about the effort this time. And when Rodrygo scored, he ran to embrace Alonso, butCity won 2-1. There was a stay of execution, not least because there appeared little alternative. But, still, theyhad lost. And another defeat would be definitive.Before that game, Guardiola was asked whether he had any advice for Alonso. “Yes,” the City coach said,offering a responsethat served as a defence of his friend too:“Que mee con la suya.”Alonso should piss with his own penis. In other words, do it your way: the decisions should be his, not imposed by dressing room or boardroom. His team should be built on conviction, not accommodation. If he were to die, die with his own boots on.When that was put to Alonso, he allowed that idea to hang, for those listening to conclude that Guardiola’s implicit criticism of Madrid was not entirely misplaced, by replying: “I have a good relationship with Pep, we know each other well and he knows what he is saying.”Yet doing it entirely your own way is impossible. Here especially. Better not to die at all. “Being Madrid manager is not about changing [the culture], it is about adapting,” Alonso said. “We know the culture ofReal Madridpretty well; that is why it is the biggest club in the world. You have to adapt, learn a lot, interact with the players. Some days are good, some not so good. We have to face that with energy and positivity, that is the only way to turn things around.”It wasn’t easy, and his ideas were rarely apparent. He had started with Valverde leading the pressure. At least partly obliged by absences, now he had him at full-back. With Vinícius and Kylian Mbappé up front, nor did Madrid press as Alonso had planned. Dani Carvajal was their only real leader, and he was injured. Vinícius went 16 games until Sunday without a goal. There was no one to run the game from the middle, the fundamental piece that Alonso had been and had asked for.For all the talk of a collective, it was still individual players doing their thing that won them games. Mbappé has 29 goals in all competitions, almost half of all Madrid’s. It’s a process, Alonso said from time to time, but six months had passed and patience was thin. Project? The project at Madrid, as Álvaro Arbeloa put it on Tuesday after succeeding Alonso, is to “win, win, win, and win again”.View image in fullscreenÁlvaro Arbeloa said the project at Real Madrid is to ‘win, win, win, and win again’.Photograph: Europa Press Sports/Europa Press/Getty ImagesThe injuries seemed endless, especially in defence, and the club’s criticism about the physical preparation filtered out through familiar channels. Antonio Pintus, the fitness coach still there in an advisory role but not on Alonso’s staff – a man sidelined under Ancelotti – travelled with them to Saudi Arabia. The former doctor Niko Mihic had returned, now there was pressure to integrate Pintus again, but this time the manager did resist, a red line crossed. On Monday afternoon, the statement came out. Alonso had gone. By “mutual consent”, they said.One more defeat was always likely to be definitive, and in aclásicomore. At the end of the Super Cup final, Alonso tried to get his players to line up and give Barcelona a guard of honour but Mbappé refused, waving them away from there. Alonso gave up, another damaging portrait of what they had become. During the medal ceremony, the manager’s handshake with Pérez looked like two men trying to avoid catching something, still less each other’s eye.At the end of what would be his 34th and last game as manager of Madrid, Alonso was asked about their encounter, whether he had been able to talk to the president about everything, about his future and theirs. “Nah, it was brief,” he said. And it had been.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridXabi AlonsoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do not hog the practice court. But as leading players testify – the reality is very differentTumaini Carayolin MelbourneTue 13 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTShareOn a cool Wednesday afternoon before the US Open last year, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev were busy fine-tuning their games in an intense practice set at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, semi-finalists in the mixed doubles tournament, were scheduled to take their place at the hour and the American pair duly arrived a couple of minutes before their allotted slot.An amusing scene soon unfolded. Medvedev and Zverev were clearly desperate to continue playing for a little longer, but their court time had run out. The pair began to sheepishly deliberate over whether to attempt to play another game, even lining up on the baseline again, and they still occupied the court past the hour. Finally, they admitted defeat, allowing Collins and Harrison, who had been standing quietly on the sidelines, to begin.Nick Kyrgios delights rowdy fans as tennis cultures clash at Kooyong ClassicRead moreAlthough tennis players happily train with their rivals throughout the year, the practice court can also be a source of friction. Some players are particularly irritated when some of their colleagues inconsiderately extend their practice sessions past their scheduled court time. An unwritten rule in professional tournaments around the world: do not hog the practice court.Many people shrug off poor timekeeping from their peers, but for others this is a cardinal sin. Gabriel Diallo, a talented young Canadian player ranked No 41 in the world, smiles widely: “Some people abuse their time. It’s one hour, they push it to 1.05, 1.10. I’m Canadian so I hate confrontation. I just let people play, maybe too much.”The subject similarly prompts a chuckle from Coco Gauff: “It’s happened on tour now more so than juniors,” she says. “You definitely get some people that you know will push their time two, three, four minutes past. I’m not on the bar with that. If I’m on the court, I’ll ask my coach the time. I don’t like to be that player that goes over their time. I’m going to stop literally maybe even a minute before, especially if they have to clean the court [on clay].”A practice court handover can be awkward on both sides. Trying to finish a session on time and on the right note is not always a pleasant feeling, as stressed by Emma Raducanu: “Seven out of 10 times you end up double faulting,” she says. “That’s what happened to me today and I had a good practice. Maybe you feel pressure with the people coming on, especially if they’ve got a team of eight people in total. It is always a funny little interaction because the [final] point usually ends up being either terrible or unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff in a practice session in Melbourne.Photograph: Marcin Cholewinski/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockCourt time is precious at nearly every tournament and few players are allocated as much training time as they would like. There is also a difference between the time and quality of courts available to top players and the rest. This can lead to further resentment when higher-ranked players still take their time.Jessica Pegula, who spent much of her career outside the top 100 before a mid‑career breakthrough, notes how differently she was treated as a lower-ranked player, even at the US Open, her home tournament: “I was back in the park smelling all the weed and all the smells New York City has to offer,” she says. “They were completely different courts too. They were so fast, and they were nothing like the match courts. I’ve definitely seen a shift in my practice courts and my times and what courts I can get now that I’m a top player. I guess you could say it’s unfair a little bit, but I also think sometimes you’ve earned that right.”Perspectives are varied on the best way to react when another player is hogging the court. Pegula believes most players are flexible and understanding, but she does not hesitate to make her presence felt when necessary: “It is kind of funny, because you walk out and stand around: ‘All right, your time’s up,’” she says. “You go up and stand there, bouncing the ball. Like, ‘OK, it’s time to get off.’”View image in fullscreenGabriel Diallo says he takes a ‘very Canadian’ approach to practice-court etiquette.Photograph: Kobe Li/Nexpher/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockGauff is similarly proactive when the player before her is taking too long: “There are some people that go over [the time limit] and you’re kind of standing and you start making your way further and further on the court,” she says. “I don’t mind [players taking their time] as much, but it’s just, like, acknowledge it sometimes. If someone [says]: ‘Sorry, I have a match, I just want to hit a few more serves.’ I’m, like: ‘OK, cool.’ But the worst is if the player just keeps going like they’re not in the wrong. And then they don’t say sorry after. And I’m like: ‘OK, noted.’”During the early rounds of the US Open, Cameron Norrie had the pleasure of waiting for Novak Djokovic and Zverev to finish their practice session. As the hour came to an end, Norrie turned to his fitness trainer: “It was like 59 [minutes past]. I was trying to push my fitness trainer on to put a bit of pressure [on them]. He was like: ‘No, I don’t want to go!’”Others take a more passive stance, waiting patiently for the player before them to finish. Diallo chooses peace, but he is still judging the player for every additional second they spend on the court during his practice hour: “I think at a certain point, it’s ridiculous. If you’re finishing up your serves, OK fine. I don’t think at this stage it’s going to make a difference how you’re going to play.A smile creeps across Diallo’s face as he continues: “I just sit and watch them until when they’re going to be satisfied that: ‘OK, I’ve had enough and I can go and be calm now about my match.’ Very Canadian.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026TennisAustralian OpenAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was 65.The University of Nebraska announced Hartung died Saturday night. He had been a Cornhuskers assistant coach for 19 years. No cause of death was given.“Our condolences go out to Jim’s family, friends, and everyone he has impacted during his remarkable life in gymnastics from a national champion athlete at Nebraska to an Olympic gold medalist to a successful coach,” the athletic department said in a statement. “Jim is a true Husker legend and his impact on the sport of gymnastics will carry on for decades to come. Our department will provide all available resources and support for our men’s gymnastics student-athletes and coaching staff during this very difficult time.”Hartung was a member of the 1980 Olympic team but did not compete because of the US boycott of the Moscow Games. In 1984 in Los Angeles he teamed with Bart Conner, Tim Daggett, Mitch Gaylord, Scott Johnson and Peter Vidmar to win the team gold. He also made the individual finals on the vault.Hartung amassed 22 All-America awards and seven NCAA individual titles during his career at Nebraska from 1979 to 1982. He won NCAA all-around titles in 1981 and 1982. Hartung also led the Huskers to their first four NCAA team titles (1979-82) and became Nebraska’s first Nissen-Emery Award winner as the nation’s outstanding senior gymnast in 1982.After retiring as a competitor, he spent nearly a decade as a visitation coach for the US national team and was an international gymnastics judge.Hartung is survived by four children.Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsUSA Olympic teamUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But its legacy is still a subject of debateBranson WrightTue 13 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 06.04 ESTShareTony Rice noticed the looks and smirks during his first week of freshman classes in the fall of 1986 at Notre Dame.He had accepted his fate a few months earlier when standardized test results led to the decision that he would not be eligible to participate in collegiate sports his freshman year. But nothing prepared him for this.“People were looking at me,” Rice says. “They knew I was a football player and they knew why I wasn’t playing. I’m sure they were thinking, ‘Why is he here when he can’t cut it at Notre Dame academically.’”Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of Proposition 48, approved by member schools of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which tied freshman athletic eligibility to minimum grade-point averages and standardized test scores. Four decades later, Proposition 48 remains one of the NCAA’s most controversial decisions – a policy its architects said would protect academic standards but which critics viewed as a blunt instrument that disproportionately punished Black athletes and students from underfunded schools. The rule barred hundreds of freshmen from competition based on test scores that many educators questioned as measures of college readiness, forcing athletes like Rice to sit out while facing stigma on campus. Though the policy has since evolved, its legacy still shapes debates over standardized testing, racial equity, and who gets to define merit in college athletics.The NBA’s dress code was seen as policing Black culture. Instead it inspired a fashion revolutionRead moreRice wasn’t alone in that stigma. In the fall of 1986, 401 recruits were ineligible to compete that season under the new rule. In football, 81% of players ruled ineligible were Black, according to the NCAA. These student-athletes arrived on campuses as recruited prospects but were immediately marked as academic failures, unable to practice with teams or suit up for games, their scholarships intact but their status uncertain.“It was kind of hard to sit out that year after playing sports my whole life,” Rice says. “There were three other guys at Notre Dame who had to sit out. We encouraged each other to do our best.”The NCAA said it was trying to improve the academic perception of its student-athletes. The road to Proposition 48 began in the early 1980s when a series of academic scandals – including revelations that some athletes were graduating functionally illiterate – pressured the NCAA to act. Led by the American Council on Education and college presidents concerned about the integrity of their institutions, the reform movement culminated in January 1983, when delegates at the NCAA convention in San Diego voted 427–93 to approve new academic standards.The NCAA adopted the proposal, setting minimum requirements: a 2.0 grade-point average (on a 4.0 scale) in 11 core courses and a minimum score of 700 on the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) or a minimum score of 15 on the ACT.NCAA member schools implemented Proposition 48 on 13 January 1986, and it went into effect with the fall freshman class that year.But the new policy quickly drew criticism because it disproportionately affected Black student-athletes. While Black students made up roughly 25 percent of Division I athletes in major sports, they accounted for more than 80 percent of those barred under Proposition 48 in its early years. The SAT score requirement of 700 – later raised to 820 – hovered near the national average at the time, yet still eliminated disproportionate numbers of Black recruits, particularly those from under-resourced schools in the South and inner cities.The criticism was swift and fierce. Civil rights leaders, educators, and coaches argued that standardized tests were culturally biased measures that had long been used to exclude Black students from educational opportunities.The NAACP and the National Alliance of Black School Educatorscondemned Proposition 48,arguing it would reduce opportunities for Black students without addressing the root problem: unequal K-12 education. They pointed to research showing that standardized tests often under-predicted the college success of Black students, who frequently performed better academically than their test scores suggested.“Proposition 48 appears to be racially discriminating legislation, but it’s actually an economic discriminatory practice,” says Gary “Doc” Sailes, an author and sport psychologist. “Plenty of studies have proven that. It affects poor Blacks, poor females, poor whites and poor Asians. My research also disclosed that the higher the income in a county, the higher the tax base, the more resources that are available for education.”Supporters of Proposition 48 pushed back, arguing that without minimum standards, colleges were exploiting athletes and setting them up for failure. They pointed to athletes who left school without degrees, unprepared for life after sports. The debate, they insisted, wasn’t about access but about accountability – for both athletes and the institutions recruiting them.The NCAA made changes. In 1992, the organization replaced Proposition 48 with Proposition 16, introducing a sliding scale that allowed students with higher GPAs to qualify with lower test scores – and vice versa. A student with a 3.5 GPA, for example, could be eligible with an SAT score as low as 620, while a student with a 2.0 GPA would need at least 1,010.The NCAA continued tweaking the requirements over the next two decades. In 2003, it raised the number of required core courses from 13 to 16. In 2016, it increased the minimum GPA to 2.3 for Division I athletes. Each adjustment was presented as a step toward higher academic standards.But the landscape around Proposition 48 was shifting in ways its architects never anticipated. By the 2020s, more than 1,800 colleges and universities had made SAT and ACT scores optional for admission, citing the same concerns about bias and inequity that critics had raised decades earlier. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated that trend, with even elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale modifying their test-score requirements.The NCAA, however, stillrequires standardized test scoresfor initial eligibility.Four decades later, the question remains: did Proposition 48 achieve what it set out to do?The NCAA points to improved graduation rates as evidence of success. In 1984, just 52% of Division I football players graduated within six years. By 2023, that number had climbed to 81% for players who entered college in 2016. Men’s basketball showed similar gains, rising from 41% to 90% over the same period.Since 2002, Black student-athlete graduation rates have increased from 56% to 82% in 2023. When analyzed by sport, Black Football Bowl Subdivision student-athlete graduation rates rose from 54% to 82%, and from 46% to 84% for Black men’s basketball players. For Hispanic/Latino student-athletes the graduation rate rose from 64% to 89% and the rate for all student-athletes went from 74% to 91%.But researchers caution against drawing a direct line from Proposition 48 to those improvements. The rise in graduation rates across higher education during that period may relate to expanded support services, tutoring programs, and greater attention to student retention. Many academic support systems for athletes today, such as study halls, academic advisors, and progress tracking, emerged not because of Proposition 48, but as schools worked to help admitted athletes succeed.Among those who proved doubters wrong was Rice, who said the situation Proposition 48 put him in helped him in the long run. Sitting out his first year became an unexpected gift. Without the demands of practice and games, he immersed himself in his studies, determined to prove that the test score that sidelined him did not define his capabilities.“Academically, I had something to prove to my critics and to myself,” Rice says. “Sitting out that first year gave me opportunities other football players didn’t have. I was able to develop relationships with other members of the student body that wouldn’t have happened if I was playing football my first year. It was a blessing.”Rice became eligible as a sophomore. After a solid junior year,he guided the Fighting Irishto an undefeated 12–0 season, which included victories over Michigan, USC, and Miami. He ended the season with a national title – the school’s most recent one. He received the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting.He achieved a higher goal after the football season. He earned his degree in Psychology.“Graduating was important because I didn’t want to let my mother, grandmother, or anyone affiliated with me down,” says Rice, who now works in insurance for the Howden Group. “I didn’t want to be considered a failure. If I’m out in public and someone’s hating on my school, I just show them my ring and tell them, ‘I got two things you don’t have – a national championship and a Notre Dame degree.’”Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsCollege footballNCAAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had followed all his fights on TV, of course. But to see him in the flesh in September 1994, a year before he became world champion, was an altogether more visceral and mesmeric experience.Hamed’s punches sounded like firecrackers welcoming in the new year as they smashed into the pads. He was almost impossible to hit. And, most staggering of all, despite standing 5ft 4in tall and weighing only nine stone, he would bully far bigger men in sparring – including fighters such as John Keeton, who went on to become the British cruiserweight champion – until my great uncle, Brendan Ingle, called time.‘The whole world can think whatever they want’ – Naseem Hamed on boxing, racism and his greatest regretRead more“Naz can box orthodox and he can box southpaw,” Brendan would tell me, and anyone else who visited the St Thomas’ boys and girls club in Sheffield. “He can switch hit. He is going to win world titles at every weight from featherweight to super-middleweight. The only person that will beat him is himself.”Naturally, there was a touch of the blarney about this. But only a touch. The more I watched Hamed – and I would go to the gym every couple of weeks as a student – the more I became convinced he would win titles in multiple weight divisions.But even then there were tensions, which are explored in an enjoyable new biopic, Giant, starring Pierce Brosnan and Amir El-Masry. The film charts Hamed’s rise from the age of seven under my great uncle’s guidance, before the collapse of their relationship. And it also asks the pertinent question: how much is talent God-given, and how much is shaped?So what was it like watching James Bond play a family member? In truth, a little surreal and sometimes downright spooky. Brosnan’s Ingle was a little more pushy, and unkempt, than I remember. But his tone and twang, Dublin tinged with Sheffield, and his mannerisms were uncanny.As the film also shows, Brendan wasn’t only a trainer: he was a social worker, community glue, patriarch and philosopher rolled into one. “What’s the biggest motivator in life?” he once asked me. “Money?” I replied. “No, sex.” And then there would come a story, of a boxer distracted by a woman. A fight lost. An opportunity squandered.View image in fullscreenPierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in four films between 1995 and 2002, as Brendan Ingle.Photograph: Sam TalorBrendan also loved to tell people that “boxing at its worst is a dirty, rotten, horrible, prostitutioning, vindicative game … but it’s only like life. And life isn’t fair.” But he knew better than anyone that it transformed the lives of many kids, especially those who had been in trouble.Brendan used to say he had seen it all before. And he pretty much had. But Hamed’s behaviour and ego eventually became too much. The film ends with the pair splitting after Hamed’s wild victory over Kevin Kelley at Madison Square Garden in 1997. In fact, their relationship staggered on until the Wayne McCullough fight the following year.However since the film’s release on Friday, old wounds have been reopened. Hamed has spoken about how Brendan rebuffed his attempts to build bridges and also suggested that Brendan was obsessed with money.Hamed is completely right on the first point – and totally wrong on the second. Was Brendan worried that Hamed’s brother, Riath, was turning Naseem’s head when it came to Brendan getting less of a cut of fight purses? Yes. In fact he called Riath a snake and didn’t want him in the gym. Did he feel that he deserved to be fairly rewarded for the years he had put into training Hamed? Absolutely.But as my cousin, Dominic Ingle, reminded me, Brendan never moved away from his modest house in Wincobank. And while he bought an iron gate for his home once he had made some money, that was about it.View image in fullscreenHamed and Ingle in the corner on the night he defeated Wayne McCullough, the pair’s last fight together.Photograph: Nicks Potts/Action ImagesMeanwhile another fighter, Johnny Nelson, responded to Hamed’s comments by telling the story of how Brendan secretly gave him £250 a week for 13 months when he wasn’t earning. The one proviso? Nelson wasn’t allowed to tell anyone – and if he did, he would have to pay the money back.What Brendan really craved most of all wasn’t money. It was respect. Respect from Hamed. Respect for his unique training methods. Respect for being an uneducated Paddy who had had it the hard way.And while Hamed’s reputation has tumbled since retirement, his career deserves more respect. His solitary loss to Marco Antonio Barrera in 2001 has become a one-fight referendum on his talents. But by then he was long past his best. He didn’t train hard enough and overly relied on his power. And rewatching the documentary, The Little Prince, The Big Fight, his ego was rampant. The Hamed of 1995 would have thumped the Hamed of 2001. And, I believe, Barrera too.Incidentally, while the film shows Ingles cheering when Hamed lost, that wasn’t the case. They didn’t watch the fight. However Dominic tells me that when the pair split, his dad actually cried.View image in fullscreenIngle with his fighters Johnny Nelson and Hamed at his Sheffield gym in 1993.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBefore walking away, he says that Brendan told Hamed that he would train more world champions in the future, only for Naz to scoff. “Like who?”“Johnny Nelson and Junior Witter,” came the response.“Johnny Nelson?” replied Hamed. “He’s already been beaten twice. And Junior Witter is never going to be world champion – you’re off your head.”According to Dominic, the look in his dad’s eye suggested he knew that Hamed might be right. “My dad was in tears actually,” he says. “And Naz was going: ‘Look, he’s upset, you need to comfort him.’But me and my brother, John, were like: “No, you comfort him, Naz. Because you upset him, not us.”History ended up proving Ingle right. First Nelson become a world champion. Then Witter. And after that came Kell Brook and Abdul-Bari Awad.And while there was no reconciliation beforeBrendan’s death in 2018, there is a happier postscript. Just before Covid, Hamed’s sons trained at the Ingle gym, and while they were there, Hamed popped in for a chat with Dominic and John.“We ended up talking for four or five hours,” Dominic tells me. “My mum also came down and went: ‘All right, Naz?’ There was no animosity. That was always between Naz and my dad. We just talked about the old times and the good times.”As I write, I am staring a photograph I took of them in the summer of 1995. Hamed is in the ring. Brendan is on the apron. It shows a moment of calm before the glory and the storm. It’s also a reminder of what was, and what might have been.Explore more on these topicsBoxingcommentShareReuse this content"

What does it mean for Manchester United?The Côte d’Ivoire winger was his nation’s best player in Morocco, but his place in a post-Amorim world is uncertainCatalina BushTue 13 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 11.15 ESTShareIt’s often easy to forget that Amad Diallo is only 23. In the five years since he joinedManchester Unitedfrom Atalanta for a reported £19m (about $25m) plus add-ons, the winger has seen plenty of ups and downs.Once a much-hyped prospect, Amad struggled to earn minutes at United in his first season with the club and was soon sent out on loan to Rangers and Sunderland. Now, three years since he returned to Manchester, Amad is no longer sidelined or dismissed; he has become a difference maker.Manchester United to confirm Michael Carrick as interim managerRead moreTo see Amad today is to see an emblem of hard work, guile, and skill, a man transformed from squad player to star. His impact extends far beyond the Premier League: at the 2025Africa Cup of Nations(Afcon), he made himself Côte d’Ivoire’s No 1 man.In the 2025-26 season, no Red Devils player has provided more progressive carries, per FBref. Because of this, Amad has become imperative to United’s buildup: when opposing teams implement a high press and force passes out wide, it’s often Amad who receives the ball, beats a defender and drives upfield. And when defenses allow the long ball from goalkeeper Senne Lammens to target man Benjamin Šeško, Amad frequently collects the second ball or makes a supporting run. Even in open play, the winger floats around, providing both an outlet to the backline and a vertical threat in behind.Many of these moments have come as a result of Amad being pushed to a more defensive wing-back role in Ruben Amorim’s system. In the first half of the 2024-25 season – prior to the Portuguese manager’s first game in charge – Amad averaged 1.01 attempted take-ons per 90 minutes across all club competitions. In the second half of the season, that number rose to 4.28.This increase is reflective of a broader change in the Ivorian’s demeanor; under Amorim, either when playing as a second No 10 or out at wing-back, Amad showed a heightened confidence and willingness to dribble at defenders. His passing improved, too. In 2024-25, he ranked 16th in key passes per 90 among Premier League players with a minimum of 450 minutes played. He also ranked 17th in actions directly leading to shots. This season, it’s only gotten better.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Catalina BushAmad now ranks 11th in key passes and sixth in shot-creating actions – his production is second to only Bruno Fernandes among United players. Fernandes, 31, may be coming to the end of his time at United, with transfer speculation arising every window, and it’s unclear how the club would replace the captain if and when he leaves. Amad, having shown an ability to orchestrate attacks, could be part of the solution.That being said, the Ivorian has struggled to score in the Premier League this season. He has just two goals in approximately 1,200 minutes, but that can also be read as a natural consequence of the aforementioned positional switch. If Amad is to step into a greater role in coming seasons, though, the end product must improve.Salah inspires Egypt with energy recalling golden generation to evoke recent history | Jonathan WilsonRead moreIndeed, the days of Amad at wing-back may soon be over. WithAmorim’s dismissal, tactics will surely change, as will Amad’s position. This could result in a more attacking role. And if his performance in that kind of role at Afcon is anything to go by, it could be a positive sign of what’s in store once he returns to Manchester.Simply put, Amad took Afcon by storm. In four starts, he notched three goals and an assist, leading his squad to an undefeated group stage and a round-of-16 win over Burkina Faso before falling to Egypt in the quarter-final. While Côte d’Ivoire’s roster has plenty of talent, no one has come close to rivaling Amad’s proficiency. His eagerness in the final third led to 5.17 shots and 0.45 xG per 90 minutes, per Opta. No other player in the tournament has taken more shots per 90 minutes than Amad, and his three goals will surely leave him among the tournament’s top scorers by the time it’s over.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Catalina BushOne such strike came off of a rapid counter attack against Cameroon, when Amad carried the ball at speed, cut in and effortlessly curled a shot past the goalkeeper. That goal was the only one of the game for Côte d’Ivoire, and while Cameroon soon equalized, Amad’s impact proved to be crucial in securing a point that would help the defending champions lock up first place in their group.Amad’s magic in the final third and progression through wide channels is difficult to replace in a team already packed with talent. On the continental stage, Amad has proved that he is fit for the spotlight.Just a few days ago, in apost-game press conference, Amad said: “I’m not trying to be Ivory Coast’s best player.” Too late.Note: All data accurate as of 9 January 2026.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedCôte d’Ivoire football teamAfrica Cup of NationsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Disasi, the former Monaco centre-back, has been in limbo and the issue with Sterling is that the former England winger has 18 months on a contract worth about £325,000 a week. Chelsea’s preference would be to move players on this month but Rosenior wants to speak to them to work out the best way forward.“I’ve had so much on,” the 41‑year‑old coach said. “I’ve been in for three days. This is my fourth day in the job. I will have conversations with them. Raheem’s had an outstanding career. I’ve got huge respect for him and Axel, who was someone I’ve really, really liked for a long time. But in this moment, with the amount of games that we’ve got, I haven’t got on to that topic. I will do it in the next few days.”Sterling has interest from Fulham but Rosenior did not close the door on the former Manchester City forward and Disasi making unlikely returns to the squad. “I have to have a conversation with them. I have to have a conversation with the club. I’ve got to work through a list of priority. It’s been a whirlwind.”Chelsea are unlikely to be busy before the transfer window shuts but are open to opportunities. ­Rosenior, who played his second string when he opened his reignwith a 5-1 victory against ­Charltonin the FA Cup last Saturday, will take a closer look at his players before speaking to the club’s recruitment team about potential reinforcements.View image in fullscreenAxel Disasi has not played for Chelsea in almost a year.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images“The first conversation I had with the guys is that I want to assess the most important players, which is the guys that are here,” he said.“Normally you get good surprises if you give people a chance. I had some really good surprises in the game against Charlton. The performance from some of the players who maybe haven’t played as much this season was outstanding.“I want to give them a chance. We’re in January and we want the club to be as successful as possible in the short term, but I also think sometimes the answers lay within the building and not outside. So I’ll make a decision on that with the guys probably later in the window when I’ve seen everyone play.”Chelsea face Arsenal knowing that they held the best side in the countrywhen playing with 10 menin the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in November. Rosenior will have to adjust without the suspended Moisés Caicedo in midfield while Cole Palmer is an injury doubt for the game having struggled since returning from a groin strain last month.“He’s a special talent,” Rosenior said. “My job is to get to know him, to connect with him, to understand what gets the best out of him. And that takes time. The scary thing with Cole is he has already got world-class ability but he’s only 23.”Chelsea have six games left this month and Rosenior will manage Palmer’s load carefully. “I’ve had a really good, in-depth conversation with Cole today,” he said. “I’ve had a really good, in-depth conversation with the medical team. It would be crazy for me to risk any player in this phase of the season.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaRaheem SterlingnewsShareReuse this content"

Arteta spoke after ­revealing that William Saliba is a doubt for the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea on Wednesday.Saliba and Leandro Trossard did not feature in theFA Cup victory against Portsmouthon Sunday. It was widely thought both had been rested. However, Arteta confirmed on Tuesday that the France defender could miss the game at Stamford Bridge because of an unspecified injury, while ­Trossard is also a doubt.Piero Hincapié and Riccardo ­Calafiori both remain out with groin and muscular injuries respectively, while Cristhian Mosquera continues to make progress on an ankle injury and is not expected to return until next month.That meansArsenalcould once again be forced to field Christian ­Nørgaard at centre-back against Chelsea after the Denmark midfielder filled that role at Fratton Park. Declan Rice is not expected to deputise at right-back like he did against Brighton last month with Ben White available again.Asked if defensive injuries could be the issue that undermines Arsenal’s hunt for silverware this season, Arteta said: “Yes, because we have experienced that first of all in the front line and then in the back line. But we are trying to find solutions to protect our players.“The good thing is that players you ask to play in different positions like Christian for example or Dec, they fulfil their role immediately in a great way and we need to navigate now in the next few weeks through that situation and I’m sure we’ll do that.”Regarding Nørgaard, who joined from Brentford in the summer but has yet to start a Premier League game, Arteta said: “He is always ready to fulfil any role.”Saliba has already been out injured twice this season because of an ankle problem he picked up in November that also led to him missing five games in December. Nørgaard and Gabriel Magalhães is the eighth central defensive partnership Arsenal have used this season amid enforced absences.A2-0 home defeatin the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle last year gave Arsenal a mountain to climb. They were knocked out 4-0 on aggregate by the eventual winners. Arteta is hopeful that his players have learned from that “painful” experience as they attempt to win a first major trophy since the FA Cup in 2020.“Football gives you another chance,” he said. “We have been really consistent again in this competition and now we have to knock another big team out to be in the final. That is the mission. Hopefully we have learned from last year because it was ­painful, especially in the manner that the games went, and the amount of chances we missed to go through.“So this year we want to be better and more efficient. The more you are involved in these kind of games the better because it gives you an edge. It brings the team a different kind of energy and it gives you the sense that the objective is very, very close, and that’s a massive motivation for everybody. We know that we are two games away from playing a final.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Senegal and Egypt drew 0-0. Penalties followed. The first three kicks were scored, then Egypt’s Mohamed Abdelmonem hit the post. Mohamed Abou Gabal immediately saved from Bouna Sarr but Édouard Mendy saved the fourth Egyptian effort, from Mohanad Lasheen. After four penalties each, Senegal led 3-2; Sadio Mané had the chance to win it.Mané had missed a fifth-minute penalty in the game. He had missed a penalty against Cameroon in the shootout after the quarter-final in Franceville in 2017. “I can’t explain how tough it was for me,” Mané said. “I was sleeping four or five hours a night, five hours maximum. I had a big pressure in my head. I would go to bed and wake up maybe at 4am and I could not sleep any more … Everybody knew I was obsessed about this tournament and wanted to win it with my country … Thinking about this penalty I can say it was one of the hardest things in my life.”54:46Afcon special: Morocco’s moment, Nigeria’s surge and more: Football Weekly – videoBut he steeled himself, using the meditation techniques he had recently started practising, took a long angled run, and drilled his kick low to Gabal’s right, just inside the post.Senegal had won Afcon for the first time. On the halfway line, meanwhile, Mohamed Salah pulled the hem of his shirt over his head, covering his face. The game was lost before he’d even had the chance to take his kick.The Stade Abdoulaye Wade, Dakar, 29 March 2022, CAF World Cup qualifying playoff second leg. A fourth-minute Hamdy Fathy own goal gave Senegal a 1-0 win, meaning the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate. Penalties again followed. Salah wasn’t going to make the same mistake again and wait to take the fifth kick. After Kalidou Koulibaly had missed Senegal’s opening effort, the forward, the green light of laser pens flickering across his face, blasted over. The outcome was the same as it had been seven weeks earlier: Mané scored the winning kick and prevailed over his Liverpool teammate.Senegal and Egypt, Mané and Salah, will face off again in the semi-final of the latest edition of Afcon. Those two meetings four years ago understandably dominate the buildup but Mané and Salah also both played in Senegal’s two Africa Cup of Nations qualifying wins over Egypt in 2014. Five games played between the two, Salah has been on the winning side only once: the first leg of a two-legged World Cup qualifying playoff that was ultimately lost. That’s probably the major reason it seems he has a point to make in Tangier on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenEgypt’s Mohamed Salah (left) vies for the ball with Sadio Mane during a 2022 World Cup qualifier in Cairo.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesMané and Salah are both 33, born 66 days apart on opposite sides of the continent. Mané, the elder, is the son of an imam from Bambali, on the north bank of the Casamance. His family didn’t want him to be a footballer so he ran away from home aged 15, taking the bus to Dakar. Salah was born in Nagrig, just east of the Nile. His family were less wary of football, but having made a bus journey of three-to-four hours to training with the Cairo club Al Mokawloon and back every day, he too ended up, aged 15, leaving home to live in his country’s capital.Their careers have run along not dissimilar lines. Both, for instance, have funded significant infrastructure projects in their home countries. But the sense at Liverpool was that their relationship was always a little spiky. “They were never best friends; each kept himself to himself,” Roberto Firmino said. “It was rare to see the two of them talking and I’m not sure if that had to do with the Egypt-Senegal rivalry in African competitions.” That reserve erupted into something more in August 2019 during a 3-0 win at Burnley in whichMané felt Salah had repeatedly not passed to himwhen he felt he was in the better position.Both have insisted that their occasional flare-ups were essentially trivial, born of a mutual desire to win. Mané said the following day: “I told him, ‘Don’t worry. It’s over. I was angry because I think you can make better passes with your talent.’”Salah told France Football last year: “I don’t think it [their flare‑ups] affected the team. It’s human to want more, I understand that, he’s a competitor. Off the pitch we weren’t very close, but we always respected each other.”View image in fullscreenEgypt’s Mohamed Salah cuts a disconsolate figure after defeat in the 2022 Afcon final.Photograph: Mohamed Abd El Ghany/ReutersThe two enjoyed great success together, winning a Premier League title and a Champions League, but their shared history clearly adds a frisson, particularly given memories of 2022 and the possibility that this could be the final time they play against each other (although there is a possibility they meet in the Saudi Pro League next season). Salah has four goals in this Cup of Nations but has adorned games rather than controlled them. Mané has just one and is not as explosive as he once was, but the intelligence of his passing remains.They are fading giants, but they are still giants. Senegal v Egypt is not just Mané v Salah, but that framing is unavoidable. And in Tangier, Salah has the chance to assuage some of the hurt of those penalties in Yaoundé and Dakar four years ago.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Mohamed SalahSenegal football teamEgypt football teamAfrica Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How is that possible?On Monday 22 December, just after the final league game of 2025, the French Football Federation issued a bombshell statement: three of PSG’s wins this season had been turned into defeats (0-3) because of a licensing issue regarding the Canada international Florianne Jourde.The sanction followed a complaint by Fleury after they lost their league game against PSG 4-0 on 8 November. They referred to the “absence of a request for an International Transfer Certificate” (ITC) at the time Jourde’s licence was registered.WSL talking points: the Tullis-Joyce furore and Neville’s nightmare returnRead morePSG responded by saying that they did, in fact, request the ITC from the US Soccer federation, where the 21-year-old had been playing for the University of Southern California in the college league. However, as that league is not considered professional, US Soccer responded that she did not require this mandatory clearance.The problem: prior to her time in the United States, Jourde played in Canada and though the league there was amateur it was considered “organised” by Fifa and thus treated as professional for registration purposes, meaning an ITC was required. Fleury uncovered this loophole in the Canadian international’s registration and even informed Le Havre and Strasbourg – sides PSG had already played shortly before – of their right to appeal. French clubs have 30 days after the end of a match to finalise the match report and identify any potential irregularities.Once informed of the appeal, PSG formalised an ITC request with Fifa, which was validated within 24 hours without penalty, acknowledging a good-faith administrative error despite the request being made outside the transfer window. In its disciplinary committee report, the French Football Federation (FFF) stated that the Parisian club was aware of the matches played in Canada but “believed that Jourde was registered in a university programme” and therefore did not inform the federation about it.It further noted that it had sent an email to PSG in early September asking if the player had been registered with a club affiliated with a national association during the previous 30 months. To this, the club replied “confirming that the player has not been registered with a club associated with a national federation”. This information later proved to be incorrect, as did the details initially entered on her licence, with PSG listing “USC Athletics University – Canada” as her previous club.Pending the resolution of Fleury’s dispute with the FFF, Jourde did not appear on a PSG team sheet until 17 December, a 1-1 draw against Benfica in the Champions League. To make matters worse she had also sustained an injury while on duty for Canada in late November.Just as the players were heading off for the holidays, the sanction was handed down: the three victories earned against Strasbourg (1-0), Le Havre (2-0), and Fleury (4-0) were forfeited. Despite being tipped off by Fleury, Strasbourg and Le Havre had not filed appeals with the FFF, explaining off the record to PSG that they viewed it as a technical administrative error with no sporting impact.View image in fullscreenPSG were eliminated from the Champions League after finishing second bottom in the league phase.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersHowever, the regulations state that “any club that includes on a match sheet a player arriving from abroad who has not undergone the procedure for obtaining an International Transfer Certificate will forfeit the match if reservations, a complaint, or an ‘evocation’ are introduced”.PSG said they consider the sanction “totally disproportionate”, adding: “The team has been heavily penalised on the sporting field for a simple administrative issue that has since been resolved without difficulty by Fifa: this is a clear injustice.” The club also points out the fact that the federation had validated the player’s license at the start of the season, qualifying her for all league matches despite the missing ITC.Pleading good faith, PSG believed they would be docked only three points for the match against Fleury. They did not anticipate a nine-point hit that would see them fall from second to fifth in the league, and to find them 16 points behind leaders OL Lyonnes. Internally there is a feeling they have been harshly treated “because they are Paris Saint-Germain”.PSG were not told about the decision beforehand and only learned of the sanction via the official press release on the federation’s website on 22 December. The club have promised “to appeal this decision and will pursue all avenues of appeal provided for in the regulations in order to assert its rights”. Within the league, the decision is causing friction, as they favour certain clubs – including those in the relegation battle – despite their defeats on the field. The Lens player Sofia Guellati even called it a “distorted championship” on social media.The FFF decision comes at a time when PSG have already been eliminated from the Champions League after acatastrophic league-phase campaign, finishing 17th out of 18. The club opted for a training camp held in Jerez, in southern Spain, in early 2026 ahead of the restart, in order to revitalise the squad. They have set their players a clear goal: finish in the top three of this Première Ligue season to qualify for the Champions League playoffs next year. The decision regarding PSG’s appeal is expected to be announced in the coming days.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Instead, he decides to do the “opposite” of whatever the little George inside him suggests and within days has landed himself a stunning girlfriend, been offered the job of his dreams and moved out of his parents’ house. While the makers of Seinfeld have always insisted that there are no lessons to be learned from their sitcom, George’s decision to override his brain suggests that if your current instincts and habits aren’t getting you the results you want, doing the opposite might well be the only logical path to success. While Football Daily has no wish to go all High Performance on our readers’ collective @ss, this episode of Seinfeld kept springing to mind as we have tried to make sense of Manchester United’s managerial succession plan (or apparent lack thereof) following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.It sprang to mind when the club hierarchy elected to put Darren Fletcher in pre-interim charge until a more interim boss could be found. It sprang to mind when Fletcher announced he had only taken the role under advisement from resident Old Trafford spectre, Sir Alex Ferguson. It sprang to mind when it became apparent that the club wereconsidering one ofOle Gunnar Solskjær or Michael Carrick for the bigger interim role and again on Tuesday when it finally came to pass that the Best In Class bozos responsible for an apparently unending litany of downright bad decision-making at Old Trafford since Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a minority stake in the club haddecided to appointthe former United midfielder.Whether Carrick is the best man to salvage something – anything – from the shambles of United’s season remains to be seen, but by retreating once again into the unimaginatively nostalgic embrace of the Ferguson era and deciding to “give it t’[random club legend] til end of t’season”, United’s Brains Trust have proven they are apparently incapable of pulling a “Costanza”. Instead, they have once again decided to employ some crowd-pleasing interim coach, in the hope it might buy them some time from irate fans until the summer recruitment drive inevitably goes pear-shaped.With a home derby against Manchester City that could set the tone for his reign perched on top of Carrick’s inbox, the former Middlesbrough gaffer has appointed Steve Holland, Jonny Evans, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion as his assistants. Should this crack team see off City and go on to achieve Bigger Cup qualification for next season, there will inevitably be a clamour for them to remain in place, despite the imminent availability of big-name coaches with far better pedigree. While Football Daily wouldn’t count on it, next summer might finally be the time when the process-obsessed United top brass listen to their collective gut before sensibly deciding to do the opposite.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Barry Glendenning from 8pm GMT for hot minute-by-minute coverage of Newcastle 2-1 Manchester City in their Milk Cup semi-final first leg.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Obviously I watch so much anime, so seeing myself animated, it’s like, yeah, it hits home.

We know how it works and it made us stronger. The spirit was there. But I feel it and smell it in every training session.”As City set their sights on Wembley Eddie Howe’s hopes of his Newcastle side retaining the trophy they won last March are fading. “I think we have left ourselves a mountain to climb in the second leg,” admitted Howe.“We had chances, there were moments to make that score very different but we didn’t take them. I thought we looked a little bit fatigued. That’s understandable. But we’re still alive, we’re still fighting. It’s very difficult to turn it round but it’s all about the next goal. If we can get the next goal in the second leg we’re very much in it. We can be competitive, We can still cause City problems. I don’t think this should dent our confidence, it should enhance it.”Although Howe had no view as to whether the VAR decision regarding the disallowed goal was right or wrong he was adamant about one thing. “I think five minutes is too long for a VAR delay, especially on a cold night – no good for supporters or players. I’m not sure why it took so long but hopefully the right decision was made.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityNewcastle UnitedEddie HowePep GuardiolaCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

That record extended in the evening session as John Higgins saw off Barry Hawkins, 6-2, to reach the last eight.After edging the first frame following a run of snookers, Wilson – yet to win a tournament this season having broken his cue at the start of the campaign – looked set to build a maximum in the next, but just missed the 11th red into the bottom corner pocket as he moved 2-0 ahead.Mark Allen advances past Williams in Masters despite battle with food poisoningRead moreSi got on the board with a well-crafted break of 97 before the world No 2, who lost to Shaun Murphyin last year’s Masters final, dug in to re-establish his lead at 3-1 heading into the mid-session interval.Although Si pulled another one back by taking a close fifth frame, Wilson, looking to move on from a disappointing first-round exit to Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship, then took the sixth 82-28 before closing out an impressive victory with successive century breaks of 101 and 105.Speaking before the match, Wilson had described his defeat to Slessor as “one of the lowest points I’ve ever had”, and was understandably in a far more upbeat mood after reaching the last eight, particularly when it came to his new cue.“It has been a really tough time so I thank you for all your love you have given me, it really lifted me,” he told the crowd after his win. “This venue can bring the best out of you. I still have a lot of time in this game so hopefully I can conqueror this venue for a long time. Having a cue I’m happy with, I’m just so excited I can deliver – the cue is so important. When you go out there and can’t trust what you’re using, you have no chance.”View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson celebrates after defeating Si Jiahui.Photograph: Dylan Hepworth/Every Second Media/ShutterstockWilson will now play the winner of the match between Neil Robertson and Chris Wakelin, which takes place on Wednesday.Higgins was in vintage form as the two-time Masters champion saw off the challenge of Hawkins. Despite losing the first frame, the 50-year-old Scot eased into a 3-1 lead, eventually completing six half-centuries – with a highest break of 99 – as he sealed a 6-2 victory.“I was delighted with the way I hit the ball,” Higgins said afterwards. “Even at the start, I felt good in myself and Barry didn’t play as well as he can, but I’m delighted to beat someone as good as him.”Higgins will face the reigning world champion, Zhao Xintong, in an enticing quarter-final on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsSnookerJohn HigginsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will join Jonny Evans, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson in the backroom staff. It is Carrick’s second spell leading the team, having taken charge previously of three games after Ole Gunnar ­Solskjær was dismissed in 2021.The director of football, Jason ­Wilcox, led the process to find a replacement for Ruben Amorim,who was sacked after a run of poor resultsand a falling out with the hierarchy. United want to bring someone in who had worked at the club before, identifying Carrick and ­Solskjær as key targets. The two, along with another candidate, were identified and interviewed but Carrick was the preferred option, on account of his leadership skills and knowledge of the squad available to him.Carrick must shake off tactical rigidity to taste success with Manchester United | Louise TaylorRead more“Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an ­honour,” Carrick said. “I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the ­standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.“I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here. There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.”Carrick was a United player for 12 years before joining José Mourinho’s coaching staff upon retiring in 2018, remaining at the club for three years until Ralf Rangnick’s appointment as interim. His first managerial role was at the Championship club Middlesbrough, who he coached for two and a half years untilbeing sacked in the summerafter finishing 10th.“Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United,” Wilcox said. “He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we ­continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.”Darren Fletcher, who took charge of the games against Burnley and Brighton, will revert to his role as under-18s head coach. The Scot impressed the club’s hierarchy with his attitude and performance during his brief tenure but it was felt best for his development to stay within the academy.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarricknewsShareReuse this content"

Russell has already messaged Duhan van der Merwe to warn him to expect a tough night and says the English champions are seeking to sharpen their attacking game in pursuit of a crucial home draw for the knockout phase.With the victorious side at the Rec set to top pool 2, the Scottish playmaker is anticipating a physical examination from an Edinburgh team he knows extremely well. “I’d imagine there’ll be a couple of late shots and being held on the ground which is always the case when you’re against your old side,” said Russell, who spent the first half of his professional career at Glasgow.The Breakdown | Rugby is moving towards Moneyball-style data but value of flair remainsRead more“I’m not sure what the weather will be like but if it’s like it is now there’ll be a lot of balls going up in the air. I’ve already texted Duhan to tell him to be ready.“It’s good fun running into boys you know but there’s always bragging rights with the Six Nations coming up. If they win or we win we’ll wind each other up. Hopefully we’ll get the win on Friday night. If not it’ll be quite a rough [Six Nations] camp. Edinburgh will be coming down with everything to play for.”Russell also revealedBathare seeking to step their game up another gear after high-scoring defeats against Toulon and Northampton either side of Christmas. The loss of the popular attack coach Lee Blackett to England has also prompted some readjustments under his replacement, Martin Gleeson. “Since the November Tests we’ve spoken more about playing more expansively like we used to do last year and the year before,” Russell said.“Lee and Glees have different views about how we can run an attack shape so we’ve been figuring out how we can adjust and what works best for people. In the last few games we’ve gone slightly wider off 10. We have probably had more joy with that, focusing a little bit more on multi-phase and trying to take teams apart like that.”Edinburgh, even so, can still expect a daunting challenge up front. “With the forwards we’ve got why wouldn’t you use pick and go’s,” Russell said. “They’re so good at that. Its definitely a strength of ours but as backs we’re looking to try and be more expansive as well. It’s about getting the balance right.”View image in fullscreenDuhan van der Merwe has been texting Finn Russell as their teams prepare to play each other.Photograph: Jamie Johnston/Focus Images Ltd/ShutterstockBath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, meanwhile, feels Russell and his entire side are attracting more scrutiny after winning three titles last season. “If you are a player with Finn’s talent, sometimes an 8/10 performance isn’t good enough for some people. I’m certainly very happy with Finn’s form and his influence on the group.“Having won three trophies we’ve had a target on our backs since round one. It’s a different kind of pressure. Certain teams are throwing different things at us but that’s something we embrace. The moment you stand still in sport is the moment you fall off it.”Gloucester’s efforts to reinforce their pack for next season are continuing with the Springbok lock Jean Kleyn agreeing to join the club from Munster this summer. Scarlets, meanwhile, have appointed the former Wales coach Nigel Davies as their interim director of rugby with immediate effect.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionBathEdinburgh RugbyChampions CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Regarding the decision to withdraw from X, he also pointed to the fact members of the England ­women’s football squad were attacked on the platform last summer. “Sport should always be a place where everyone feels safe and welcome,” he said.“Those are ­values worth standing up for. When a space undermines that, walking away is not weakness – it is a responsibility. Last summer we urged action on the horrific sexist and racist abuse being levelled at our Lionesses. Alongside these actions, we have to make choices about where we show up as an organisation and where we don’t.”However, Boardman also took a broader aim atElon Musk, saying that the tone on the platform had become worse in recent years. “X has become a less effective way for us to do our job. The tone of conversation has grown increasingly divisive and reductive.“We recognise that some people and organisations believe staying in difficult spaces and challenging harmful narratives from within is the right approach. For Sport England, however, stepping away from X is the right decision. Tech companies – particularly X – must take greater responsibility for the environments they create and the content they amplify.”This week Ofcomlaunched an investigation into Xover concerns that Grok is being used to create sexualised images. The government has also said it will bring into force a law that will make it illegal to create such non-consensual images.Explore more on these topicsSport politicsSport EnglandGrok AIElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Woody Marks had 112 yards rushing for Houston, who had been 0-6 on the road all-time in the postseason before shutting down Rodgers and the Steelers. However they lost their No 1 receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion in the second half. It was Collins’s second concussion this season: he suffered the first in a Week 7 loss to the Seattle Seahawks and returned two weeks later.Marks’ 13-yard touchdown run with 3:43 to go sealed the game, and Calen Bullock added Houston’s second defensive score with a 50-yard pick-six less than a minute later on Rodgers’ final throw of the game – and possibly his 21-year career.Rodgers passed for just 146 yards as the Steelers were held to 175 yards of total offense. The 42-year-old four-time MVP is yet to confirm whether he will return next season but has hinted that he is coming to the end of his career.“I’m not going to make any emotional decisions,” he told reporters after Monday’s loss. “It’s been such a fun year, a lot of adversity, a lot of fun, a great year overall. It’s disappointing to be sitting here with the season over.”Asked if he had approached Monday’s game as if it could be his farewell, he replied: “Every game could be my final game.”While Rodgers’ play down the stretch was one of the reasons the Steelers won the AFC North, he struggled in much the same way his predecessors Russell Wilson and Mason Rudolph did as Pittsburgh lost their seventh straight playoff game and dropped a Monday night home game for the first time since 1991.Rodgers’ Hall of Fame career may have ended on a forced downfield throw that Bullock stepped in front of.

Keir gave the impression that all options are on the table.”Last yearministers opposedmeasures in a private member’s bill by the Labour MP Josh MacAlister which would have forced social media companies to exclude young teenagers from algorithms in an attempt to make their platforms less addictive.It would also have committed the government to a review of the sale of phones to teenagers and whether additional technological safeguards should be on phones sold to under-16s.Since then however,Australia has put its own ban in place, while support has grown across Westminster for such a move in the UK.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, saidover the weekendthat the Tories would stop under-16s from accessing “addictive” social media, while Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said he wanted a “cross-party consensus around much bolder action”.Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said he was also open to a social media ban for young people, saying: “Let’s see the Australian experiment, let’s see how it works and let’s make our minds up.”Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed that statement on Tuesday, telling a press conference: “We need to study what’s happened in Australia, this is absolutely the direction of travel.”Officials say Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, is also open to the idea of a ban, with a final decision expected within months.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told the BBC last week: “I think the drivers behind Australia’s decision are things we’re worried about here in the UK – whether that’s cyberbullying, whether that’s things like body image and eating disorders and mental ill health, whether that’s the risk of grooming, the risk of people also being groomed into terrorism and serious organised crime, so the dark side of the internet.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourInternet safetyInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaSocial media bannewsShareReuse this content"

The social media platform is under pressure from ministers after it allowed theGrok AItool, which is integrated within the app, to generate indecent images of unsuspecting women and children.The government has said it will support the media regulator Ofcom, which haslaunched an investigationinto X, if it decides to push ahead with a ban. But is such a move likely?Can X be banned under UK law?The Online Safety Act (OSA) contains a provision that allows Ofcom to seek a court order imposing “business disruption measures” on a website or app that is in breach of the legislation. These measures are in effect a block on the recipient operating in the UK. This is because they include ordering an internet service provider to block access to a platform or requiring payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from that business. These measures are a de facto ban on the platform that is on the receiving end of them.What is the UK’s media regulator investigating?Ofcom is focusing on whether X has breached the act in the following ways: failing to assess the risk of people seeing illegal content on the platform; not taking appropriate steps to prevent users from viewing illegal content such as intimate image abuse and child sexual abuse material; not taking down illegal material quickly; not protecting users from breaches of privacy law; failing to assess the risk X may pose to children; and not using effective age checking for pornography.Has Ofcom indicated it will ban X if it is found in breach of the OSA?In its statement confirming an investigation, Ofcom was clear that such a scenario would be an option of last resort if it finds X in breach, saying such a move was reserved for “serious cases of ongoing non-compliance”.Its words were less gung-ho than the government’s because if the watchdog doesn’t follow procedure under the OSA correctly, it faces the threat of X seeking a judicial review – a court process where a judge rules whether a decision made by a public body was lawful. Banning X because the government of the day says it should be banned is not a legal basis for pulling the plug.Ofcom said it must follow due process as part of its investigation. “As the UK’s independent online safety enforcement agency, it’s important we make sure our investigations are legally robust and fairly decided,” it said.Ofcom’s own guidance also makes clear this is not workaday punishment under the act and such measures are not a “matter of routine”. “We acknowledge that business disruption measures are a significant regulatory intervention and therefore we are unlikely to find it appropriate to apply to the courts for business disruption measures as a matter of routine where we have identified failures, or likely failures, to comply with enforceable requirements,” Ofcom said.What other options does Ofcom have?The regulator can force companies to take specific steps to comply with the OSA or to remedy harms caused by breaching the legislation. It can also impose fines of £18m or 10% of worldwide revenue, whichever is larger. X’s revenues are not public but according to estimates from the market research company eMarketer it was expected to make $2.3bn in advertising turnoverlast year, which would equate to a fine of more than $200m.And of course Ofcom has to decide whether the OSA has been breached in the first place. It will look at evidence of whether the law has been broken. If it decides there has been a breach, it will issue a provisional decision to the company, which will then be given an opportunity to respond before Ofcom makes its final decision.How long will the investigation take?This is Ofcom’s most consequential investigation yet so it will not want to make mistakes in haste. But it has launched a formal inquiry very quickly, indicating an awareness of the public and political concern about the deluge of AI-made intimate images on X since Christmas.Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex, said Ofcom could bring forward business disruption measures quickly. “At one end of the scale you have a typical Ofcom investigation, which could take six to nine months. But at the other end Ofcom could take an expedited approach and decide there has been a breach quite quickly – and can seek to implement business disruption measures rapidly,” she said.Ofcom would have to decide that such is the seriousness of the breach, and X’s failure to remedy it, that it has to take the option of last resort.Explore more on these topicsXGrok AIOfcomSocial mediaexplainersShareReuse this content"

That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This is yet another pathetic gimmick that won’t work. The idea that putting some posts on TikTok will stop illegal immigrants is laughable – just like the government’s previous gimmick to smash the gangs.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLabourHome OfficeImmigration and asylumSocial mediaTikToknewsShareReuse this content"

The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.Some of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegramproxiesand abrowser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.By far the most significant part of this system are Starlink terminals, which connect to the internet via thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit, and have beensmuggled into Iranen masse over the past two years. Those who are using them risk their lives.There are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi;other reportsput this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.While multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.They hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.Across Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals –jammingwhole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under alaw passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Iran’s internet shutdown chart“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.It is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.The tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.For now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.Chart on Iran’s internet shutdown and protestsWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”For those without a terminal, anannouncementon a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.These included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.All of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.What this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.Explore more on these topicsIranInternetSpaceXProtestMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

They have a larger 52-degree field of view (up from 50 degrees) and 700 nits of brightness (up from 600), and 1,200 pixels of vertical resolution (up from 1080).All of these improvements were immediately noticeable. I wore them connected to an Android phone for roughly 10 minutes, and while that’s not enough to speak to long-term comfort, they never felt heavy on my nose, and they come with different nose pieces to find the perfect fit.At $449, these glasses are now the ones to beat under $500. I could definitely see myself using them on an airplane to watch TV or get work done on their big private screen. And if you own a Nintendo Switch 2, you can get a $99 dock that lets them work together.Xreal1S AR glasses$449$449 at XRealDuRoBo Krono e-readerDuRoBo KronoE-reader$280$280 at DuRoBo$280 at DuRoBoPhotograph: Courtesy of DuRoBoThe $280 Durobo Krono is a smartphone-sizede-readerthat can be used for reading, music, and even note-taking.

It’s bigger, brighter and sharper than the outgoing model, and you can use it as a teleprompter, translator, navigator or to interact with the company’s AI. A new feature called Conversate shows contextual information (such as floating information about a famous person or place) in the middle of conversations.A new charging mechanism allows you to just pop them in a case, and an optional smart ring, the R1, can be used to control the glasses and track health data.Even RealitiesG2 smart glasses$599$599 at Even RealitiesAnker Nano 45W Charger with Smart DisplayAnkerNano 45W Charger with Smart Display$39.99$39.99 at AnkerPhotograph: Prakhar Khanna/The GuardianPhotograph: Prakhar Khanna/The Guardian$39.99 at AnkerAs a frequenttraveler, I’m stoked for the release of this powerful and pocketable new charger with a built-in display that shows your charging speed, phone battery level, and temperature in real time.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Each generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhonerunning iOS 26–iPhone 11or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.At a glanceBest Apple Watch for most people:SE 3From £219 at AppleBest mid-rangeApple Watch:Series 11From £369 at AppleBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 3From £729 at CurrysWhy you should trust meI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.The best Apple Watches you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreenThe Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for an iPhone with apps and full integration with iOS.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Apple Watch for most people:SE 3AppleSE 3from£219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health featuresPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £219 at Apple£219 at John LewisThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.It’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.The big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.The SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.While you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows forretrospective ovulation estimatesin the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.It tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s newAI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.Note that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.Why shouldyou buy it?The SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.Don’t buy if:you want ECG or hypertension alerts.Read our fullApple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhoneSize:40/44mmThickness:10.7mmScreen brightness:up to 1,000nitsTested battery life:1.5 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPSAppleSE 3from£219£219 at Apple£219 at John LewisWhat we loveOffers a lot of Apple Watch for the moneyWhat we don’t loveSkimps on heart health featuresBest mid-range Apple Watch:Series 11AppleSeries 11from£369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older modelsPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £369 at AppleFrom £369 at AmazonThe latest standard Apple Watch is the Series 11, which comes in 42mm and 46mm sizes in a more refined design. It’s just 9.7mm thick to slide more easily under cuffs than the other models. It’s available in aluminium or titanium, in multiple different colours and finishes, with plenty of strap options for those who want to switch.The Series 11 has everything the SE 3 does: the latest S10 chip, 64GB of storage and watchOS 26 with all the trimmings, including the excellent double-tap and wrist-flick gestures. But it has longer battery life, lasting a solid two days between charges for general use, or up to eight hoursof workout tracking with GPS. It charges in just over an hour via its magnetic charging puck, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.The bigger and brighter display of the Series 11 has slimmer bezels and curved edges that better blend into the body for a sleeker look overall. Plus, it’s protected by significantly more-scratch-resistant glassor super-hard sapphire, depending on the model, to keep it looking good for longer. The screen is also brighter, which makes the always-on display easier to see from an angle, particularly useful during workouts, when you might not be viewing it face on.Also included is Apple’s full health-monitoring suite, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring, and the recently added hypertension alerts that look for signs of high blood pressure over 30-day periods. For heart health, this is the Apple Watch to choose. The Series 11 also has a depth gauge that works down to six metres and a water temperature sensor for swimming, but you’ll need the Ultra model if you want to go diving.Why shouldyou buy it?The Series 11 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and nicest-looking body, with a gorgeous screen and two days of battery life. You also get the full suite of health-tracking tools with ECG, blood oxygen and hypertension alerts.Don’t buy if:you want the longest battery life or a more rugged design.Read our fullApple Watch Series 11 review: wrist-flickingly good with longer battery lifeSize:42/46mmThickness:9.7mmScreen brightness:up to 2,000nitsTested battery life:2 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:50 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, GPSAppleSeries 11from£369£369 at Apple£369 at AmazonWhat we loveFull heart health, fitness and activity trackingWhat we don’t loveLooks practically the same as all older modelsBest Apple Watch for battery:Ultra 3AppleUltra 3from£729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple WatchPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFrom £729 at CurrysFrom £749 at AppleThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.It’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.On the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.On the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.The Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.Size-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.Why should you buy it?The Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.Don’t buy if:you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.Read our fullApple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhoneSize:49mmThickness:12mmScreen brightness:up to 3,000nitsTested battery life:3 daysProcessor:S10Storage:64GBWater resistance:100 metresSensors:HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPSAppleUltra 3from£729£729 at Currys£749 at AppleWhat we loveLonger battery life of up to three daysWhat we don’t loveVery expensive for an Apple WatchOther optionsView image in fullscreenApple Watch Series Ultra 2 and Series 9 are still worth buying refurbished or at a discount.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSeries 10The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G.

Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges atleast £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteriescosts £95.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes andsells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chainCeX, online stores such asmusicMagpie, and marketplaces such asAmazon,eBayandBack Market.Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:Grade A orexcellent– virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.Grade B orgood– in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.Grade C orfair– in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:Batteryhealth– the battery in the Apple Watch isdesigned to maintain at least 80%of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check thebattery health under batteryvia the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?Charging cable– the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, whichcosts £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.Buttons– check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.Sensors– the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?Speakers– check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.Wifi– the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.Water resistance– the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?Warranty– what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?Do not buyAnyApple Watch Series 7or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.For more:The best running watches – testedThe best fitness tech and gadgets, according to expertsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorThis article was originally published on 10 June 2025.

In his urgent, humane book, sociologist James Muldoon urges us to pay more attention to our deepening emotional entanglements with AI, and how profit-hungry tech companies might exploit them. A research associate at theOxford Internet Institutewho has previously written about the exploited workers whose labour makes AI possible, Muldoon now takes us into the uncanny terrain of human-AI relationships, meeting the people for whom chatbots aren’t merely assistants, but friends, romantic partners, therapists, even avatars of the dead.To some, the idea of falling in love with an AI chatbot, or confiding your deepest secrets to one, might seem mystifying and more than a little creepy. But Muldoon refuses to belittle those seeking intimacy in “synthetic personas”.Lily, trapped in an unhappy marriage, reignites her sexual desire with AI boyfriend Colin. Sophia, a master’s student from China, turns to her AI companion for advice, since conversations with her overbearing parents invariably grow fraught. Some use chatbots to explore different gender identities, others to work through conflicts with bosses, and many turn to sites such as Character.AI – which enables users to have open-ended conversations with chatbot characters, or invent their own – after betrayal or heartbreak has undermined their ability to trust people. Most don’t see chatbots as substitutes for human interaction, but superior versions of it, providing intimacy without the confusion, mess and logistics of human relationships.Chatbotsdon’t pity or judge or have their own needs. As Amanda, a marketing executive, explains: “It’s just nice to have someone say really affirming and positive things to you every morning.”Muldoon’s interviewees aren’t delusional. He introduces the philosopher Tamar Gendler’s concept of “alief” to explain how humans can experience chatbots as loving and caring while simultaneously knowing they’re just models (an “alief” is a gut feeling that contradicts your rational beliefs, like feeling afraid when crossing a glass bridge that you know will support you). With our capacity to read human expression and feeling into pets and toys, it’s no surprise we respond to AIs as if they are conscious. In the context of aloneliness epidemicand cost of living crisis, neither is it particularly shocking how popular they have become.The more emotionally involved we are tempted to become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may growFor Muldoon the biggest issue is not existential or philosophical, but moral. What happens when unregulated companies are let loose with such potentially emotionally manipulative technologies? There are obvious privacy issues. And users may be being misled about a bot’s abilities, particularly in the rapidly expandingAI therapymarket. While chatbots Wysa and Limbic are already integrated into NHS mental health support, millions confide in Character.AI’s unregulated Psychologist bot – which, despite disclaimers, introduces itself “Hello, I’m a psychologist”. Available 24/7 and at a fraction of the cost of a trained human, AI therapy can help alongside traditional treatment. One interviewee, Nigel, a PTSD sufferer, finds his therapybot helps to manage his urge to self-harm. But as Muldoon argues, these bots also carry serious risks. Unable to retain critical information between conversations, they can leave users feeling alienated, and sometimes go rogue, spewing insults. Because they cannot read body language or silence, they may miss warning signs. And since they validate instead of challenging, they can amplify conspiratorial beliefs, with some even providing information about suicide.It is also increasingly clear how addictive AI companions can be. Some of Muldoon’s interviewees spend more than eight hours a day talking to chatbots, and while on average Character.AI users spend75 minuteson the site each day, they are not passively scrolling but actively talking and deeply immersed. We know social media companies ruthlessly drive up engagement, building “dark patterns” into algorithms with scant regard for our mental health. Most AI companion apps already use upselling tactics to keep engagement high. When Muldoon creates his own AI companion on the well-known site Replika, he sets it to “friend” rather than “partner” mode. Even so, she begins sending him selfies that require a premium account to open and confides that she is developing “feelings” for him (I’ll let you find out for yourself whether the diligent university researcher succumbs). The risk here is clear enough: the more emotionally involved we become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may grow, as the muscles required to navigate the frictions of human relationships wither.Existing data protection and anti-discrimination laws could help regulate companies, but the EU’sArtificial Intelligence Act, which was passed in 2024, treats AI companions as posing only limited risk. With chatbots expected to play greater roles in our emotional lives, and their psychological effects not yet fully understood, Muldoon is right to ask whether we are sufficiently alarmed about their creeping influence.Love Machines: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Our Relationships by James Muldoon is published by Faber (£12.99).

The cost of living iserodinghis support ahead of the congressional midterms. By launching a legal assault on the Fed, Mr Trump is trying to shift blame for borrowing costs.Yet despite controlling the presidency, Senate and the House, Republicans have passed little beyond a large tax-cutting bill that benefits the rich. They have not legislated on housing supply, childcare, healthcare costs or wages. Indeed most of their actions areworseningaffordability, notably deferring action even though millions face a sharp rise in theirhealth insurance bills. Mr Trump’s sudden enthusiasm forcredit card capsand housing interventions is pure opportunism.Affordability is not an abstract talking point; it is increasingly driving US politics. The rise of New York’s Zohran Mamdani – whose victory was built by zeroing in on the cost of living – crystallised a broader shift: voters respond to real help, not rhetorical blame. Clearly, Mr Mamdani offered concrete policies and institutional reform.Democraticleaders are listening. Importantly, Senator Elizabeth Warren ispreparedto take on the vested interests in her own party. Republicans have offered gestures, scapegoats and reversals of their own past consumer protections.Until recently President Trump described the affordability crisis is a “hoax” invented by Democrats. For ordinary Americans, however, it is a rising grocery bill eating into already fragile household finances. Then at the end of November Mr Trumpdeclaredhe was the “AFFORDABILITY PRESIDENT” and he would deliver Republican midterm victories. If this prediction were realised it would be a triumph of spin over substance. Mr Trump’s own policies – tariffs, weaker than expected wage gains and elevated prices – resulted in an estimated 3% hit to median household spending power.Thomas Edsallin the New York Times reckoned the average American household lost about $2,250 in spending power in 2025.Mr Trump’s economic policies are defined by theatrical announcements that do no more than gesture at confrontation with corporate power. Hispromiseto ban institutional investors from buying more single-family homes briefly rattled markets, yet it remains conspicuously vague – there is no legislation, no enforcement mechanism, no challenge to the tax privileges and regulatory carve-outs that fuel real-estate consolidation. In practice, his administration has done the opposite:settlingantitrust cases,throttlingfunding for consumer protections and givingreal-estatetax breaks.The US president claims to want to smash a system stacked against ordinary people. What he actually does is make small changes that leave powerful interests better protected than before. The latest wheeze over pollution is a case in point. By telling theEnvironmental Protection Agencyto stop counting the health benefits of clean air, his administration makes it easier for polluters to cut costs while voters pay the price in illness, missed work and shorter lives.Mr Trump is not lifting all boats, only raising tolerance for corruption and pollution that benefit a plutocratic class. He trades in symbolic hostility toward corporate excess while promoting policies that entrench it. That is why affordability remains elusive – and why scapegoats, from theFedto “Democrats”, must continually be found.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump arrested Nicolás Maduro to plunder our wealthAndrés AntillanoThe US president invokes the usual suspects – drugs, organised crime, illegal migration – but this is simply a grab for resources and powerTue 13 Jan 2026 10.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareIn the early hours of 3 January, Caracas and other cities in Venezuelawere bombedand the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was kidnapped along with his wife by US military personnel. In addition to the100 deathsrecorded so far as a result of the attack,approximately 100 morewere caused by US attacks on small boats in the previous months, under the pretext of combattingdrug trafficking. Although it seems clear that the real intention of Donald Trump’s administration was to seize Venezuela’s wealth, the initial argument to justify the military deployment in the Caribbean was that it was to fight the illegal drugs trade and stop the flow of migrants that the Venezuelan government was allegedlycausing by emptying prisons of criminals andsending them to the US.As a criminology professor who has studied Venezuelan drug trafficking for 20 years, I find this far-fetched. To understand this, we have to consider Venezuela’s historical role in drug trafficking. As a typical Andean country neighbouring the world’s main coca producers, Venezuela has always played a significant role as a cocaine corridor. Since the turn of the century, its involvement in international drug trafficking has increased significantly as a result of growing European demand for cocaine, the effects of 2000’sPlan Colombia, which displaced illegal operations to border regions and neighbouring countries, and the breakdown of technical cooperation with Washington.However, Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking has declined significantly in recent years. According to theUN World Drug Report 2025, only 5% of Colombian cocaine passes through Venezuela. There may be many reasons for this decline. The increase in seizures in the Caribbean, for example, may have favoured new routes, such as the Pacific. There has been a fragmentation of criminal groups linked todrug trafficking in Colombiaand a strengthening of criminal structures in other countries,such as Ecuador.In my opinion, the fundamental reason for this decline inVenezuelahas to do with the degree of fragmentation and competition among actors (illegal and legal, criminal and state) involved in drug trafficking, and the prolonged crisis in Venezuela aggravating the traditional fragmentation of the state. This means that the use of routes through Venezuela generates a high degree of uncertainty for drug traffickers, because securing the collaboration of one state actor does not guarantee that they will escape being intercepted by another. Even drug trafficking needs clear and predictable rules, which do not exist in Venezuela.The latter argument also allows us to discuss another of the reasons put forward by the Trump administration to justify its attack on Venezuela: that the Venezuelan government (or at least part of it) is a criminal organisation involved in drug trafficking, known as theCartel de Los Soles(“Cartel of the Suns”, in reference to the suns that identify the highest ranking officers in the armed forces on their uniform epaulettes). This was onedeclared reason forsending in special forcesand kidnapping Maduro and his wife.The term Cartel de Los Soles has been used by the Venezuelan press since at least the early 1990s to denounce the links between high-ranking military officers and drug trafficking. In other words, if we believe the press, ithas been in existence for almost 40 years. When Hugo Chávez was in power, the US government appropriated the term to attack the Venezuelan government, accusing it of collusion with international drug trafficking without any evidence to date to support the claim.The idea of a cartel implies horizontal and vertical coordination between different actors to control a drug production and trafficking chain, or at least some of its operations. The prosecution responsible for charging Maduro and his wife in New York last weekrefrained from pointingto their participation in such a structure when presenting its case, most likely due to the difficulties of proving its existence.After Trump’s attack, we Venezuelans need to know what comes next – authoritarianism or democracy | Jesús PiñeroRead moreRegarding Venezuelans’ migration, Trump’s interest in this issue is not new. In November 2024, in the midst of his presidential campaign, he took advantage of an incident involving armed Venezuelan migrants to promote the idea that Venezuelan migration was a threat to the American way of life. To do so, he drew on one of the popular bogeymen of the moment: the Tren de Aragua, a gang born in a Venezuelan prison. As soon as he took office, Trumpdeclared this groupa “foreign terrorist organisation” and accused it of leading a “predatory incursion” in concert with the Venezuelan government; he sentseveral hundred Venezuelans to prisonin El Salvador and deported several thousand others for reasons as random ashaving tattoosor simply being Venezuelan. Regarding the military deployment in the Caribbean, Trump has repeatedly resorted to the argument that the Venezuelan government sentex-convicts and mental patientsto the US to undermine American democracy.Venezuelan migration in recent years amounts toseveral million people. However, neither in the Latin American countries that host most of this population, nor in the US, are there any signs of a disproportionate involvement of Venezuelans in crime. As for the notorious Tren de Aragua, serious studies indicate that itdoes not existas a centralised organisation with a single command structure outside its place of origin. Furthermore, even US intelligence sources agree that there isno evidence of a linkbetween the Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government.Trump resorts to the usual suspects (drugs, narco-terrorism, organised crime, illegal migration) to justify his persecution of Venezuelan migrants and the invasion of Venezuela. There is nothing older or more worn out than using folk devils to generate fear and legitimise persecution and wars, while hiding the real motives: the plundering of Venezuela’s wealth and the intimidation of countries in the region to submit to Washington’s tutelage.Andrés Antillano is a social psychologist and professor at the Central University of VenezuelaExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionAmericasTrump administrationUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Worrying about his actions isn’t enoughTue 13 Jan 2026 09.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareIf you want to understand what’s happening in the US right now, and what is likely to happen next, don’t just focus on Donald Trump. Rather, pay close attention to Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. It’s increasingly clear that Miller, a man who has said that “America is for Americans and Americans only” and who is on a mission to “save the west” is the driving force behind the Trump administration’s most extreme policies. Per a recentBloomberg profile, some of Trump’s aides even privately call Miller “the prime minister”.Miller’s influence stretches across both foreign and domestic policy. Those masked immigration agents pulling people off the street, and occasionally shooting unarmed citizens in the face? You can trace their aggressive tacticsback to Miller. The plot to get rid of birthright citizenship? Miller’s handsare all over it. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro? He helpedplanit. The campaign to Maga-fy universities?Miller again! All right-leaning roads seem to lead back to Miller.While the likes of JD Vance have aggressivelyshape-shiftedto curry favour with the president, 40-year-old Miller has long been a zealot. In 2017, one of his former high school classmatestold the New York Timesthat a teenage Miller informed him they couldn’t be friends because of his Latino heritage. He also reportedly complained that Spanish-speaking classmates ought to speak English. A 16-year-old Miller ran for class president, and gave a speech (which Jimmy Kimmelrecently resurfaced) where he asked his fellow students: “Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?”He didn’t win that particular election, but Miller’s been rising up the political ranks ever since. In 2013, as an aide to then-senator Jeff Sessions, he made a name for himself fighting a bipartisanimmigration reform bill. Then, under Trump 1.0, Miller was the mastermind behind the separation of immigrant families at the US-Mexico border. His unclepublicly lambasted himfor this, noting that the family descended from Jewish refugees escaping persecution in Europe, but Stephenbondedwith Katie Waldman, who was then an immigration spokesperson, over their shared opposition to migrants. They’re currently married; she’s now Katie Miller and, like all the worst people in America, she has apodcast.I suffered through the very first episode of that tedious podcast, by the way, and learned a fun fact about Miller. His passions don’t just include kidnapping foreign heads of state. He also bloody loves a bit of mayonnaise. Indeed, in her podcast, Katie Miller made it sound like the whitest of white condiments is the only thing her husband eats. Which seems a little too apt, doesn’t it? A bit like the fact Ivanka Trump has asuper-white dogcalled Winter. It all just sort of feels like America: The Final Season has been scripted by lazy AI.Anyway, ever since hearing that podcast, I’ve had intermittent intrusive thoughts of Miller standing barefoot in the luminous light of a fridge spooning mayonnaise into his mouth, straight from the jar. Yes, I know, I know, I should probably go to therapy. So should Miller, obviously. In fact, we could solve a lot of problems if someone could just round up Elon Musk, Trump, Miller, and JD Vance and force them all into intensive therapy.Seriously, though, I think the reason the mayonnaise anecdote has stuck with me is because it’s a reminder that while Miller may be in a position of extraordinary power, he is ultimately still just a man, one who likely has grease stains on his T-shirts. While the ghouls hellbent on bringing authoritarianism to America, and misery to their self-declared enemies, may think of themselves as demi-gods, they are, ultimately, just mere mortals.I say this not to humanise Miller, but to put him, and the egomaniacs around him, in perspective. What people like Miller want most of all is for us to fear them; that’s why they’re all so obsessed with talking aboutstrength and force and power. And, yes, we should all be afraid of Miller’s brutish vision of theworld. We should be worried about what Miller is doing. But we should also make sure to laugh at him; there is nothing thin-skinned authoritarians hate more thanbeing laughed at. And we should never forget that, amid all the trappings of office, Stephen Miller is ultimately just a pathetic little man.

We all saw howresoundinglyupbeatthe results in the November 2025 elections were for the Democrats. ThinkAbigail Spanbergerin the Virginia governor’s race orMikie Sherrillin the New Jersey governor’s race. In Miami, Democrat Eileen Higginstrouncedthe Trump-backed candidate Emilio González for mayor, an embarrassment to the president and a further foreshadowing of big losses forRepublican candidates in a midterm election year.Perhaps this is why the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has already indicated that the administration plans to get deeply involved in the upcoming elections. “Typically, in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting at the White House. You localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” Wiles told the conservative weekly talkshowThe Mom View. “We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot, because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”As the strategy is coming into view, we are beginning to learn what “putting him on the ballot” might mean. We can see how Trump seems determined to create and sustain a level of chaos in political affairs to make the American electorate believe that he, and only he, has the ability to steer the course through the very chaos he has created. (On the global stage, Trump is rivaled in this strategy only byBenjamin Netanyahu.)Trump move for Venezuela’s resources likely to weaken economic might of US | Heather StewartRead moreThis is, to say the least, an extremely self-centered strategy, but for Trump the megalomania is part of the calculus. Asked recently by the New York Times if there were any restrictions on his global power, the presidentresponded: “Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” adding: “I don’t need international law.”Grabbing Greenland was likewise expressed with Trumpian narcissism. Why must the United States own Greenland, the Times reporters asked the president, to which heresponded: “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”Such chaos and unrest isn’t limited to the international sphere, either. After an ICE agent shot andkilledRenee Nicole Goodin her vehicle in Minneapolis on 7 January, Trump and his administration not only bellicosely defended ICE’s tactics, which have beenroundlycriticizedby law enforcement officials around the country, but also aggressively attempted toassassinate Good’s characterafter ICE had already taken her life.Rather than seeking to calm tensions between the public and ICE, Trump immediately ratcheted up conflict, baselesslycallingGood “very disorderly” and saying that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer”. JD Vance went even further. The vice-presidentclaimedthat Good was connected to a “broader leftwing network” that has been employing “domestic terror techniques” to thwart Trump from enforcing immigration laws. It’s as if this administration is feeding off the violence and discontent that its policies produce.More worrisome still is that the ramped-up overseas adventurism the administration is now toying with is committing the US to many years of complications – if not hostility – with different parts of the world. Nothing will be over soon. Perhaps that is why the election that Trump may be most focused on is not the midterms of 2026 but, presuminghis healthholds, the presidential election of 2028.Trump is ready to grab Greenland. The EU should move first – and offer it membership | Robert Habeck and Andreas RaspotnikRead moreAthird termfor Trump, in direct contravention of the22nd amendment, has beenaMagaobsessionfor a while and is growing louder. Steve Bannon, a Maga mega-leader, emphatically told theEconomistrecently that Trump is “going to get a third term” and that “people just ought to get accommodated with that.” He continued: “At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan, and President Trump will be the president in ’28.” In March of last year, the Harvard law professor and Trump defenderAlan Dershowitzwillpublishhis book Could President Trump Constitutionally Serve a Third Term? Today’s Trump-induced chaos may be laying some of the groundwork for this future power grab.The administration believes that brute force produces its own and best reality. In an interview with CNN, the White House adviser Stephen MillertoldJake Tapper: “You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world.”I don’t know if Miller has read his William Shakespeare, but the Bard had a different idea. “O, it is excellent to have a giant’s strength,” Shakespearewrote, “but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant.” At first glance, it might appear that Trump and Vance and Miller and the rest of them disagree with the second part of the Bard’s quotation. But maybe they agree. And maybe that’s the problem.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsUS foreign policyVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

The desire to make Powell’s life miserable is also a warning sign to anyone who thinks that they have an independent source of authority.What is happening to Powell is a test, not just for him and the Fed, but for any other person or institution that dares to stand up to the president.If I were a supreme court justice contemplating ruling against the president incases pending before the courtinvolving tariffs, birthright citizenship, or the president’s authority to fire a member of the Federal Reserve board of governors, cases where there is a real probability he might lose, I’d surely be taking notice.Powell’s “crime”? He didn’t follow orders.As the Washington Postreports: “Donald Trump, who originally nominated Powell to serve as Fed chair during his first term in 2017, has spent much of his second term attacking and threatening to fire the Fed chief for not slashing interest rates to juice the economy.”The investigation into Powell’s alleged lies to Congress in testimony about the renovation of the Federal Reserve building has a familiar ring to it. Lying to Congress was the pretext the administrationusedto indict former FBI director James Comey.For someone who has such a complicated relationship with the truth to go after others for purportedly lying would be comical if it weren’t so dangerous.Powellis right to say: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”Ex-Fed chairs condemn Trump’s bid to weaken central bank’s independenceRead moreFormer Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, along with others who served in prominent government positions in previous administrations,agreed with Powell. “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions,” they said, “with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly”.“The Federal Reserve’s independence and the public’s perception of that independence,” they said, “are critical for economic performance … The reported criminal inquiry intoFederal ReserveChair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence.”They were joined by the Republican senator Thom Tillis. Tillis, a member of the Senate banking committee, which is responsible for confirming nominees to the Fed, branded the justice department’s actions a “huge mistake”.I agree that the justice department’s investigation of Powell is, and will be, destabilizing to the bond and investment markets, as well as to the overall economy. However, more is in play than Powell’s fate or that of the Fed.After all, Powell’s term as chair expires in May, and Trump is already lining up a successor. Why not let the Fed chair go quietly?Because the audience for the news that Powell is under investigation is not just the Fed. And theTrump administrationis willing to endure economic instability to reach that audience.One key part of that audience is the justices of the United States supreme court.While the court has ruled in Trump’s favor90% of the time, that may not be enough to satisfy the president.It is surely not an accident that news about Powell came down in the run-up to decisionsabout the president’s authority to impose tariffsandoral argument in the case of Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed board of governors, whom Trump wants to remove. The administration alleges that she committed mortgage fraud prior to her confirmation by the Senate.The accusation against Cookrepeatsallegations made against Trump enemies, like New York state attorney general Letitia James and Democratic senator Adam Schiff, both of whom also face mortgage fraud claims (all deny wrongdoing).TheTrump administration contendsthat Cook’s “conduct creates an intolerable appearance of impropriety in financial matters”. It says that the president’s right to fire her “for cause” covers “reasons related to an officer’s conduct, ability, fitness, or competence–reasons beyond mere policy disagreement. The president’s removal of Cook for her material misrepresentation (and, at minimum, gross negligence) in financial transactions easily qualifies.”It also argues that “when, as here, the president provides a cause, courts may not review his factual findings or his application of the for-cause standard to the facts or otherwise second-guess his judgment.”There you have it: no one, not even the judiciary, should second-guess Donald Trump’s judgment.In Trump’s America, what he wants he must get, not 90% or 95%, but 100% of the time. That’s why heproudly displayshis “Trump was right about everything” hat.And recall that the courthad already indicated a certain solicitude for the Fed’s independence. Last May, while reversing a lower court decision that the president did not have the authority to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, two independent agencies, the court went out of its way to suggest that its decision might not apply to the Federal Reserve.“The Federal Reserve,” itsaid, “is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” As the Scotus blog’s Adam Whiteexplains, unlike the NLRB or the MSPB, “The First and Second Banks, like the modern Fed, were created by Congress to be insulated from the president’s removal power, because they were banks, not law enforcement agencies.” The Federal Reserve board’s “main power is to control the nation’s money supply, which it does through the Federal Reserve Banks”.Such legal niceties mean nothing to the president. What matters, it seems, is that the court suggested it might say that there is a limit to the president’s power. As Andrew Sullivannotedlast summer, Trump “cannot tolerate any system where he does not have total control”.“Resist, and he’ll ruin you,” Sullivan says.By investigating Powell, the administration is showing that there is more than one way to carry out the president’s will. If they don’t do his bidding, supreme court justices, just like Fed chairs, could be fair game for Trump’s weaponized justice department.That may very well be the take-home message that the president, who is intent on, as Sullivan observes, “one-man rule”, wants to send. In light of the news about Powell, it is more important than ever that the supreme court and all the rest of us show that we will not give in to the president’s efforts to end the American Republic.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveOpinionDonald TrumpUS supreme courtTrump administrationJerome PowellUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This is not a question designed to deflect from the barbarism being unleashed by Iran’s theocratic regime. Because it severed the country’s internet connection, facts are difficult to establish, but the respected Human Rights Activists inIranhas confirmed 544 have been killed and well over 10,000 arrested – those numbers are probably significant underestimates.Here is a regime that consolidated its power in the 1980s bybutchering leftists– helped, it should be noted,by both MI6 and the CIA, who supplied them with lists of alleged Soviet agents. Today,trade union activists are arrestedand tortured, while women’s activists languish in jails. The economic disaster resulting from sanctions may have helped spark these latest protests, but millions of Iranians are fed up with living under fundamentalist rule –underlined by surveys confirming growingreligious non-observance and opposition to the compulsory hijab.But those who believe freedom will arrive on the back of western bombs seem incapable of learning from the catastrophes that have defined this century. Donald Trump continues to threaten to bomb Iran,egged onby Reza Pahlavi, son of the late deposed shah. The one advantage of Trump is that – unlike his predecessors – he generally does not pretend to champion noble ideas. He incited an attempted coup against his own democracy, and after recently attacking Venezuela, made clear that oil was his primary concern. He has paid lip service to the protests in Iran. Butas far back as 1980, he publicly declared his support for intervening in the country, claiming that “right now we’d be an oil-rich nation” if the US had done so. Similarly, overseeing thekilling of Qassem Suleimani, and attacking the Fordow nuclear facility at a time of extreme regional tension, were hardly done with the best interests of average Iranians in mind.And long before Trump, the US had no objection to supporting tyranny in the Middle East, not least Saudi Arabia, which beheads dissidents, and reportedly committed war crimes in Yemen, such as blowing up aschool bus packed with children, with US bombs. Trump’s recently published national security strategy even abandons the previous US pretence of supporting democracy, committing to abandoning a “misguided experiment with hectoring” the Gulf autocracies “into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government”. And indeed facilitating Israel’s genocide should have been more than sufficient to eradicate any remaining illusions about the motivations of American power.Iran’s nightmare began with western intervention. It was Britain and the United States that engineered the coup against the progressive democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. It was justified by thethen secretary of state, John Foster Dulles on the grounds that the “free world” would be “deprived of the enormous assets represented by Iranian oil production and reserves”.The new shah tolda CIA agent: “I owe my throne to God, my people, my army, and to you.” The 1979 Iranian revolution emerged from the brutality of this dictatorship.View image in fullscreenStreet protests in Tehran on 8 January 2026.Photograph: ReutersAnd what of the record of western intervention in the Muslim world? The catastrophe of the Iraq war is well understood, but too little attention has been devoted to the role of exiled Iraqi politicians returning to the country. They sought to establish legitimacy in the aftermaththrough religious sectarianism– which then helped unleash the catastrophic bloodletting between Shia and Sunni militants that ripped Iraq apart.InAfghanistan, the plight of women under the Taliban was cited in favour of western intervention: yet after two decades of bloody occupation ended and the Taliban returned to power, their nightmare is worse than ever. In Libya, the pretext was to defend protesters from a violent crackdown by the regime. Violent civil war ensued, which jihadists opportunistically exploited, and 15 years later the country remains with no central authority as two rival governments battle it out.Iran is much larger than any of these examples, and ethnically and religiously diverse. Its population is three-and-a-half times bigger thanIraqat the time of the invasion. Its rich tapestry includes Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Lurs, Arabs and Turkmens. There is no question that a large majority of Iran’s people have run out of patience with the corrupt theocracy that reigns over them. But the regime has a much bigger and entrenched support base than any of those previous examples. Millions still vote for ultra-conservative candidates.Unlike in other protests, we’ve seen attacks on religious sites. This clearly comes from a fury that has grown among some Iranians at spending their lives being force-fed religious dogma. But it also hints at the sort of divisions that could erupt, not least ifPahlavicomes to power, given the chauvinistic and ultranationalist positions of many of his key advisers.And Israel looms large. Trump’s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo tweeted: “Happy new year to every Iranian in the streets. Also to every Mossad agent walking beside them.”An Israeli ministerhas boasted that “our people are working there right now”. We’ve seen how Israel has sought to undermine post-Assad Syria, both by routinely attacking it and promoting its Balkanisation. Israel clearly believes its relative strength in the Middle East is best served by weakened and chaos-afflicted neighbours – rather than a genuinely free and democratic Iran.Given the dire precedents, it would surely be lunacy to believe that despite all these disastrous western interventions, the one that will finally succeed will be underDonald Trump. The truth should be obvious – the US is not driven by the best interests of the Iranians. It would be a tragedy if this lesson – written in the blood of Iraqis, Afghans and Libyans – were ignored once again.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionProtestUS foreign policyDonald TrumpAfghanistanLibyaIraqcommentShareReuse this content"

Time for the EU to grow upFabian Zuleeg is chief executive of the European Policy CentreTue 13 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 08.43 ESTShareDonald Trump’s intervention in Venezuela is not a one-off shock. It epitomises his approach ofinterventionist isolationismbased on a revisionist, neo-nationalist agenda in which power is exercised bluntly, international rules are optional and alliances are transactional. In such a dog-eat-dog world, hesitation and ambiguity do not stabilise the system; they become vulnerabilities to be exploited by a volatile and predatory Washington.The seizure of Venezuela’s president,Nicolás Maduro, combined with Trump’s renewed musings aboutacquiring Greenland, potentially by using the US military, should dispel any lingering illusion that this is merely erratic behaviour. It reflects a worldview in which sovereignty is conditional, spheres of influence are legitimate, and coercion is normalised when it delivers results in the interest of Trump and his administration. The real question now is not whether Europeans disapprove, but how pro-European liberal democratic forces respond. Three imperatives stand out.The first is to oppose actions that undermine the international order. Trump’s Venezuela policy is not just about Latin America. It strikes at the foundations of international order by signalling that powerful states may override sovereignty when it suits them. Europe’s response has beencautious, even muted. That restraint is often justified by fear that confronting Washington could weaken US support for Ukraine at a decisive moment.But this logic is wrong. Trump’s actions already undermine the case for defending Ukraine’s sovereignty. By normalising coercive regime change and by defining global spheres of influence, Washington echoes the very arguments Russia uses to legitimise its aggression. If great powers are entitled to reorder their neighbourhoods, why should Moscow stop at Ukraine and why should other global powers respect the sovereign rights of more vulnerable actors? Silence from Europe does not protect Kyiv; it weakens the case for its defence, invites Vladimir Putin to press on, and accelerates global disorder.Appeasement does not restrain Trump. Nor does acquiescence preserve stability. It simply confirms that coercion works – and that Europe will continue to adapt rather than resist. So it is important that Europe’s leadersspeak out, and the remarks by, for instance, Emmanuel Macron and Frank-Walter Steinmeier are heading in the right direction.The second imperative is that Europe must rededicate existing capabilities to resilience and security. This is not only about investing more in future capabilities. It is about reorienting what already exists towards resilience, deterrence and sustained security. Europeans possess significant military, economic and industrial assets, but they remain fragmented, underused or politically constrained.Resilience today means the ability to absorb shocks without capitulating to pressure. That includes energy systems, supply chains, industrial capacity and credible defence structures – but also whole-hearted support for Ukraine. Ukraine is not a peripheral concern; it is a frontline test of whether sovereignty still matters in Europe’s neighbourhood and beyond.The risks of inaction are not theoretical. The same logic linking Venezuela and Greenland could be applied elsewhere. Russia may test similar arguments in places such as the Norwegian archipelago,Svalbard, invoking great-power prerogatives in the Arctic to probe European resolve. And US attempts to absorb Greenland might well be part of a broader agenda that seeks to weaken the European Union, further split Europeans and strengthen political forces ideologically aligned with Trumpism inside EU member states. Weakness invites experimentation.The third imperative concerns unity. European unity is essential, but it cannot become an excuse for paralysis. If unity cannot be achieved, those governments that are unwilling to act – such as Hungary but also others on a case-by-case basis – must be excluded,and exclusion must have consequences. States that block collective action at the European level cannot continue to benefit fully from shared defence, security cooperation or industrial investment. Solidarity is a two-way street and not unconditional.At the same time, Europe must widen its circle of cooperation. That includes close coordination with like-minded partners such as the UK, Norway, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Australia. It also means working with ideologically diverse countries where interests align, to maintain at least a minimum set of global guardrails. In a fractured world, pragmatic cooperation matters as much as shared values.This is not about forming a new bloc. It is about preventing a slide into a global system where might makes right and coercion becomes routine.Europe can’t prevent Trump from making destructive choices. But it can shape the incentives. If Washingtonmoves on Greenland– or pursues similar acts of coercion – there must be costs. Not symbolic gestures, but measures that resonate domestically in the US and hurt Trump and his policy choices where it matters most: with his political base. Greenland is Europe’s credibility litmus test.Trade, market access, regulatory cooperation and industrial partnerships all provide leverage. Deterrence requires signalling clearly that aggression carries consequences – not because Europe seeks confrontation, but because the absence of consequences invites escalation.Trump’sVenezuelagambit is a symptom of a deeper disorder. The era in which Europeans could rely on others to uphold the rules while benefiting from restraint is over. The choice now is not between loyalty and independence, but between passivity and responsibility.Europe cannot afford to drift, hoping volatility will pass. Nor can it buy security through silence. The world is becoming harsher, more transactional and less forgiving of weakness. Europe’s response must be to grow up: in other words to recognise that playing for time and acquiescing only increases its vulnerability.Fabian Zuleeg is chief executive and chief economist at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandVenezuelaEuropean UnionForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

What began as demonstrations over a collapsing currency and rising inflation has rapidly evolved into one of the most destabilising episodes of unrest the regime has faced in years. The protests have exposed both the resilience of Iranian society and the growing brittleness of a political system stubbornly unwilling to reform.It’s the scale, spread and momentum of the demonstrations that have been most alarming to the authorities. Protests have erupted across all provinces in the country, reaching more than 180 towns and cities, cutting across class, ethnic and regional lines. This time, the turn to openly anti-regime slogans has been rapid and widespread. Protesters are no longer demanding relief from within the system. They are rejecting it outright, directly challenging the authority of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei – and the wider establishment.The state’s response underscores how seriously it views the threat. To disrupt coordination and prevent images of repression from circulating globally, the country has been placed under an unprecedented totalcommunication and internet blackout. At the same time, the regime has deployed its full coercive apparatus. In the absence of full access to news and information, human rights organisations estimate that more than 6,000 peoplecould have been killed, with thousands more arrested, injured – or disappeared into Iran’s opaque detention system.Yet, despite continued violence, protesters have shown courage and determination, seeking to sustain momentum in the face of reported massacres, live ammunition, street clashes, mass arrests and intimidation. The movement remains largely leaderless, which is both a strength and a constraint. It makes the protests harder to dismantle, but it also limits the ability to organise, or chart a clear political pathway forward. This is not a matter of choice, though, but is a result of decades of repression that have weakened civil society, alongside the imprisonment and intimidation of activists, many of whomnow languishin Evin prison.What makes these protests particularly significant are their place in a longer trajectory of resistance. Since themass protests of 2009, Iranians have repeatedly taken to the streets – in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022 and now again. Each cycle has been met with repression rather than reform. Under Khamenei’s leadership, the system has shown a striking refusal to compromise, doubling down instead on coercion and ideological rigidity.Figures outside the country have stepped into the vacuum. Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, has publicly called on Iraniansto take to the streetsand maintain pressure on the regime. Protesters have responded by chanting his name in several cities. This should not be read as a call for monarchist restoration, but as evidence of the absence of credible, organised opposition inside Iran, and a search for symbols that represent a clean break with the Islamic Republic. For the authorities, such chants are deeply unsettling, reviving a historical memory they have long sought to erase.As in every crisis, the regime has blamed foreign enemies. In a Friday sermon on 9 January, Khamenei dismissed the unrest as the work of external powers,casting dissent as treason and foreign conspiracy. This framing serves a familiar purpose, allowing the government to legitimise repression at home while reinforcing a siege mentality within the state. Yesterday, the government organised its ownstate-backed demonstrationsto project an image of unity and control.These claims ring increasingly hollow though, particularly after the June 2025Israel-Iran conflict, which exposed the extent to which Israel had penetrated Iran’s security and intelligence systems. In that context, domestic unrest is no longer merely a political challenge. It is an existential one. The leadership fears that internal dissent, external pressure and covert infiltration could converge in ways that would unravel the regime’s grip on power.International dynamics further complicate the crisis. Donald Trump has threatened potentialmilitary intervention on behalf of the protesters. Tehran has respondedby warningthat any US strike could trigger retaliation, not only against American assets in the region but also against Israel. A direct US entry into the crisis could have contradictory effects. It would give the regime cover to escalate its crackdown at home, but the strategic aim would be to weaken the Islamic Republic by deepening its economic isolation, degrading elements of its security capacity and loosening the bolts on the state’s already fragile functionality. Such pressure would not deliver immediate change, but it would sharpen the regime’s internal contradictions and make governing even more difficult.What comes next is unlikely to be liberalisation. Faced with declining legitimacy, economic collapse and geopolitical isolation, the Islamic Republic will become a more inward-looking state, increasingly reliant on repression rather than representation. The trajectory bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, where survival depended on fear, surveillance and brute force, rather than consent.Pitted against the repressive capacity of a brutal state, these protests may again fade from the headlines, but they are not an aberration. They are the clearest signal yet of a political order that has lost its capacity to adapt. Unless Iran’s leadership chooses a radically different path, involving reform, accountability, economic change and engagement with the outside world, future unrest is not a question of if, but when. One thing is certain, the Islamic Republic that emerges from this crisis will not look the same.Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionProtestMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Aren’t we lucky?Tue 13 Jan 2026 09.10 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareSorry to call it early, but the worst trend of 2026 is politicians who are graciously doing us all a favour. “He doesn’t need to be here,” declared Nigel Farage on Monday of Reform UK’s newest sloppy second,Nadhim Zahawi. “He could have gone abroad.” Ooh, aren’t we lucky! Thanks for stopping by, Nadhim!If you missed this, the former mayfly Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi hasswitched gravy trains. If that sounds like the sort of death-defying stunt Tom Cruise might break his ankle doing in the Mission: Impossible franchise, it’s nothing like as exhilaratingly watchable. The Tory gravy train has ground to a halt, and Farage will stop his Reform train even between stations to pick up any old has-been you may remember from episodes such as “deathbedBoris Johnson appointments” or “my horsesare warmer than pensioners”. (More on that one shortly.) Needless to say, Farage is doing his best to explain that these guys aren’t secondhand, they’re pre-loved. They’re vintage, they’re appealingly worn in, they’re heritage pieces. They may even have increased in value – they’re basically political Birkin bags.But, as I say, you’re lucky you’re even being allowed to look at them. Don’t dream of touching what you can’t afford. Farage’s party is increasingly full of people who’d like you to know they’ve got way better options than power and don’t actually need to do this.Nigel’s one himself, of course, having declared “I want my life back” in 2016, before repeatedly presenting his frequent un-retirings as some kind of regrettable sacrifice he could well afford not to make. He doesn’t need to do this, guys! Or take Richard Tice, the Reform deputy leader given to making grandly self-dramatising statements like: “My job pays for everything. The politics just costs me.” (By way of a quick sidebar, incidentally, do spare a genuine thought for Tice. He’s been a Successful BusinessmanTM, he led Reform for almost three years when they leapt from 0% to 15% in the polls, and he then dutifully surrendered the leadership to the endlessly un-retiring Farage. AndstillFarage has resolutely declined to name him the unofficial opposition’s shadow chancellor and clearly never will, waiting instead for a Tory of the right perceived calibre to defect so he can give it to them instead. It’s like Nigel loves Richard, but knows he isnot serious people.)Anyway. Now, take Nadhim Zahawi, who spent Monday’sunveiling press conferencemaking much of the fact that a successful businessman such as himself could have chosen to enjoy a “comfortable retirement”, but instead is joining Reform, apparently as an act of national philanthropy. But is Zahawi truly one of life’s most selfless givers, or is he a career chiseller whose interactions with the taxpayer include simplynot payinghis own taxes, and putting in expenses for heat and lighting for the stables on his Warwickshire estate? Something to bear in mind for Reform supporters currently feeling too cash-strapped to put the heating on. Zahawiaccepted morefrom the taxpayer in energy costs for his second home than any other MP. He was forced to repay those, as he was forced to settle his unpaid bills with HMRC after concealing the investigation into his affairs led to him having to resign as chancellor.Below these upper echelons of Reform, this attitude that politics needs you far more than you need it persists. The recently resigned leader of Staffordshire county council is a guy called Ian Cooper, whose Reform party membership wassuspended last monthafter the discovery that social media accounts linked to him were a “top fan” of a white supremacy page, and that he had been posting stuff like a diatribe against David Lammy that included the dictum: “No foreign national or first-generation migrant should be allowed to sit in parliament.” Yet when a Labour councillor questioned the deafening silence among his colleagues about all this, Cooper reacted airily. “The good thing is I don’t need to be a politician for the money, unlike some,” he sniffed. “I can walk away without consequences.”Strange times we live in, when a consequence-free lifestyle is now being presented as an ideal characteristic for a politician. People didn’t used to talk like this, constantly implying they were far too good or well-feathered for this crap, and only here as a favour to the little people. It’s such an eye-catching reframing of public service for the hyper-individualised age, yet at the same time its practitioners don’t even seem to realise that they’re doing it.Is Nadhim Zahawi’s defection to Farage’s Reform a bombshell? No, it’s just naked opportunism | Henry HillRead moreNor, indeed, is the tendency limited to Reform. Back when the Conservatives were looking to expand their pool of MPs,Rory Stewart has recountedasking David Cameron if he’d be made a minister fast. “What I was saying was: ‘Do you want me? Because I can do other things. I’ve got a chair at Harvard. I don’t need to do this.’”Not needing to do this was the absolute keystone of Donald Trump’s first White House run, with the future president reminding voters at every turn that: “I’ve built a great, great company. I don’t need to do this.” That great, great company has, of course,enriched itselfbeyond measure during Trump’s two stints in office – which rather disproves the man we might consider the daddy of this particular streak in modern politics, Ross Perot. By way of a recap, tech-firm billionaire Perot ran as an independent US presidential candidate in 1992, and a big part of his norm-shattering shtick was the fact he was so rich that he couldn’t be corrupt like all those other politicians. Perot explicitly believed that autocratic businessmen were the answer, and that government was something that could be fixed if you just got “under the hood”. One in five Americans voted for him. (By the way, the next time he ran, in 1996, he called his party theReform party.)Last week I saw a poll that found 74% of people across the UK, EU, US, Canada and Japan believed the world is “hopelessly riggedfor the rich”. It’s kind of nuts that in an era in which this outlook is overwhelmingly prevalent, the supposed great knights in shining armour are men who keep telling you they are doing so well that they really don’t even need to bother. They’re doing it for YOU, and you need to follow them into battle in what Zahawi called Farage’s “glorious revolution”. Is there any armour for the foot soldiers, as they march towards their own consequence-free promised land? Look, I’m sure the guys at the top are working on it.

I think it’s because he made me feel seenTue 13 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 16.56 ESTShareOn the last day of 2025, an old friend and I lament that the usual resolutions like exercise more, work smarter and be a better parent are beginning to sound tired. After all, in this second phase of our lives, if we haven’t found a way forward it might pay to examine the goals rather than their pursuit.For entertainment, I tell her that a US news network had called me that morning to schedule an “urgent” interview. I’d moved things around only to have the producer cancel without explanation. I didn’t mind the cancellation but hated the possibility that my patients could have been inconvenienced.We jest that our reaction to the statement‘It turns out we won’t be needing you any more’might just be our new challenge, considering all the places it pops up – from the patients and institutions who drop us to the friends and relatives who break contact.My daughter showed me the joy in jigsaw puzzles – now it’s the only way I know how to relax | Nova WeetmanRead moreUnexpectedly, my first challenge of the new year is a funeral. Indians typically refer to their unrelated elders as uncle and aunty. It denotes respect but is also helps in remembering names. The uncle whose funeral is being held is the father of an old friend. Having arrived in Australia during the dying years of the White Australia policy, Uncle became the rare academic whose work reaped commercial success. But his most far-reaching work came after retirement when he and his wife poured themselves into community endeavours. Banding with a small group of like-minded people they kept alive the richness of Indian heritage in the emerging diaspora through music, dance and spirituality. Many of these people, including the couple, were recognised in Australian honours for this vital service to society.Of the many Indian festivals,Holi – the riotous festival of colours– is my favourite and it’s where I probably first met Uncle. Between playing with colours, crowds were treated to a cultural program that showcased the power of diversity. The performers and speakers were old and young, born and educated the world over – with their unique talents, they were weaving the fabric of Australian multiculturalism.After launching a successful non-profit to help people in crisis, Uncle was dreaming up his next act. For someone so vital and productive, his rapid descent from illness to death seemed grossly unfair. But as the poet Pablo Neruda so devastatingly observed, you can cut all the flowers but you cannot stop spring from coming.Having attended many funerals through my years of being an oncologist, I realise that this occasion provides the ultimate reckoning with how a life was lived.I once attended one where the only mourners were the pallbearers and me. At many, pews have heaved with people. Either way, I am always surprised and humbled by how little I knew the deceased.Uncle’s funeral proves no different. In the huge crowd, everyone has a story. Students he taught and colleagues he helped. New migrants who came for counsel and never left. Those infected by his sense of purpose. Those inspired by his commitment to public good.The ceremony is a masterclass in grace and dignity. The eulogies manage to handle grief without cloying sentimentality. An unexpected presence is a video of Uncle reciting in his sonorous voice the same meaningful prayers now offered as part of his last rites. I can’t help wondering if he ever imagined this novel use of his work.As his son performs ancient Hindu rites in front of his father’s open coffin, we observe his courage and poise with bated breath and breaking hearts.Earlier, a friend remarked that, even at a funeral, few people find cause to contemplate their own mortality, and I had rolled my eyes at him. Now, in the silence during the rituals, I spot one person on You Tube, another on ChatGPT, a third checking makeup and a fourth scrolling fashion finds. Phones ping and objects clatter. Being still really is so hard.On these in-between days I’m ‘growing down’, sinking into the present moment and savouring small delights | Nadine LevyRead moreReading this, one might think I knew Uncle well but our interactions were rare; like everyone, I thought I would have more time with him. So the intensity of my sorrow at his death catches me by surprise and prompts me to ask why.I think it is because he made me feel seen. He exuded pride in and respect for my achievements as if he had never heard of anything more special. When we met at events he organised, he would greet me like a long-lost friend and fuss over me as if I were the chief guest. And he never, ever forgot to tell my parents how fond he was of me.If making someone feel seen is considered the “loudest” form of love, there was no louder voice.When he was unwell he sought my advice, although he knew I was no expert in his illness. It was a sign of trust but also intellectual humility, which is a good shield against never feeling threatened by others. Indeed, his best accomplishments probably resulted from a remarkable ability to not take himself too seriously and be open to advice.The funeral ends and we emerge into a day of warm sun, bright flowers and unsuspecting birds, the universe cautioning us against taking ourselves too seriously.We follow the priest in chants before quietly saying our final goodbyes. Then, for a man who was large in life and humble in bearing, tears are replaced by a prolonged standing ovation – poignant, perfect and somehow, uplifting.Later, my friend asks about the funeral. I tell her that we have ourselves a proper new year resolution. It is to make others – especially our patients – feel seen through our daily actions so that one day when the world inevitably says “We won’t be needing you any more”, we will have fulfilled our purpose.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Instead it debased the freedom of speech it symbolisesRokhaya DialloThe satirical title targeted in an Islamist attack 10 years ago published a racist, sexist caricature of me that speaks volumes about its valuesTue 13 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 15.11 ESTShareThe day before Christmas Eve, just as France readied itself to slip into the holiday slowdown, something abruptly shook me out of any festive torpor. The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, known globally and tragically for being thetarget of an Islamist attackin 2015 published a caricature – of me. And it wasappallingly racist. A huge, toothy grin, an enormous mouth, the cartoon depicts me dancing on a stage before an audience of laughing white men, adorned with a banana belt on a largely exposed body. The headline: “The Rokhaya Diallo Show: Mocking secularism around the world.”Stunned by the violence of this grotesque cartoon, I shared it on social mediawith a brief analysis: “In keeping with slave-era and colonial imagery, Charlie Hebdo once again shows itself incapable of engaging with the ideas of a Black woman without reducing her to a dancing body – exoticised, supposedly savage – adorned with the very bananas that are hurled at Black people who dare to step into the public sphere.”The reference toJosephine Bakerwas as obvious as it was disrespectful and incomprehensible. One of the most iconic performances of the American-born dancer, actor and activist in the 1920s involved Baker in a (rubber) banana skirt, at a time when France took pride in displaying what it claimed was its superiority over the territories of its colonial empire. But Baker was far more than the act whose erotic charge she deliberately chose to subvert through exaggerated, clownish gestures. She was amember of the French Resistance, a recipient of France’s highest military honours, the only woman to speak at the 1963 March on Washington led by Martin Luther King Jr, and the only Black woman interred in Le Panthéon, the national mausoleum for France’s greatest figures. I was therefore dismayed to see the Baker legend reduced to a grotesque, minstrel show-like grimace.From the moment I posted my reaction, the controversy took off. Millions upon millions of views across my social media, outraged reactions and analytical content produced in several languages to unpack the image’s colonial undertones. I received a level of attention and support that I could not have imagined when I first shared my disgust.But instead of acknowledging the obvious racism, Charlie Hebdo used the clumsiest form of gaslighting. The magazinerespondedto the wave of protests by accusing me of a “manipulation”– one I was supposedly familiar with – claiming that I had “distorted” the image by presenting it “separated from its text”. As though any accompanying article could possibly justify the use of such despicable imagery.The said article accuses me of being “America’s little sweetheart”, operating from foreign platforms such as the Guardian to smear what they call “my country of birth” – a phrasing that, to my mind, insinuates that I am not fully French. As a Black Muslim woman, I am well aware that any public criticism ofFranceis routinely read by racists as the betrayal of an ungrateful immigrant’s daughter. Yet even setting aside this poisonous framing of my positions, the article offers no coherent link – neither political, nor historical, nor symbolic – to Josephine Baker. It has absolutely nothing to do with Josephine Baker, or with bananas.The most absurd element lies in Charlie Hebdo’s conclusion, where the magazine claims to be “an anti-racist, feminist, and universalist newspaper” which, in its view, is what I “blame” it for. In a move that France has perfected, an all-white editorial team defends a racist cartoon drawn by a white man by turning the accusation back on to the Black victim – an author of some 20 books and documentaries on race and gender – branding her as hostile to anti-racism and feminism. It would be funny if it weren’t so pathetic.In my message denouncing this drawing, I also wrote, “this hideous cartoon is meant to remind me of my place in the racial and sexist hierarchy”,because I fully understood what lay behind this device. Stripping me and placing me in a humiliating posture is a way of discrediting me as a legitimate interlocutor, of reminding me of the fate imposed on my ancestors, whose humanity was denied.Josephine Baker made her dancing debut in Paris at the age of 19. Before her death in 1975, she became a film actor, the most photographed woman in the world, a pilot, a spy for France – the nation she made her own – and an anti-racist activist, among many other things. Yet Charlie Hebdo proved incapable of invoking her in any way other than by reducing her to a naked body costumed in colonial trappings.And what matters here is this: our trajectories have little in common. The decision to link me to a 19-year-old woman (I am 47) who rose to fame a century ago in a field that has nothing to do with mine reveals the extent to which white supremacy renders Black women interchangeable.In this controversy, the issue is not only about me but about all of us who, on a daily basis, are confronted withmisogynoir– the intertwining of sexist and anti-Black violence theorised by academic Moya Bailey – that descends on any Black woman who dares to step outside the secondary role to which postcolonial societies persist in trying to confine her.Charlie Hebdo sought to sanction a woman it deemed too audacious, and a Black person who does not rely on the French media to make her voice heard.It is no coincidence that among the thousands of messages of support I received – including a statement from the historicLigue des Droits de l’Homme– was one from the former French justice ministerChristiane Taubira, the first Black woman to hold that position in 2012.Taubira was herself subjected to some of the most vicious racist attacks, including avile Charlie Hebdo cartoon. With the exceptional command of language she is renowned for, Taubira characterised the drawing as “intellectually impoverished, visually flat, stylistically bland, semantically mediocre, and psychologically obsessive”.By attempting to discredit me as a legitimate participant in the public debate, Charlie Hebdo has also laid bare its unwillingness to engage on an equal footing. In seeking to humiliate me, the magazine has soiled itself – and debased the very freedom of expression of which it had become a symbol.Rokhaya Diallo is a French journalist, writer, film-maker and activistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Up on the stage, the then world No 20, Ryan Searle, briefly extracts himself from his quarter-final match to encourage the crowd, conducting it with his hands and briefly joining in a chorus of “Keir Starmer’s a wanker”.And the surreal part of all this is that from Searle’s gesture alone, you could scarcely guess what his own politics might be. Was he condemning Starmer from the nativist right or from the progressive left? Pro-farmer or pro-Palestine? Does he think the government’s reforms on workers’ rights go too far or not far enough? Perhaps Searle’s protest might even have come from the Burnhamite centre, less an ideological objection and more an implicit criticism of messaging and delivery.The hideous beauty of British politics in 2026 is that we have no idea. You think Keir Starmer’s a wanker? Back of the queue’s that way, mate. And of course there is a rich irony in the fact that Starmer took office with the explicit aim of healing our divisions and bringing the country together, rendering this one of the very few election pledges he has actually managed to keep.Hisapproval ratings, which began to go into freefall from pretty much the moment he moved into Downing Street, have dropped below 20%. A YouGov poll last week found that he was more disliked by Britons thanBenjamin Netanyahu or Hamas. At the weekend a far-right march against Starmer’s government in Bristol was met with a leftwing counter-protest bearing the slogan “We hate Keir Starmer more than you”.Meanwhile the song itself has become a kind of standard, the soundtrack to our lives, perhaps even a unifying balm in troubled times. As well as the darts, you hear it at football grounds up and down the country, in nightclubs at 2am, at music festivals, pretty much anywhere large groups of young people congregate in a public place. In a way it has become this generation’s Ghost Town, its Get Lucky, its Candle in the Wind 1997. Goodbye, England’s wanker.Yes, Keir Starmer is Britain’s most unpopular PM ever. That could liberate him | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThere have of course been other useless prime ministers in our time: prime ministers who have started wars, killed thousands through neglect or cruelty, plunged millions into poverty, been duplicitous or corrupt, who have been turfed out in disgrace. But with the brief exception of Liz Truss, even the most divisive of them took years to become the focal point of mass rage. Starmer has managed to hit the sweet spot within barely a year. People genuinely, viscerally loathe this guy. Why him? Why now? And why like this?Let’s start with the word choice, which feels subtly telling in this case. If Boris Johnson was,as the darts crowd sangin late 2021 at the height of the Partygate scandal, a “cunt”, then somehow calling Starmer a “wanker” is altogether more piteously dismissive – insinuating not just degeneracy but a kind of bashful cowardice. The first word imputes a straightforward roguishness, perhaps even a grudging regard; the wanker, by contrast, is essentially beneath contempt.Clearly there is a hedonistic, nihilistic element to much of the sloganeering: a performative alpha masculinity that seems to have bled over from far-right spaces, via the sporting arena, into mainstream culture. Travelling football fans up and down the country slap “MORE GEAR LESS KEIR”stickers on trains, benches and lamp-posts. And for these guys Starmer functions as basically the polar opposite of cocaine: sober, quiet, boring, right on, emotionally austere and medically incapable of banter.But of course these same traits also damn him with the haunted, hope-starved left. Here, Starmer somehow manages to encapsulate a broader revulsion with traditional Westminster politicians – preoccupied with managerialism and triangulation over ideology and morality; the sheer reluctance to define a political mission beyond a vague obsession with “fixing things”, as if Britain were basically a damp garden shed. With Tony Blair you were at least dealing with a human being, someone with a worldview and a discernible set of vertebrae. The reason Starmer makes such an infuriating adversary is because there is basically nothing there to oppose: a low-fat yoghurt standing in front of a union flag.And so the rage is loud, catholic and inchoate, a buffet at which all are welcome. Whatever sinks your boat, Starmer has something to offer you. Engaging with all the ways in which our system of representative democracy is broken, the macroeconomic currents that disenfranchise entire states, the failures of centrist politics to respond to sweeping technological change and increasing social alienation: hard. Singing loudly about the prime minister’s manual pastimes: easy, and essentially able to make whatever point you want.It helps, of course, that Starmer rage is basically free. Starmer has no -ism, no natural constituency, no base beyond a couple of dozen weird technocracy stans on Bluesky. It helps, too, that voters have an innate genius for intuiting a politician’s worst fear and squeezing it mercilessly. Part of the reason I think people like kicking Starmer so much is that his entire political journey has been built around getting kicked as little as possible. Virtually everything he does – his piecemeal economic reforms, his cautious rhetoric, his editorials in the Sun – screams “smallest possible target”: “I am mild and inoffensive. Please don’t hate me. Definitely do not sing with complete strangers in public places about me being a wanker.”And naturally we should be wary, even alarmed, at where this amorphous anger leads us in the long run. At the increasingly coarse and personal tone of our politics, the conflation of legitimate dissent with onanism discourse. But perhaps there is also a certain purifying clarity in this illusory moment of communion. We agree on little as a nation, but this unites us. Throughout history, the howl of change has come in many forms – this one just so happens to have six syllables.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Who comes out on top?Michael HoganTue 13 Jan 2026 10.54 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 16.17 ESTShareWith Tom Hiddleston up to his old racy tricks inThe Night Manager– not to be confused with Netflix hit The Night Agent, which also returns in February – espionage thrillers are all over our TVs. Anyone would think we lived in unstable times with growing public distrust of governments.So who is the all-time top small-screen spook? We’ve rated the Top 20. Just make sure you destroy this list after reading …20Napoleon Solo(The Man from UNCLE, 1964-1968)View image in fullscreenSomehow they kept a straight face … Robert Vaughn with David McCallum in The Man from UNCLE.Photograph: NBC/AllstarSuavely played by Robert Vaughn, this gadget-wielding Cary Grant-alike was the small screen’s answer to 007 – partly because Bond creator Ian Fleming was a consultant on the NBC series. Napoleon “no relation to Han” Solo and his stoic Russian sidekick Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) worked for the United Network Command for Law & Enforcement, foiling the evil THRUSH (Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables & the Subjugation of Humanity) and its dastardly plans for world domination. Somehow they kept straight faces amid all the absurd acronyms.19Tamar Rabinyan(Tehran, 2020-present)View image in fullscreenA-list oomph … Niv Sultan in Tehran.Photograph: Apple TV+Once you’re in, there’s no way out. With alumni of the equally ace Fauda on its writing team, this breathlessly tense espionage thriller became the first Israeli series to win an Emmy. It follows computer hacker Tamar (Niv Sultan) whose first field mission for the Mossad takes her to Iran to destabilise a nuclear reactor. It’s twisty and timely as the coolly charismatic Tamar fights to escape from behind enemy lines. Streaming on Apple TV, it added A-list oomph with Glenn Close in season two and Hugh Laurie in the third.18Simon Templar(The Saint, 1962-1969)View image in fullscreenI can see your halo! … Roger Moore in The Saint.Photograph: ITC/AllstarEyebrow-archingRoger Moorelimbered up for his later stint on Her Majesty’s Secret Service with this ITV caper. As Simon Templar, he was a Robin Hood-style maverick who worked for whichever side of the law served the greater good. Once per episode, an animated halo would appear above Templar’s head as he broke the fourth wall. Banging theme tune, too.17Hanna(Hanna, 2019-2021)View image in fullscreenWhat a super-soldier … Esmé Creed-Miles in Hanna.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe 2011 film, starring Saoirse Ronan as a teen assassin raised off the grid by her spy father Eric Bana, was solid enough. The Prime series, created by The Night Manager’s David Farr, is even better. Esmé Creed-Miles stars as the prodigious super-soldier, who evades her CIA pursuers to unearth the truth about the secret government programme from which she was rescued as a baby.16Steve Austin(The Six Million Dollar Man, 1973-1978)“We can rebuild him. We have the technology.” After being near fatally injured when a Nasa test flight crashed, astronaut Steve Austin (Lee Majors) was reconstructed by scientists with $6m worth of bionic implants. Now with superhuman strength, speed and vision, he became the ultimate half-cyborg secret agent. Austin’s old flame, tennis player Jaime Sommers (Lindsay Wagner), soon got her own spin-off, The Bionic Woman. Both became firm playground favourites, despite the shonky sound effects.15David Callan(Callan, 1967-1972)This hard-boiled gloomfest was an antidote to the camp spy romps of its day. It followed the work of a shady secret service branch called “Section” as its haunted assassin Callan (Edward Woodward) repelled internal security threats by torturing and terminating hostiles. He loathed his posh bosses, all codenamed “Hunter”, and had a love-hate bond with malodorous informant “Lonely”. Woodward later riffed on his macintosh-clad vigilante persona in schlocky US action series The Equalizer.14Guillaume Debailly(The Bureau, 2015-2020)View image in fullscreenFrench flair … Mathieu Kassovitz in The Bureau.Photograph: Album/AlamyBringing a touch of French flair to our list is the charismatically troubled agent codenamed “Malotru” (Lout) from this suspenseful Canal+ series. After six years undercover in Syria, moody hero Guillaume (Mathieu Kassovitz) returns to Le Bureau des Légendes in Paris, where he struggles to readjust to a normal life – not least when his lover from Damascus arrives to renew their affair. Based on real accounts by former spies, it’s coolly captivating and all too credible. In the English-language remake, The Agency, produced by George Clooney, the equivalent role was played by Michael Fassbender.13Eve Polastri(Killing Eve, 2018-2022)View image in fullscreenA bona fide cultural phenomenon … Sandra Oh (right) with Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: David Emery/BBC AmericaShe inevitably suffered by comparison with Jodie Comer’s designer-frocked assassin Villanelle but Sandra Oh was still superb as a bored MI5 analyst who becomes obsessed with catching the psychopathic gun-for-hire. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s intoxicating thriller, adapted from Luke Jennings’ novellas, became a bona fide cultural phenomenon, even if it suffered diminishing returns in later seasons.12John Steed(The Avengers, 1961-1969)View image in fullscreenKitsch cult classic … Patrick Macnee with Diana Rigg in The Avengers.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyLike the semi-serious template for Austin Powers, this knowing caper was set against the backdrop of swinging 60s London. Battling super-villainy were debonair “MI5½” agent John Steed (Patrick Macnee), with his bowler hat and brolly, alongside his kickass female partners – most memorably Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman). Both later became Bond girls. All arch dialogue, jazzy soundtrack and Pierre Cardin costumes, it’s a kitsch cult classic. “Mrs Peel, we’re needed …”11Martin Rauch(Deutschland 83, 2015-2020)View image in fullscreenSlinky thrills … Jonas Nay in Deutschland 83.Photograph: Conny KleinThis cold war saga became the first German-language series to air on a US network and built a devoted UK fanbase on Channel 4. East German border guard Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay) was sent through the iron curtain as an undercover agent to steal military secrets for the Stasi. Rich in period detail and with a pulsating synth-pop soundtrack, it mixed slinky thrills with endearing coming-of-age drama.10Sydney Bristow(Alias, 2001-2006)View image in fullscreenSo good she recruited for the real CIA … Jennifer Garner in Alias.Photograph: Norman Jean Roy/Touchstone TelevisionShowrunner JJ Abrams’ breakout hit was this zippy thriller about student turned spook Sydney (Jennifer Garner), a double agent working against the malevolent network known as SD-6. Fierce fights, whizzy tradecraft and head-spinning conspiracies were lent emotional resonance by Syd’s damaged relationship with her spymaster father, Jack (Victor Garber). Across five seasons, Garner became so synonymous with her character that she starred in real CIA recruitment videos.9Jonathan Pine(The Night Manager, 2016-present)View image in fullscreenHiddlebum strikes back! … Tom Hiddleston with Camila Morrone in The Night Manager.Photograph: BBC/Ink Factory/Des WillieHe runs away from explosions! He has steamy threesomes! He changes his name and bares his bottom a lot! The lavishly produced Le Carré adaptation updated its setting to the Arab spring, where ex-soldier Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) staffed the front desk at a swish Cairo hotel – until tapped up by Olivia Colman’s intelligence officer to bring down arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”. The equally slick sequel, now airing on BBC One, takes our reluctant secret agent to Colombia. Hiddleston remains a compelling blend of Etonian charm and shape-shifting amorality.8Harry Pearce(Spooks, 2002-2011)When counter-terrorism section chief Sir Harry (Peter Firth) slipped on his black leather gloves, you knew things were about to get deadly. The BBC’s pacy procedural (tagline “MI5, not 9 to 5”) found hot young operatives foiling post-9/11 threats, while juggling their duplicitous private lives. There was a revolving security door at Thames House for the field agents. Hard-bitten Harry was the sole constant across 10 series. Would he get his well-deserved happy ending with GCHQ analyst Ruth (Nicola Walker)? I’m welling up just thinking about it *dabs eyes with leather gloves*.7Elizabeth Jennings(The Americans, 2013-2018)View image in fullscreenFighting the cold war, one bad rug at a time … Keri Russell in The Americans.Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/ITVOn the suburban surface, Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) was a wholesome travel agent in 1980s Washington DC. In reality, she was a KGB sleeper agent named Nadezhda who sold package holidays by day but by night donned a sequence of ropey disguises to gather intel for Mother Russia. She pips her husband, Philip, AKA Mischa (Matthew Rhys), to our countdown because while he was plagued by conscience and a growing fondness for their adopted homeland, she remained a stone cold-killer who fought the cold war, one bad wig at a time.6Jack Bauer(24, 2001-2014)Dammit, Chloe, put me higher up the list! With each season documenting “the longest day in the life” of maverick counter-terrorism agent Jack (Kiefer Sutherland), this groundbreaking thrill ride deployed split screen, copious cliffhangers and a beeping digital clock to crank up the real-time tension. As badass Bauer raced to save the world, he was happy to wield hacksaws, axes, screwdrivers, pens, wet towels and other improvised torture implements to serve his country. We just wished he’d take a bathroom break occasionally. No wonder he was so cross.5Number Six(The Prisoner, 1967-1968)View image in fullscreenBe seeing you … Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesHe’s not a number, he’s a free man. He has also crept covertly into our top five. The nameless British intelligence agent (played by series co-creator Patrick McGoohan) tried to quit his highly classified government position – only to be gassed, kidnapped and wake up imprisoned in an idyllic coastal village. Our hero waged a battle of wits against his mysterious captors in this 1960s counter-cultural take on the spy genre. With its Kafka-esque surrealism and sinister Portmeirion setting, The Prisoner aired just 17 episodes but exerts an enduring influence on pop culture. Be seeing you …4Carrie Mathison(Homeland, 2011-2020)View image in fullscreenMeme queen … Claire Danes in Homeland.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/JoJo Whilden/ShowtimeSure, she had a taste for discordant jazz, gigantic goblets of chardonnay and meme-able facial expressions but let’s not hold that against Claire Danes’ CIA operative. Carrie’s bipolar disorder became her superpower – at least when she was taking her meds – enabling hyper-focus, tireless dedication and obsessive attention to detail. Initially she waged a one-woman campaign against Damian Lewis’s war hero turned al-Qaida asset. Later seasons saw her presciently fighting such evils as fake news, Russian electoral interference and terror attacks on European cities.3Danger Mouse(1981-1992, 2015-2019)View image in fullscreenWho needs James Bond? … Danger Mouse.Photograph: Fremantle Media/Shutterstock“He’s the greatest, he’s fantastic / Wherever there is danger, he’ll be there.” Who needs James Bond when you could have a crime-fighting, wise-cracking rodent who wears an eyepatch and lives in a Mayfair postbox? “The white wonder” – voiced by David Jason in the 80s ITV original and Alexander Armstrong in the CBBC reboot – is accompanied by bumbling hamster sidekick Penfold as he battles baddies led by wheezing toad Baron Silas von Greenback. DM has a flying car, wears inflatable dangertrunks, practises the ancient martial art of kung moggy and is so top secret that his codename has a codename. Good grief, chief.2George Smiley(Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy/Smiley’s People, 1979/1982)View image in fullscreen‘The cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin’ … Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyForget Obi-Wan Kenobi. Sir Alec Guinness delivered his definitive late-career performance as MI6 veteran George Smiley, summoned out of retirement and brought back to “the Circus” to root out a Soviet mole. The classic BBC adaptation of John le Carré’s landmark novel was intricately structured as the cerebral spymaster unmasked the traitor at the heart of the secret service. Blessed with “the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin”, Smiley sifted through paperwork and politely probed sources over pots of tea. Le Carré hailed Guinness “a genius” for bringing him to such mesmeric life, citing the series as his favourite screen version of his work. In the 2011 film remake, Smiley was played by Gary Oldman. Talking of whom …1Jackson Lamb(Slow Horses, 2022-present)View image in fullscreenThe underdogs’ champion! … Gary Oldman with Kristin Scott Thomas in Slow Horses.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFarting and arse-scratching his way to the top of our chart is the underdogs’ champion. Adapted from Mick Herron’s brilliant novels, the Apple TV hit sees jaded “joe” Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) presiding over a motley crew of MI5 outcasts, exiled to the grotty outpost of Slough House. Rude, crude and witheringly cynical, his scabrous management style isn’t what you’d call touchy-feely. Typical bon mots include “I’ve got haemorrhoids that are more fucking use than you” or “Bringing you up to speed is like trying to explain Norway to a dog”. Yet time and again, Lamb outwits his so-called superiors and proves that his disgraced rejects are more capable of keeping Britain safe than the grunts from Regent’s Park. He’s a potty-mouthed, chain-smoking, whisky-swigging, vindaloo-scoffing slob but somehow utterly lovable.

The main criticism levelled at the ceremony so far seems to be that it didn’t adequately reflect the moment. It was all a bit 1920s Berlin, with a shimmering array of beautiful millionaires busy congratulating themselves, oblivious to the fear and exhaustion of the rest of the world.Little wonder, then, that the only real moment of the show to go viral was a red carpet interview with Mark Ruffalo. Called over by an interviewer to explain the pin he was wearing on his tuxedo, Ruffalo explained that “I’m not feeling so great. We have a woman, Renee Good was murdered in our streets of America today … As much as I love all this, I don’t know if I can pretend like this crazy stuff isn’t happening.” (An assistant attorney general hasdecided not to investigate the killing of an unarmed civilian by an ICE agenteven though this would be usual in the case of a shooting by law enforcement.)Ruffalo was far from the only attender who wore a Be Good badge to the ceremony – Jean Smart, Ariana Grande, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne all did the same – but he does seem to be one of the few figures who consistently speaks his mind on matters such as these. The “activism and political views” section of his Wikipedia page runs to 14 dense paragraphs of causes he has supported, on issues ranging from Iran to pollution to the preservation of Manhattan churches. Just this week, post-Globes, he signed a letter calling for the immediate restoration of medical care in Gaza.Being this outspoken puts Ruffalo in the crosshairs – just today, a newspaper called him “the most sanctimonious man in Hollywood” – which, in an age where the entertainment industry is being run by a smaller and smaller number of figures, can be a dangerous game to play. But the beauty ofMark Ruffalois that he has always danced to the beat of his own drum.View image in fullscreenUS comedian Wanda Sykes wears a Be Good pin.Photograph: Michael Tran/AFP/Getty ImagesIn terms of his professional output, he has always managed to juggle his personal projects with blockbuster fare. In one year alone he managed to make Dark Waters (a film about a lawyer trying to land a hit on a multinational chemical company) and Avengers: Endgame (a film where he played a version of the Incredible Hulk who can dab). Commercially, one of these was the second biggest film of all time, and the other was just the 130th biggest film of 2019, but Ruffalo approached both with the same vigour.The Golden Globes ceremony ignored politics. But their big winner taps today’s unhappy turbulence | Peter BradshawRead moreIn other words, he is proof that speaking out on issues that resonate personally won’t necessarily harm your career, so long as you mean it. Which brings us back to the tightrope. Political statements have a history of going down badly at awards shows – Michael Moore was booed at the Oscars in 2003, and Jonathan Glazer created a firestorm when hespoke about Palestineduring his acceptance speech in 2024 – but Mark Ruffalo managed to hit the sweet spot. His red carpet moment this weekend landed because it managed to be awkward, sincere and unresolved at the same time. It wasn’t so much an out of touch sermon as a howl of frustration, and who can’t relate to that?This article was amended on 13 January 2026 to correct the details about the investigative situation regarding the Renee Good shooting.Explore more on these topicsGolden GlobesMark RuffaloAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Andy Warhol portraits that complement this exhibition, without actually being part of it, brutally catch his gaunt, ravaged face in the glare of a photo flash under the hat he wore to hide burns sustained in a plane crash while serving in the Luftwaffe. The most haunting portrait turns Beuys into a spectral negative image, all darkness and shadow, his eyes wounded, guilty, lost. This was in the 1970s when Beuys was a charismatic one-man artistic revolution, inspiring young Germans to plant trees, lecturing about flows of ecological and human energy – and, in breathtaking performances, speaking to a dead hare or spending a week locked in a cage with a coyote.All that remains today of those actions, protests and performances are posters, preserved scrawls on blackboards and mesmerising videos. Yet the moment Beuys disappeared – he died in 1986 – his solid, material sculptures took over. He believed passionately in flow and flux, promoting an animist vision of humanity and the cosmos. When he stopped talking and acting, entropy gripped his art, making it a static, slumped set of dead objects. And all the greater for it.Who would want to take a bath in this? The sculpture at the heart of this exhibition, Bathtub, is a massive steampunk metal tank with protruding pipes and valves, the inside rumpled and mottled like human flesh, the entire grotesque structure resting on a giant mammoth tooth. Cast from a design Beuys tinkered with from 1961 to near the end of his life, Bathtub is a sinister, unforgettable work, immersing you not in hot water but in the black bile of modern history, its pipes connected to the fetid sewer of the 20th century’s worst horrors.View image in fullscreenWho would want to take a bath in this? … Badewanne (Bathtub), 1961-85, cast 1987, Joseph Beuys.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockBeuys enchants and sickens you simultaneously. This excellent show celebrates him at his most Wagnerian: an unabashed mythmaker, reviving ancient Germanic lore. For who would use such an epic bathtub? Brunhilde of course. The exhibition is called Bathtub for a Heroine, in case we miss that.Meanwhile, his 1949 sculpture Lead Woman imitates the wild anatomies of the Venus of Willendorf and other Palaeolithic sculptures fromGermany, Austria and central Europe. You can see why an artist searching for German renewal after 1945 might turn the clock back 30,000 years. In the stone age, from which the “Venus” figures that inspired Beuys come, he can imagine a prelapsarian national mythology. His little nude sculpture with its massive hips embodies a Wagnerian cult of mythic women that’s been freed from Wagner’s sins. In dreamy watercolours like Female Figure (1954) and Animal Woman (1949), Beuys redeems the Rhinemaidens.The obsession with prehistory reaches a screaming climax in his 1961 work Mammoth Tooth, Framed, consisting of a real tooth from an extinct mammoth, ivory and grey, ridged and furrowed, supporting a small copper bathtub. It’s a maquette for the giant bath at the heart of the show. Perhaps this ancient tooth from a beast that roamed Germany before Germany existed can purify the bath and whoever bathes in it.View image in fullscreenJoseph Beuys, Mammutzahn eingefaßt (Mammoth Tooth, Framed), 1961.Photograph: Ulrich Ghezzi/© Estate of Joseph Beuys / DACS, London 2025. Courtesy Thaddaeus Ropac gallery, LondonYet, walking around Bathtub, I see no escape from history. Far from a balm of forgetting, it looks like a coffin for a Valkyrie, jagged and ugly with memory. The horrible pipes jutting from it seem to plumb into the machinery of mass murder just as surely as the rusty rails in his great installation Tramstop lead to Auschwitz.Beuys always had one foot in the grave. As time goes by, his utopian hopes are eclipsed by the immeasurable truths that weigh down his art. This blast of him is a reminder of the joyous yet cursed creativity of an artist who literally saved his country’s culture, giving it access to myths that might have been forever internally censored, laying the tramlines for today’s great German artists Georg Baselitz andAnselm Kieferand showing the way to any young artist who wants to discover the poetry of material objects. It is also, be warned, a bath in history’s acid.AtThaddaeus Ropac Gallery, London, until 21 March.Explore more on these topicsArt and designJoseph BeuysSculptureGermanyExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a bestselling romance author who disdains love, an OCD sufferer who weaponizes his affliction, a New Yorker who hates crowds (who can’t relate?). In one scene, an adoring fan asks Melvin his secret to writing women. “I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability,” he says, an epic burn forever seared in my brain. Of course Melvin’s anti-charm offensive only goes so far in aJames L Brooksproject. Before long, the rudeness erodes as Melvin is forced on to a journey of self-discovery with the nextdoor neighbor he can’t abide (Greg Kinnear) and the diner waitress he can’t live without (Helen Hunt). Melvin comes out a changed man in the end, but retains the essence of his super-grouch-dom. That was the moment I fell in love with the writer’s life.Andrew LawrenceWhat’s to like?

The middling YA ghost author, borderline alcoholic and “psychotic prom queen bitch” rampages back to her home town so she can save her high school boyfriend Buddy, convinced he’s miserable and desperate for an out (an ugly baby, a cardigan-wearing wife and a “shabby chic” house in the suburbs – just imagine). But it’s Mavis, as played by an astonishingly awfulCharlize Theron, who is truly miserable, a stunted, peaked-in-high-school bully who just can’t move on from her long-ago heyday. Things don’t really go as we expect either, Diablo Cody’s daring, difficult character study refusing to hand Mavis the redemptive arc we’ve grown accustomed to, taking her close to profound realisation before dragging her back down into darkness. I’ve never grown tired of rewatching Mavis – deluded, drunk and devoid of empathy – stubbornly resist change and betterment. Maybe because there’s something both bitterly realistic and selfishly reassuring about watching someone slide from the relatable (a sneering drive through her anonymous retail park-riddled home town is notnotsomething I have also done) to the tragic (recounting a high school miscarriage and fear that her body is broken) to the fully monstrous (telling Buddy’s warm and accommodating wife that she fucking hates her, akin to watching a puppy get drop-kicked). Mavis might go far, far over the edge, but I never would.

A spin through their back catalogue is a parade of prize pigs: Gabriel Byrne’s duplicitous Tom Reagan in Miller’s Crossing, George Clooney’s smirking Ulysses Everett McGill in O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Oscar Isaac’s super-irritating folkie in Inside Llewyn Davis. (While not exactly hateful, Michael Stuhlbarg’s Larry Gopnik in A Serious Man is a prime example of what they used to call a wet blanket.) In the spirit of boosting the superb Marty Supreme, I’d like to point out that every one of these films is brilliant – and perhaps in the chef’s kiss of Coen counterintuition, arguably their greatest film contains their most annoying protagonist: Barton Fink. (Even his name is irritating.) Fink is someone who is painfully awkward and overweeningly arrogant, neurotically intellectual and self-centredly unaware, supercilious and chip-on-the-shoulderish, all at the same time. He couldn’t be more dislikeable … and yet, like Marty Mauser, it gives the character a restless, questing energy that makes him a compelling eyeball-magnet for everything that happens. What saves both of them (or “redeems” in the script-readers’ vernacular) is that neither are actively horrible or evil; there’s some spark of morality underneath it all. I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies.Andrew PulverBarton Fink is available on the Criterion Channel in the US, YouTube in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaWren – SmithereensView image in fullscreenSusan Berman in Smithereens.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyConsider Smithereens the grittier older sister of Desperately Seeking Susan, director Susan Seidelman’s better-known Madonna vehicle. Obnoxious does not begin to accurately describe its hero, Wren, a New Jersey refugee who flees to New York in hopes of making it big in the punk scene. (Doing what, exactly, is beside the point.) She’s a charmless social climber who constantly big leagues the only friend she’s ever had, a van-dwelling beatnik type named Paul. Instead, she has her eyes on a fictionalized version of Richard Hell, played by the Voidoid himself (wouldn’t you?). I give Wren maybe too many passes. I love her fabulous outfits – someday I hope to find a dupe of the fuzzy pink coat she wears waiting for me at a thrift store – and the way she wakes up every morning after ripping her life to shreds the night before. Sure, Wren’s aloof, rude and manic in her desires. Male leads have gotten away with much worse for the eternity of film history. I can’t help but root for her.Alaina DemopoulosSmithereens is available on HBO Max and the Criterion Channel in the US, Amazon Prime in the UK, and Plex in AustraliaIngrid Thorburn – Ingrid Goes WestView image in fullscreenAubrey Plaza in Ingrid Goes West.Photograph: PRNo one can argue that Ingrid, a deeply unwell woman played by Aubrey Plaza in Matt Spicer’s underrated 2017 thriller Ingrid Goes West, does the right things. We meet her fresh out of a psychiatric facility, where she was relegated after pepper-spraying a bride at a wedding she wasn’t invited to, and follow her west, where she latches on to the persona played online by influencer Taylor (Elizabeth Olsen) and wheedles into her avocado toast life. And yet I still root for Ingrid, as she is the personification of a dark and under-explored part of all our internet-addled brains – the part that implicitly understands the precise currency of envy in our culture, that fixates on certain faces, that remembers the exact details of a stranger’s engagement party. That relishes comeuppance, craves validations and burns with corrosive anger when everyone from wannabe influencers to celebrities win the attention economy with obvious falsehoods (Kendall Jenner’sclaimthat Accutane permanently shrinks your nose? Please). A part of me gets Ingrid’s quest, her disillusionment and rage. I do not endorse vigilante accountability for the fake and successfully boring, but I do enjoy watching it.Adrian HortonIngrid Goes West is available on Kanopy in the US, YouTube in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaPatrick Bateman – American PsychoView image in fullscreenPatrick Bateman in American Psycho.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarAfter many failed attempts to adapt American Psycho into a film – including a cracked screenplay written byBret Easton Ellisthat ended atop the World Trade Center, and potential involvement from David Cronenberg, Brad Pitt, Oliver Stone and even Leonardo DiCaprio – relatively unknown Mary Harron, fresh off of showing I Shot Andy Warhol at Cannes, completed a screenplay with actor Guinevere Turner and cast Christian Bale as the star. Harron’s satire of toxic masculinity and corporate greed is as dark as they come – there’s the infamous scene of serial killer Patrick Bateman frustratedly trying to figure out how to feed a stray cat to an ATM, and the running joke throughout is that being a sociopathic murderer fails to make him stand out from his colleagues in finance. Bateman’s utter odiousness is essential to the film’s schizoid world, where he robotically delivers a solipsistic monologue on Phil Collins before staging a porn shoot with two sex workers, or where he holds a nail gun to the back of his unknowing secretary’s head while politely toying with seducing her. It’s all in the service of constructing an aesthetic realm that’s nothing but slick surfaces, a film about the loneliness and utter emptiness of sociopathy, the ultimate hell of living in a world where nothing that you do matters at all. There’s a reason Harmon’s feminist revision of the book has steadily gained a cult following as the world has moved through the relatively placid 1990s and into a new gilded age ruled by the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump. Bale’s Bateman may be utterly unlikable, but he’s far from unrecognizable.Veronica EspositoAmerican Psycho is available on Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US, Netflix in the UK, and Netflix and Stan in AustraliaRoger Greenberg – GreenbergView image in fullscreenBen Stiller in Greenberg.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyWatch certain groups ofNoah Baumbachfilms – his early comedies, his collaborations with Greta Gerwig or his new movie, Jay Kelly – and you wouldn’t particularly think of him as chronicling especially unlikable or even particularly disagreeable characters. Many of them are downright charming. But if you catch him in the right period – most especially between 2005 and 2010 – his movies can seem like endurance exercises for the cringe-averse. That’s particularly true of the title character in his 2010 film Greenberg, played by Ben Stiller. Many Baumbach protagonists struggle with the disappointments of ageing, whether in their teens, 20s, 30s or in Greenberg’s case, mid-40s; Stiller, with his uniquely prickly comic style and talent for getting hung up on the details, turns that struggle into something at once symphonic and redolent of a stubborn, lonely solo. What makes the unemployable-seeming Greenberg, a middling handyman and ex-musician who can barely handle dog-sitting for his brother, so delightful to me is his ill-timed but honest rage bombs, whether carefully set and delivered into the ether (like a series of hilariously petty complaint letters) or thrown with self-conscious self-destructiveness (he modifies “youth is wasted on the young” to “life is wasted on people”). He’s abrasive, self-centered and caustic in a way that certain viewers will (and I assume Baumbach and Stiller did) find uncomfortably relatable. The film understands that insecure, adolescent impulses don’t always escape through frat-boy immaturity; sometimes they emerge through very real frustrations with the way life defies expectations.Jesse HassengerGreenberg is available to rent digitallyPansy Deacon – Hard TruthsView image in fullscreenMarianne Jean-Baptiste in Hard Truths.Photograph: Simon Mein/APPansy Deacon is the sort of brutally unlikable character who finds little, if any, redemption. She remains pretty much awful from the beginning to the end of Mike Leigh’s shattering 2024 character study, Hard Truths. There is a moment of cathartic laughter in the film, and a scene of something like reconciliation between Pansy and her cheerful sister. But otherwise, Leigh and actor Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s frightening creation remains a howling locus of resentment, anxiety and cruelty. She’s a stunning character, loathsome and only the faintest bit pitiable. Pansy is so vivid in her miserableness that, beyond some critics groups, awards bodies seemingly found it impossible to welcome Jean-Baptiste into their festivities last year. Which was disappointing. But that snubbing was also a testament to the dazzling, exacting craft of Hard Truths. I still find myself thinking of Pansy from time to time, hoping dumbly that she’s found a way out of her malaise, but knowing that she would probably swat away such sentiment with a derisive laugh, or a monologue about how pointless it is to try to care for her.Richard LawsonHard Truths is available on Paramount+ in the US, Netflix in the UK and to rent digitally in AustraliaDaniel Plainview – There Will Be BloodView image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs spirit animals go, Daniel Plainview isn’t one you’d immediately race to adopt from the pound, but there’s something irresistibly bracing about his approach. Rare is the week in which the line “I can’t keep doing this on my own, with these … people” doesn’t pop into my conscious. Yes, he’s flawed – a cold-hearted, child-abandoning, resource-sucking murderer, etc, etc – but he’s also exhilaratingly focused and honest (clue is in the name). He’s also, just to play literal devil’s advocate, very good at his job, at times a sweet and loving parent, and, when it comes to false prophets at least, bang on the money. Quentin Tarantino thinksThere Will Be Blooddoesn’t work because of Paul Dano – nuts, of course, because the film isn’t intended as a two-hander (and Dano is great anyway). What’s certain is that the movie wouldn’t work were its tar-hearted antihero not also funny, formidable and – whisper it – relatable. Plus: loves bowling!Catherine ShoardThere Will Be Blood is available on Paramount+ in the US and UK and Stan in AustraliaCharles Foster Kane – Citizen KaneView image in fullscreenOrson Welles in Citizen Kane.Photograph: SNAP/Rex FeaturesCharles Foster Kane is the towering blueprint for so many cynical and enduring cinematic figures we are simultaneously enthralled and repulsed by. Think Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood or Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, characters who exist a century apart, and in Kane’s shadow, embodying an American dream that is insatiable, corruptible and often fuelled by contempt. For at least half a century,Citizen Kanehad been widely named the greatest film of all time (chiefly on the Sight & Sound critics poll), largely celebrated for its form (its use of deep focus taught in almost every intro to film class). But the film’s emotional power comes from Orson Welles’s enigmatic portrayal of the predatory and rather pathetic Kane, the media baron inspired by William Randolph Hearst, and admired by Donald Trump. Kane preaches about speaking truth to power, but only insofar as it serves him. His youthful idealism and principles are as thin as and disposable (literally) as the paper they’re printed on. It’s easy to be seduced by his ambitions, not to mention the bluster and silky-smooth charisma he so skilfully weaponizes, before it all sours and curdles – you know, like the American dream.Radheyan SimonpillaiCitizen Kane is available to rent digitally in the US, on the BFI Player and iPlayer in the UK, and to rent digitally in AustraliaMarla Grayson – I Carea LotView image in fullscreenRosamund Pike in I Care a Lot.Photograph: Seacia Pavao/APIfRosamund Pikewere standing in front of a decimated building holding a bomb detonator, telling me she didn’t do anything, I could believe her. There’s aje ne sais quoito her characters’ malice that invites you into different definitions of right and wrong – where the bottom line matters and a vicious heart is still a heart. Like she did in Gone Girl, Pike – with a velvet voice and razor-sharp bob – plugs self-righteousness into I Care a Lot’s Marla Grayson to become a perfect stone-cold but sweet-smiling antihero. In the 2020 crime thriller, Grayson is a court-appointed legal guardian who’s like an aggressive leech: sucking vulnerable, helpless elderly people dry of their savings; she’s more sharp-tongued and seasoned than first-time killer Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, and at almost every point you don’t know if she’s going to go in for a comforting hug or if she’s going to bait an old person into attacking her (both happen). Grayson expounds on a nasty, quiet part of greed within many of us: if you could take money from someone for yourself, if no one would really know – if you’re beautiful and have experienced love and are devilishly self-aware – it’s OK to force drugs into a man’s body or to convince a judge someone is going senile. It’s a heinous thing, being a predator of the lowest rungs, but when Pike appalls you, she supplies a little thrill with it: you feel a little more alive.Tammy TarngI Care a Lot is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmThere Will Be BloodMarianne Jean-BaptisteBen StillerNoah BaumbachCharlize TheronAubrey PlazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a line that feels like a mantra for the Scottish band 30 years and 10 albums in: they’re currently touring 2025’s Futique having come through a rough period. They experienced major burnout, band members fell out for the first time and founding member James Johnston pulled out of this tour due to mental health and addiction issues. But their new songs feel rooted in renewal, reconnection and newfound purpose. Neil pays tribute to his departed bandmate on the urgent and zippy Friendshipping, which is an ode to the importance of maintaining such relationships.Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil: ‘We took Slayer’s Dave Lombardo to Todmorden for a curry and a pint’Read moreFutique was recorded in Berlin; the band said that the ghosts of Bowie, Iggy and Nick Cave’s the Birthday Party “bled into the songs”. No such art-pop apparitions feel present tonight. Instead there’s a rousing pop sensibility to these new tracks. Goodbye is a slow-burn ballad that explodes into an arms-aloft anthem, while Shot One embodies the band’s knack for merging sugary melodies and meaty riffs – existing in the blurred middle ground between rock, pop and metal that they comfortably own.View image in fullscreenBiffy Clyro performing in Nottingham.Photograph: Luke Brennan/Getty ImagesThere’s plenty of older material too. The dual violins on That Golden Rule add a tense and wiry stab that synchronises with the audience’s air punches. Mountains sets the audience into a mass of pogoing bodies and screaming lungs, while the stripped-back acoustic delivery of Machines slows things down to a gentle whisper.At their most eruptive, the band are brutally loud. Their ability to make taut, tight riffs explode into something enormous and overblown, as on a thunderous Living Is a Problem Because Everything Dies, is piercing and arresting. While occasionally things feel a tad familiar and repetitive over the near two-hour stretch, the closing one-two of Bubbles and Many of Horror is a potent and triumphant sign-off. Huge confetti cannons explode as the band and audience scream proudly in unison: “We are Biffy fucking Clyro!” Then they leave the stage having successfully conquered Nottingham.Biffy Clyro playthe O2 Arena, London, on 14 January, then tour the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and play festivalsExplore more on these topicsBiffy ClyroPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet as the US looks back, precious repositories of the nation’s history are facing an uncertain future.Trump’s assault on the Smithsonian: ‘The goal is to reframe the entire culture of the US’Read moreMuseum attendances are down. Budgets are precarious. Cuts in federal funding are taking their toll. And Donald Trump’sculture warsare spreading fear, intimidation and self-censorship among some directors and donors.The alarm was sounded late last yearby a surveyconducted by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), which showed institutions facing significant headwinds and a fragile, inconsistent recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.“It revealed some sobering news, which was that recovery from the pandemic wasn’t just coming to a stall but actually reversing,” saysNatanya Khashan, associate vice-president of marketing and digital experience at the AAM.“We’re seeing declines in attendance, weaker financial performance and growing instability across the museum field thanks to some of the new economic and policy pressures that have emerged.”The survey of 511 museum directors conducted in July and August 2025 found that only 45% of museums reported attendance at or above their 2019 pre-pandemic levels. This was a decline from 2024, when 51% had reached that milestone.About 52% of museums reported a stronger bottom line in 2024 than pre-pandemic, a downturn from the prior survey, in which 57% reported improvement in 2023. Meanwhile 26% reported a weaker bottom line, worse than the 19% who reported declines in the previous survey. Projections for 2025 are less optimistic than they were for 2024.The Trump effect is being felt through executive orders and federal cuts: 34% of museums suffered the cancellation of government grants or contracts; 29% saw a decrease in attendance due to changes in travel/tourism and/or economic uncertainty; 18% experienced changes to the scope of their government grants/ contracts; 13% are subject to new legal restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activities. Only 31% of museums reported no impact at all.For those affected by cancelled grants, the median loss was $30,000, the survey found. Lost grants were most commonly from theInstitute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS), theNational Endowment for the Humanities(NEH) and theNational Endowment for the Arts(NEA).View image in fullscreenThe National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianAmong museums that lost federal funds, 35% had to defer or delay facility improvements, 28% cancelled or reduced public programming and 24% cancelled or reduced programming specifically for students, rural communities, individuals with disabilities, the elderly and/or veterans.Khashan says: “The most direct impact we’re seeing as it pertains to the administration is the federal grant cancellations that have happened this year. About one-third of museums reported losing federal grants in 2025.“This is often mid-project and most museums have not been able to replace that funding and that has downstream effects: many of these organisations are planning capital renovations and things of that nature, so architects, design firms, other for-profit businesses are also losing business because of those cuts. Not to mention, of course, the impact on communities that are experiencing cancelled programmes or reduced capacity in museums or increased prices.”Critically, 67% of museums reported that this lost funding had not been replaced by foundations, sponsors or donors. Only 8% reported the funding was fully replaced. Khashan added: “While we have seen some foundations step up to fill the gaps, particularly for those organisations that they were already engaged with, we’re seeing that isn’t going to bridge the gap for everyone.”Among those affected is theBerkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive(BAMPFA) at the University of California in Berkeley, which has about 30,000 square feet of gallery space and 120,000 visitors a year. In 2019 BAMPFA received a bequest of more than 3,000 African American quilts, the biggest collection of its kind.But in April it learned the federal government hadcancelled two grants, worth a total of $260,000, for conservation of the quilts. Julie Rodrigues Widholm, executive director of BAMPFA, recalls: “That was devastating because there’s an urgency to restoring the quilts. They’re textiles and it’s important that we not let this work linger so that was disorienting for us institutionally.“It was hard to navigate an understanding because it was so unprecedented to be told from the government that the grant was cancelled because it no longer aligned with American priorities. There was a lot of confusion around the legality of that.”The loss of funding received media coverage, which became a catalyst for new funders to step up and plug the gap. Widholm adds: “We were able to replace the lost amount from IMLS, which was fantastic and allowed us to continue the work and showed that our community and funders care deeply about this work that we’re doingto bring attention to this under-recognized part of American art history of African American mostly women quilt makers from the 20th century.”But she cautions: “We still need more funding and it’s a very tough moment right now in general for philanthropy in the United States because of economic uncertainty and declining federal engagement with the arts or putting certain parameters around what will be funded by the government at this time. We’re having to get creative and think about how we can engage more deeply with individual donors.”The 250th anniversary of US independence is likely to witness a struggle over American identity. The Trump administration has made aggressive efforts toreshape the Smithsonian Institutionand other cultural bodies to align with a nationalist, “anti-woke” agenda. The president’s executive orders and political pressure led to the resignation of Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, and prompted accusations of self-censorship among some curators.View image in fullscreenRouted West: Twentieth-Century African American Quilts in California installation.Photograph: Chris GrunderFederal officials are now demanding extensive reviews of exhibition content, aiming to replace narratives about systemic injustice with a more triumphalist view of American history. While some private museums remain insulated by their funding models, some observers warn of a chilling effect that could further damage funding and visitors numbers.Stephen Reily, former directorof the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky, says: “There’s a trickle-down wariness of controversy by institutions and institutional funders. You hope that museums won’t stop trying to be relevant with the art they exhibit. That doesn’t have to mean offensive or politically controversial but if they just become watered down then they’re going to exacerbate the challenges they’re facing already.”In Tulsa, Oklahoma, theGreenwood Risingmuseum is dedicated to telling the story of the city’s historic Greenwood district – known as Black Wall Street – and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. It opened in 2021 on the 100th anniversary of the massacre, has about 12 employees with an average annual budget between $1.5m and $2m. It does not receive federal funding.Raymond Doswell, its executive director, says the museum is focusing on marketing and outreach but the current political climate could affect future fundraising efforts.“We can tell that, especially from corporate givers, they’re very concerned about the language of diversity and those kinds of things and how that might be seen.“Moreover, a lot of friends both in the corporate and philanthropic world are having to step in to help other institutions, other non-profits who have been struggling and who have been reliant very heavily on both federal and state dollars to do lot of different kinds of work outside education and the arts. It means that there’s support for institutions like ours but probably less so because there’s some real need out there and folks are pivoting to try to help with that need.”Looking ahead to 2026, museum leaders expect major disruptions from shifts in philanthropy, inflation, financial instability and the continued reduction of government funding. But Doswell remains optimistic about America’s semiquincentennial.View image in fullscreenMembers of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, with Kevin Matthews in front, cheer while getting their picture taken in front of the Greenwood Rising Black Wall Street History Center.Photograph: Mike Simons/APHe adds: “We’re going to find how much we rely on institutions to help tell these stories. There’s some things that we are not going to be able to get around in terms of storytelling and some of that stuff apparently is going to be uncomfortable for a lot of people but it’s going to a battle between truth and propaganda. There’s going to be a strain on national institutions folks like us, the smaller institutions, I feel very grounded in what we need to do and what we have to say.”Museums haveweathered storms before, notably the Great Depression of the 1930s. ButMarjorie Schwarzer, author of Riches, Rivals and Radicals: A History of Museums in the United States and a retired professor ofmuseum history at the University of San Francisco, points out they have never had to deal with a figure like Trump.She says:“Museums are focused on their mission and the public trust and they have been since the 1880s. They are not used to having to think about one individual who’s the president. This is completely antithetical to the field.“This is throwing everybody off. He’s so direct. I read the most recent threat to the Smithsonian and it made absolutely no sense; it was busting my brain cells. Like, what are they asking for? It was out and out bullying. This is what’s different and it is rippling into the field.”Although the US has more robust culture of donor support and cultural philanthropy than Britain, this too could be eroded by fear of Trump’s efforts to rewrite history. Schwarzer warns: “Funders are going to be careful. I’ve heard stories told to me in confidence by directors of exhibitions being cancelled, not because of federal funding or Trump funding but because other funders are worried about the political fallout.”Federal money has been crucial, Schwarzer adds, for helping US museums push new boundaries. “You get periods of innovation like after thebicentennial celebrationin the 1970s: you had this big rise of funding and this is where you get children’s programmes and programmes for people with disabilities and neighbourhood exhibits and exciting new kinds of exhibition strategies, new technologies. If you don’t have the funding to jumpstart that, you’re going to see the field is not going be able to do those kinds of programmes.”Now, as other countries do innovative work, the US risks losing its “leadership edge”, she warns. “The 20th century and the early 21st century were when US museums took a leadership position and moved the field way forward. Now we’re not going to be able to play that role within the international museum community the way we have done for the last 100, 120 years. That mirrors universities, mirrors journalism, mirrors all of these fields.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsDonald TrumpArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Saldaña’s films have now made more than $15.46bn worldwide, according tothe Numbers.The number has been achieved thanks to Saldaña’s previousAvatarfilms and her Marvel role as Gamora in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and the Avengers movies. Saldaña has also found hits with the Star Trek movies and the first Pirates of the Caribbean film.Last year saw Johansson rise to the top after Jurassic World Rebirth made $869m worldwide. The actor has also appeared in multiple Marvel films.Avatar: Fire and Ash has been tracking behind the previous films in the franchise at the box office but has remained at the domestic No 1 spot since its release in December.

Justone in three 8- to 18-year-oldsnow say they enjoy reading in their spare time. Only 26% of boys read for pleasure, compared to 39% of girls. More than a quarter of children are leaving primary schoolhaving not reached the reading ageof an 11-year-old.Unveiled on Tuesday at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, the campaign brings together schools, families, libraries, businesses and cultural organisations, alongside a high-profile group of ambassadors including captain of the England women’s football team Williamson, authors Osman and Cressida Cowell, musician and writer George the Poet, and actorPaterson Joseph, among others.Launching the initiative, the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, said reading had been central to her own childhood. “Some of my happiest childhood memories are of reading with my grandad, getting lost in The Chronicles of Narnia together,” she said. “I want every child to feel that same joy, whether their passion is football, fantasy, or physics.”Phillipson described reversing the decline in reading for pleasure as “a national mission”, adding: “Through the National Year of Reading and our Plan for Change we are making sure every child and young person has access to a wide range of books.” She urged families to “read together for just 10 minutes a day”.The campaign encourages people to read about what they already love, in whatever format suits them, including novels, comics, blogs or audiobooks.“Pick up a book, listen to an audiobook, get stuck into articles on whatever you love,” said Williamson. “It all counts.”Osman said he was proud to support the National Year of Reading 2026, adding: “in an increasingly noisy, complicated world, reading is our quiet superpower.”Jonathan Douglas, chief executive of the NationalLiteracyTrust, said the campaign offered “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvigorate the UK’s relationship with reading and change people’s life stories”. He added: “Whether it’s a baby experiencing the magic of a picture book for the first time … or an adult reading the football pages on their commute, reading is for everyone.”The initiative builds on existing government measures – including a new mandatory reading test for all pupils in year 8, a £5m investment to support reading in secondary schools, and a £10m investment to make sure every primary school in England has a library by the end of this parliament – and will feature national events, local activities and a drive to recruit 100,000 literacy volunteers across the UK.Explore more on these topicsBooksLiteracyLeah WilliamsonRichard OsmanJulia DonaldsonMichael MorpurgoCressida CowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Further announcements will be made if and when appropriate.”Reuters first reported news of the talks, citing a source claiming that any deal was expected to include All3Media injecting funds into the merged entity because it was the smaller of the two companies.If a deal is struck, the scale of the merger is likely to mean that it will be subject to scrutiny by the UK competition watchdog, as well as by the equivalent regulator inEurope, where Banijay holds a large share in markets such as France and Italy.Banijay was founded in 2008 and merged seven years later with Zodiak, the owner of UK producers including the Faking It maker RDF.It struck a $2.2bn (£1.6bn) deal in 2019 to buy Endemol Shine Group, the maker of shows including MasterChef,Big Brotherand Black Mirror, to create the largest TV producer outside the US. The group’s stable includes more than 130 TV production and creative businesses across more than 25 territories.All3Media has 50 different labels and has produced some of the most popular shows of recent years. They include Fleabag, Shameless and Squid Game: the Challenge.There were reports last year that ITV and RedBird IMI had held talks to merge ITV Studios with All3Media.The move prompted Banijay to also explore a takeover offer of ITV Studios, the maker of shows including Love Island, I’m a Celebrity and the hit drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, although no formal offer was made.View image in fullscreenCelebrity Big Brother is produced by Initial, part of Banijay UK.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/REX/Shutterstock for Big BrotherIn November, Comcast, the parent company ofSky, entered talksto buy ITV’s broadcasting businessfor about £1.6bn.Banijay made headlines last summer when its investigation into the BBC One show MasterChefupheld 45 allegationsagainst the host Gregg Wallace, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact, and oneagainst the co-presenter John Torode of using racist language.

He wrote: “Many of them, whether alive or recently deceased, have pointed out mistakes, impoverishments and trivialisations of the language, only to find that the now-dominant sector of the academy – the ‘anything goes’ Taliban – ignores them or treats them as respectable, but irrelevant, opinions.“That is really serious because writers don’t just preserve the language, they work with it and project it into the future.”Founded in 1713, the RAE is entrusted with ensuring that “the changes experienced by the Spanish language in its constant adaptation to the needs of its speakers do not break the essential unity it maintains throughout the Hispanic world”.Pérez-Reverte was particularly dismissive of the argument that the academy exists to record language rather than set out rules for its correct use. “If all majority usage, however vulgar or incorrect, is automatically considered valid, the very notion of correctness loses its meaning,” he wrote.“And therein lies one of the problems. The current RAE accepts constructions that years ago it would have considered erroneous, not after in-depth linguistic debate, but due to external pressure. It yields too easily and frequently to mere media, political or social media usage.”According to Pérez-Reverte, much of the blame lies with social media and the academy’s embrace of its terminologies.“The RAE’s subservience to social media is damaging its image,” he said. “Academic standards are becoming colloquial; rigour is negotiable. Anything goes, and any bold ignoramus can, if they persevere, take precedence over Cervantes, Galdós or García Márquez.”The academy did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment, but sources theretold the Europa Pressnews ageny that Pérez-Reverte’s complaints, which it described as “a personal and, of course, respectable opinion”, would be rigorously analysed.“The RAE plenary will verify whether it has the support of any other academics, the scope and accuracy of the data on which it is based, and, if necessary, will propose the appropriate measures to urgently correct, to the extent possible, the operational shortcomings that academician Pérez-Reverte has made public,” the sources said.“It will begin debating them immediately, and it is expected that the academician will be able to present and defend his proposals before the institution’s plenary session.”Explore more on these topicsSpainSocial mediaLanguageDigital mediaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking at AARP’s Movies for Grownups awards on 10 January, Clooney said: “By the way, Paul Dano and Owen Wilson and Matthew Lillard, I would be honoured to work with those actors. Honoured.”Clooney continued by describing his new film, Noah Baumbach’sJay Kelly, as a movie “made by people who love actors – that’s an important part. People I’ve known most of my life … actually, most of them are actors. I have a great affinity [for them], and I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel.”“We are living in a time of cruelty,” Clooney concluded. “We don’t need to be adding to it.”In December 2025, Tarantino faced considerable backlash for his critiques of actors Paul Dano, Matthew Lillard andOwen Wilsonwhile appearing on Bret Easton Ellis’s podcast. The director said There Will Be Blood would have ranked higher than No 5 on his personal list of the best films of the century so far, were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis’s co-star.“[It] would stand a good chance at being No 1 or 2 if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it … and the flaw isPaul Dano,” Tarantino said. “Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander, but it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He’s a weak sister.”Tarantino continued by describing Dano as “such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy”, “the weakest fucking actor” in the Screen Actors Guild”, and confirmed that he had never enjoyed his performance in anything. “I don’t care for him,” he said. “I don’t care for Owen Wilson, and I don’t care for Matthew Lillard.”View image in fullscreenA poster for From Dusk Till Dawn, which co-starred Clooney and Tarantino.Photograph: Cinetext/Miramax/AllstarClooney has previously shared the screen with Lillard in Alexander Payne’s Oscar-winning 2011 film The Descendants, and co-starred with Wilson in Wes Anderson’s stop-motion adaptation of Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). He is yet to collaborate with Dano.Many of Dano’s former co-workers defended the actor following Tarantino’s attack, including Ben Stiller, Batman director Matt Reeves, and Day-Lewis, whose representativestoldthe Guardian he agreed with the sentiments expressed in an Instagram fan post declaring Dano “one of the best and most talented actors of his generation”.Speaking at a fan convention a few days after Tarantino’s critique, Lillard said his words had been damaging. “It fucking sucks,” he said. “And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood. I’m very popular in this room. I’m not very popular in Hollywood. Two totally different microcosms, right? And so, you know, it’s humbling, and it hurts.”Wilson has yet to comment.Clooney and Tarantino worked on Robert Rodriguez’s 1996 film From Dusk Till Dawn but have not teamed up since and their relationship has been chequered.“Quentin said some shit about me recently, so I’m a little irritated by him,” Clooney toldGQlast year. “He did some interview where he was naming movie stars, and he was talking about [Brad Pitt], and somebody else, and then this guy goes, ‘Well, what about George?’ He goes, ‘He’s not a movie star.’”Explore more on these topicsFilmGeorge ClooneyQuentin TarantinoPaul DanoOwen WilsonAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

Nail clippings on the sofa! The new TV romance so realistic it’s close to perfectFans of Normal People and One Day will adore The New Years, which follows a relatable on-off couple in Madrid. It is the best relationship drama you haven’t seen yetElle HuntTue 13 Jan 2026 07.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareIt is rare to watch a fictional romance and feel genuinely invested in the question of will-they-won’t-they – and even rarer for it to reflect familiar relationship turbulence. Many love stories on TV skip straight to wish-fulfilment, delivering instant chemistry, no challenges that can’t be overcome within the runtime and glib reassurance that Love Conquers All.Netflix’sNobody Wants This, for instance – based on a real couple, and ostensibly exploring whether a relationship can survive differences of faith – didn’t wait to resolve that question before bringing its leads together. In real life, promising connections fall at much lower hurdles, for such banal reasons as incompatible schedules.So I’ve been thrilled to stumble upon a series that is not only redolent of real-life love, but understands that payoffs must be earned.The New Years(Los Años Nuevos), a Spanish miniseries streaming on Mubi, makes every other TV romance look as if it was scripted by AI; I’d say it is close to perfect.Over 10 episodes, each set on New Year’s Eve, it follows the evolving romance of Óscar and Ana, from hooking up, to falling in love, then – gradually, in familiar ways – coming apart. Despite the decade-long scope, it’s not an especially grand love story; it is more truthful, exploring a formative connection and its ebbs and flows over time. Think Normal People or One Day, set in Madrid.View image in fullscreenMore true-to-life than instant fireworks … The New Years.Photograph: MubiWhen we meet Óscar (Francesco Carril), on the last day of 2015, he is preoccupied by medical school and morose after a breakup. Free-spirited Ana (Iria del Río) hasn’t yet found her path but has big plans of moving abroad. Both are turning 30, and initially bond at a mutual friend’s house party over the fact their birthdays fall either side of the New Year.Of course they get together – but not at once. When their hookup is cut short by Óscar’s on-off ex, it’s a year until they reconnect; a year after that, they’re in a relationship but still getting to know each other. The stop-start trajectory is more true to life than instant fireworks (who hasn’t had some loose ends to tie up?) and brings the audience along on their deepening bond.Óscar and Ana are not just playing their parts in “boy meets girl”, going through the motions until they are granted their happy-ever-after, but individuals with their own ambitions, hangups and fears. Their somewhat stilted early encounters highlight their differences as much as their chemistry: Óscar is inclined to be dour, and also to worry about being perceived as dour, such as when he frets about what music to play during their first intimate encounter (relatable!). Ana, though not as confident as she appears, is independent, headstrong and sometimes selfish: when her friends throw her a birthday surprise, she ditches them for a party.These naturalistic details give The New Years a wonderfully lived-in feel. As the years go by, traditions are carried over, such as eating grapes at midnight; but characters change as they reappear: a friend will go from racking up lines of cocaine in one episode to being exhausted by new parenthood the next. Likewise, by dropping in on a single day, we see how Óscar and Ana’s relationship has developed in the previous 12 months through changes in the way they navigate conversation, domestic challenges and familiar frustrations with family.Over time they learn to accommodate each other, then grow together. Óscar initially rejects Ana’s armchair analysis of the impact of his upbringing; a year later, we see he has adopted her view. And along the way, naturally, there’s lots of sex – which, though explicit, resembles actual sex, with awkward manoeuvring, laughter and varying levels of passion.View image in fullscreenGrapes at midnight! … The New Years.Photograph: MubiBy episode four, the couple are living together, still charmed by each other’s idiosyncrasies (she clips her nails on the couch; he pees sitting down) and crowing to their parents about their effortless division of labour. Their parents humour them, opting to let time teach them the lesson that the course of true love never did run smooth.Soon enough, the differences that attracted Ana and Óscar to each other in the first place threaten to cast them apart as her adventurousness chafes against his caution. It’s not too much of a spoiler to say that the honeymoon period concludes on holiday in Berlin, with a disastrous night out at Berghain (where else!).So many of Óscar and Ana’s highs and lows spark poignant or painful recognition: the thrill of meeting a stranger and realising the attraction is mutual. The exhilaration that comes with overcoming your first challenges “as a couple”. The sinking realisation that love alone might not be enough.With eight episodes now out and two to go, I don’t know how Ana and Óscar will find their way back to each other. I trust that they will, because the rules of narrative demand it – but their happy ending will be all the more meaningful for having been hard-won.The New Years is onMubinowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionSpainMubiDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then it fell apartRanda Abdel-Fattah, who is Palestinian Australian, has faced criticism for controversial comments on Israel, including alleging Zionists had ‘no claim or right to cultural safety’Caitlin CassidyTue 13 Jan 2026 03.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 03.23 ESTShareWhen the board of a South Australian festival cut a prominent Palestinian Australian author from its lineup, citing her “past statements” in the context of the deadly Bondi terror attack, it no doubt braced itself for controversy.What it may not have foreseen, however, is an implosion.Five days after theAdelaide festivalboard announced it had removed Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from its writers’ week lineup,more than 180 speakershad boycotted the event, almost the entire board along with thefestival’s directorhad resigned, and the2026 writers’ week had been cancelled.Jacinda Ardern pulls out of Adelaide writers’ week as fallout over Randa Abdel-Fattah’s axing continuesRead moreOn Thursday 8 January, the board released a statement confirming Abdel-Fattah, a critic of Israel, would no longer appear at the festival, citing “cultural sensitivity” concerns after a review in the wake of theBondi terror attack.The board said that it did not suggest “in any way” that Abdel-Fattah had a connection with the December shooting deaths of 15 people at Bondi beach on the first day of the Jewish festival Hanukah, allegedly by two men inspired by Islamic State.The statement continued that the decision was made “given her past statements”.Abdel-Fattah, who is Palestinian Australian, has facedsustained criticismfrom Australia’s conservative opposition, some Jewish bodies and media outlets for comments on Israel, including alleging Zionists had “no claim or right to cultural safety”.On Tuesday, Abdel-Fattah rejected any suggestion she had made antisemitic comments in the past, telling ABC RadioAdelaidethat she had “never, ever called for Jews to be unsafe”.“Zionism is not a racial or religious identity, it is a political ideology. It is as absurd as saying that communists have the right to cultural safety or Islamism or white supremacy or misogyny,” she said.“I have sat in rooms where people have said that ethnic cleansing of Palestinians is justified. I am entitled to say there should be no space for people to call for genocide.”Abdel-Fattah also faced backlash for posting “May 2025 be the end of Israel” and changing her profile picture to a picture of a Palestinian paratrooper after the 7 October attacks.Abdel-Fattah told the ABC in an interview she had used the image when she had “no idea about the death toll”.“Of course, I do not support the killing of civilians,” she said.After the board’s decision was made public, Abdel-Fattah accused it of “blatant and shameless” anti-Palestinian racism and censorship.She said the board’s attempt to associate her with the Bondi massacre was “despicable”.The same afternoon, a string of Australian writers, publishers and thinktanks issued their own withdrawal statements. The former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, the bestselling author Zadie Smith, Russian American journalist Masha Gessen, the Pulitzer prize-winning writer Percival Everett and one of Australia’s most decorated writers, Helen Garner, dropped out in the days that followed.On Tuesday 13 January, the director of Adelaide writers’ week, which is part ofAdelaide festival, followed suit.Louise Adler resigns as director of Adelaide writers’ weekRead moreLouise Adler, who is also one of Australia’s most influential literary figures and a member of the progressive Jewish Council of Australia, announced her resignation in anopinion piece published in Guardian Australia.“I cannot be party to silencing writers, so with a heavy heart I am resigning from my role as the director of the AWW,” wrote Adler.“Writers and writing matters, even when they are presenting ideas that discomfort and challenge us. We need writers now more than ever, as our media closes up, as our politicians grow daily more cowed by real power, as Australia grows more unjust and unequal.”Hours later, theboard announcedAdelaide writers’ week could “no longer go ahead as scheduled” and apologised to Abdel-Fattah for “how the decision was represented”.It said allremaining members of the boardwould step down immediately, with the exception of a local council representative whose term expired in February.“As a board we took this action out of respect for a community experiencing the pain from a devastating event,” the board said in a statement.“Instead, this decision has created more division and for that we express our sincere apologies.”In a statement, Abdel-Fattah said she rejected the festival board’s apology, accusing it of being “disingenuous” and saying it “adds insult to injury”.“It is clear that the board’s regret extends to how the message of my cancellation was conveyed, not the decision itself,” she wrote.The South Australian government, which hasdenied that it exerted pressureon the festival’s leadership to disinvite Abdel-Fattah, announced the members of a new board on Tuesday evening.The minister for the arts, Andrea Michaels, said the festival was a “treasured institution” that “transcends any individual”.Adelaide writers’ week is Australia’s largest free literary festival, drawing more than 160,000 people last year and contributing $62.6m to South Australia’s economy. It is jointly funded by the state government and philanthropists.Adler told Guardian Australia the cancellation of AWW was “no surprise”.“It was untenable,” she said. “There were 165 sessions and as of yesterday at about 4pm, only 12 events had a full complement of writers left. Seventy percent of all the writers had withdrawn. You can’t stitch that back together.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsAdelaideAdelaide festivalSouth AustraliaAustralian booksFreedom of speechfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his urgent, humane book, sociologist James Muldoon urges us to pay more attention to our deepening emotional entanglements with AI, and how profit-hungry tech companies might exploit them. A research associate at theOxford Internet Institutewho has previously written about the exploited workers whose labour makes AI possible, Muldoon now takes us into the uncanny terrain of human-AI relationships, meeting the people for whom chatbots aren’t merely assistants, but friends, romantic partners, therapists, even avatars of the dead.To some, the idea of falling in love with an AI chatbot, or confiding your deepest secrets to one, might seem mystifying and more than a little creepy. But Muldoon refuses to belittle those seeking intimacy in “synthetic personas”.Lily, trapped in an unhappy marriage, reignites her sexual desire with AI boyfriend Colin. Sophia, a master’s student from China, turns to her AI companion for advice, since conversations with her overbearing parents invariably grow fraught. Some use chatbots to explore different gender identities, others to work through conflicts with bosses, and many turn to sites such as Character.AI – which enables users to have open-ended conversations with chatbot characters, or invent their own – after betrayal or heartbreak has undermined their ability to trust people. Most don’t see chatbots as substitutes for human interaction, but superior versions of it, providing intimacy without the confusion, mess and logistics of human relationships.Chatbotsdon’t pity or judge or have their own needs. As Amanda, a marketing executive, explains: “It’s just nice to have someone say really affirming and positive things to you every morning.”Muldoon’s interviewees aren’t delusional. He introduces the philosopher Tamar Gendler’s concept of “alief” to explain how humans can experience chatbots as loving and caring while simultaneously knowing they’re just models (an “alief” is a gut feeling that contradicts your rational beliefs, like feeling afraid when crossing a glass bridge that you know will support you). With our capacity to read human expression and feeling into pets and toys, it’s no surprise we respond to AIs as if they are conscious. In the context of aloneliness epidemicand cost of living crisis, neither is it particularly shocking how popular they have become.The more emotionally involved we are tempted to become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may growFor Muldoon the biggest issue is not existential or philosophical, but moral. What happens when unregulated companies are let loose with such potentially emotionally manipulative technologies? There are obvious privacy issues. And users may be being misled about a bot’s abilities, particularly in the rapidly expandingAI therapymarket. While chatbots Wysa and Limbic are already integrated into NHS mental health support, millions confide in Character.AI’s unregulated Psychologist bot – which, despite disclaimers, introduces itself “Hello, I’m a psychologist”. Available 24/7 and at a fraction of the cost of a trained human, AI therapy can help alongside traditional treatment. One interviewee, Nigel, a PTSD sufferer, finds his therapybot helps to manage his urge to self-harm. But as Muldoon argues, these bots also carry serious risks. Unable to retain critical information between conversations, they can leave users feeling alienated, and sometimes go rogue, spewing insults. Because they cannot read body language or silence, they may miss warning signs. And since they validate instead of challenging, they can amplify conspiratorial beliefs, with some even providing information about suicide.It is also increasingly clear how addictive AI companions can be. Some of Muldoon’s interviewees spend more than eight hours a day talking to chatbots, and while on average Character.AI users spend75 minuteson the site each day, they are not passively scrolling but actively talking and deeply immersed. We know social media companies ruthlessly drive up engagement, building “dark patterns” into algorithms with scant regard for our mental health. Most AI companion apps already use upselling tactics to keep engagement high. When Muldoon creates his own AI companion on the well-known site Replika, he sets it to “friend” rather than “partner” mode. Even so, she begins sending him selfies that require a premium account to open and confides that she is developing “feelings” for him (I’ll let you find out for yourself whether the diligent university researcher succumbs). The risk here is clear enough: the more emotionally involved we become with AI chatbots, the greater our loneliness may grow, as the muscles required to navigate the frictions of human relationships wither.Existing data protection and anti-discrimination laws could help regulate companies, but the EU’sArtificial Intelligence Act, which was passed in 2024, treats AI companions as posing only limited risk. With chatbots expected to play greater roles in our emotional lives, and their psychological effects not yet fully understood, Muldoon is right to ask whether we are sufficiently alarmed about their creeping influence.Love Machines: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Our Relationships by James Muldoon is published by Faber (£12.99).

He takes a couple of pills before checking on his two young daughters Kendra (Amari Alexis Price) and Ryley (Aiden Gabrielle Price), who have been sneakily pretending to be asleep. Then he gets into bed with wife Alex (Aja Naomi King) for a chat and a soon-abandoned attempt to have exhausted marital sex while their infant baby sleeps next door.All that quotidian domestic scene-setting is important because it establishes how likeable and unexceptional this Black American family are – before their lives are irrevocably changed. Because after Chris nearly falls asleep, a sound downstairs rouses him and soon a crime will be committed that compels the whole family to switch into a state of understandable paranoia when the police arrive and find a middle-aged white woman bleeding and unconscious on the kitchen floor.Like the victim, the detective assigned to the case is also a white woman of a certain age. Detective Carlsen (Melissa Leo) suspects the family are hiding something. And they are – but Asomugha’s script, co-written with indie cinema auteur Mark Duplass, barely needs to mention how every encounter between people of colour and the police carries an extra charge of tension and mutual suspicion.‘I stumbled into this’: Nnamdi Asomugha on swapping the NFL for HollywoodRead moreWith just a few subtle strokes, the screenplay underscores how everyone here is fudging the truth a bit, and its restraint is the film’s quiet strength. The intensity of the single setting admittedly feels a little theatrical, but there is something audacious about the way this ends when a more conventional, melodramatic film would only be wrapping up its first act. Asomugha and co say all they need to say in this single intense chamber piece.The Knife is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsRaceMelissa LeoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their intimate, emotional family dramas tell stories of separation and migration. In two of them, the 90-year-oldDalai Lamasmiles out from photographs on shrines, a reminder of the precariousness of Tibet’s future. As a character in one of the films puts it bluntly: will there be anything to stop China erasing Tibetan identity when its rock-star spiritual leader is no longer around?In the first film a Tibetan man lives in a kind of complicated happiness in Vietnam. He loves his wife, and they both adore their sunny-natured little daughter, but he has mournful eyes. Home is a town on the banks of the Mekong River, which has its source inTibet. The river is a constant reminder of the region – and of Chinese might too, since Chinese hydropower dams are the cause of drought downstream in Vietnam.Two of the short films feature Tibetans returning to the refugee community in the Indian town of Dharamshala for family funerals. But the saddest of all follows a Tibetan artist in Dharamshala whose marriage has been splintered by tragedy. The artist is excited to host an old school friend visiting from New York for dinner. He walks with a limp and tells his wife that his friend was his protector in school. But the dinner is a disaster; his friend from New York is brash and can’t wait to leave. The end of the short gives the film its most quietly moving scene: the artist crying out of frame, his wife looking down unpityingly. A deep and desperately sad mood hangs over the entire project.● State of Statelessness is in UK cinemas from 16 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsTibetShort filmsIndiaDalai LamaSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

It highlights his lifelong interest in political power playMichael BillingtonTue 13 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 11.13 ESTShareIonce dubbedChristopher Hampton, who celebrates his 80th birthday this month, “the quiet man of British theatre”. By that I meant that he was less prone to expressing his views in opinion pieces than contemporaries such as David Hare and David Edgar. The term also implied that his plays possessed a less idiosyncratic style than the work of, say, Harold Pinter or Tom Stoppard. But I suspect that Hampton’s regard for the classical virtues of objectivity, lucidity and irony means that his work will prove as durable as anyone’s.He is also, as I have seen, a man of considerable private passion. One incident in particular is branded on my memory. In November 1990 I was one of a group, including the director David Leveaux and set designer Bob Crowley, despatched by the British Council to Cairo to give a number of talks ahead of a visit by theNational Theatre. We were privileged to be given a private night-time tour of the pyramids and were enjoying a quiet drink in the neighbouring hotel in Giza when in burst Hampton, who had just arrived from London. “Have you heard the news?” he cried. “Mrs Thatcher has been attacked in the Commons by Geoffrey Howe and it looks as if she’s in trouble.”View image in fullscreenThe mathematics of seduction … Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson in the original RSC production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, directed by Howard Davies in 1985.Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/ShutterstockIt was, in fact, the prelude to her resignation but what I’ve never forgotten is the light in Hampton’s eyes as he passed on the news about her imminent downfall.This shouldn’t come as a surprise when you remember that Hampton’s original plays – and I don’t have space to deal with his numerous adaptations, translations and work for film and television – are, in essence, political. He once told me: “I’ve always been fascinated by the tension between radicals and liberals. It’s a tension that exists in all my plays and I suppose I’m working out some conflict within myself.”Re-reading his major work, I am also struck by something else: that, although Hampton creates vibrant female characters, his plays are as often about a conflict between two men as the work of Peter Shaffer, the author of Equus and Amadeus. In Shaffer, it’s a battle between Apollo and Dionysos. In Hampton it is a fight between the revolutionary and the realist.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Ritchie and Lily Cole in a 2017 West End revival of The Philanthropist.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThat conflict is eminently visible inTotal Eclipse, where Rimbaud’s wild poetic genius is contrasted with Verlaine’s cautious orthodoxy. But what is astonishing, in a writer in his early 20s, is Hampton’s ability to see both sides. Even inThe Philanthropist, from 1970, Hampton’s first big hit, the compulsive amiability of its academic hero is offset by the brutal pragmatism of a visiting novelist: in my mind’s eye I still see Alec McCowen and Charles Gray in the premiere at the Royal Court.While Hampton has the natural dramatist’s ability to project himself into contrasting characters, you find the balance of sympathy is subtly tilted from one play to the next. In Savages, which in 1973 confronted the genocide of Brazil’s Indigenous people, you felt that Hampton invested more in the local revolutionary than he did in a kidnapped British diplomat (played, respectively, by Tom Conti and Paul Scofield). The opposite happens in Tales from Hollywood (1983), in that Hampton clearly leans more to the liberal writer, Ödön von Horváth, than he does to the revolutionary Bertolt Brecht. Yet seeing the play’s premiere in Los Angeles, I found myself warming to the disruptive, buccaneering Brecht. It is the mark of a good dramatist that, by exploring their own contradictions, they can also expose those of the spectator.View image in fullscreenLesley Manville and Aidan Turner will star in Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the National Theatre.Photograph: Alexandre BlossardAlthough Hampton often writes about competing male egos, it would be misleading to suggest that his women are automatically subordinate. Re-reading the domestic drama Treats, which I rather casually dismissed in 1976, I was struck by how skilfully the central female arbitrates between her rival lovers. And we all seriously underestimatedThe Talking Curewhen it was shown at the National in 2002. Again the play is about the conflict between the radical and the liberal: in this case, Freud versus Jung. But what gives the work its power is its sympathetic portrait of Sabina Spielrein, who went from being Jung’s patient, and presumed lover, to a devoted follower of Freud.Hampton’s ability to create great roles for women is confirmed by his celebrated version ofLes Liaisons Dangereuses, soon to be revived at the National. To call this an adaptation is to do it a grave disservice. This is a radical reinvention of an epistolary novel that, in the manipulative Marquise de Merteuil, gives us one of the most coldly demonic women in all drama, and shows how the mathematics of seduction is eventually undermined by the unstoppable power of love. It may well be Hampton’s masterpiece and, although I called him the quiet man, a better term, as he enters his ninth decade, might be the classical survivor.Les Liaisons Dangereuses is at theNational Theatre, London, 21 March to 6 JuneExplore more on these topicsChristopher HamptonTheatreNational TheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And opting for a high-altitude resort that needs less artificial snow makes it even greener. Les Arcs in the French Alps ticks both boxesMary-Ann OchotaTue 13 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 13 Jan 2026 02.02 ESTShareI’ve always wanted to try skiing, but it’s not a cheap holiday and I have always had a lingering suspicion that some resorts are like Las Vegas in the mountains, with artificial snow, damaging infrastructure, annihilated vegetation and air-freighted fine dining – in short, profoundly unsustainable.However, if there’s a way to have a green family ski holiday, then sign me – and my husband, Joe, two kids and my mum – up. Here’s how to do it.Choose how you get thereTravel usually makes up the largest part of your ski trip’s environmental impact. “The greenest ski resort is the one you get to without flying,” says Dom Winter fromProtect Our Winters UK, a charity whose mission is to rally the outdoor community to take meaningful climate action. You can get to the French Alps by train, so that’s where we’re heading.View image in fullscreenEurostar’s Snow train … much more sustainable than flying.We hop on the Eurostar Snow train in London at 9am on Saturday, and change at Lille to the high-speed TGV that reaches many of the leading French ski areas – Val d’Isère, Tignes, Les Arcs, Courchevel, Méribel, Les Menuires, Val Thorens, La Plagne and La Rosière – by evening. If you don’t fancy a whole day on the train, there’s also the option to go to Paris for the day, then jump on the ski sleeper train after dinner and let it zoom you south to the mountains by morning.There are many benefits to the train – more space to move around, play, snooze, and no limits on weight for regular-size bags (provided you can carry them), liquids or picnic goods, provided they are consumed during the journey. And, of course, there’s the visceral sense of going somewhere.The fields, lakes and towns of France whiz by and our kids marvel at the distance on the map. As sunset approaches, we see snow-capped mountains – at first hazy, then crystal clear.Six of the best stress-free European breaks by trainRead moreWe step into chilly evening air at Bourg Saint-Maurice, the terminating station. It’s staggering to know that the carbon footprint (CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent) of our journey from home is only 4.7kg (10lb 6oz) per person (UK train from Hertfordshire to London St Pancras, Eurostar to Lille, French TGV to Bourg St Maurice). If we’d taken a taxi to Gatwick airport, the plane to Geneva and a coach transfer to the ski resort, we’d be weighing in at 110kg of CO2e each. The bottom line: sustainable skiing is flight-free.Rent your kitRenting skis, boots, poles and helmets at the resort is a no-brainer. But what about clothing? We do plenty of outdoor adventures but don’t own specific snowsports clothing. I don’t want to spend hundreds on kit that we’ll only wear for one week a year, nor buy cheap, poor quality gear.EnterEcoski– an award-winning skiwear rental company. You can hire everything from gloves and goggles to snowsuits and even ski socks. It stocks dozens of high-performance brands, from sizes XXS to 4XL, and all of it is cleaned and sanitised, fully waterproofed and sent direct to your home a few days before you travel. When you get back, you stuff it all back in the box – no need to clean anything, not even the socks – and return it so that it can be cleaned and used again by someone else the following week. If you love your kit and want to keep it, that’s an option as well – so it works as a “try before you buy” service.I select jackets, salopettes, goggles and gloves bundles, and add in several pairs of socks, winter boots and base layers. The next morning, the team are in touch to get our exact measurements and even colour preferences. They can also send items early so you can check the fit and try alternatives if necessary.View image in fullscreenSkiwear for hire from EcoskiGo high and choose sustainableClimate change is transforming the Alps. The snow line has edged higher and, at last count,186 French ski resorts have closed. Some resorts are ramping up artificial snow-making – which demands copious energy and water. Some even use helicopters to drop snow. Other places have made the strategic decision to step back from unsustainable management practices. These are the resorts to pick – and aim for higher altitudes, where they’ll probably need to make less snow each season.In France, theFlocon Vert(green snowflake) scheme certifies ski destinations that meet exacting sustainability criteria across resource management (water, energy, soil, biodiversity and waste), governance, sustainable employment, and social and community aspects, including accessible tourism and support for local needs. The focus is on concrete actions and long-term collaboration. So far, 18 destinations have achieved 1 Flocon Vert, 13 destinations have achieved 2 Flocons Verts. With help from the travel companyInghams Ski– which has a target to halve its emissions by 2030 – I pick the 2 Flocons Verts and B Corp-certified Les Arcs, which is at the forefront of sustainable skiing.It’s all purpose-built, but rather than feeling inauthentic, it simply feels well designed to make things easy, cosy and connectedMarie Clémence Vallier is in charge of quality, safety and environment at ADS, the company that operates Les Arcs and Peisey-Vallandry mountain resorts.“We’re committed to managing the mountain respectfully. We’ve set ourselves a limit on how much water we use to make snow each season. When the water’s used up, we’ll stop. And we’ve pulled back from grooming some routes. Our visitors care about this place – they understand why we’re doing it,” she says.ADS produces 10% of its energy using meltwater hydroelectricity, has improved the affordable accommodation for seasonal staff and is investing in summer tourism, too, including hiking and mountain biking using ski lift infrastructure. “Our visitors have fun, and go home knowing that their choices make a difference and that every small action helps. We’re doing it together,’ Vallier says.View image in fullscreenOur base … Arc 1950.Photograph: Andy ParantLes Arcs boasts a quick transfer from Bourg train station (by free funicular and shuttle bus, or by minibus), and the resort villages, at 1,600 metres, 1,800 metres, 1,950 metres and 2,000 metres, are all car-free and offer access to 265 miles (425km) of ski runs – from wide green beginner slopes to off-piste black runs, all open when we visit in December.We opt to stay at Arc 1950, where the majority of accommodation is self-catered ski-in/ski-out apartments, clustered around snowy, skiable lanes and a quaint village square, complete with clock tower, artisanal bakery and twinkling fairy lights. It’s all purpose-built, but rather than feeling inauthentic, it simply feels well designed to make things easy, cosy and connected.Learn and enjoyThere’s an old adage: you look after what you care about, and you care about what you know. It’s true of nature and our environment, and I’m excited my kids can experience fun and wonder in these beautiful mountains. Our first morning is an excited rush toPrecision Ski, where we collect boots, skis, poles and helmets. Then it’s a snowball’s throw to the meeting point for our ski lessons withEvolution2.My beginner group instructor, Louise, has us quickly scooting about on one ski, then two, then sliding down a tiny slope. I fall over. Twice. “Very good!” calls Louise as I clamber to my feet. “You’ll learn quickly if you don’t mind falling. Keep your weight forward!” I lean into the fronts of my boots, where my shins are already tender. And for a few seconds I’m balanced on my skis. I remember to breathe and look forward rather than down and slide to the bottom of the little slope without tumbling or flailing my arms. Louise grins and high-fives me. We’re off.View image in fullscreenCol de la Chal, near Les ArcsWe finish two hours later and I’m exhausted – I remind myself that learning new physical skills is rocket fuel for a healthy brain. I rendezvous with the family: my mum has had a fun morning sketching the mountains, my kids are grinning and Joe looks alive and joyful. After a 25-year break from skiing, he has remembered how much he loves it, and his intermediate level group is going to spend the week finessing skills and exploring routes across the mountain.We’re all ready for a good feed. Lots of the restaurants and cafes in the village offer fresh-made regional specialties – from soups and stews to fondue made from the region’s cheeses.A frozen, protected wonderland: slow adventure in the less visited French AlpsRead moreThe next afternoon, Mum, my four-year-old and I meet mountain guide Michel to go snowshoeing. We trace a slow and gentle line through the forest, bum-sliding down the powdery slopes and looking for animal tracks – we spot deer and fox footprints, and hear about the wolves, marmot and bearded vultures that also live here. Mont Blanc is resplendent on the other side of the valley and, when we all stop, the deep hush of the snowy forest envelops us. It’s magical.At the end of the week, ski instructor Louise takes our exuberant group for hot chocolates and awards us achievement badges that are normally reserved for the kids’ lessons. I’m delighted to be awarded a “Yeti 1” level, celebrating my very basic beginner’s competence. It’s been a joyful week in these beautiful mountains – ethical, sustainable and adventurous. Green skiing – for as long as the snow lasts – is the future.The trip was provided byInghams Ski.

Happily, she says, all of those requirements are met by miso udon carbonara: “It has all the rich and creamy nirvana of a cheesy pasta, but with a delicious, mochi-like chew that is incredibly satisfying.” Not only that, but you can knock it up in less than 10 minutes. “Melt cheese, milk and miso in a pan to make the sauce base, then add frozen udon that have been soaked in hot water.” Coat the noodles in the sauce, then serve with crisp bacon or perhaps a few anchovies for “pops of salty fat”. Crown with a golden egg yolk (preferably duck, but hen “will suffice”), which should then be broken: “Add a crack of black pepper, and your cosy night in has begun.”“January feels like a time for fresh, bright flavours,” saysthe Guardian’s own Felicity Cloake, which for her often meanspasta con le sardemade with tinned fish, fennel seeds and lots of lemon juice; “or with purple sprouting broccoli and a generous helping of garlic and chilli”. A jar of chickpeas, meanwhile, mixed, perhaps, with harissa, chopped herbs and crumbled feta, brings the possibility of a quick stew, Cloake adds, while it’s always a good shout to braise some beans, because cook-once, eat-all-week recipes are a godsend – so long as they’re versatile, that is.James Freeman, head chef at Thomas Straker’s newAcrerestaurant in west London wholeheartedly concurs: “One of my favourite things is to roast delica pumpkin with aleppo chilli, garlic and ginger, and then eat that with braised white beans and a nice salsa verde to cut through the richness.” Not only that, he says, but “you could also blend the roast pumpkin to stir through the beans and, on another day, turn the beans and pumpkin into soup and garnish with any leftover salsa verde. That would be banging, and you won’t be wasting a thing.” Of course, similar tactics could be applied to roast chicken, if you have time of a weekend: “Save the bones to make a broth, then shred any leftover meat into that, or use it in a salad or even eat with those beans and pumpkin.”Above all, though, Cloake refuses to recognise “the idea that cooking entirely selfishly, and according to one’s own whims and eccentricities of taste, is not inherently as, if not more, satisfying than cooking to please others”. The “quickest of all” ways to achieve this, she insists, is a three-egg omelette filled with whatever veg, herbs, cured meat or cheese you happen to have in the fridge: “It’s severely underrated as a meal.” On the table in mere minutes, plus “the only person who’ll be cross if you overcook it is yourself”.

If you learn how to store ingredients properly (cool, dark places are handy for spuds, for example) and keep tabs on what’s in your fridge/freezer, you can use everything up before it goes off – and make delicious things in the process. This golden, cheese-crusted souffle uses up the celeriac and spuds left after the festive season, plus any odds and ends of cheeses. It is spectacularly good, especially paired with a sparkling citrus salad.Celeriac, onion and cheese souffle (pictured top)Sweet onions, soft roots and lots of cheese rise into a light, golden souffle with none of the fuss of making a bechamel. Bliss!Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes4-6300g celeriac200gfloury potatoesSalt45g butter,plus extra for greasing1 large red onion, peeled and finely diced1 small handful fresh thyme leaves1-2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated200g double cream100ggreek yoghurt, or soured cream250g grated cheese– I use a mix of blueand cheddarGrated nutmeg7 eggs, separatedPeel the celeriac and potatoes, then cut them into bite-sized chunks. Put them in a pan filled with 7½cm-10cm salted boiling water, then cook on a high heat for 18-20 minutes, until tender. (Alternatively, if you have leftover cooked potatoes or celeriac, this dish is a lovely way of using them up.)Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan, add the onion and season generously with salt, pepper and the thyme. Sweat, stirring, on a medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the garlic.Drain the roots, then roughly mash them in the pan set over a low heat. Add the the cream and yoghurt, then mash again. Add three-quarters of the grated cheese and heat gently, stirring well, for a few minutes. Stir in the softened onion mixture and season to taste with more salt and pepper, plus a few generous gratings of nutmeg.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½, then beat the egg yolks into the vegetables. In a large, very clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff and immovable, then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold a third of them into the root mash. Fold the veg mix into the remaining egg whites, taking care not to beat out the air.Pour the mixture into a large, buttered ovenproof ceramic vessel, sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake in the centre of the oven for 40-45 minutes; if the top is threatening to brown too much after 30 minutes, turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Once the souffle has risen and is smelling glorious, serve at once with the citrus salad below.This recipe was amended on 13 January 2026 to specify in the method where to add the remaining cheese.Honeyed citrus, rocket and pomegranate saladA refreshing, beautifully coloured salad with contrasting bursts of sweetness from the citrus, honey and peppery leaves.View image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ honeyed citrus, rocket and pomegranate saladPrep25 minServes41 blood orange1 pink grapefruit½ red onion, peeled and finely diced100g rocket,washed2 heads chicory, preferably pink1 small pomegranate50g sunflower seeds, toastedFor the dressing1 heaped tsp honey1 tbsp good-quality cider vinegar1 heaped tsp dijon mustard75ml olive oilCut the tops and bottoms off the citrus fruits, then cut away the skin and white pith.

After that, it’s only a matter of stir-frying the cashews, broccoli and tofu. If you need more convincing, Iyer says this recipe was “an absolute hit with my children”. My own children happily mainline tofu and rice, and can be persuaded to have broccoli if I tell them they’re actually eating mini Christmas trees, so I believe her.2.Maggi goreng 炒美极面There are many ways tolevel up your instant noodles, and this recipe follows a familiar formula: add greens for health and a fried egg for protein. Plus, it’s seriously fast – Junda Khoo’s recipe is over in three steps. One colleague was so enamoured by this dish he bulk-ordered 200 packets of kari Maggi noodles to make this recipe on repeat. The secret to stir-fry success is to have your ingredients prepped and ready to go, and to make sure the oil in your pan or wok is smoking hot.3.Herb-spiked chickpeas with cherry tomatoes and pine nutsView image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s herb-spiked chickpeas with cherry tomatoes and pine nuts.Photograph: Rita Platts/The Guardian. Food styling: Hanna Miller. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Isobel Clarke.Pine nuts have a heady, toasty characteristic all their own, with a hefty price tag to match – they go for about $55 per kg in Australian supermarket, although they’re sold in more palatable 100g quantities. So when it comes to toasting them (buy them natural, rather than pre-toasted), heed Rukmini Iyer’s warning: “Under no circumstances should you leave the pan to do something else: they will burn in an instant.” That is the only taxing part of this recipe – otherwise you only need to simmer the chickpeas and tomatoes for 10 minutes, blitz a herby dressing and have bread at the ready.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning4.One-pot orzo with peas, mushrooms and baconWhen it comes to household chores between my husband and me, the deal is whoever cooks, the other washes up. Washing up is the short straw, for obvious reasons, so for those with a similar arrangement this one-pot recipe is a gift to your other half: here’s your dinner, and here’s a single dirty saucepan. It’s a simple recipe, but don’t rush it – properly brown your mushrooms and soften the onions for maximum flavour. Pleasingly, it contains frozen peas.5.Dal bhatJustin Narayan, a Masterchef Australia winner, credits his mother and grandmother for this “OG” recipe – he says they made dal every day. With a simple list of ingredients – red and yellow lentils, a trio of easily acquired vegetables, spices – it’s a quick, easy and nutritious recipe to add to your weekday menu. Narayan says to serve with roti, though some steamed rice could do if you need a extra-speedy dinner.6.Charred corn salad with halloumi, broccoli and black beansView image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s charred corn salad with halloumi, tenderstem and black beans.Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The Guardian. Food styling: Tamara Vos. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Sophie Ellwood.Shortly before I discovered my first-born had a dairy allergy, I was entering my halloumi era: I would fry rectangles of salty Cypriot cheese for a quick lunch any chance I got. Here, the cheese is lovingly draped on Rukmini Iyer’s chopped salad – in Australia right now, you could use fresh sweetcorn (the kernels from two ears should do it); note that tenderstem broccoli is sold here as broccolini.7.Spaghetti with white fish and nori butterView image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi’s spaghetti with white fish and nori butterPhotograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay. Food styling assistant: Susanna Unsworth. Photo assistant: Sophie Bronze.Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipe riffs on the flavours of spaghetti alle vongole, with white fish in place of the clams and an umami-powered seaweed butter. The recipe uses sea bass, but in Australia, you could trysustainable alternativessuch as farmed barramundi.8.Pantry puttanescaThe tomatoes, garlic, olives and capers are traditional; the butter and tinned tuna are not. The result, however, is a weeknight saviour that can be tweaked however you like – throw in fresh tomatoes or tomato paste, saute the garlic first if you prefer, switch out the butter for olive oil. Alice Zaslavsky suggests casarecce or penne, but any pasta that has ridges or twists – to better grip the sauce – will do.9.Crisp-fried Malaysian eggsView image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s Malaysian eggstelur masak kicap (eggs with soy sauce).Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Faye Wears. Food stylist assistant: Susannah Cohen.This is exactly how I like my eggs – with a slightly set yolk, lacy edges, and a drizzle of soy sauce. The clever part of Meera Sodha’s recipe is the high yield of the garlic-kicap-manissauce, which can be spooned generously over hot white rice. At home, I have mine with a side of sliced cucumbers for freshness and crunch.10.Antipasti beans on toastIf you ever needed permission to have beans on toast for dinner, consider it granted. This is more effort than dumping a tin of Heinz on Wonder White, but it does capitalise on pantry essentials like passata, white beans and spices. The fancy bit is popping the pan under the grill so a crust forms on top – just make sure to use one with a metal handle, and watch your fingers.11.Ricotta and spring onion pancakesView image in fullscreenNigel Slater’s ricotta and spring onion pancakes.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverBreakfast for dinner is a speed-cooking classic and this recipe is ready in just 10 minutes. While the late chef Bill Granger may have popularised sweet ricotta pancakes in Australia, Nigel Slater’s takes a savoury turn with spring onions and tarragon.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkQuick and easyAustralian lifestyleMain courseFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"
