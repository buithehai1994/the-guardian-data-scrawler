The US president has already announced plans for25% levieson imports of cars, steel and aluminium to the US.One vital battleground now is over Washington’s threat to impose blanket reciprocal 25% tariffs on all countries that impose VAT on US exports. These countries include the UK and EU nations. The US does not impose VAT on its imports.graphicThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned last week that a 20% increase in tariffs between the US and the rest of the world would cut UK growth by 1% and “entirely eliminate” the £9.9bn of fiscal headroom that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restored in the public finances by a painful programme of welfare and other cuts in herspring statement last week.Starmer appears to be waiting to judge how to react, based on the level of any tariffs imposed on the UK.He is said by government officials to be ready to “act in the national interest” if Trump does hit the UK hard. But his team also says that he will be “pragmatic” if need be – suggesting he may not retaliate immediately, in the hope of talking Trump round over time and with the aim of creating the conditions for signing a wider UK-US trade deal.Starmer has already been warned by theLiberal Democrats against “appeasing” Trumpby reducing a major tax for US tech firms at the same time as imposing savage welfare cuts including on disabled people.Diplomats now say Starmer, who has refused to issue a word of criticism of Trump since his return to the White House, must be prepared to retaliate or run the risk that the US president simply deploys the same tactic again and again, knowing his opponent will not fight back.View image in fullscreenFormer British ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch said Keir Stramer should learn from the robust stance to Donald Trump’s tariffs by Canadian PM Mark Carney.Photograph: Sait Serkan Gurbuz/APSpeaking to theObserver, the former UK ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch said Starmer should learn from the experience over recent days of the Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, who appears to have softened Trump’s tariff threat by warning of strong Canadian retaliation and making clear his displeasure at the US president over this threats towards his country’s sovereignty – an approach that has lifted his Liberal party substantially in the polls. Carney said: “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.”Lord Darroch said: “It’s understandable that, faced with deeply damaging US tariffs on British cars, steel and aluminium, the government should think about concessions like reducing digital tax. But they need to be wary of giving Trump wins; tariffs are his all-purpose forcing mechanism and he’ll use them again and again if he sees them working. And they should note the dramatic turnaround in Canadian politics, where on the back of a robust and defiant response to US tariff threats, Mark Carney’s Liberals have gone from 14 points behind the Canadian Conservative party at the end of January to eight points ahead last week.”It is expected that Trump may impose less punitive tariffs on the UK than on member states of the EU, which he believes have taken an anti-US approach on trade over decades.João Vale de Almeida, former EU ambassador to the US and the UK, said he did not expect the UK to retaliate in the way the EU was bound to. But he said it was important that Starmer hit back in some way by criticising the way the US president used tariffs as a tool of policy.“He [Starmer] should at least condemn the tariffs, as they are bad for everyone,” Vale de Almeida said.In her spring statement last week, Reeves – who is said to oppose retaliating to US tariffs – said the “global economy had become more uncertain” but at no point mentioned that it was Trump who had fuelled the uncertainty and created the conditions in which a global trade war is now entirely possible.Carney, by contrast, has taken on Trump, telling him on Wednesday thatCanadawould retaliate against the US with tariffs of its own, potentially escalating a damaging trade conflict between the neighbouring countries. But Carney and Trump then sounded a more friendly note after a phone call on Friday. Carney’s office described it as a “very constructive conversation”, while Trump said in a social media post that the call was extremely productive.An Opinium poll for theObservershows that, after the spring statement, just 11% of UK voters expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months, with 23% saying it will stay the same and 61% that it will get worse.‘Down to the wire’: inside the UK’s crunch talks with the US as it bids to avoid Trump tariffsRead moreAbout 17% said they expected their finances to get better, 38% that they would stay the same and 41% that they would get worse.Voters in this country rate the UK economy relatively poorly compared with other large economic nations, particularly China. The UK economy is rated better than China’s by just 9% of UK voters, with 10% saying it is about the same and 43% saying it is worse. Only 15% say the UK economy is better than that of the US, with 16% saying it is about the same and 36% saying it is worse.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe ObserverKeir StarmerDonald TrumpTrade policyTax and spendingMark CarneyCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

We dealt with it positively and accepted it,” Khalil al-Hayya said in a televised speech.“We hope that the [Israeli] occupation will not undermine [it],” said Hayya, who leads the Hamas negotiating team in indirect talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the Hamas-Israel war in Gaza that erupted in October 2023.”Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said after “a series of consultations pursuant to the proposal that was received from the mediators, Israel conveyed a counter-proposal in full coordination with the US’’.Netanyahu’s government insists on the release of 10 of the 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, according to media reports quoting officials in Israel. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel, 58 remain in Gaza including 34 who the Israeli military says are dead. Hamas is reportedly open to releasing their bodies.In exchange, Israel is supposed to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Khalil added that Hamas’s weapons are a “red line” and it will not disarm as long as Israel’s military occupies Gaza.Israel is not actively participating in negotiations for a ceasefire deal taking place in Doha between Egypt, Qatar and Hamas, despite increasing efforts to reach an agreement before Eid al-Fitr.The news came three days after security sources told Reuters that Egypt, one of the mediators in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, had received positive indications from Israel over a new ceasefire proposal that would include a transitional phase.Last weekIsraelresumed its military operation in Gaza, shattering the calm of the ceasefire with Hamas. According to the Palestinian health ministry, 921 people have been killed in the renewed assault.On Saturday, Hamas’s armed wing released footage showing an Israeli hostage in Gaza calling on the government to secure his release, the second such video shared by the militant group within days.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group identified the man as Elkana Bohbot, who was abducted from the site of a music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war.The footage lasts more than three minutes and shows Bohbot speaking in Hebrew and repeatedly raising his hands in desperation as he pleads for his freedom.The Guardian could not verify when or where in the Gaza Strip the video was recorded.In the clip, Bohbot said the bombardment could cost him his life, and pleaded to be reunited with his wife and son.In a separate development, Israel’s militaryadmitted on Saturday it had fired on ambulancesin the Gaza Strip after identifying them as “suspicious vehicles”. Hamas condemned the attack as a “war crime” that killed at least one person.The incident took place last Sunday in the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.The Gaza health ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 have been wounded since the beginning of the war.AFP and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is feared more than 90 people remain trapped there.graphicIn neighbouring Thailand Bangkok’s governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said the search for construction workers at the site of a collapsed 30-storey building in the capital would continue. “We believe that there are still survivors. We will do everything possible to rescue them,” he said on Saturday evening, adding that heavy machines, including cranes and diggers, were being used to clear access at the site. The building fell to the floor while under construction near the city’s Chatuchak weekend market.Drones and sniffer dogs have been deployed to identify signs of life. At least 10 people have died in Bangkok. Dozens more are missing.Myanmar’s ruling junta said in a statement that 1,644 people have now been found dead and another 3,408 injured. Others are still missing.Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued a rare appeal for international help on Friday, and declared a state of emergency across six areas of the country. Aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday with Russia and China, two of the isolated junta’s few allies, flying in rescue teams and supplies. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team, and Malaysia said it would send 50 people on Sunday.View image in fullscreenYe Aung accompanies his wife, Phyu Lay Khaing, on their way to hospital after she was rescued from a collapsed building in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesThe response to the disaster is complicated not only by communication outages and damaged roads, but also the conflict that has gripped the country since themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta has faced dogged armed resistance to its rule, formed of a patchwork of groups, including civilians who took up arms to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed organisations that have long fought for independence. It has lost swathes of territory, and responded with relentless airstrikes, which continued even after the devastating quake, including in Sagaing, close to the epicentre.The World Food Programme’s country director, Michael Dunford, said that coordinating a response to the disaster would be “very challenging”. He added it could be “days and weeks” before the true scale of the damage in Myanmar is known. An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said hospitals and health facilities had sustained “extensive damaged or destruction”, adding that there were “a severe shortage of medical supplies”.Major bridges, roads, universities, hotels, historical and religious sites and public buildings have also been heavily damaged or destroyed, according to reports cited by UNOCHA.The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, which was followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock, was felt across the region, and is the largest quake to hit Myanmar in decades.Myanmar’s junta chief invited “any country, any organisation” to help with relief and said he “opened all ways for foreign aid”.The junta has in the past repeatedly been accused of blocking humanitarian aid to areas controlled by its opponents. The Norwegian Refugee Council said “immediate and unhindered access for aid workers” would be critical.View image in fullscreenMotorists pass a building rocked by the 7.7-magnitude earthquake.Photograph: ReutersOn Saturday evening many in Mandalay prepared to sleep outside overnight, either because their homes had collapsed or they feared continued quakes.‘No one came’: Myanmar volunteers dig with bare hands to save earthquake victimsRead moreThe disaster comes at a time when many aid agencies are scaling back their work following Trump’s cuts to the US Agency for International Development, a major donor. Trump said on Friday that the US was going to help with the response, though no concrete commitment has yet been announced.The UK will send a package of up to £10m to support people in Myanmar, the Foreign Office said.The European Union said it was providing €2.5m (£2.1m) in initial emergency aid and assessing the needs on the ground to mobilise further assistance. EU crisis management commissioner Hadja Lahbib said the EU “stands in solidarity with people inMyanmarand the broader region”.The United Nations has allocated $5m (£3.9m) to start relief efforts, while the World Health Organization said it was preparing to surge support in response to “a very, very big threat to life and health”.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarThe ObserverEarthquakesSouth and central AsiaNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

That is an example of harassment and bullying at scale.”On Tuesday, Prince Harry quit as patron of the charity. He released a joint statement with co-founder Prince Seeiso ofLesotho, claiming they had been forced to step down “in support of and solidarity with” the board of trustees who had also resigned, due to a dispute with Chandauka, which reportedly arose from a decision to focus fundraising in Africa.Harry and Seeiso wrotethat the relationship “broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation”.Sky News reported that one of its sources, who is “close to the former trustees of the Sentebale charity”, said that Chandauka’s accusation that she was bullied by Prince Harry and the “Sussex machine” was completely baseless.Accusations and resignations mark remarkable 24 hours at charity founded by Prince HarryRead moreIn a statement earlier this week, Chandauka said: “There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.“Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to the press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued.”Sentebale was set up in 2006 by Harry after spending two months in Lesotho during his gap year in 2004.The prince’s acrimonious departure from the charity comes five years after he told a Sentebale dinner party in 2020: “When I lost my mum … you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long. Together, you have given me an education about living, and this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could ever have imagined,” he told dinner guests. “We are taking a leap of faith, so thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step.”Representatives for Harry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAfricaCharitiesAids and HIVMonarchyLesothonewsShareReuse this content"

What is this operation?“Is it a terror cell, is it a drug den they’re about to raid? No, it was two parents in a dispute with the school.

After their ban, the pair said they emailed the school “regularly” about the needs of their daughter, who is disabled.An officer warned the family in December, telling them to remove Sascha from the school, which they did the following month, a week before the arrests, The Times reported.Allen claimed he and Levine were not abusive and were never told which communications were criminal, which they said was “completely Kafkaesque”.Levine told Sky News that the incident remains “inexplicable” to her. “We cannot fathom what happened; it doesn’t make any sense. We made a few inquiries, we had a bit of banter on a WhatsApp group, and then we were arrested,” she said.A spokesperson for Cowley Hill primary school told the Times that they’re happy for parents to raise concerns as long as they do it in a “suitable” way.Hertfordshire constabulary added: “Following reports of harassment and malicious communications, which are criminal offences, a man and a woman from Borehamwood, both aged in their 40s, were arrested on Wednesday 29 January.“In relation to the police visit on 20 December, a complaint was submitted which was reviewed by our Professional Standards Department.

She said police seized attenders’ phones and laptops.Youth Demand describes itself as “a youth-led nonviolent civil resistance campaign demanding the UK stops arming Israel and cancels all new oil and gas granted since 2021”.The Quakers’ statement said they “strongly condemned the violation of their place of worship” and pointed to the stricter protesting laws brought in by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023, which they claimed were directly responsible for the raid.The Met police said it had arrested six people at the meeting on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. It said it arrested five other people for the same offence on Friday – four in London and one in Exeter.The police said those arrested were part of Youth Demand and claimed those attending the meeting were planning direct action in the capital next month.“Youth Demand have stated an intention to ‘shut down’ London over the month of April using tactics including ‘swarming’ and road blocks,” police said.“While we absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.”Police said all those arrested had been released on bail, except for one who was released and will face no further action.Quakers, a nickname for members of the Religious Society of Friends, follow a religious tradition that grew from Protestant Christianity in the 17th century.Quakers have a long history of supporting protest movements and nonviolence is one of their core beliefs.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

A male opened the door and immediately shut the door on the officers,” theAtlantapolice lieutenant Andrew Smith said, adding that police subsequently cordoned off the area to search it for a suspect.“During the process of establishing the perimeter, two males fled out of the rear of the house,” Smith said. “One male returned back into the house. The other male jumped two fences as he was fleeing. When officers located him on the other side of the fence, he appeared to have suffered an injury to his leg.”He added: “Just to be very clear, the injury that was sustained was not via the officers on scene. It was when the male was fleeing.”According to the medical examiner’s office, Bailey was taken to the Grady Marcus trauma center and died there from his injuries.His cause of death was not immediately determined, with an autopsy pending.Born in Waterboro, South Carolina, Bailey entered the hip-hop scene in Atlanta at a young age where he maintained a “consistent presence … during its commercial boom in the 2010s”, Varietywrote.Besides appearing on songs by other rappers including Future and Young Thug, Bailey worked with Juicy J, Kodak Black and Rick Ross.Speaking toComplex in 2013 about his creative process, Bailey said: “I don’t really care what I say on a beat as long as it’s about some money.“When you try to think hard and write it out, that’s when it’s gonna be fucked up.”Last March, he released one of his latest projects, Trap’s Last Hope, featuring songs including Grind Dont Stop, Ice Game, Free Bands and Letter to God.Explore more on these topicsAtlantaHip-hopUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Each rally was locally organized with original themes. In Ireland, it was “Smash the Fash”, and Switzerland had “Down with Doge”. Photos posted to Bluesky by Tesla Takedown showed demonstrators inSan Jose, California, close to where Tesla was previously headquartered, andAustin, Texas, where its headquarters are now.Musk, the world’s richest person, heads the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), whichhe’s tasked with slashing federal budgetsin the US, including laying off thousands of workers, though he saidin an interview Thursday: “Almost no one has gotten fired.” He’s gone after the Social Security Administration, the Department of Education, the National Park Service and several more departments and agencies, causing widespread backlash and criticism. Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment.View image in fullscreenA protest at a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas, on 29 March 2025.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesIn San Francisco, a crowd of around 200 people gathered in front of the Tesla showroom. Protesters spilled into the busy street and onto the median, confusing the self-driving Waymos trying to get around people darting back and forth.A boombox blasted We’re Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister and cars drove by honking enthusiastically. Even passing postal trucks, public buses and fire engines honked in support. People propped up signs with slogans like “Burn your swastikar before it burns you” and “No Doge bags”. Others flew massive American flags mounted upside down.The block-long Tesla showroom was emptied of all cars, and only a few security guards stood inside, with some San Francisco police outside. At one point, a group of four men wearing red Maga hats and black Doge shirts walked through the crowd, but everything remained calm.“I’m out here protesting because what I see is a hostile takeover of our country,” said Myra Levy, who was holding a sign that said “Pinche Ladrón” (“fucking thief”). “That is not OK for me. That is not OK for all of us.”Her friend, Karen Heisler, emphatically added: “We did not vote for this.”View image in fullscreenProtester Myra Levy (on far left) at the San Francisco Tesla dealership in San Francisco on Saturday.Photograph: Dara Kerr/GuardianIn Berkeley, California, the Tesla showroom has shut down every Saturday for the last month because of the weekly protests, according to salespeople from neighboring retailers. Only security guards have stayed on to guard the building. It’s been the scene of lively demonstrations that have included a mariachi band and a 10-foot cardboard Cybertruck for people to spray-paint. Earlier this month, the showroom’s front door was splattered with red paint. The showroom manager declined to comment.In New York City, several hundred anti-Tesla protesters gathered outside the EV company’s Manhattan showroom on Saturday. Sophie Shepherd, 23, an organizer with Planet Over Profit, explained that the rally was not about protesting electric cars.“We’re here to protest Musk, who has essentially held a Tesla car show on the White House lawn,” she said. “We want to disrupt his business as much as possible, so that includes all Teslas, and not just the Cybertruck.”Marty, 82, said he was attending the New York City rally “because I’m worried about my country”. In the 1960s, he protested the Vietnam war. “Now, it’s the overthrow of our country by oligarchs,” he said. The rally, he went on, was a message to “this guy Elon who is buying our government”.On Friday, the New York police department said its officers were searching for two suspects who allegedly carved the word “Nazis” and a swastika on the doors of a Tesla Cybertruck in Brooklyn this week, part of an uptick inattacks on Tesla vehicles and facilitiesacross the US since Trump took office.View image in fullscreenA protest in London on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn Washington DC, organizers planned a rallyin front of a new Tesla showroom in Georgetown, making the theme “Tesla Takedown Dance Party”. “Dump the meme stock, join dance lines,” read the flyer. “The stakes couldn’t be higher but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun!”“The hypocrisy is so deep,” said Manissa Maharawal, an assistant professor at American University who has studied anti-tech protests and points out that Tesla hasreceived billions in government funding. “It’s this company that’s been subsidized in a lot of ways by the government, but now the CEO is trying to dismantle the government because he thinks he knows better than everyone, because he comes from the tech industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

States with the most planned rallies included Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Texas, Washington and California, totaling more than 100. Several protests also took place throughout Canada.In London, dozens of demonstrators gathered at a Tesla showroom along the three-lane A40 in West London.“Musk is hugely abhorrent. He is funding the far right, and meaning that any Republicans who speak out end up not being funded in their next election,” said gay rights campaigner Nigel Warner.“It’s too overwhelming to do nothing,” said Louise Cobbett-Witten, who has family in the US and was protesting at the Tesla dealership in west London. “There is real solace in coming together like this. Everyone has to do something. We haven’t got a big strategy besides just standing on the side of the street, holding signs and screaming.”Tesla Takedown organizers reiterated the need for people to continue to speak out and protest against Musk, Trump and Doge. The stakes are high and “no one is coming to save us”, they say on theirwebsite.Maharawal, from American University, said she was struck by that sentiment, saying: “For there to be a nationwide and global protest saying ‘no one’s coming to save us’ just speaks to the level of anger and desperation right now.”Eggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against MuskRead moreOrganizers have also been careful to distance themselves from the violent vandalism that has been carried out against Tesla showrooms. Dozens of Tesla facilities have beenattacked in the middle of the nightwith molotov cocktails, gunshots or graffiti saying things like “Fuck Elon” and “Tesla Is Fascist”.Trump has vowed to designate any violence against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism.Tesla Takedown organizers condemn the vandalism. “We are a non-violent grassroots protest movement,” the group says. “We oppose violence and destruction of property.

The 87-year-old also refused a number of offers to paint the lateQueen Elizabeth IIbecause he only paints people he knows.Speaking in an interview with the Times, before his latest art show, Hockney said of the king’s visit to his Marylebone home: “He came on Monday for about an hour. But I didn’t offer to paint him.”Of Elizabeth II he said: “It’s difficult to do the majesty … I thought, she is a genuinely majestic figure, and I just couldn’t see a way to do it.”The Bradford-born artist said in the interview that his pictures were better if he knew the subject “really well”, and he criticised Lucian Freud’s portrait of the late Queen. He said: “When you look at the queen, her skin is absolutely marvellous. It’s very beautiful skin. Well, he didn’t get that at all.”In the interview, Hockney explained that he had moved back to London from his former home in Normandy, France in 2023 because of “intrusion”, as “people kept coming round”.The 87-year-old painter’slatest show, called David Hockney 25, will open in Paris at the Fondation Louis Vuitton art museum and cultural centre.Hockney talked about the new paintings he had produced from his Marylebone home. One of his efforts, which he calls Play Within a Play Within a Play and Me with a Cigarette, is a pro-smoking message. “I’m nearly 88 years old and I didn’t think I’d be here. I’m still a smoker, but I’m surviving,” he said.“I read in the newspaper the other day that lung cancer was going up and smoking was going down. Well, what did that tell me? It told me that it wasn’t really smoking.”The outspoken artist also remarked on his perceived rise of officiousness: “People are getting very … bossy. There’s an awful lot of bossy people about now. They’re little Hitlers, aren’t they? And there’s lots of them. Bossy bossy boots.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is campaigning for Andrea Jenkyns, the former Tory MP, to become Reform’smayor of Greater Lincolnshirein the local elections on 1 May. Lowe comes up a lot when he’s “out footsoldiering” and is a popular figure, Elwick said.Another activist, Ian from Worcestershire, laughed when asked how he thought things were going. “Itwasgoing quite well, wasn’t it?” he said. “He’s had a bad press with theRupert Lowething, but one man doesn’t make a party I suppose, like the Tories with Boris. But I like his [Lowe’s] plain speaking, to be fair.”He hesitated. “Nigel is plain-speaking but he tends to go around the houses a lot.”May’s local elections will be the first big test of whether Farage’s party has managed to maintain its momentum from the general election. The party was polling at 26% last month, a pip ahead of Labour, and is standing candidates in most of the 1,650-odd council seats being contested in 23 councils in England, and for six directly elected mayors.Winning council seats is a way to increase its base of activists and potential candidates for the next general election, and Reform had billed the event at Birmingham’s Utilita Arena as the “biggest rally in modern political history”.Outside, protesters from groups including Stand Up To Racism and National Rejoin March waved EU flags, while Led By Donkeys put up images of Farage and Vladimir Putin saying “Vladimir and Nigel welcome you to Birmingham”.Inside, the Reform supporters – a mix of angular young men in sharp suits and pointy shoes, and older men wearing turquoise ties queuing for selfies with Lee Anderson – were buying “Make Britain Great Again” caps, rosettes and placards.When the event got under way there were plenty of empty seats in upper tiers of the 10,000-capacity arena, and only the first 10 rows of premium seats in front of the stage were full. But Reform’s opponents will not sniff at its ability to gather even 5,000 or 6,000 people to a political event on a Friday night – not many fewer than at Neil Kinnock’s Sheffield rally in 1992 or during Jeremy Corbyn’s 2016 leadership campaign.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage arrives at the rally on a JCB digger.Photograph: Jacob King/PAReform had decked out the arena with a vignette of how it sees modern Britain – a broken-down pub, rubbish on the streets, a dilapidated bus stop and a road strewn with potholes. David Bull, the former Brexit party MEP who Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, described to the crowd as a “modern day Larry Grayson”, toured the set and interviewed some of the mayoral candidates, who includeArron Banks. The Leave.EU founder is standing for the West of England and described himself as being “as popular in Bristol as a pork pie at a bar mitzvah”.Farage arrived on the footplate of a JCB digger, which turned out to be a “Pothole Pro”, he told the crowd. It had been lent to him by JCB’s founder, Anthony Bamford – a longtime Tory donor who recentlygave Faragea helicopter flight worth £8,000 – and can apparently fix potholes for half the price of other diggers. Councils could use them if they weren’t “tied in to five- and 10-year contracts with inferior providers, but we’ll fix that, won’t we, when we control those county councils”.A question for Farage’s party is whether or not he can broaden Reform’s appeal beyond a base that has different priorities and concerns than the rest of the country, and is closer to Donald Trump’s supporters.Polling by Opinium shows that Reform voters are more pessimistic about the economy than the rest of the UK: 80% of Reform voters think things will get worse over the next 12 months, compared with 60% of all voters. And they remain much more concerned about immigration than others, with 77% putting it as one of the most important issues facing Britain compared with 39% overall. Previous polling has revealed them to be more sceptical about sending British troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers and more positive about Trump.Like Trump, Farage has been holding a succession of events – Birmingham was just the latest and largest – and the MBGA caps and razzmatazz production values were matched by some Trumpian policies. He pledged to create a “British form of Doge”, Elon Musk’s controversial cost-cutting unit, to pay for “the cuts that people deserve”, and said civil servants would bebanned from working from home. He took aim at net-zero policies, complained about inheritance tax, promised to end “unskilled migration” and got a standing ovation for the line: “Everyone who comes here illegally will be deported.”He finished to another standing ovation, but there had been a brief moment of dissent during the two-and-a-half-hour rally, when Lowe supporters shouted his name. It may be mentioned again over the next five weeks.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe ObserverNigel FarageRupert LoweLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

As students we can’t,” Jade said.Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Tesla, Starbucks, KFC and X are among the US brands that have been cited as those to be shunned. Those questioned by pollsters also cited Apple, Microsoft, booking platforms Airbnb and Tripadvisor, Nike and Converse.Alain, 43, a pest controller, walked past carrying a Nike bag, having just bought new trainers. “I understand the boycott, but they are the best and they are what I always buy,” he said.View image in fullscreenAn anti-Musk slogan sprayed on a Tesla in Lyon.Photograph: Konrad K/SIPA/REX/ShutterstockWhat France’s consumers say and what they do are different matters, said François Kraus from pollsters Ifop, which carried out the study.“We are starting to see a sanctioning of the US and its policies in people’s attitudes, but there is a gap between the position people have in principle and what they do in practice,” Kraus told theObserver.The poll found leftwing Democrat sympathisers, those over the age of 65 and those with net incomes above €2,400 a month were most in favour of the boycott.“We found the one-third who say they are boycotting are mostly people who are well-educated and reasonably well off who are making a considered and informed decision. These are people who once they change their habits they stick to it,” Kraus added.“They are aware of transatlantic tensions and, as long as Trump is in office, they will beboycotting US products. It is difficult to see, however, what impact this will have in the long term.”The poll found the French were particularly angered by trade tariffs, Trump’s diversity and inclusion clampdown and the treatment of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump’s threats to raise import duty on French and European wines and champagne to 200% have also dampened enthusiasm for the US.Support for the boycott appeared to transcend social groups usually associated with political activism, the poll found. Kraus said the popularity of the US as a student, holiday and business destination is at a 40-year low.Today, 22% of those quizzed would like to study in the US compared with 48% in 2010. The number who want to live there has dropped from 30% to 22%, and only 20% now want to work in the US compared with 37% 15 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the aim was to encourage his compatriots to choose French and European goods over American products.“We hope the idea will enter people’s minds when they are in the supermarket and have to decide between two products 50cm apart, and they will choose a product that is in keeping with their values. Most French and European people will do this in silence, discreetly, instinctively,” Roussez said.Speaking on RMC radio, journalist Jean-Philippe Doux dismissed the idea of a boycott as “ridiculous”.Roussez disagreed: “It’s not about overthrowing Trump or the US economy – it’s about doing something, however modest, to redress the balance. It’s symbolic, and we know Americans are fond of symbols. We remember the freedom fries symbolism used during the Iraq war. Now we are using those same symbols against them.“Boycott is a strong and hard word but what we are really saying is buy French and European. Just as the Americans are saying ‘America first’, we are saying ‘France and Europe first’.“As an individual I feel I need to do something. I don’t care if it’s considered ridiculous. Economies are the sum of individuals, and I’m voting using my custom to choose French and European products for my future and the future of my children.”Out on the Grands Boulevards, plenty of French consumers seemed to want to be left to enjoy their Big Macs made from French beef and their chicken nuggets made from French fowl.Delphine, 35, a care assistant, said a boycott was a good idea in theory. “I don’t go to McDonald’s and I don’t drink Coke. While I might think twice about buying something from the US, there would have to be an obvious and not inconvenient alternative. In any case, it’s not like I’m going out tomorrow to buy aTesla.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverMcDonald'sCoca-ColaTrump tariffsProtestDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Then, theAtlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published the chat in full, contradicting Gabbard’s remarks that no classified data or weapons systems had been mentioned in the chat.Q&AWhat is Signal?ShowSignal is a messaging app founded in 2012 that allows users to transmit texts, photos, videos and documents, as well as make audio and video calls. It uses end-to-end encryption, which protects messages against hackers and cyberattacks via an extra layer of security. Several other privacy features, such as the ability to automatically delete messages, have made it popular among communities such as journalists and activists that frequently deal with sensitive information.Signal is run by the non-profit Signal Foundation and relies on donations to function, giving it a different business model than other encrypted messaging services such as Meta-owned WhatsApp. It does not track user data to the same extent as Meta and publishes its code to allow for public auditing of its security measures. Signal, like any messaging app, is still vulnerable to human error through methods like phishing attacks or  spyware which can allow hackers to gain access to users’ devices. The Signal Foundation’s president called the addition of The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief a user error rather than a problem with her app’s security.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there,” said Gabbard. “What was shared today reflects the fact that I was not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat.”Then there was the US secretary of defense,Pete Hegsethwho – staring straight down the camera – baldly stated: “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.” The next day, Goldberg revealed that Hegseth himself had texted the precise timing of the attacks and the weapons systems to be used, specifically F-18 jets and MQ-9 drones.It’s unlikely that anyone will be punished. Trump has told his aides that he doesn’t want to give the Atlantic a scalpAnd Michael Waltz, the White House national security adviser, was left scrambling on live television as he was quizzed by a Fox News anchor on how Goldberg’s number had ended up on his phone. “You’ve never talked to him before so how is the number on your phone?” asked conservative television anchor Laura Ingraham. “It gets sucked in,” Waltz, a former congressman and army special forces soldier, replied – without explaining how a number can get “sucked in” to a phone.But despite all this, no one is really taking the prospects of an investigation seriously. At heart, this is about politics – and the fact is that Democrats simply don’t have the votes or the sway to deliver a body blow to the administration at this point.It’s unlikely that anyone will be punished.Donald Trumphas told his aides that he doesn’t want to give theAtlantica scalp, and vice-president JD Vance responded forcefully during a trip to Greenland on Friday: “If you think you’re going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody you’ve got another think coming … I’m the vice-president saying it here on Friday: we are standing behind our entire national security team.”For decades, national security was broadly seen as the last bastion of bipartisanship in Washington, an area where Democrats and Republicans put aside their differences for a general consensus on supporting the national interest. Members of Congress on the intelligence and foreign affairs committees often maintained cordial relationships. There was also an understanding that big scandals could jump the partisan line, and lead to serious repercussions even with tensions between the parties at their highest.Scooter Libby, once chief of staff to vice-president Dick Cheney, was sentenced to prison after an investigation into the leak of the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame. The Department of Justice under Barack Obama launched more Espionage Act investigations for leaking sensitive information than all previous administrations combined.Hillary Clinton warns Trump ‘stupidity’ will leave US ‘feeble and friendless’Read moreAnd the FBI, of course, launched a years-long investigation into Hillary Clinton for keeping emails on a home computer server that ultimately may have helped sway the elections. “It’s not the hypocrisy that bothers me; it’s the stupidity,” Clinton wrote in aNew York Timesop-ed on Friday. “We’re all shocked – shocked! – that President Trump and his team don’t actually care about protecting classified information or federal record retention laws … What’s much worse is that topTrump administrationofficials put our troops in jeopardy by sharing military plans on a commercial messaging app and unwittingly invited a journalist into the chat. That’s dangerous. And it’s just dumb.”Observers have remarked that the scandal would have been far greater if it had taken place at a lower level in the intelligence community. Mid-level officers and defence officials would all face far harsher blowback if they were caught divulging the kind of information that Hegseth sent into the chat, including the specific timing of the strikes and the weapons systems to be used.But the Trump administration believes that it can simply divert and divide public attention until there is a new scandal. That may be a winning strategy. Trump is to introduce tariffs this week that will probably dominate the news agenda for weeks. And his deputies are out on cable news every day, pushing back at the media for covering the scandal and suggesting that Goldberg somehow sneaked his way into the chat rather than being added directly by Waltz, the national security adviser.“They have treated this as a media event to be spun rather than a grievous error to be rectified,”wrote Phil Klay, a military veteran and guest columnist for theNew York Times. The early indications are that the Trump administration will skate through this scandal, crossing into new territory in Washington where even a major security leak can be repainted as the fault of the media for covering it.Andrew Roth is the Guardian’s global affairs correspondent based in Washington DCExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakThe ObserverTrump administrationUS politicsPete HegsethUS national securityDonald TrumpSocial mediaanalysisShareReuse this content"

A not so subtle expression of soft Saudi Arabian power? A wonderful example of the synergy between a city and its football club? Or a Sunderland supporter’s worst nightmare?Saturday’s celebrations on Newcastle’s Town Moor staged to commemorate Eddie Howe’s team’sCarabao Cup triumph against Liverpoolat Wembley two weeks ago was all those things and much, much, more.Newcastle’s new stadium video gives added impetus to proposed moveRead moreIf the collection of the team’s first major domestic trophy since the 1955 FA Cup meant different things to different people it was also quite some statement. While around 200,000 fans crammed into a small area of the city centre towatch two open-top buses transport Howeand his players the short distance separating St James’ Park from the Town Moor, a further 150,000 gathered on an expanse of urban green space larger than New York’s Central Park.Only those who had applied for free, electronic tickets were admitted and, having passed security, they stood from 1.30pm until approaching 8pm, watching a re-run of the final on big screens before being entertained by not only local bands but – inevitably – by Ant and Dec.A little earlier that ubiquitous pair were aboard the buses conducting interviews relayed on those big screens. As a fan outside St James’ Park sat atop Sir Bobby Robson’s statue, and others balanced on the top of bus shelters or perched precariously up trees, Howe struggled to contain his emotions. “I hoped people would show up but this is unbelievable,” said Robson’s latest successor against a soundtrack of the cheers and “Toon Army” chants echoing well beyond Gallowgate. “I didn’t know what to expect today but it’s incredible. I can’t thank the people of Newcastle enough. It’s very emotional.”View image in fullscreenOne Newcastle fan greets the players from a unique vantage point on route.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThis, though was merely the warm-up for the main event – the moment when Howe and his squad took to the temporary Town Moor stage. It arrived at 6.30pm. By then the broadcasters’ helicopters overhead had filmed the sort of dramatic aerial shots of seething humanity that Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners would doubtless see as emphasising their ability to not merely shape a football club but an entire UK city.When Howe arrived on stage and lifted the cup his smile was as broad as the Tyne. “We’re desperate for more,” said Newcastle’s manager. “When you get a taste of something like this it makes you hungry. Hopefully this is just the start.”As Newcastle’s players took turns to hoist the trophy a day that had begun with fans queuing outside the club shop at St James’ well before its 9am opening was drawing to a close. No matter that the weather was chilly enough to necessitate supplementing the uniform black and white striped replica shirts with winter coats and woolly hats, this was a city feeling the power of the sun on its back after finally emerging from a footballing ice age.Although the celebration was ostensibly “dry”, many attendees warmed up with a few drinks in the packed bars of Gosforth and Jesmond, two suburbs within walking distance of the Town Moor.View image in fullscreenTwo dogs don black and white stripes.Photograph: Harriet Massey/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesAmid multiple road closures and public transport chaos the city drew, happily, to a standstill as an extraordinary, uniquely monochrome, festival unfolded. Even the mannequins used to promoted the latest spring women’s fashions in the city centre window of Fenwick department store were dressed in black and white.Outside John Lewis, shoppers queued to have their photographs taken alongside a replicaCarabao Cupwith the excitement of children waiting for a Christmas audience in Santa’s grotto.More hardcore, if ticketless, fans milled around St James’ Park as lengthy queues built up around the Town Moor. Attendees frequently encompassed three or four generations of the same family as fans from as far afield as Australia, North America, Kenya and South Korea mingled with locals who view Sunderland as a foreign country.Back in town, pavements filled with fans already in position for the bus parade, with the more enterprising lining the ramps of an empty car park near the Haymarket in order to gain prime vantage points.As the sound of vuvuzelas filled the air the front of the Sandman Signature hotel opposite St James’ Park was covered with a giant banner of Howe. Newcastle’s manager could not miss it as, at 4.30pm precisely, the team’s two open-topped buses pulled on to the road and, amid a cacophony of noise and serenaded by a series of flares, the players visibly gasped in awe.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães (centre) enjoys the moment on stage at Town Moor.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images“Oh my God,” said the winger Jacob Murphy. “It’s amazing.” His fellow wide man, Harvey Barnes, did not disagree: “This,” he said, “is something else.”Fans who witnessed the 1955 FA Cup win were in a minority, with 95-year-old Elsie Burns foremost among them. During a six-month stay in a sanatorium spent recovering from tuberculosis she had held that trophy herself in the course of a morale-boosting visit from Newcastle players.Seventy years on the mere thought of catching a glimpse of the Carabao Cup provoked delirium as streets blending brutalist 1960s and 1970s architecture with some of the finest Georgian buildings outside Bath became almost alarmingly packed and images of Sandro Tonali, Alexander Isak, Dan Burn, Bruno Guimaraes and the rest of Howe’s heroes stared down from lampposts.One of the parade buses, a retired London doubledecker with its roof chopped off, failed the first of two MOT tests last week but as it headed to the Moor the engine seemed as finely tuned as Howe’s midfield. “We could get used to this,” reflected Newcastle’s former England centre-forward Alan Shearer, speaking for many. “The last two weeks have probably been the best of my life.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedThe ObserverCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was at the lowest point of my life – depressed and anxious and doing weekly therapy to exorcise the demons of my past.I decided I would only accept love from someone who genuinely thought my needs, opinions, ambitions and time were as valuable as theirs. And if I couldn’t find such a person, that was OK, because I was already enough. In any case, I doubted such a person existed.The moment I knew: we hadn’t met, I hadn’t seen a picture. But when I read her words a humming started upRead moreNevertheless, I was first-dating my way through a list of potentials that included a Buddhist dog trainer (he was the Buddhist, not the dogs), a CEO of a multinational company, an accountant, a couple of lawyers, a policeman, a meteorologist and enough IT professionals to fill an Excel spreadsheet.Then I stumbled on an academic and journalist. I googled this Dr Christopher Scanlon fellow before our first date and found a stack of articles he’d written for various newspapers. Let me tell you, this man could write.So, obviously, I fell for him instantly. Good writing is like porn to me. Our first date progressed in the usual way, discussing prepositions and past participles. Well, not quite. We were far more interested in the common misuse of the word “amount” instead of “number”.Things nearly came to an abrupt halt on our third date when I discovered he was Catholic. It was a twist for me, because I had deliberately filtered my internet dating search to only return profiles of people who were atheist or agnostic. It turned out Chris had accidentally missed the “religious and spiritual beliefs” section on his profile. His faith was confronting enough for this little atheist, but lack of attention to detail was the real shocker. I decided to put my pedantry aside and overlook this character flaw.A few months after Chris and I started dating, events in my life unspooled further and it became clear to me that when it came to regaining my mental health, I had a long way to go.I decided it was time to call things off. I took him out for coffee to end our relationship. I told him I adored him, that he was exactly the person I could see myself with, but that I couldn’t do a relationship right now. I told him it was stupid of me to have even tried and unfair of me to have lured him into my crazy life and messed him around. I needed to sort myself out before I could share my life with someone else, I told him. And since I had no idea how long that was going to take, we needed to break up.Chris was quiet for a moment. He looked at me across the table. He took a sip of his long macchiato as I tried to gauge how much I’d hurt him. Chris and I had never argued, so I didn’t know what response I was going to get – anger, cruelty, sulking or indifference?View image in fullscreenChris and Kasey on their wedding dayI braced myself for any and all of the standard responses. But then he replied, simply: “I’ll wait.”Those two words were the purest expression of love I had ever experienced. Nobody had ever waited for me. Ever. Even the people who were supposed to love me didn’t wait for me.I had grown up believing love was only available to me if I kept up with someone else’s pace. I believed I only had a shot at being loved if I only showed the best version of myself. And here was a man seeing me at my lowest, most broken, most distressed and asking nothing from me but me.Chris reached across the table and took my hand. “You’re going to get through this, puss cat,” he said. “And when you do I’ll be here.”I took Christopher Bernard Scanlon to be my lawfully wedded husband 18 months later in a tiny (Catholic!!) church in Hobart, the same church his parents were married in 40 years earlier.I knew then it was the smartest decision I had ever made in my life. Years later, I still know this to be true.

It wasn’t outside in trucks though – it was on the stage! They played two nights, and after the first night they left all the gear up, because they were playing there the next night. I knew the Hammersmith Odeon like the back of my hand, I used to bunk in there all the time. I was like the Phantom of Hammersmith Odeon.It was about two in the morning. I stole a little minivan and I got in. There was no one there, other than a guy sitting on the fourth or fifth row, asleep – he was snoring. It was dead silent. I tiptoed across the stage, and I nicked some cymbals, the bass player’s [amplifier] head – a Sunn amp it was – and some microphones. I got Bowie’s microphone with his lipstick on it!Did you everfess up to Bowie about this?I kind of did, on a phone call. He knew I’d done it; he thought it was funny. Actually, I don’t think I nicked anything off him, I don’t think the microphones were his. The only ones I felt bad for were Woody [drummer, Mick Woodmansey] and [bass player] Trevor Bolder.I actually did make amends with Woody. He came on my radio show a few years back, and I thought I’d tell him live, when we were on the air, what I did. I was like, “I’ve got to make amends to you, Woody, I nicked some of your cymbals. What can I do to make it right?” He goes, “I don’t know; give us a couple of hundred bucks.” I think I gave him $300, so he was well happy.What album do you always return to?Oh,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardustis always a go-to.What’s the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened to you on stage?There was a time in 1996, when theSex Pistolsplayed in Milwaukee, a big club which had a ridiculously high stage – it was about 20 foot. Some guy walked on the stage, I don’t know how he got through. John [Johnny Rotten, nee John Lydon]’s security Rambo saw him and came running across the stage. He grabbed the guy, the guy hit John, and John fell off the stage, head first. And I thought, that’s the end of that. But he got up and carried on!View image in fullscreenThe Sex Pistols in 2024: Glen Matlock, Frank Carter, Steve Jones and Paul Cook.Photograph: Henry RuggeriPunters are raving aboutFrank Carteras the new singer of the Pistols. How does it feel playing these old songs with a new frontman?It’s great, it’s refreshing. He’s younger – well, he’s 40. I’ll be 70 this year! But he’s got bundles of energy, and he’s great with an audience. He’s not trying to be Johnny Rotten. People love it. My philosophy is, don’t play more than an hour and 15, an hour and 30, max. Whenever I go to a concert, I’m not interested in seeing a band for three hours. I guess some artists think the crowd’s getting their money’s worth, but for me, I’m bored after an hour or so.We often askpeople who they would like to play them in a biopic. You’ve already had one! Did you enjoy Toby Wallace’s portrayal of you inPistol?I love Toby, he’s great. He came out [to Los Angeles] and he’d stare at me for a long time, trying to pick up my mannerisms. He had to get someone to help him with his speech, obviously, because he’s got the Australian accent. Sometimes he slipped up a little bit, but I thought he did pretty good.The one thing that bugged me was this scene where they go on about my guitar – “Oh, it’s like Excalibur!” – but they couldn’t even find one close to mine. The one they used looked like it was from Woolworths. It must have cost a tenner. I would gladly have lent them one of mine.You know a lot of people. Who’s the most famous person in your phone?I do know many famous people, but this is a great story. When I was doing Indie 103.1, I ran into Cliff Richard. I said do you want tocome on the show, have a larf? And he said OK. He came down, brought his guitars, and I couldn’t get him to shut up. He went through all the old classic songs. He’s such a pro. They don’t make ’em like him any more.Anyway, he left, I had his number, and funnily enough he called me on my landline when we got acceptedinto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He left a message and he just started singing,“Congratulations! And jubilations!”It was the funniest thing ever.Besides Cliff, you’ve hosted everyone from Judas Priest to Brian Wilson on your show. Who was your most chaotic guest?I would sayJerry Lee Lewis. He was really ornery and prickly. I think I said, “What was it like when you went to England?” And I don’t think he actually got to tour in England – he got banned becausehe was married to his cousin, who was underage. And he just turned on me: “I don’t wanna talk about that!” And there was silence. I didn’t know what to do, I started to panic.In the late 80s you played on a Bob Dylan song,Sally Sue Brown. How was Bob in those days?It was bizarre. I met him a couple of weeks prior to him asking me to put a band together out at some party. I had long hair and was on my Harley with no helmet, and he was gravitating towards me. Someone must have told him I was in the Sex Pistols. We hung out for a bit, and I got a call two weeks later, can you put a band together, and we’ll do a session down at Sunset Sound [studios].So, I did. Paul Simonen [ex-the Clash] happened to be in town at that time. I got the drummer from Pat Benatar’s band, the keyboard player was playing with Rod Stewart. We ended up on that song, which is a cover. We kind of gelled on that one.What song do you want played at your funeral?That’s a funny one. I guess some people who are narcissists would already be thinking of this stuff, right? I’m not as narcissistic as a lot of people I know, but I’ve learned over many years of being sober that it ain’t all about me. I don’t know, that’s a miserable question. It just tells you you’re gonna die one day.Do you have a party trick?I like to fart in front of people. You can tell if someone’s cool or not from their reaction. I farted in front of Lisa Marie Presley once. She was sitting outside Starbucks and I was going in, and I just let one rip. She had this look on her face of disgust. I just carried on walking into Starbucks.

But Matt Remick, Rogen’s character inThe Studio, isn’t a manchild but a man: a pretty regular middle-aged one, trying to do good, honest work in a sour, cynical business.It’s the industry around Matt, rather, that appears stuck in a state of arrested development, as he’s handed one lazy, juvenile, IP-milking movie pitch after another (including a Kool-Aid origin story that sounds almost too plausible to be parodic) while trying to hold on to his soul.Back in the mid-2000s, Rogen broke through in Hollywood as the very picture of wise-cracking, dope-smoking slackerdom; nearly 20 years later, the Canadian actor and filmmaker is perilously close to playing the straight man. Off-screen, too, Rogen has shaped up and grown up, even if he remainsthe most enthusiastic marijuana advocate in showbiz.The Studio, which he devised and directed with his longtime creative partner Evan Goldberg, may be the crispest embodiment yet of Rogen’s more mature persona, but it’s not an abrupt about-face: now 42, the star has been quietly and cannily tweaking his public and professional image over the years, correcting past missteps and modelling a progressive attitude where many straight white dudebro comics have turned bitter or defensive against the perceived onset of new, “woke” industry standards.View image in fullscreenRogen with Katherine Heigl in the 2007 film Knocked Up.Photograph: Universal/Allstar“The complaint that comedy’s harder than it used to be is not a valid complaint,” Rogen said in anEsquireinterview earlier this year. “Maybe it was too easy before. And why should it be? Why shouldn’t it be hard? I like that my job is hard, because I’m trying to do ­something that requires a huge amount of resources and people’s time and energy.”The quote went viral, attracting applause from critics and viewers, weary of more entrenched, demographically predictable culture-war positions. Funny, perceptive and sufficiently switched on to have attracted guest stars ranging fromMartin ScorsesetoSarah Polleyto Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos,The Studiosuggests Rogen is coping just fine with that degree of difficulty.The younger, hotter-headed Rogen may not have recognised such gentle diplomacy. Raised in a middle-class Jewish household in Vancouver, the young Rogen saw his family background as material for irreverent stand-up routines before, aged just 16, landing a role as an acerbic high-school outcast in Judd Apatow’s cult teen TV seriesFreaks and Geeks.The gig gained Rogen a steady place in Apatow’s so-called comic “frat pack,” and it was Apatow who gave Rogen, at 25, his first starring vehicle. In the hit 2007 romcomKnocked Up, he and Katherine Heigl, then hot property from TV’sGrey’s Anatomy, played reluctant parents-to-be following a drunken one-night stand. It was a classic comedy of mismatch, mining laughs from the friction between Heigl’s Type-A career-woman character and Rogen’s shaggy stoner; though it was well received at the time, its hard, blank female characterisation and sympathetic stance toward male jocularity would meet with more criticism in a post-#MeToo age.Heigl herself was a sceptic at the time, stating in interviews not long after the film’s release that she found it “a little sexist”: “It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys.” Rogen, pressed for a response by radio shock-jock Howard Stern, responded rashly. “It’s not like we’re the only people she said some batshit crazy things about,” he said. “That’s kind of her bag now.”View image in fullscreenSeth Rogen in This Is the End with James Franco (left) and Jay Baruchel (right).Photograph: Columbia Pictures/AllstarRogen would walk back these comments years later, though this minor feud cast both stars’ images in stone for a few years. Heigl, sure enough, was branded as humourless and uptight and hard to work with, as her career momentum soon stalled; Rogen, depending on your point of view, was either a fun hang or a boorish loose cannon. Either way, he was better business. In the same summer asKnocked Up, the broad,lewd teen comedySuperbad– which he wrote with Goldberg, and in which he played a supporting role – became an instant generational touchstone, cementing the distinctiveness of Rogen’s comic voice both on and off camera.That swift one-two of unexpected ­blockbusters cued a steady stream of work for the unlikely star, including such scattershot vehicles asObserve and ReportandZack and Miri Make a Porno, and a green light for his own most indulgent projects: together with indie director David Gordon Green, he and Goldberg attempted to resurrect the moribund stoner-comedy genre with the daft, suitably incoherentPineapple Express, the moderate commercial success of which seems a generous effect of theKnocked Up/Superbadafterglow. Other writing credits went less well: the Owen Wilson comedy was a witless dud,The Green Hornetan expensive superhero flop,The Watchan instantly forgettable (and forgotten) sci-fi caper. Still, he and Goldberg retained enough studio goodwill to make their joint directorial debut with 2013’s mildly amusing apocalypse comedyThis Is the End, only for the following year’s political satireThe Interviewto effectively end their directing careers after the premise of the film, starring Rogen and regular collaborator James Franco as hapless journalists recruited to assassinateKim Jong-un, attracted the ire of the North Korean government.Sony largely nixed its theatrical release.On screen, meanwhile, Rogen alternated between playing oafishly to type and pushing subtly against it: he was a schlub in Polley’s 2012 romantic dramaTake This Waltz, but a wounded, tender one, and a gentle foil toBarbra Streisand’s overbearing Jewish mother stereotype inThe Guilt Trip. As the long-suffering tech entrepreneur Steve Wozniak inDanny Boyle’s biopicSteve Jobs, he made a bid for prestige thespian credibility, while even in more tailored comic fare like the hitNeighborsfilms, he admitted some growth, taking the part of the weary family man to Zac Efron’s heedless hedonist.But it was 2019’sLong Shot, which returned him to the romantic comedy genre opposite Charlize Theron, that most clearly exemplified the new-model Rogen as he approached 40.As an unemployed journo hired as a speechwriter for Theron’s sleek presidential candidate, he was still scruffy, still offbeat, but softly, sweetly so: in contrast toKnocked Up, the film’s Pygmalion-style narrative necessitated more change on the man’s part than the woman’s. And in Steven Spielberg’s nostalgic autofictionThe Fabelmanshe was unimpeachably gentle as one of the most sympathetic homewreckers in all of cinema, seducing Michelle Williams’s matriarch with unspoken puppy-dog longing.In person, Rogen has made up for any earlier indiscretions with an unblotted nice-guy reputation: if the public knows little about his 20-year, intentionally child-free relationship with actress and writer Lauren Miller, that’s exactly the way he wants it.His only personal relationship to garner any scrutiny is his former friendship with Franco, whose star has fallen in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations — though Rogen once stated his intent to keep working with the embattled actor, he’s since cut ties entirely. Asked by aSunday Timesjournalist if the estrangement was painful, his answer was guarded: “Not as painful and difficult as it is for a lot of other people involved. I have no pity for myself in this situation.”In interviews, he prefers to talk about his ceramics hobby and his unflagging weed habit — both of which he’s combined into a surprisinglyelegant lifestyle brand, Houseplant— and remains proudly outspoken on political matters. His condemnation of Zionism (“I was fed a huge amount of lies about Israel,” he said on a Marc Maron podcast in 2020) has aroused controversy for which he has steadfastly not apologised.For Rogen, niceness needn’t equal blandness — just asThe Studio, prickly and pointed in all the right places, proves that “mature” comedy isn’t the safer route.Seth Rogen on going from onscreen slacker to studio boss: ‘People really do scream at each other in Hollywood’Read moreExplore more on these topicsSeth RogenThe ObserverComedy filmsTV comedyTelevisionComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most of us have a bottle of seed oil, normally called vegetable oil in the UK, in our kitchens – a nearly tasteless but very useful fat that has been a commonplace cooking ingredient for decades.And yet this previously unremarkable golden liquid has sparked online furore and vicious debate.Nutritioninfluencers on social media have described it as “toxic”, “inflammatory”, “unnatural” and the root cause of the obesity epidemic.The US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, whohas caused controversy with his viewson subjects from vaccines to fluoride in drinking water,has saidthe population is being “unknowingly poisoned” by seed oils and urged people to revert to “traditional” fats such as butter, lard and beef dripping for better health.Last month theWall Street Journalreportedthat fast food chains were promoting their shift away from seed oils after Kennedy’s criticisms. He even made a televised visit to a branch of Steak ’n Shake to praise its decision to cook fries in beef tallow instead.So should we really be ditching our bottles of vegetable and sunflower oils and covering everything in lard?Seed oils have been in widespread use since about the 1950s and, as well as being used for home cooking, are also in many ultra-processed foods. They include rapeseed (known as canola in the US and generally labelled as vegetable oil in the UK), sunflower, soya bean, corn, grapeseed, rice bran, sesame and safflower. While you can buy cold-pressed seed oils, the most common production method involves using a solvent (normally hexane) to extract the oil from the plant. It is correct that hexane is a toxic substance, but it is almost entirely removed from the final product by the refining process – the EU allows a maximum residual limit of 1mg per kilo.The refining process includes bleaching and deodorising, both of which critics have jumped on to claim that seed oil is “unnatural” and therefore “bad”.Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, who has spent his career researching dietary fat and health, explains: “The processing actually takes out potentially toxic material.”Sarah Berry, professor of nutritional sciences at King’s, agrees: “The end product, in my opinion, is very safe to eat.”The next allegation against seed oils is that they are “inflammatory”. This assumption is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the science, says Berry.View image in fullscreenRapeseed oil (known as canola in the US) is no science-based cause for concern.Photograph: Larry Crowe/APSeed oil critics claim that the type of omega-6 fatty acid present in them (called linoleic acid) can be inflammatory, whereas omega-3 – the other essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, found in foodstuffs such as oily fish, flaxseed and chia seeds – can reduce inflammation.“Because the enzymes used to convert omega-3 into anti-inflammatory chemicals are the same ones used to convert omega- 6, their argument is that having too much seed oil will mean the enzymes are stolen away from the omega-3,” says Berry.“This isn’t true. It’s true from a theoretical biochemical pathway. It’s true in mice upon unrealistic stimuli. But it is absolutely not true in humans.” In fact, randomised, controlled trials show that linoleic acid has either a neutral or, in most studies, an anti-inflammatory effect in humans.“The idea that linoleic acid is some sort of toxic thing is absolute nonsense,” says Sanders. “It’s an essential nutrient. Of the essential fatty acids it’s the most important one. If you’re deficient, it impairs immune function and platelet function doesn’t work.”It also has a potent cholesterol-lowering effect, says Berry, who is chief scientist at nutrition company Zoe. “It has been shown to reduce blood cholesterol significantly. Because of this and based on the current evidence I would say that not only are seed oils notbad for us, they are a healthy part of our diet.”Sanders attributes much of the decline in cardiovascular disease we’ve seen in the past 50 years to our increased consumption of seed oils. A few weeks ago, a study that followed 200,000 adults over 33 years found that those who replaced a tablespoon of butter a day with the same amount of plant-based oil such as soya bean or rapeseed had a 17% reduction in risk of death from all causes. The study, which was published inJAMA Internal Medicinealso found a 17% reduction in risk of death from cancer.“Our study found that higher butter intake was associated with increased deaths from all causes and cancer, while higher intake of plant-based oils was associated with lower deaths from all causes, cancer and cardiovascular disease,” said lead study author Yu Zhang, a graduate student at Harvard TH Chan School of PublicHealth.Priya Tew, from Dietitian UK, says some of the confusion might have come from a 1960s study: “It showed men with heart disease had a higher intake of seed oils. But this was through margarines that also contain trans fats, which we know increase the risk of heart disease.”A similar logic applies to the argument that, as our intake of seed oils has risen – which it has more than 200-fold over the past 50 to 70 years – so too have our rates of chronic disease.“Association does not mean causality,” says Berry. “Think what else has changed; our food landscape is almost unrecognisable compared with 70 years ago. It’s estimated 60% of the seed oils we consume come from ultra-processed food which has many other chemicals that are unhealthy for us and processes that affect the healthfulness of the food.”In other words, it’s not the seed oil that’s the problem.Berry’s recent statements about seed oils have landed her in hot water. After appearing on a podcast explaining that seed oils are healthy, she received relentless hate mail, including being told she’s “the most hated scientist in America”.“It nearly got to the point where I was going to stop speaking out on the topic so I didn’t have to be subjected to such horrible comments and meanness. But then I thought, that’s exactly what they want. They want to shut down the real evidence, so it just galvanised me to speak out about it even more.”As always, with nutrition, it’s better to consider overall diet than to hyper-fixate on one ingredient. But these kind of messages don’t tend to get as much traction. “Human nature is such that we are more susceptible to risk and scare headlines,” Berry says. “They’re going to get more clicks than a balanced, boring nutrition scientist like myself saying seed oils are fine as part of a balanced diet.”Sanders says you don’t have to ditch your seed oils and you shouldn’t swap them for butter or lard. “The seed oil scare is all just gossip. It’s not based on any good science at all.”Explore more on these topicsNutritionThe ObserverHealthFoodUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eventually we uncovered the truth behind the passionJuliet RosenfeldSat 29 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareProfessor M was a 60-year-old academic in a scientific, technical field. She chose to lie on my couch, rather than sit opposite me, from our second meeting. Thick black glasses framed her strong nose and she wore monochrome, androgynous clothes. She had a stern authority about her that I noticed the very first time I met her. Her hair was uncoloured and cut into a chic crop. She had lived in London since university in her home country on another continent, and English was her third language, which she spoke perfectly. She had never seen a psychotherapist before.In the first weeks of our work together, she talked – without stopping, breathlessly – about a man she had known in her 20s while undertaking doctoral work in America. By chance, they had met again recently at a conference overseas where both were presenting papers. They had sex in a hotel room hours after this meeting. A relationship began, with intense communication by email, text and phone. The man lived in a city about four hours by train from London, with his wife and three teenage children.Professor M, who was rather a formal person, told me during our third session that she was ashamed to admit she was “utterly possessed by his penis”. At this point, she had been with her partner for 25 years. In that time, she had never been remotely interested in any other man. Her lover had erupted completely unexpectedly into her life. Her contented, interesting existence with her life companion had been blown apart. Now, the sound of her lover’s voice led to sudden “electric shocks down below” and she bought herself a vibrator to manage her new “roaring libido”.In those early sessions, she wanted to describe her relationship with her partner. He had an adult son from a previous relationship, whom Professor M was close to, as she was to the rest of his family. Professor M and her partner had many mutual friends, shared similar hobbies and interests, and played a sport they both loved. This made her affair all the more baffling to her. Until her lover arrived in her life, she told me she was happy with her partner, or thought she had been.Twice a week I would see her and she would describe her yearning for her secret lover. It seemed to build over the weekend, when contact was restricted because of his wife and Professor M’s partner. However, they had found a routine, a way of staying in touch via phone calls, sometimes Zoom conversations, emails and presents they sent to their offices in their respective universities. No one knew of it but them. And now me.As a psychotherapist I have strict codes about discussing my patients: I do so only under clinical conditions, and always anonymised. But I’m writing about Professor M because she asked me to. I had placed an ad in the classifieds section of various publications:Have you had an affair? Published author and psychotherapist keen to interview under strict anonymity for case studies in this underexplored aspect of behaviour.Professor M, by this time a former patient of mine, got in touch. She knew I was researching the subject and suggested I include her story. She hoped it might help others, she said, to see the devastation that an affair can cause. To my surprise, she was not alone: the responses to my advert flowed in.We are not normally let into affairs at all, let alone given an intimate account of them. Affairs often remain secret, even after they end. Affairs are powerful disrupters, yet they go on around us all the time, hidden from view. One in five of us will have an affair. (These are the ones that are reported and can be found in statistics.) We will all know someone, if not several people, who have had one. You may have had an affair yourself or you may have been the “victim” of an affair. Despite many radical changes in society’s attitudes to how we live, who we live with and how we define ourselves, affairs continue to shock, perplex, disgust and fascinate us.There are affairs where a spouse is aware of what is going on and even supports it. There are emotional affairs, when no physical sexual betrayal takes place. There are even now affairs that are conducted entirely online. Without ever meeting, two people are immersed in a profoundly inappropriate, disinhibited long-term sexual relationship. I spoke to someone in this situation. He is a distinguished doctor who sends photographs of his genitals to a young woman he will never meet in real life. He describes himself as crazily in love with her.She described waiting between their calls as a kind of hungry longing. Her vibrator broke from overuseI also spoke to a “happily” married man, a patriarch and now grandfather, who has long relationships with married (sometimes), pregnant women decades younger than him; a psychotherapist who treated and then seduced her patient, destroying her career and losing her licence to practise in the process; a woman married to “the love of my life” for 25 years who left him for a woman (her children did not speak to her for more than a year after they found out about the affair); and a senior management consultant who has sex with her chief executive, knowing any relationship between employees is forbidden and a sackable offence.I now believe, having researched this subject over four years, that, for many people, affairs are as hardwired in our DNA as fidelity. What is rarely understood is that the roots of most affairs are there decades before two people meet. Yes, decades. Here’s why: the reasons are locked in our infancy and childhood. That is, in the past not the present. The unmet needs for affairs are locked deeply within our psyches: to be held, communicated with, responded to, loved. Without adequate caregiving and interest early on, we seek emotional and physical reassurance and stimulation in myriad ways throughout life. Having an affair is one way.Psychoanalysis does not give us all the answers, but it helps us understand our behaviour. By exploring the unconscious through the stories of others, we can begin to learn more about the motivations for this most risky of relationships. So it was for my work with Professor M.From the beginning of the therapy, there was rarely room for me to speak or comment. Professor M would come in, throw her bag and her coat on the chair opposite mine and almost fling herself on to my couch. I sat behind her, observing her expressive hand gestures as she talked about this man obsessively. She described every aspect of him and every detail of what he did to her.I frequently felt overwhelmed and squeezed out by Professor M’s monologues. She was obsessively interested by him, like a teenager with a rock star. Her lover was not her usual type, but she worshipped his body. She wasn’t an aftershave fan, but she adored his smell. She didn’t have a physical “type”, but she was really turned on by his stocky chest, hairy back and firm calves. She spoke of the smooth, clear skin on his back and muscled buttocks with ardour. He played a very physical team sport twice a week and she fantasised about watching him play, beating opponents on the field with his incredible skill.She described waiting between calls, for their virtual “meetings”, as a kind of hungry longing. She bought herself another vibrator as the first one had broken from overuse. Her lover’s voice, the way he cleared his throat, even his occasional cough down the line also had a profoundly erotic effect on her. During these first two years of therapy, Professor M and her lover managed to meet for a number of overnight meetings, occasional weekends and, three times, almost a week’s holiday, always disguised as international conferences. Her excitement before these illicit escapes was palpable and I found myself unusually interested to know what had happened at our sessions after she had met her man. She would return thrilled but low, as he had left again. For a long time, I felt convinced that, despite the complexity of her situation, her love for this man would overcome all obstacles. I also felt sure that he was deeply in love with her.They had conversations, often in long emails, about the new life they would live together, with Professor M leaving her partner to live with her lover, who would also leave his wife. As he had three children, she understood the onus would be on her to adapt for their sake. She seemed excited about the prospect and was confident that, although it would be hard, it would all be possible. The man had sent her estate agent particulars of the types of flat they might live in, near the university he was sure she would be able to get a job at. They had had detailed financial discussions about how the assets might be split and merged. Mainly, however, what Professor M talked to me about was how her lover talked to her. She was “fabulous”, “brilliant”, a “total star”, and I could hear her smiling as she put her mobile phone down by her side on the couch, having read me her lover’s latest email.View image in fullscreen‘Her excitement before their illicit escapes was palpable.’Photograph: BDLM/Getty Images/Image SourceThroughout, Professor M insisted this illicit love affair in no way impacted on her relationship at home. Things continued happily between her and her partner “as usual”. It was not that she did not feel herself attracted to him, but rather that her lover had blown away any sexual interest in him.I often felt like an irrelevant bystander to this passionate coupling. Why was I even there, I sometimes wondered, other than as a cipher to “hold” the secret of this extramarital affair? I felt impotent in the face of this middle-aged coup de foudre. During the first two years, I didn’t get to know anything about the early life of Professor M.This is relevant, as normally with a patient I would know or have a sense of their childhood, parental figures and experiences, in the first months of treatment. Strangely, I had no sense of this with Professor M; I felt I knew almost nothing about her past. It felt as distant and foreign to me as the continent she came from. I was allowed to hear only about her present and her future.There was something infantile and pleading in her rapturous accounts of this great love affair. She spared me no detail of the erotic lust on both her and his part. I was compelled to listen, but not to enter the room she created with her lover. Now, I see that only when he abandoned her would I fully meet Professor M in my consulting room.One day in early spring 2018 she arrived agitated and angry. It was a Monday; she had spoken to her lover late that Sunday and he had told her that, despite his commitment and love for her, despite all their quite well-developed plans, he couldn’t sacrifice the lives of his children for his own happiness. His children were beginning university, one overseas, and he could not leave the family home, or their younger sibling.Professor M said she had dreaded this coming and it was “fucking outrageous”. She seethed and I saw her fists clench. Her lover had repeated to her: “Not yet.” She would have to be patient and hold on. As she said this, for the first time, I was not sure I believed him. I had a feeling he was leaving her. My emotional reaction changed as dramatically as my patient’s. I felt, from then on, profound concern for her. My feeling of being a bag carrier for her erotic escapades disappeared.At this point, the appearance of this rather tough, professional-looking woman changed. Her cheeks looked sodden whenever she left, and sometimes on arrival. I could see her harshly pulling a tissue along her lower lids again and again. The sessions themselves had a different quality. They were now full of silences, other than when she demanded of me that I tell her: What was going on? Where had he gone? What the hell was going on? Who the fuck behaved like this? Why can’t you make him stop it?From then on, and into the early summer, Professor M’s lover was only sporadically in touch. She alternated between intense anger and despair. The sessions were sometimes silent other than for her sobbing. At other times they were a rant of indignation and furious tirades about this “fucking idiot”. But the treatment also changed course completely. There was no doubt that Professor M had been dropped and relegated by this man.I felt a despondent exhaustion as well as a feeling of not being able to “bear” her. The 200 or so sessions we had had so far had been hard in so many different ways. Sigmund Freud, the 19th-century inventor of psychoanalysis, talks about the archaeological digging of the process. It is a slow, hard sifting away, sometimes extremely repetitive. The truth is, I had felt exhausted by Professor M, quite often, in the first two years, but now I began to feel bored.Boredom is a red flag to the therapist. When a patient bores you, it is important to think about what is going on. What are they trying to do? Distract you into some daydream of your own? Put you to sleep? Or is there something so awful it cannot be said? With Professor M and her long soliloquies about her lover, detailing the minutiae of their interactions, I often felt stultified. But I kept listening, wondering what I was bearing witness to. Was I there to record this man’s presence in her life, to prove that he was really in love with her, that this was not a fantasy? I was the only person who knew about him after all. But, alongside the tedium, a darker feeling often came to me, something like: this would not end well. It was at this point that his communication with her was drawing to a final close.Professor M’s clothes became shabbier in some hard-to-discern way, and her sharp, short haircut grew out and was no longer assiduously trimmed. The cool boyish styling that had seemed so elegant looked unkempt now, even childish. Twice a week, as she entered my consulting room, she would make eye contact of a beseeching quality, as if without words she was desperately asking me for help. A patient’s non-verbal cues always need interpretation and acknowledgment, and I tried my best to discern what she meant.Their previously well-arranged times to speak became much patchier, then very infrequent, and finally entirely unreliable. Then they stopped almost completely. Professor M would plan to be home, or out, waiting in her car to take his calls, but they would not come. She would wait, and wait, and wait, infuriated with herself, wasting time that could otherwise have been spent on papers she needed to mark or research proposals she had to make. However, as contact with him lessened, I felt her move closer to reality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She sat, hunched and hollow-eyed, staring at a point somewhere behind my head as she told me she thought she might die and, over the weekend (it was a Monday), had considered killing herself.This was the après-coup. This psychological term concerns the effects of events over time in the mind. It has a quality similar to a whiplash injury; the effects of such a brutal impact that may not be felt for years in the body after the initial blow. The trauma could not be understood at the time. However, a later event remobilises the latent traumatised feelings. I was left with a devastated three-year-old, shrinking in her adult body. The change in her physical appearance reinforced this. I was suddenly aware that she had lost a dramatic amount of weight.As time passed, the man began to write to Professor M accusing her of unrealistic expectations and naivety. Professor M fought back with equally accusatory responses, but she did not have much more fight left in her now that the man had gone. She was exhausted.She made me think both of an alcoholic giving up drinking or a baby suddenly deprived of the breast, who has been subjected to a violent weaning. Around this time she wrote to him saying she could not go on like this. I felt she was at a point of risk and suggested we upped her sessions to four times a week. I did not feel she was suicidal, but I felt unclear as to how she would manage the enormity of this loss alone. The secrecy of her relationship meant that no one but me knew what she was going through. She eventually felt able to request some compassionate leave from her department head, and I knew we were into the beginning of Professor M’s recovery.Consciously, it was simple: she had an adult lover. Unconsciously, she had Daddy back or, maybe, he had just never goneOver the next six months, she accepted she would never see her lover again. This man had taken so much of our therapeutic space, but now, alongside the silence and crying, I began to get hints of her early life.Professor M returned to the couch, with her legs pulled up, on her side in a foetal position, often gasping with tears for the entire 50 minutes.As she continued to pore over the relationship, one cold winter morning Professor M told me something new. Her attraction to her lover had deepened in their second summer together when he grew his hair long. She remembered long sessions in bed on one of their stolen weekends when she had fiddled and played with it, telling him what beautiful thick hair he had and how it helped to drive her wild with lust.She suddenly “remembered” that the only other man she had ever kissed with long hair was her late father. When she was two, about to turn three, he had left her mother, never to return, and emigrated to the other side of the world. Professor M was raised alone. Her mother, a GP, had had to work extremely hard to manage her work and the childcare, and Professor M would remain the only child of a lone mother.As often happens when a patient’s presence can almost feel unbearable, it slowly became clear to me why Professor M had needed me to suffer so much. In psychotherapy, the “transference” is the way the therapist embodies multiple hidden current or historical figures in the patient’s mind. These are often very private, sometimes shameful feelings the patient has that can be explored, if their therapeutic alliance – the relationship between therapist and patient – is sufficiently trusting. Who the therapist represents shifts and changes, often within one session.Partly, I could see how I became to Professor M like her mother: overwrought, angry, unable to take anything more from her unhappy little daughter. No wonder she had to dominate the session and not let me in. She was furious with her mother. It was very possibly something that had happened with her lover, too, I felt: she had become too demanding, too unsatisfied, too needy.Slowly, I learned that Professor M was not allowed to speak of her father in childhood. She possessed hardly any photos of him other than two or three given to her by her paternal grandmother (who would die early on in Professor M’s life). She understood her father had remarried when she was four or five, although she had never heard from him after he left.‘All efforts should go towards repairing the trust’: how to survive an affairRead moreSoon after this, Professor M arrived with a photograph and gave it to me. The black-and-white image was of a beautiful, full-cheeked toddler, gazing adoringly at her father who clutched her stocky thighs, staring besottedly at her. Her chubby hand was pulling on his (indeed beautiful) dark hair brushed back from his face while they both smiled, their features, strong noses and, from what I could see, clear blue eyes mirror images of each other. I was deeply moved.Throughout her life, Professor M’s intellectual faculties had compensated for the very early deprivation of her father. And, in our work, in essence, the tiny toddler part of her had been brought back to life. Going back, we pieced together how something important had happened to Professor M when she had first met her lover (aged 24). That had been too early a time for them both, with burgeoning careers and itchy feet.But it had been profoundly reopened when she met this man as her lover, at 58. A going-back-in-time, a psychical regression, had taken place at this point. Her lover, unbeknown to him, was put in the role of the missing father. This was a completely unconscious displacement by Professor M. I might even propose that she was in the throes of a psychotic disavowal. What that means is that she could go back to a time when she was happily in love with and loved by her father. If she was successful in this disavowal (and denial of reality), she didn’t have to suffer from his missing, his abandonment, his departure, because there he was, embodied in her lover, and her adult self. Consciously, it was simple: she had an adult lover. Unconsciously, she had Daddy back or, maybe, he had just never gone.The desperation, adoration and desire to be seen and loved by a man, as the photo showed me so vividly, had been abruptly taken away when her father had left. He was replaced by a mother who was quite possibly bereft and desperate herself but, to her only child, cold and hostile to her wish for her beloved father to return. The witness I had played to her extraordinary, passionate, secret love affair was her secret victory over her mother. All of this, of course, unconscious. But her maltreatment of me reinforced this feeling. I had suffered through two years of hearing about her sexual odyssey and enjoyment in silence.I was in some hidden way the GP mother, who helped her many patients, but who was now going to listen, in detail, to absolutely everything this little girl had to say.Professor M continued to see me for several more years, reducing to once a week. Her life started to fill up again, in a good way, with her partner, a research grant and a new hobby together: tango dancing. Her stepson married, and a grandchild was soon on the way, which she and her partner were thrilled about.In the end, she and I came to think that her lover had probably done her a service. The abandoned, demanding little girl, unable to contemplate reality or her parents’ complex reasons for separating, had been brought back to life by this man. In effect, she had remained stuck in a time warp of idealised adulation with her father. She had never moved on, and never been angry with him (consciously) for his departure. Yet she was intuitive enough as a small child to know that to challenge her mother would have been unwise.In time, she could also contemplate her mother’s vulnerability, moving to empathy for a young, deserted female GP in the 1960s. She eventually had some admiration for her.Professor M was the patient who brought alive the complex nature of an affair for me – how deeply the roots of it are likely to be embedded in our early love lives. Our infantile passion for each parent, or even the idea of a parent, if a child has one parent not two, or is born posthumously, is critical to a mature emotional life. We love our parents in order to be able to grow up. Then we turn away from them to find our own loving adult attachments. However, if in early childhood our managing and interpretation of these relationships is subverted, interrupted, prevented, almost unavoidable damage may not manifest for decades.I don’t believe Professor M felt no guilt about her affair with regard to her partner, but I know that her relationship with him deepened into something more loving as the years passed. She still writes to me every 18 months or so and although I tend not to write back more than a line or two to patients, in order not to disturb the analytic relationship, I do always acknowledge these emails. Perhaps it gratifies us both that she can update me about her life with such pleasure.Some details have been changed.

As a mathematician and epidemiologist, he has advised multiple governments on outbreaks such as Ebola and Covid. In his new bookProof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty, he examines how we can appraise evidence in our search for the truth.What inspired you to investigate the concept of proof?Alice Stewart, an influential epidemiologist, used this nice phrase that “truth is the daughter of time”. But in many situations, whether you’re accused of a crime or thinking about a climate crisis, you don’t want to wait; there’s an urgency to accumulate evidence and set a bar for action. We’re entering an era where questions around information – what we trust and how we act – are increasingly important, and our concepts of what we can prove are shifting as well.You examined the ways that mathematical proofs have changed throughout history. What did you learn?I was so fascinated by the cultural differences in what people have assumed to be obvious. In Europe, for example, negative numbers were shunned for a very long time. That’s because a lot of our maths was built around ancient Greek geometry, where something like a “negative triangle” doesn’t make sense. In contrast, a lot of the early mathematical theories in Asia were driven by finance and the concepts of debt, where negative numbers make a lot more sense, so they were much more comfortable handling those concepts.I found that ideas like calculus were also based on physical intuitions about the world: an apple falls, and we can write down the equations that drive its motion. But when you started getting down into it, you could find exceptions where the intuitions weren’t true. As a result, you had this tension with an entire community who wanted to ignore these nuisances – these “monsters”, as they called them – while other characters were pushing for an evolution of the field. Einstein’s work on relativity, for example, relied on these controversial ideas.Lincoln taught himself the fundamentals of ancient Greek mathematics and he would deploy those principles in his debatesIn the book, you draw some parallels between these mathematical debates and the politics of the time.A lot of democratic ideas in the foundation of countries like the US attempted a kind of mathematical precision. The statement “we hold these truths to be self-evident” in theUS constitutionwas originally “we hold these truths to be sacred”, for example. But Benjamin Franklin crossed it out because he wanted more mathematical certainty behind these ideas, as if they were axioms.And in parallel with mathematics crumbling in its foundations, you saw the US descending into civil war, because the idea that all people are created equal wasn’t self-evident to some people. You had the same tension manifesting in two different ways in two very different fields.Tell me a bit aboutAbraham Lincoln. How was he influenced by mathematics in his rhetoric?Lincoln was renowned for his speeches and the precise nature of his arguments, and that didn’t come about by coincidence. He made a conscious decision as a lawyer to get a better understanding of what it means to demonstrate something and construct an argument that is logically robust. So he went and taught himself the fundamentals of ancient Greek mathematics,Euclid’sElements, and he would deploy those principles in his debates. He took advantage of this notion that if you can find a flaw or contradiction, you can cause someone’s entire argument to collapse.View image in fullscreenAbraham Lincoln in 1863.Photograph: Alexander Gardner/National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian Institution/ReutersYou describe how some core concepts arose from casual conversations. How did the perfect cup of tea inspire the design of clinical trials?Therewas a tearoom in Rothamsted agricultural station in Hertfordshire, and in the early 1920s, three statisticians were having a conversation when one of them, Muriel Bristol, observed that tea always tastes better if the milk is put in before the hot water. The other people around the table disagreed, but they thought it was a nice challenge to see how you could work out whether she could tell the difference or not. In the end, they calculated that you need to lay out eight cups, in which half have the milk added before the hot water, and half after, ordered randomly. This produces around 70 possible combinations, meaning there is only a 1.4% chance that Bristol would get that out of all the possibilities correct – which she did.One of the mathematicians was Ronald Fisher, who would end up writing a landmark book calledThe Design of Experimentsthat examined how you can separate an effect from chance or human biases – and this included the principle of randomisation and using probabilities to test the strength of a hypothesis.How is AI changing our understanding of proof?A few years ago, I was at a dinner with a lot of AI specialists, and there was a lot of talk about the fact that AI is often more efficient if you don’t worry about it providing an explanation for what it’s doing or the decisions it makes. I found it interesting that this was a concern, because in medicine, we have a lot of things that work without us understanding why. One example isanaesthesia: we know the combination of drugs that makes a patient unconscious, but it’s not clear why they do.Why would hundreds of pages of handwritten maths be more trustworthy than a computer?We’ve struggled with similar questions for a long time, right?In the 1970s, we had the first ever computer-aided proof of thefour-colour theorem, which says that if you want to colour a map so that no two bordering countries have the same colour, you’ll only need four colours to do this. Even if you simplify it down and you look for symmetries, there are still just too many combinations to go through by hand. But a pair of mathematicians used a computer to punch those combinations and get over the line. There was a lot of scepticism, because it was the first time that you had this major theorem that mathematicians couldn’t verify by hand. But then, among the younger generation of mathematicians, there is scepticism about some of the old methods. Why would hundreds of pages of handwritten maths be more trustworthy than a computer?I think that’s going to be an important debate in the future, as algorithms become increasingly useful for the predictions they can make, even if we don’t have an easy understanding of the way they work.With the spread of misinformation, it may feel that many people have simply stopped caring about evidence. What do you think of this?There has beensome interesting research looking at what peoplesaythey value online, versus what they actuallydo. If you ask people whether accuracy is important in what they share, they’ll say they don’t want to share things that are false. In the moment, however, they often get distracted: something triggers an emotional response, or aligns with political beliefs, and they share the information on those grounds, without checking the facts.But there are lots of layers to this. In some cases, there can be an incentive to go against what authority says, if you want to suggest that you’re not constrained by the thinking of the crowd. Henri Poincaré, a mathematician who did a lot of work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, described something like this: “To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.” And I think that’s the danger, at the moment – that there’s this almost excessive doubt. People are just disengaging with truth altogether.Proof: The Uncertain Science of Certaintyby Adam Kucharski is published by Profile (£22).

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toKitty DrakeSat 29 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareRory, 53Even just yesterday, I was curled up with her in the afterglow and I felt total blissIn September, I was diagnosed with cancer, and in January I found out I only have months to live. I’ve lost a lot of weight, but physically I still feel relatively normal – which is a relief, but also confusing. I am even strong enough to have sex with my wife, Anna, and in the last few weeks sex has become even more precious to us, because it somehow releases us from the weight of my diagnosis.Knowing I have so little time is crushing. I’ll see a stranger doing something totally unremarkable, like riding a bike, and feel overwhelmed by the fact I’ll probably never get to do that again. But when Anna and I have sex, we disappear into our own world, and I genuinely forget about the cancer, even if it’s just for 20 minutes.Anna asked to watch me take a shower … To be admired made me feel like myself againAnna is remorselessly positive. It is what I love most about her. She can see light in any situation, and wants us to spend this time having good experiences. Just after we got the bad news, I booked a hotel in London. There was a fancy bathroom, and Anna asked if she could watch me take a shower. I don’t look like the man I used to be because of the cancer, but Anna watched me with so much love and desire. To be admired by her made me feel like myself again. We are having sex every couple of days now – which is more than before I got ill – and it feels amazing to be close to one another.The sex is more gentle, and I get tired in certain positions, but I get swept up in the moment, and it quietens that constant voice in my head. The only other time I forget momentarily about my diagnosis, weirdly, is when I’m doing a jigsaw. It’s just the right level of engagement without it being a huge task. There’s no massive sense of jeopardy, but it’s engaging enough to take your brain over. So I’m doing a lot of jigsaws and having a lot of sex.In the last few days, I’ve started feeling this numbness in my feet ... I don’t want to ask the doctors exactly what this means, but I know my body is failing. Anna is convinced I’ll live another eight months, but I don’t believe it. I know I’m starting to die now. But sex is still a place Anna and I can go together to forget. Yesterday, I was curled up with her in the afterglow and I felt total bliss. All my despair fell away.Anna, 52I still find just looking at him intoxicating. It doesn’t matter that illness has changed his bodyLast night and all this morning, I lay in bed saying to myself, “He is ill and he won’t survive this.” I am struggling to get it into my head. But when I do get close to accepting it, I start crying – and I’m of no use to Rory that way.So I’m trying to hold myself together.He is terrified I will emotionally detach from him because it’s too painful to be close like this and know he is dying, but I won’t do that. We have this ritual where I stroke Rory’s wrist to send him off to sleep, and sexual touch comforts us both in a similar way.During sex, I don’t avoid touching Rory’s scar and around his liver – the area where his cancer is – because I won’t let it rob me of one part of him.I still remember being in bed with him, on our first date, and the orgasm building. It felt like Naked AttractionRory and I got together when I was 36, but I’d never had an orgasm during sex before I met him. My ex-husband wasn’t bothered about pleasing me sexually, but Rory was the opposite.I still remember being in bed with him, on our first date, and the orgasm building. It felt like on the TV show Naked Attraction when the screen goes up to reveal the contestants and you hear the music – Dah! Dah! Dah! I remember the physical sensation travelling up my legs from my toes. Even after 16 years together, I still find just looking at him intoxicating. It doesn’t matter that he has a scar, or that illness has changed his body. I know there will be a day when Rory won’t be able to have sex in the traditional sense, but I hope he might still want to be naked together, or let me stroke his skin.The other day I was making up the spare room and Rory came in and flashed me, jokingly. It didn’t lead to anything. It was just an affirmation of the sexual sparkle between us.I want that sensuality and humour to bleed into all the time we have left together, because it is pure joy. It lifts us out of the panic and terror.When I picture the end of Rory’s life, I want the intensity of what we feel for each other now to still exist, right up until the last moment.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The competition’s newfound disdain for replays allowed Nottingham Forest to become the first team to win three consecutive FA Cup penalty shootouts. History was made, novelty was witnessed, but in a setting that emphasised the traditions of the grand old Cup. After Exeter and Ipswich, fell Brighton, and soForest matched the featof the Moroccan army side FAR Rabat, who beat MC Oujda, Wydad Casablanca and Rachad Bernoussi on penalties in successive rounds to win the Coupe du Trone in 2007.It was a game characterised by caution, reflecting both Forest’s habitual preference for a low block and Brighton’s wariness afterlosing 7-0 to Forest last month. But it also perhaps reflected how much both sides cared, a welcome, if retro, feature of the latter stages of the FA Cup this season.Nuno applauds Nottingham Forest after reaching Wembley FA Cup semiRead moreDefeat would have meant the loss of an opportunity that neither side could take lightly. Of the four sides involved in the first two quarter-finals, only one had won the FA Cup: Forest, who last won the Cup in 1959 when their opening goal was scored by Roy Dwight, Elton John’s cousin. This will be their first semi-final since 1991, when they beat West Ham.Brighton may have been in two semis in the past six years, but there is no sense of them being sated. Success both for them and Forest remains an improbable dream; each step further up the mountain opens up new vistas of possibility. They are not desperately clinging to achievement, grasping desperately at each trophy to stave off the fear of failure, hoarding silverware like a gloomy dragon in an Anglo-Saxon epic, which is how it often seems for superclubs.The sense of occasion, the yearning for a semi-final, was palpable and, as so often in the FA Cup, there was a self-awareness, the game played amid echoes of the competition’s past, as though conscious of its own history. One home fan had brought a cutout of the FA Cup, albeit one that, rather than being made of cardboard or plywood as it would have been in a Pathé clip, it was fashioned of foam and had an inflatable seagull dangling from it. There was even a homage to Ian Rush in the 1986 FA Cup final as Carlos Baleba’s flashed just wide and knocked over a remote-controlled camera.But this was also a very contemporary occasion, and not just because of the pyrotechnics that cast this thoroughly modern stadium in the rolling Sussex hills in a cordite-scented haze just before kick-off. Only seven of the starting XIs were British, an obvious contrast to the 1959 final, when the greatest exoticism was supplied by Bill Whare, Forest’s Guernsey-born right-back.That’s a curiosity that takes on greater significance when it is considered how many of them had played in World Cup qualifiers in the past week.A total of 13 players from the two squads were involved in action outside of Europe. Seven of them travelled more than 10,000 miles in doing so. And one of them, Forest’s Chris Wood, travelled over 23,000 miles in helping secure New Zealand’s qualification with wins over Fiji and New Caledonia. A hip injury sustained in the latter of those kept the centre-forward out.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s João Pedro and Nottingham Forest’s Murillo were on international duty together with Brazil.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe two managers, equally, were avatars of very modern types: Nuno Espírito Santo, a classic Portuguese pragmatist with an excitable backroom staff, and Fabian Hürzeler, a terrifyingly youthful German devotee of pressing football and loud swearing.They had both been sent offin the corresponding league fixture for their reactions to the sending-off of Morgan Gibbs-White.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPerhaps the most modern aspect of all, though, was the presence of the two players on the respective right flanks: Yankuba Minteh for Brighton and Elliot Anderson for Forest. It was the ever-industrious Anderson who seemed to have his ankle hooked by the trailing arm of Kaoru Mitoma midway through the second half, only for Peter Bankes to overturn his initial call of penalty following a VAR review – another intrusion of the modern into the palimpsest.Both were sold by Newcastle last summer, apparently for profit and sustainability regulations. It’s probably not great that there is an incentive for clubs to sell promising young local talent, like Anderson, that they have developed, and it’s certainly frustrating for Newcastle, but on the other hand, this might be an example of PSR ensuring a wider spread of talent than would otherwise be the case. It would be dangerous to draw too many conclusions from one season but the sense is this campaign has been that, Liverpool and the bottom three aside, the Premier League has been a far more level and competitive division than it has been for a decade.And then a final modern twist: not a replay but extra time and penalties. And this season in the Cup, in shootouts Forest have been impeccable.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverNottingham ForestBrighton & Hove AlbionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Score again. Go back to Wembley again. Yeah. Did I mention Wembley? Eberechi Eze has had a fairly decent last five days of his footballing life, bookended here by a performance of supreme incision on a crisp, boisterous day in south-west London, when he was the very obvious point of difference between Crystal Palace and Fulham.Not just in his numerical contribution to Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win: a jaw-dropper of an opening goal, all thrilling, controlled power; followed by a proper, actual high-skill assist. But also in terms of style and a Palace system that leans right into its own strengths when all the parts function like this.Eze fires Crystal Palace to emphatic win over Fulham and into FA Cup semisRead moreFulham had the ball here but not the chances. Palace had a compact defence and quick transitions. Best of all they had Eze, by some distance the most luminous presence on the pitch. The second goal on 38 minutes killed the game. It was a perfect miniature, Eze taking the ball far out by the left touchline, surging inside, then producing just a tiny flash of the razor’s edge as Sander Berge blocked his path to goal.There were no stepovers or feints, just a switch of feet, Eze passing the ball to himself, one foot to the other, creating the space and delivering the cross in two rat-a-tat touches, with just enough deception – did you think I was a rightie? Here’s my left – and with nothing wasted, even the cross placed just right for Ismaïla Sarr to head into the corner of the net.It was Eze’s 10th assist of the season to go with six club goals. The last of these had arrived four minutes earlier from the same pocket of space. This time it was more obviously spectacular, Eze gliding inside, then gliding inside again, like a dancer hitting his mark, before shooting thrillingly hard and flat, the ball curling from outside the line of the far post before finding itself suddenly fizzing about in the back of the net.Those two pieces of skill settled the game. Best of all they were basically pulled out of the air, entirely distinct from the 86 minutes of noise either side. Eze has often been called a cage-baller or street player, with an idea his skills are homemade, maverick, unorthodox.In the early days at Palace, when Ray Lewington would come marching up to the touchline in his shorts just to yell at Eze, making sure he was running and covering, he did look a bit raw. Although, to be fair, it was hard to tell how much of this was just a function of having a man in shorts constantly yelling at him.Here he seemed utterly in control, physically stronger, and basically a nightmare to play against, sniping both ways with that startling lateral spring, the 360-degree scan in operation even as he’s easing past you. It is an elite level of skill. The real step up is, of course, to apply it every game, to be relentless, as Eze was here.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze shows off his maverick skills against Fulham on a day when the England international stood out above everyone else.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThis was a lovely English football occasion. Craven Cottage, which always feels like a boat trip or a picnic, was washed with chilly spring sunshine before kick-off. The perimeter was lit with tongues of fire, the air crackling with early-day excitement. The Palace end had even brought its red-and-blue balloons, a nice birthday-party-ish touch.For both sets of payers, both clubs and both managers this was a flag day, with no too-cool-for-school team rotation, no plates spinning on grander stages elsewhere. Fulham may have Europe on their minds. But this was basically everything for everyone here in that moment, a self-contained moment of theatre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is what the Cup demands. Find a way to win. Shake the day by its lapels. But even here the distinction between the two teams was clear. Fulham were vigorous but blunt, buzzing against the surface of the game like a fly on a window pane. For long periods their version of urgency was to play patient, passing football slightly more quickly.There were moments of mild disorder, There was also the reassuring sight of Jean-Philippe Mateta back on the pitch, albeit wearing a protective device described pre-match as a helmet. In reality this was something more pared back, a minor head-gusset, a low-denier stocking with bespoke ear-pad feature.Mateta played with energy and led the Palace breaks in that misleading style, a little rangy and loose, but always quicker than his frame suggests. Adam Wharton had an unusual afternoon behind him. He was combative and buccaneering, occasionally just making the game seem easy with the speed and accuracy of his passing, all the while looking like he might actually be playing with his hands in his pockets. But Wharton was also lucky not to get a second yellow card after a minor, harmless but stillverbotenkick that the referee missed.It was comfortable for Palace by the end. Afterwards, as journalists asked questions about Eze, as Oliver Glasner answered questions about Eze, a knot of children could be heard simultaneously chanting Eze’s name outside the press room. There was only one outstanding presence here, expertly deployed in that hard-running system. On this form Palace will be a match for any team left in their way. And Eze does like Wembley.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverCrystal PalaceFulhamanalysisShareReuse this content"

A reflection of her consistency, Sabalenka is the third WTA No 1 in history to reachthe finals of the Australian Open, Indian Wells and the Miami Open in the same year.Defiant Djokovic on verge of making more history against teenage starRead more“I’m speechless,” said the Belarusian. “The last couple of finals were really tough, tight and close ones for me. Going into this one I was so focused on myself, I was super-focused and I was playing point by point. Now it feels super-special. I’m just speechless right now and super-happy with the title, first one in Miami.”Over the past year, Sabalenka and Pegula have met in three of the five most significant hard court finals after their 2024 meetings at the US Open and Cincinnati Open. In both of those,Sabalenka overpowered Pegulawith her superior weight of shot despite considerable fight from the American.Sabalenka’s dominant performances en-route to the final further positioned her as the clear favourite. She faced two other top 10 opponents in the sixth seed Jasmine Paolini and the ninth seed Zheng Qinwen, plus the defending champion Danielle Collins, yet she did not drop a set in her six matches.After rain had delayed the start of play by an hour, the final began with a series of breaks as the initiative swung sharply between both players early on. It was Sabalenka who settled down in the second half of the opening set, first finding her rhythm on serve and then perfectly timing her best return game of the match. Up 6-5, Sabalenka picked Pegula’s serve apart, taking the set by breaking to love. “I’m super happy that I was there,” she said. “I was fighting no matter what.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As has been the case in most of their recent encounters, Pegula simply does not possess the variety of shot, defensive skills or comparable weight of shot to put this focused, determined version of Sabalenka under sustained pressure and she had no answer as the world No 1 took control of the second set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once a one-dimensional player determined to attack every last ball, Sabalenka has evolved into an intelligent, tenacious superstar who has become so difficult to beat.

The full-back, who won her first cap in 2017, has now scored 39 tries for the Red Roses and at 25 years old there is a lot more to come from the World Rugby player of the year.Wales 12-67 England: Women’s Six Nations rugby union – as it happenedRead moreKildunne, who has lost only two games in an England shirt, had been kept largely quiet in the first half which inspired an impressive performance in the second half where she sliced through the Wales defence like butter. The England head coach John Mitchell said: “She is a breath of fresh air, she is very, very talented.She is maturing her game all of the time, she has had different challenges in 2025 where teams try to take her out of the game and give her less ball. But she is finding different ways to enter the game as well. I think as much as she has plan A, which is a great running game, I think you will see her develop other skills as she counters the challenges.”Kildunne was not the only one to shine as Maddie Feaunati had another storming performance, while the centre Meg Jones also had an impressive match. For Jones there was an added layer of emotion as she was making her first England appearance since both of her parents died and she capped it with a phenomenal solo try.It has been a decade since Wales have had the bragging rights against England in the Women’s Six Nations and another dominant performance from the Red Roses ensured the hosts’ wait would continue. England were far from their best, which is a frightening prospect for their future opponents as they were still able to run in 11 tries. Handling errors were the main cause of frustration for Mitchell’s side, particularly in the first half.The hosts did come away with one record to be proud of as no Welsh women’s team had experienced a matchday quite like this one. The attendance of 21,186 obliterated the previous record for a Welsh women’s sporting event on home soil, 16,845, which was set by the national football team in November.Conditions were perfect with the roof closed, which amplified the cauldron effect an extravagant light and fire show created. It revved up the crowd and infused the game with the emotion only this rivalry can create.View image in fullscreenAbi Burton dives over to score on her full England debut.Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesThe battle-like atmosphere was translated on to the pitch with Jaz Joyce-Butchers’ pace the highlight early on as Wales looked to score first. The England flanker Sadia Kabeya secured a turnover but a knock-on by the fly-half Zoe Harrison in the in-goal area gave Wales a five-metre scrum. The resulting attack ended with Jenni Scoble going over to give Sean Lynn the perfect start to his first home game in charge.It was not long until England fired back with Feaunati going over. Jones followed it up by running half the length of the pitch to touch down, pointing to the sky as she scored as a tribute to her parents. Once England turn the scoring tap on, their opposition are rarely able to stem the flow and the Red Roses extended their lead through Sarah Bern and Feaunati tries.The Principality exploded at the start of the second half thanks to a break by Lisa Neumann but Wales were unable to convert it into points and England punished them once again. Kildunne, the player of the match, brought out her signature rodeo celebration every time she touched down, with the full-back the scorer of the next three tries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Morgane Bourgeois added the conversion and two penalties to make it 13-0, but Emma Orr kicked, chased and touched down for Scotland after Lisa Thomson pounced on a French handling error. Helen Nelson added the extras to reduce the deficit to 13-7 at half-time.Bourgeois kicked another penalty soon after the restart before France further extended their lead through a brilliant long-range drop-goal from scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Nelson slotted over a penalty to leave Scotland nine points behind approaching the hour mark, but France found another gear in the latter stages.France scored twice in three minutes through Feleu and Seraphine Okemba down either flank to take the game beyond their opponents. Bourgeois then dived over herself to score the hosts’ fourth try and seal a bonus point.

Burton was in an induced coma in 2022 because of a rare brain illness and she said of her journey to wearing a Red Roses shirt: “I tried not to think about it too much before but afterwards when I saw my mum, dad and grandparents it made it super-real and special. They have been on that journey with me so the fact we got to share a special moment meant the world to me.”Wales more than fronted up in the encounter and they prevented a record win, which came in 2005 when England trounced them 81-0. But the Red Roses continue to bloom in their era of domination. The victory extended theirwinning run in the tournamentto 31 matches and their victories in all competitions to 22.Can anyone stop this England team?

They were still called Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic in those days and played in the Third Division (South). They had put out Wolves and Tottenham in the previous two rounds, the excitement enticing a record crowd of 28,799 to Dean Court to see them play Matt Busby’s side.The United centre-half Mark Jones was carried off early on and, nine years before the introduction of substitutes, Bournemouth took the lead against the 10 men,Brian Bedford nudging inafter Ray Wood had flapped at a corner. Two Johnny Berry goals, the second a penalty, in the space of five second‑half minutes, though, saw United through. They went on to lose to Aston Villa in the final, when Peter McParland fractured Wood’s cheekbone after six minutes, forcing the centre-half Jackie Blanchflower to take over in goal.There’s a terrible poignancy to the Pathé footage now. Six of the United side from the quarter‑final would die inthe Munich air crashthe following February while Blanchflower, who did not play at Dean Court, was so badly injured he never played again.Evanilson: ‘I left 40C in Rio to go to -5 … I couldn’t finish the training session’Read moreBournemouth finished that 1956-57 season fifth, a place above Brighton and three above Brentford, two of the other upstart clubs who have thrust their way into the top half of the Premier League this season. Bedford joined QPR a couple of years later and, under Alec Stock, an inspiration forThe Fast Show’s Ron Manager, he became a prolific forward there, although he left before the League Cup win of 1967.Bournemouth would eventually beat Unitedin a Cup tie at Dean Court, although not until 1984, by which time they were managed by Harry Redknapp and Ron Atkinson had acceded to the United dugout. That season Bournemouth finished 17th in the Third Division. It wouldn’t be until 2021 that they reached the last eight of the FA Cup again.Does any of that matter? Perhaps not, but if theFA Cupcan’t facilitate nostalgic discussion of greats of the past, it really has lost its purpose. And if nothing else that Bournemouth have reached this stage of a competition that began in 1872 only twice before says a lot about their ascent and the rarefied position in which they now find themselves.That other run to the quarter‑finals was rather less storied than the first. As a Championship side, Bournemouth beat Oldham, Crawley and Burnley before going down 3-0 to Southampton. But now they are back again. Sunday’s game against Manchester City will be their first FA Cup quarter-final as a Premier League side and the first time there has been a realistic possibility of Bournemouth winning a major trophy.Bournemouth beat City 2-1at the Vitality in November. They were one of the sides Pep Guardiola listed as playing the most up-to-date form of the game,a mantle Andoni Iraola has accepted, discussing how the positional play Guardiola helped popularise can become predictable. The approach Iraola favours, with runners tearing in behind opposing defences, is just the sort of style that tends to unsettle Guardiola teams.View image in fullscreenManchester United goalkeeper Gary Bailey and defender Arthur Albiston come under pressure from Bournemouth forward Trevor Morgan during the FA Cup third round match at Dean Court in 1984. Bournemouth won 2-0.Photograph: PABut Bournemouth have failed to win any of their last five games. Having passed through an injury crisis with a minimum of fuss, they have suffered an unfortunate regression to the mean just as it appeared that Champions League qualification was within their grasp. Iraola’s frustration at his side’s occasional inability to finish games off has been clear, particularly afterthey squandered a two-goal leadto draw at Tottenham in a game they had dominated.Though Bournemouth are 10th, the gap to City in fifth is only four points, and none of the other contenders entirely convince. Which is why the next couple of weeks feel so vital for their short-term future. As it stands, Bournemouth are three games from the first major trophy in their history, one of two routes that still lie open to them for a first qualification for Europe. But equally, should they lose to City and then drop more than a couple of points against Ipswich, West Ham and Fulham in the three games that follow, this season could dwindle, the promise of winter melting away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They would have generated memories to stand alongside Brian Bedford and sustain the club’s fans for decades. Qualify for the Champions League and they would have generated a source of revenue that would make a profound difference to Bournemouth’s spending capacity and raise their profile immeasurably. Not that it’s necessarily an either/or: against Wolves in the last round, Iraola did not pick a weakened team.Fans tend to prioritise silverware, particularly at clubs for whom trophies are a rarity. They would get their Wembley final, their name on the Cup, their permanent place in history. Playing in Europe is fun but transient, as the example of Leicester showeds. It might be fun to be playing Porto, Sevilla or Atlético, but that can have a negative impact on league form and, if the revenues generated aren’t invested wisely, it doesn’t protect a club from relegation. Recent recruitment has been of a level with that of Brighton or Brentford, but smaller clubs are always walking a tightrope; errors of judgment hurt them more than the elite.But directors are drawn primarily to money, which will always be the paradox for clubs such as Bournemouth, having to focus less on winning trophies in order to be better placed to win trophies. Although there has beenbold talk from Tim Bezbatchenko, the president of the Black Knight Football ownership group of which Bournemouth are a part, of “matching Iraola’s ambitions”, Bournemouth remain Bournemouth. There are plans for a larger stadium but there is a reason the capacity is 11,000. Champions League money could add a layer of security, but Bournemouth can never be a super-club.Bournemouth’s rise has been remarkable, but clubs of their stature do not endure at the top for long. These could be the greatest two months in the club’s history; another such opportunity may not come along any time soon.Explore more on these topicsBournemouthInside footballFA CupcommentShareReuse this content"

For a heartstopping moment in the kiss-and-cry area, it looked like they might not step through. After Italy’s Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri delivered a solid but beatable free dance – scoring 123.42 points, nearly five below their season’s best – for an overall total of 206.46, the opportunity was there. All the British pair needed was 122.61 to secure a bronze medal, a score around three points under their own top mark for the year. It might have seemed straightforward enough. It almost wasn’t.Alysa Liu left figure skating behind. She came back better than ever | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreSkating third-to-last in the final group, Fear and Gibson performed their free dance to a string of Beyoncé hits, a fan-favourite programme that has earned ovations across the circuit. After a tight, nervy first half, the crowd inside TD Garden rewarded their strong, confident finish with roars of approval before the technical panel went to work. Several elements, including the levels on their steps and one of the lifts, came under scrutiny.The tension during the wait was excruciating. Finally, after a seemingly interminable wait, their score flashed up: 123.25 in the free dance – sixth place on the day but just enough for the podium over two segments. Their total of 207.11 gave them bronze by a margin of 0.65 points over the Italians. The crowd erupted. So did the British camp. “I can’t even describe my feelings, Fear said. “I’m still shaking. It’s a dream come true, and I’m kind of in disbelief. But I’m so grateful for the results.”View image in fullscreenLilah Fear and Lewis Gibson delight the crowd in Boston during their free dance routine which sealed a bronze medal.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesIt marked Britain’s first world or Olympic ice dance medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean’s comeback bronze at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games – a 31-year drought finally broken. It was also a redemption of sorts for Fear and Gibson, who had placed fourth at the past two world championships.It was alsoBritain’s first medal at worldsin any discipline since Torvill and Dean won the last of their four consecutive ice dance titles in 1984.“This is crazy, right?” Gibson said. “It’s just unbelievable. We’ve been compared to them [Torvill and Dean] a lot, and I love it every time. It’s such an honour. I was inspired by them, and I hope so much that there are little kids out there in Great Britain seeing this and wanting to put their skates on as well.”Despite Saturday’s sixth place in the free dance, their rhythm dance score of 83.86 from Friday – a career high – proved crucial in keeping them ahead of Guignard and Fabbri, who were fourth in both segments.The gold medal went to the home favourites, Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who dazzled once again with a confident and technically masterful free dance to their Take Five and ‘Round About Midnight medley. The flawless skate, which included a level four for the twizzles and lift and a level three for footwork, earned them a season-best score of 222.06. That sealed their place as the first team to three-peat since Russia’s Oksana Grishuk and Evgeni Platov in the 1990s – and the first Americans ever to do it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sargent produced a composed finish for his 13th goal of the season to settle a tight game of few clear-cut chances.

That’s undoubtedly true in the age of Trump – but maybe it’s always been so. The White House’s undisguised contempt for loyal allies in the UK and Europe necessitates a robust reciprocal rethink. How healthy – and desirable – is this partnership? Has it caused more problems than it’s worth?Those, myself included, who throughout their professional lives have taken close transatlantic ties for granted, face some awkward questions. Is the US-UK “special relationship” an embarrassment, even a strategic liability? Today’s America is evidentlynot a trustworthy, disinterested friend. Was it ever?As I write my lastforeign affairs commentaryfor theObserver, I look back over nearly 50 years and wonder, firstly, at the false narrative, not confined to Donald Trump, that American altruism is exploited by “freeloading” European Nato allies. What tosh! US troops and missiles are based here primarily to defend the US. Since 1945, Washington has viewed Europe as its first line of defence against Russia. Germany was the US’s preferred cold war battlefield, Britain its airfield. Perish the thought that Americans might actually fight on their own soil (except against each other). US wars are typically waged in faraway places. That’s why the 1962 Cuba missile crisis came as such a shock.The trouble with America began at conception. The “war of independence” that started as a middle-class taxpayers’ revolt was a stab in the back for Europe’s struggle against Napoleon’s tyranny – the Vladimir Putin of his time. American resistance to British efforts to suppress the global slave trade perpetuatedanother evil.Claims the US saved Britain in 1940 are overblown. Britain saved itself. Franklin Roosevelt steered clear until forced to fight by Pearl Harbor and Hitler’s 1941 declaration of war. Postwar Britain, devastated and penniless, watched as the US grabbed its global markets and military bases. Suez in 1956 cemented its fall. It was stillpaying off war loans in 2006. Americans may dispute these historical perspectives, yet they lend present-day context. The nuclear arms race, numerous cold war coups and proxy wars in Africa and Latin America, catastrophe in Vietnam, Nato’s 1980s Euro-missile crisis and the first Gulf war were all troublesome US storylines for which UK-Europe support was expected, indeed demanded.View image in fullscreenExplosions rock the World Trade Center after being hit by two planes on 11 September 2001 in New York City.Photograph: Allsport UK/AllsportMore Uncle Sam craziness followed in the shape of the post-9/11 “global war on terror”, Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and the vengeful madness of “King” George (W Bush). Nato backed the invasion of Afghanistan. But then came Iraq, nonexistent weapons of mass destruction,Abu Ghraib, and all the ensuing democracy-damaging lies, misery and failures.Out of Iraq came Islamic State; out of Afghanistan, after 20 years of bloodshed, came a resurgent, gloating Taliban.Barack Obama abandoned Syria. Now Trump, America’s burger-eating surrender monkey,sides with Russia, and betrays Ukraine and the west. For all these made-in-the-US calamities, a weak Europe shares some blame. But the high price paid by allies grows unaffordable.Unquestioning US support for Israel and the mass murder of Palestinians fuels antisemitism, far-right nationalism and European instability.Emboldened by Trump, Putin’s threat to Poland and the Baltic republics intensifies. US foreign aid cuts and reckless climate and energy policies imperil millions, accelerating northwards migration from Africa. Trump threatens Iran with all-out war,pushing it towards nuclear weapons.Are US policymakers innately incompetent, uninformed or simply unlucky? It scarcely matters as long as Britain and Europe feel locked in a toxic relationship from which there is no escape. Except Trump and his good ’ol boys,oozing online hillbilly hostility, unwittingly offer a chance of deliverance to those bold enough to take it.The American hegemon has always exacted onerous tribute. Trump’s tariffs reflect abiding lust for loot and domination. US pharmaceutical companies, food and drink multinationals and tech and social media giants plunder the empire’s subject lands onfavourable, ill-regulated terms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Concepts of shared values and universal laws are fracturing as Trump targets “woke” andtears up the UN rulebook.Billy-no-mates Britain faces a particular problem, post-Brexit. Its nuclear weapons, armed forces, security services, defence industries, financial markets and export businesses are inextricablyin thrall to the US imperium. The UK clings desperately to a sense of “specialness” to sustain fading self-belief.Yet Steve Witkoff, Trump’s useless Ukraine envoy,calls Keir Starmer’s plan a “pose”. Vice-president JD Vance,the intrepid Greenland explorer, mocks the UK as a “random country”. Some weird geezer named Hegseth claims we are “pathetic”. What depth of insult, what degree of disrespect, would convince Britain’s too-nice prime minister to stop propping up collapsing transatlantic bridges?Such rudeness and condescension do not come out of nowhere. We British know; those ugly Americanslearned their imperial arrogance from us. What’s new is Trump’s debasement and corruption of America’s constitutional and democratic tradition. Moral authority is being lost, and with it the right to lead.Huge convulsions punctuate US history: the civil war, prohibition, the Great Depression, McCarthyism, Watergate, 9/11. The Trump-Maga spasm follows that pattern. It, too, will pass. Or will it? While the US prefers dictators to democrats, punishes its friends, and lies, bullies and plots to stealallies’ sovereign territory, there is no going back. Many, perhaps most, Americans abhor this vile behaviour – yet unaccountably fail to stop it.Forget what Starmer says. Britain will have to choose. It has kowtowed to the US all our lives, and this is where it has got us. Gradual strategic disengagement from America, coupled with renewed integration in a reformed, revitalised Europe, is the only sane, safe path. Stop feeding the monster.

But what if it spares us from learning, writing, painting and exploring the world?Joseph EarpIf I reduced my existence to a series of ChatGPT prompts, the act of my living is only shorter – not betterSat 29 Mar 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 21.41 EDTShareAs much as I have the general vibe of a luddite (strange hobbies, socially maladjusted, unfathomable fashion choices, etc) I have to hand it to automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives less boring.I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls anaesthetised dentistry an “unmixed blessing”.I would add some other unmixed blessings to that list: I like watching videos of cool birds on YouTube; I’m happy when my phone gently reminds me that it’s time to get up and go for a walk after I’ve watched too many cool birds on YouTube; and I have no problems whatsoever with the printing press.For great stories, we need people, not AI | LettersRead moreBut one of the many things about the so-called “AI revolution” that makes me want to run for the hills is the promise that AI will simplify things that should not be simple – that I would neverwantto be simple.In matters of technology, I operate on one guiding principle: I give my computer the work that I do not want to do, and that I gain little by doing myself. The ideal model of the computer, I think, is the calculator: if I sat there with a piece of paper and a pen, I could probably do most of the sums myself that I ask my calculator to do. But that would take time, and I’m a busy man (lots of cool bird videos to watch), and so I give it to a computer to work out.What I am not happy to outsource is most of the things that AI is desperate for me to outsource. I do not want a computer to summarise texts sent by my friends into shorter sentences, as though the work of being updated on the lives of those I love is somehow strenuous or not what being alive is all about. I do not want Google’s AI feature to summarise my search into a pithy (often incorrect) paragraph, rather than reading the investigative work of my fellow humans. I don’t want AI to clean up the pictures that I take on my phone that are rich and strange in their messiness.And I certainly do not want AI to write my books for me, or paint my pictures. Not only would the work be terrible: it wouldn’t even be work. As all creatives know, there is limited joy inhaving written a book– as soon as it is done, most of us are on to the next thing. The thrill, the joy, the beauty, is in thewriting of a book. If you outsource your creative work to a computer, you are not a creative. Someone who merely churns out product is not an artist – they are a salesperson. The artist is the person who makes, not who has made.Simply put: I don’t know where this endless march of shortening the act of living leads us to. AI promises to free up time. But if what it spares us from is learning from our friends, writing, painting and exploring the world, then what, actually, are we meant to do with that time?It’s increasingly clear that a computercouldlive my life for me, all while I atrophy, never going outside. But if I reduced my existence to a series of ChatGPT prompts, the act of my living is only shorter, not better. And despite what tech bros tell me, those are not the same thing.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

The not-causing-a-national-outcry part of that was easy. All I had to do was show up and not be a thinly veiled agent of Trumpian expansionism while pretending to care about dog sled races.The other part – going to Greenland in the first place – is harder to explain. I’m not an explorer, a sailor or a climate scientist. I don’t belong to any of the vanishingly few occupations with legitimate reasons to visit the Arctic Circle. I was there, inexplicably, as a literary journalist.In 2014, a 24-year-old Greenlandic writer called Niviaq Korneliussen published her debut novel, written in Greenlandic rather than the dominant Danish language. (Greenland is self-governing on domestic policy, but has been a Danish territory since the 18th century.) Four years later, it had been translated into English with the titleCrimson, and become a bestseller. I had been sent to profile this unlikely literary superstar.A few days after the editor first emailed me about the assignment, a car arrived in the middle of the night to take me to Heathrow. I was halfway there when I realised that my weatherproof coat was still hanging, supposedly unmissably, next to my front door. I landed in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, with nothing but a big cardigan to protect me from the elements.My preparation was lacking in other ways too. I’d made contact with Korneliussen before travelling, but intended to call to confirm arrangements when I arrived. Except Greenland isn’t covered by EU mobile roaming agreements, so my phone didn’t work. No matter: I could use the wifi at my hotel to email.So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreBut the hotel – actually a seamen’s hostel – hadn’t put a password on its network. When I arrived, a large cruise ship was sitting in the nearby harbour, soaking up all the bandwidth. As I stood at the front desk, almost in tears about this professional disaster, a sailor walked past and called out a cheerful greeting of “Hey, English!” I’ve never felt so foreign in my life.The amazing thing, really, is that I could make it to Greenland in such chaotic fashion and not die of exposure. For millennia, the ice-smothered island had been luring travellers on to its barely habitable fringes, and then repulsing them. The earliest known settlers were Norse – walrus hunters who traded the ivory with visiting ships, and scratched out a difficult living from Greenland’s small patch of farmable land.Sometime in the 15th century, the Norse Greenlanders vanished and nothing in the historical record can say whether it was famine, disease or the sheer chilly isolation that finished them off. Their disappearance, writes the journalist Jon Gertner in his excellent bookThe Ice at the End of the World, “remains one of European history’s supreme mysteries”.The Inuit ancestors of today’s majority Greenlanders only arrived about 800 years ago, and maintained a healthily suspicious attitude to their home. In their folk stories, the ice caps were a place of strange creatures and unknown horrors. The few Europeans who visited tended to agree. Hans Egede, an 18th-century Danish missionary, declared that the centre of Greenland could have “no use to mankind”.Some men, though, wanted to change that. In the late 19th century, two explorers staked their claim to the strange, hostile landscape. First the Dane Fridtjof Nansen crossed the island from west to east, surviving brutal temperatures and terrifying crevasses to make the 260-mile journey by foot and on ski. It took 11 weeks.That stung the American Robert Peary into competition. He undertook an even longer and more fearsome route, crossing the northern part of Greenland. It was physically punishing, but perhaps even more so mentally, surrounded by nothing but blaring whiteness in the endless sun of the Arctic summer. On the ice, wrote Peary, “the nightmare of emptiness possessed us”.It wasn’t clear at that point in history whether Greenland would end up being Danish or American, but the Danes staked their claim first, establishing trading posts in the early 20th century. Since then technology – and climate change – have made Greenland ever more accessible.You no longer have to make iceberg-dodging approaches to the coast by ship: you can get a plane. And when you get there and find yourself improperly attired, you don’t have to get native Greenlanders to make you clothing from reindeer hide that’s been arduously chewed until it’s soft enough to stitch (which is how Peary got himself fitted out).I sat in the airport marvelling at how ill-equipped I was to survive in a place so implacably indifferent to my plansInstead, you go to Nuuk’s shopping centre to buy yourself a new jacket, which is what I did. It was gougingly expensive (island prices), but still better than the pitying look I got from Korneliussen when we eventually met and she saw I was dressed in knitwear. Still, I wasn’t in danger of hypothermia: the temperature while I was there was a blazingly summery 10C.You shouldn’t imagine that Greenland has become too tame, though. Nuuk is the size of a small market town, and wilderness presses in as soon as you reach its limits. Hard, black volcanic rocks rear up from the shallow turf. There are no roads connecting Greenland’s settlements: the terrain is too rugged.The weather turned the day I was going home. It was touch and go whether my connection to Iceland would be able to take off at all: I believe it was the last flight to leave Greenland for 48 hours. I sat in the airport, hugging myself in my new jacket, marvelling at how ill-equipped I was to survive in a place so implacably indifferent to my plans.The lesson the Vances should take from their ill-fated expedition is that Greenland doesn’t care about human ambition and desires. Donald Trump’s attempt to take possession of it is just another episode in its contested history. But, even today, you cannot simply stroll on to the island and take it. So far, the Greenlanders themselves have made it very clear that they won’t be welcoming this new generation of American adventurers.Sarah Ditum is a journalist and the author of the bookToxic: Women, Fame and the Noughties.

Europe, and Britain, must offer them sanctuarySat 29 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 12.38 EDTShareAt international academic conferences recently, one sees an interesting trend. Some American participants are travelling with“burner” phonesor have minimalist laptops running browsers and not much else. In other words, they are equipped with the same kind of kit that security-conscious people used to bring 15 years ago when travelling to China.So what’s up? Well, these academics have a finger on the pulse of Trump’s America, and are concerned about what might happen when they return home. They’ve read onRobert Reich’s Substackabout the French scientist who was prevented from entering the country because US Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his “personal opinion” to colleagues and friends about Trump’s science policies.Or they’ve heard about DrRasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the US after visiting relatives in Lebanon. She was deported, reports Reich, “despite having a valid visa and a court order” blocking her removal. “Federal authorities alleged that they found ‘sympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures’ in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February.”And they also know aboutMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, whom – though he is a legal permanent resident of the US and has not been charged with a crime – the government is trying to deport because he had participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.Those pro-Gaza demonstrations so irked the Trump regime that it demanded the return of $400m of federal research funding. When Columbia sought a meeting to discuss the matter, itreceived a lettersetting out the conditions that it would have to accept before the government would deign to talk. These included a stipulation that Columbia must “begin the process of placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for a minimum of five years”.The bullying of Columbia is the canary in the coalmine which reveals the Trump-Musk junta has it in for American universities. There are two reasons for their hostility. The first is that, as elite institutions devoted to freedom of inquiry and the telling of uncomfortable truths, they are anathema to the new autocrats in Washington. The second is that some of them (the so-called Ivy League) are fabulously wealthy, being for the most part hedge funds with nice universities attached. And if there’s one thing thatDonald Trumpcannot abide, it is large pots of money that he and his ghastly tribe can smell but not touch. So if the aloof trustees of Harvard, Princeton, Yale et al think that their august institutions lie beyond his reach, perhaps they should understand that Trump looks on them much as Henry VIII looked on the rich monasteries of his heyday.What are UK institutions doing to meet the coming challenge? The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing muchMany teachers and researchers in US universities are now fearful of what lies ahead. No line of inquiry is safe from the raging firestorm of Maga intolerance. Many of the most vulnerable areas of inquiry lie in the health sector – LGBTQ+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and so on. But there’s also endangered research on environmental issues and the climate crisis, socioeconomic inequality, plus the humanities, social science and astrophysics.The looming crisis in the US is beginning to remind people in Europe of the 1930s, when the UK and the US began to realise that Jewish scientists needed to be rescued from the Nazis. About 2,000 scientists and academics fled the fascist countries between 1933 and 1941, fearing for themselves or Jewish family members. Then, universities in the US and the UK made space for and welcomed a whole generation of geniuses – Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Max Born, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, to name just a few. Likewise, members of the Frankfurt School were rescued and installed in New York, where they becamemightily critical of American capitalismbut at least lived to tell their particular tale. As did Thomas Mann.Now, in a different age, there are stirrings in Europe to provide safe places for American researchers. In France, Aix-Marseille University iswelcoming American scientistswhose work has become untenable after the Trump administration’s cuts in certain academic sectors. The Free University of Brussels (VUB) is opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, which areopen to American researchersworking in socially relevant fields. The fellowships come with substantial funding (€2.5m) as part of the European Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. It’s also aiming to attract American professors looking to relocate. VUB, with its Francophone sister university ULB, is providing 18 apartments for international researchers seeking temporary residence at the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies.This is the beginning of something hopeful. But it also raises the question of what UK institutions are doing to meet the coming challenge. The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing much. Perhaps that’s because most of British academia still can’t get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the “special relationship” is yesterday’s story.What I’ve been readingHow I accidentally got sent Trump’s Yemen textsJeffrey Goldberg’sastonishing storyabout the White House security leak in theAtlantic.Philosophy and fatherhoodA curious tendency among western philosophersexplored in an intriguing post by Doug Muir.AI has learned to reason …… or has it?

It seems like the creepy billionaire’s insemination obsession has rubbed off on Trump: the legally definedsexual predatoris now calling himself “the fertilization president”.Trump proudly unveiled this new nickname for himself on Wednesday at aWhite House eventcelebrating Women’s History Month. Someone should probably report this event to the DEI police, by the way, because I am pretty sure the president himself made acknowledging women’s history verboten. Earlier this year, for example,it was reportedthat a number of federal agencies were banning celebrations related to Martin Luther King Jr Day, Black History Month, Women’s History Month and other “special observances” because they didn’t want to fall foul of Trump’swide-ranging executive orderon diversity, equity and inclusion.This particular event, however, appears to have been permitted because thecurated crowdconsisted of the sort of women Trump approves of: very white, and very deferential. The White House has uploaded a number of videos of the attenders gazing adoringly at Trump – who once vowed to be aprotector of women“whether the women like it or not” – as he rambled on.“We’re going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too, the women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we’re talking about. It’s going to be, it’s going to be great,” Trump told the crowd. When the crowd started laughing appreciatively, Trump said “fertilization” again, before adding: “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president, that’s not bad, that’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right? I like it.”To be clear: a cat didn’t accidentally walk over my keyboard while I was writing this. This is a precise transcription of what Trump said. The man has always beenalarmingly incoherent– and yet with much of this, the press still seems intent on editing his wild ramblings into something that makes them seem more normal. Poynter has termed this “sanewashing”.I’m afraid I can’t seem to find what was in the goody bags that were given out at the Women’s History Month event. (Elon Musk’s phone number, perhaps?) Nor can I tell you exactly what was going through Trump’s head as he was waxing lyrical about fertilization – amid digressions about theprice of eggsand gas – at an event meant to celebrate women’s achievements. But, to put the fertilization remarks in a little more context, he brought them up after boasting that he’d signed an executive order expanding access to (often very expensive) fertility treatments like IVF.This boast is technically true: in February, Trump signed an executive order directing the domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the costs for accessing IVF. However, this was really nothing more than a PR move. As the Guardian’s Carter Shermannoted at the time:“[T]he lack of direct action on IVF in Trump’s … order is striking, especially in the context of Trump’s other executive orders, which have issued sweeping – and potentially illegal – mandates … The order does not, for example, mandate private employers cover IVF in the way that they are required to covercontraception.”His (totally meaningless) executive order was meant to fulfil promises Trump had made on thecampaign trail, where – in a brazen attempt to appeal to female voters – he supported making IVF more affordable. He also declared himself the “father of IVF” last October, while also admitting he’d only just found out what the procedure was. During, his debate with Kamala Harris, he similarlyproclaimedhe had “been a leader on IVF, which is fertilization”.Will Trump go any further than giving himself weird nicknames, and actually do something meaningful to increase access to IVF? Possibly. On the one hand, he has to tread carefully around IVF because it’s a sensitive topic for many anti-abortion zealots who believefrozen embryosshould be legally considered children, and who have been pushing toseverely curtail accessto the procedure. On the other hand, however, Trump does have Musk, one of the world’s most passionate pro-natalists, whispering in his ear about how the US needs more babies.If Trump does make IVF more accessible, it certainly won’t be more accessible for everyone. Just look at Viktor Orbán’s Hungary – a rightwing autocracy that many conservatives in the US look to as a blueprint for what they want to achieve at home – and the pro-natalist policies there. Hungary has a state-run IVF system and offers generous fertility and parental benefits to a certain subset of people. AsMother Jones has explained: “[T]he closer you look at Hungary’s eligibility requirements for family benefits, the more clearly you see the kind of babies Orbán wants to populate his boom: not just Hungarian nationals, but children from married, heterosexual, middle-income and up Hungarian nationals with stay-at-home moms.”My wife and I spent a huge amount of money on fertility treatments to have our child and I know a lot of people who have made enormous financial sacrifices to access IVF. Ordinarily, I’d cheer on any attempts to broaden access to it. But, amid his wider war on reproductive rights, Trump’s declaration that he’s the “fertilization president” feels menacing.Women, it seems Trump is going to protect you, whether you like it or not!

Although the secretaries of defense, state and treasury, the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, the vice-president, and the president’s chief of staff were among the 18 people included, neither the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, who is a statutory member of the principals committee of the National Security Council, nor any military designee was invited into this group. Instead, the editor of the Atlantic,Jeffrey Goldberg, was sent a link. Waltz noted: “Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days.”The Atlantic’s publication of Goldberg’s article about the Signal group’s exchanges was followed by a spray of attempts to cover it up. Trump and the rest of his administration simply denied that anything classified had been released; there were no “war plans”, it was a “hoax”, Goldberg was “scum”, “a loser” and “discredited”, and what about Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton? Which prompted Goldberg to publish the detailed war plans he had withheld in his first article. He was the only responsible person involved in the incident.Quite apart from the glaring incompetence and illegality of the whole affair – Goldberg’s careless inclusion, the fact that a provision of the Espionage Act (18 USC § 793) criminalizes “gross negligence” for mishandling classified national security material, and that operating on Signal with timed deletion of messages violates the preservation of records for the National Archives – the conversation pulled back the curtain on the White House.For all intents and purposes, Stephen Miller acted as the de facto presidentThe transcript exposed the internal pecking order of theTrump administrationand its actual chain of command, if it could be called anything that regular. In the end, the final decision-maker within the group to whom the others deferred was not any cabinet secretary or the chief of staff. They turned to “SM” – Stephen Miller – the deputy chief of staff who is Trump’s zealous enforcer. The chief of staff, Susie Wiles, came across as a cheerleader. Miller was the one who gave the stamp of approval. He conveyed Trump’s word. For all intents and purposes, Stephen Miller acted as the de facto president.The desultory discussion on Signal also highlighted the juvenile towel-snapping bro culture at the top of the administration. The Fox News personalities in the cabinet and the others who have habituated themselves to blathering forceful opinions appeared in the leaked transcript to have seamlessly carried over their habits of loud and thoughtless talk. Above all, they don’t know when not to speak; nor do they know what they reveal about themselves when they do. They don’t know how to conduct themselves as serious people in the room. Their incompetence comes naturally.About the military plan on the eve of being executed,JD Vanceopined: “I think we are making a mistake.” By venturing his view at this advanced point in the operation, he showed that he had been out of the loop. Vice-presidents since Walter Mondale, under President Jimmy Carter, have been made indispensable figures in important decisions, especially involving national security. But Vance sounded like an outsider, a guest on a podcast.The Trump team group chat news is obscuring an essential question | Mohamad BazziRead moreHe went on about how the Houthis menacing the trade in the Hormuz Strait affected Europe more than the United States. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” he said. Vance felt that it was Trump who was out of the loop or assumed Trump’s ignorance. If only Trump understood his own contradictions.But Vance conceded: “I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself.” Where did he think he would voice his dissent, Joe Rogan’s show? He did not know Goldberg was already listening in. Then Vance suggested: “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”“There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line,” piped up Joe Kent, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, lending support to Vance. Kent has been an overlooked figure in the scandal. He has anextensive historyof associations with extremist domestic terrorist organizations. As a Republican congressional candidate, he paid a consulting fee to a member of the Proud Boys; he has also been close to the Christian nationalist Patriot Prayer group involved in violent street brawls in Portland;defendedthewhite supremacist Nick Fuentes; and stated: “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with there being a white people special interest group,” during an interview with a group called the American Populist Union. In 2022, after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Kentcalledhim “very reasonable”. When Kent ran for the House that year, after his ties to the far right were exposed, he claimed he had distanced himself from such groups. Kent was the deputy of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, on the Signal group.Waltz joined in the Europe-bashing with talking points to buttress Trump’s zero-sum mercantilist view of the world, explaining: “Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”Vance broke in to say that if Hegseth wanted “to do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”Hegseth agreed: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” He added: “Question is timing.”Enter Stephen Miller. “As I heard it,” he said, “the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”The allies are not really allies; they are renters, and the rent should be raised“As I heard it …” Miller spoke as if he were the only one to hear Trump. No one else said they had. Miller was definitive. He was more than the Trump whisperer. He was the voice of Trump.Miller also chimed in on the chorus of contempt for Europe. It was as though Europe was the enemy. The allies are not really allies; they are renters, and the rent should be raised.On 15 March, Hegseth returned with an “update” of precise details of the attack. “I will say a prayer for victory,” he wrote. It was a go. As it proceeded, Waltz chronicled the targets hit on Signal.Susie Wiles weighed in: “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.”Waltz posted three emojis – a fist, a flag and a fire.“Great work all. Powerful start,” said Miller. He was the one to give the praise. He apparently had the authority.In Russia, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy, responded with two prayer emojis, a flexed muscle emoji and two American flag emojis.Afterward, Witkoff, a former New York real estate operator and Trump golfing partner, gave aninterviewto Tucker Carlson, the far-right podcaster who is highly influential with JD Vance and Hegseth, in which Witkoff said he “liked” Vladimir Putin, who was not “a bad guy”, “straight up”, and had presented him with a portrait of Trump to take home – “such a gracious moment”.What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreProclaimed a “success”, the operation itself will do little to quell the Iran-backed Houthis, who resumed their missile attacks on shipping in the Hormuz Strait after Benjamin Netanyahu, seeking to maintain his fragile grasp on power, abandoned the ceasefire in Gaza, which Trump declared he “fully supports” after doing nothing to sustain it. Instead, Trump proposed turning the ravaged Palestinian territory into a beachfront property, a “riviera of the Middle East”. Trump shared an AI-generated video of himself and Netanyahu lolling on the beach with dollars raining down and half-naked dancing women. Trump’s policy, of which the Houthi strike supposedly demonstrates “success”, has further entangled the US in cycles of violence without any clear path forward.As soon as Goldberg’s article appeared, the cover-up effort began. “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic; to me it’s a magazine that is going out of business,” Trump said. “I know nothing about it. You’re saying that they had what?”Republicans in the Congress stammered or were silent. At last, the senator Roger Wicker, of Mississippi, chair of the Senate intelligence committee, called for an expedited report from the Pentagon’s inspector general. Unfortunately, there is no such inspector general – at least not a permanent one. Trump fired him on 27 January along with 16 others across federal agencies and departments, without reason, contrary to the Inspector General Act of 1978, tightened in 2022. “I don’t know [the fired inspectors general],” Trumpsaid, “but some people thought that some were unfair or were not doing the job.” For now, there is an acting inspector general.The scandal might have been avoided if Hegseth could have consulted with the Pentagon’s legal authorities, the judge advocate generals. But hefiredthe top Jag officers of the army, navy and air force three weeks before the Signal group was formed.Nor did Hegseth, or anyone else, apparently think to include the joint chiefs of staff, who just might have objected to the obvious sloppiness and illegality of the Signal setup. But on 21 February,Trump firedthe chair of the joint chiefs, the four-star general CQ Brown Jr, the chief of naval operations and the air force vice-chief of staff. He had alreadyremoved the chief of the US Coast Guard.Brown, the former air force chief, was the first Black person to head a branch of the armed forces. “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt,” said Hegseth in dismissing Brown. Adm Christopher Grady, serving as the acting chair of the joint chiefs, was not sent the invitation for the Signal group that Goldberg received.To replace Brown, Trump has nominated a retired three-star general, Dan Caine, whom Trump insists on calling “Razin’ Caine”. But no one raised Caine to participate in the chat.He might be grateful to have been ignored. Instead of the three-star general, Waltz mobilized three emojis.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakOpinionTrump administrationUS national securityDonald TrumpJD VancePete HegsethUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

Four Labour governments since the Second World War were derailed by financial crises – in1949,1967,1976and2008– and two Tory governments by crises in1992and2022. Yet, in 2025, Britain is arguably economically more vulnerable than in any of those years. The task for the chancellor is to climb out of this deep pit with as much determination as possible while not risking a sterling or bond sell-off that would derail the government, party and country at least as severely as any of those earlier crises.Thus the much-criticised fiscal rules. These are not a self-imposed straitjacket to be abandoned at will but an attempted firewall to sustain financial market confidence while allowing scope to maintain and increase public investment. The promise to balance day-to-day public spending five years hence with day-to-day tax receipts is a minimum guarantor of fiscal credibility. But meeting this permits a second rule: to allow the state to borrow to maintain and increase capital spending, so protecting public investment from being raided as the soft option when the public budget comes under pressure – as every chancellor has done for more than 50 years, with results we live with daily.Rachel Reeves has received a hail of brickbats for herspring statement, but strategically she has got a great deal right. Exploiting the fiscal rules, she is consolidating the increase in public investment announcedlast Octoberand raising it further. This, together with planning reforms that theOffice for Budget Responsibility recogniseswill ignite more housebuilding, will underpin an upturn in economic growth. It will also reinvigorate the public capital stock, extending from hospitals to decarbonising the housing stock – recognised by the OBR as enhancing growth. There are acute risks posed to world trade, growth, inflation and interest rates as President Donald Trump is set to launch hisself-defeating “liberation day”next Wednesday – a salvo of 25% import tariffs oncar, steel, aluminium,pharmaceuticalsandsemiconductor chipsfrom any country he deems to be taking advantage of the US. The threat makes it all the more important that the UK can maintain and increase its levels of public investment, now high in historical terms, to offset the likely damage.To hit 3.2 million already disadvantaged households so they lose an average of £1,720 a year by 2029 is a capital errorBut the associated borrowing will be met calmly by the markets if the government hits it​s first fiscal rule, ​which was threatened this spring by economic underperformance, ballooning debt interest payments and an explosion of health-related welfare benefits that, unchecked​, would have risen very close to matching education spending by 2029. The government was right to try to constrain this growth. No society, however rich, can countenance allowing spending on those with disabilities to grow so much it crowds out other crucial areas of spending. What of social care? Special educational needs? Defence? Social housing? Apprenticeships? International aid? Prisons? The court system? The more than 6 million people living on paltry universal credit? Supporting economic growth? Although there is a powerful case for increasing taxation on propertied and wealthy people, it is less clear that all the additional proceeds should be wholly earmarked for one category of the population. Unpalatable as it may be, the growth had to be slowed down.But here the chancellor and her Treasury ministers lost their moral and political compass. To hit 3.2 million already disadvantaged and stressedhouseholdsso they lose an average of £1,720 a year by 2029 (on the government’s own figures), and plunge 250,000 extra people into poverty, with only the scantest of compensating measures to help them into work, is a capital error. Some potential helpful measures were hinted at – a promised £1bn back-to-work scheme (with no details) and the pledge that sickness benefit claimants can retain their benefit if they work – but it was paltry. The range of Gordon Brown’s New Deals for work cost about £3bn in 2025 prices; a similar range of programmes – to incentivise employers to hire people with disabilities and mental health challenges while offering support and financial reward to re-engage with work – would be at least as expensive. Instead, we have an exercise in budgetary and PR management in which some of the weakest in our society bore the brunt. This was not tough love to assuage Reform voters, as some Labour MPs comfort themselves: it was an amoral abdication of responsibility to some of the most vulnerable.Recognising this reality, the chancellor needed additional resources. Thus, the second capital error: to abjure any attempt to raise revenue in innovative ways. There would, for example, be wide support for creating a national defence fund, financed by 50-year bonds – with the debt service costs covered by a national defence levy averaging, say, 1% of income but structured so the well-off paid proportionately more. It would be a double whammy: finding the resource to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP earlier than 2029 and at the same time freeing the rest of the government from debilitating cuts to accommodate more on defence. And sooner or later, a chancellor of some political hue must reform regressive, low-yielding council tax. This is a Rubicon that must be crossed. There is a successful economic strategy potentially in the making, but the government needs to avoid the unforced capital errors of last week – and get on the front foot.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025OpinionRachel ReevesTax and spendingWelfareEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

People tend to associate them withantisocially high suburban hedgesor ugly, nature-bereft blocks of industrial forestry.But at the world’s most important collection of rare evergreens, which is 100 years old this spring, these often unfairly maligned trees are celebrated and revealed in a much more beautiful light.Bedgebury national pinetumin Kent is increasingly vital as an ark for endangered conifers, which are globally one of the most threatened groups of plants in the world. A third of conifer species are at risk of extinction.The pinetum (pronounced “pine-eet-tum” – an arboretum for pine trees) was founded by the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew and the Forestry Commission in 1925 after Kew’s curator complained that his rare conifers were choking in London smogs. “Anyone working in the pinetum would come away looking like a chimney sweep,” wrote William Bean, the curator ofKew Gardensat the time.Set up on the southern Kentish Weald, Bedgebury was an ideal escape from pollution, and also provided varied topography and soils and both boggy and free-draining land to suit a wide range of species. Conifers planted by the previous landowner, the Victorian evergreen enthusiast William Beresford, were already thriving there.In 1925, the first 315 trees were planted, overseen by the Forestry Commission, which wasfounded after the first world warto ensure an increasingly tree-less Britain became more self-sufficient in timber. Foresters were keen to discover which New World conifer species might thrive in Britain’s forests of the future.View image in fullscreenThe pinetum was set up on the Kentish Weald to escape air pollution.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianToday the pinetum continues to provide Forestry England with real-world examples of conifer species that may flourish in the near future. Global heating, new tree diseases and political instability are giving fresh urgency to identifying resilient timber trees for the next century.The pinetum is also a unique repository for rare species, with the most complete conifer collection in the world.In recent years, its horticulturalists have worked to grow andsave the Mulanje cedar, thenational tree of Malawithat was illegally logged to extinction during the pandemic.Staff were also the first in the world to successfully grow probably the rarest tree in the world, the Vietnamese golden cypress, from seed. Offspring will shortly be distributed to other botanic gardens around the world.Dan Luscombe, the curator of Bedgebury, described the Vietnamese golden cypress as “our giant panda”.“We’re a tree zoo,” he said. “We hold on to species and repropagate them. You cannot conserve something if you can’t grow it. That’s the skill of horticulture.“Conifers get a bad reputation because ‘dwarf’ conifers planted in the 1970s were never dwarf and never stopped growing. Leylandii is the suburban brute. But conifers shouldn’t be overlooked. They are some of the most amazing living things on the planet. These trees are like incredible paintings which we hold on to for posterity. These species have been around for so many millions of years and the biggest threat to them is our behaviour.”For many of the 500,000 annual visitors who enjoy the pinetum’s trees and trails, it is a sanctuary of beauty and tranquility.Liz Anderson, a volunteer at Bedgebury, said: “It’s my happy place. Everybody says that. I love trees and there’s such a variety here. The vistas, having the inclines and looking down on the trees, the different light when you come here – it’s the most beautiful place.”View image in fullscreenThe pinetum is a sanctuary of beauty and tranquility for its visitors.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe pinetum celebrated its 100th birthday as only a tree collection knows how – with a ceremonial planting. Two Japanese hemlock trees have been put into the ground exactly 100 years to the day after the first curator, William Dallimore, planted the same species.The site is facing a grave threat, however. One of continental European forestry’s worst foes, theEuropean spruce bark beetle, flew into Kent in 2018 and is established just 300 metres away from the pinetum.If the beetle discovers the pinetum, it could destroy many species. If it moves north and reaches large commercial Sitka spruce plantations in northern England and Scotland, it could seriously damage Britain’s future timber crops.Although Luscombe dreads the arrival of the beetle, he said the pinetum could become a vital real-world laboratory for assessing which species can best resist it.“It could be devastating for the pinetum but actually we could be looking at the collection here and seeing what species are more susceptible than others to this disease and see which ones have more resistance and resilience. Sometimes, the bad happening is more for the greater good.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Tiny conifers are the giants of the future.“What I am doing now isn’t for me, it’s for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren,” said Luscombe, who has worked at Bedgebury for 25 years. “There’s not many jobs you can leave a living legacy after you’re gone and that’s one of the joys of this. In 100 years’ time someone will be talking about the work my team have done and we’ll all be long gone. There’s something really rewarding about that.”And while Bedgebury attracts thousands of visitors when it puts up trails of festival lights at Christmas, Luscombe has one final message to the spruce-sceptics: “A conifer is for life, not just for Christmas.”Five of the best at BedgeburyVietnamese golden cypress(Cupressus vietnamensis)One of the rarest trees in the world, the first time it was ever grown from seed by horticulturalists was at Bedgebury. The pinetum plans to distribute its young trees to other botanic gardens around the world.Cathay silver fir(Cathaya argyrophylla)A rare conifer from China, where barely 100 live in the wild. Specimens only came to the west at the turn of the century. Bedgebury’s specimen was the first to “cone” in Britain – producing valuable seed for the next generation.Coast redwood(Sequoia sempervirens)Now considered endangered in the wild, this vast tree of the American west coast has thrived since it was brought to Britain. Seed collected from the wild (to ensure genetic diversity) has been used to plant an avenue at Bedgebury, which will be spectacularly high in years to come.Sicilian fir(Abies nebrodensis)Europe’s rarest tree with just 29 left in the wild. Five seedlings grown from wild seed were given to Bedgebury and are now 3 metres high and thriving.Yew(Taxus baccata)One of three British native conifers (alongside Scots pine and juniper), many of the oldest yews in Europe are found in churchyards where the trees predate the church – and predate Christianity. Bedgebury has taken cuttings from a hugeancient yew in nearby Ulcombe churchyardso this particular individual, which could be up to 2,000 years old, is cloned and will live on.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsConservationKew GardensKentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But new research offers a glimmer of hopeKatharine Gammonin Los AngelesSat 29 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 11.03 EDTShareAlex Sinunu was used tosurfingthree or four times a week in Santa Monica Bay – after all, the beach was just a mile from his home and he could ride his bike there with his board. But ever since the megafires that swept through neighboring Pacific Palisades in early January,the ocean has been filled with ash, debris– and endless questions.The massive blazeconsumed thousands of homesand other structures, many of them on the edge of the Pacific coastline. Subsequent rainstorms sent tons of debris washing into the ocean, turned the water brown and raised fears about the toxins that could be coming from all the charred remains of buildings and cars – including asbestos, lithium-ion batteries and plastics.There is also no single authority in charge of maintaining ocean health, which has made informing the beach-going public a challenge, and created lingering uncertainty about when it’s safe to get back in the water.In a city where surfing is a way of life, waiting for the all-clear has been agonizing. Sinunu is part of a local surfing group called the Surfcats, and they are feeling the pain of staying away. The ocean is so close, yet so far. “It would be like living in Mammoth and not being able to ski in winter,” he says, referencing the famous ski town in theCaliforniamountains.It’s not just the debris that washes up on the shore. Sinunu is also concerned about what lurks in the waves. “My concern is melted Tesla juice,” he says. “There’s just God knows what’s in the water. I’m looking for some data.”He and other surfers have been travelling far and wide in search of safer waters to paddle out to – he’s been driving north to Malibu or south to Manhattan Beach to get his fix, with others venturing as far as Ventura, some 60 miles (97km) away.The surf group is exploring other options to get an outdoor thrill – they are discussing pickleball, and some of them go skateboarding. But it’s not the same, and a depression has settled over the group. “We identify as surfers, and I have a surfboard on my wall, and that’s our vibe.”‘Uncharted territory’After months of questions, there are now glimmers of optimism. This week, local non-profit Heal the Bay released areportshowing the results of ocean samples at 10 sites along the length of Santa Monica Bay, which sits just below the Palisades neighborhood. They show that immediately after the fires, the water quality was better than expected – but there could still be risks to marine mammals, fish and other creatures in the food chain.Heal the Bay staff scientists and a regional water agency tested the ocean for 116 known pollutants at multiple sites in January and February. They found elevated levels of only a few pollutants: beryllium and PAHs, both associated with burned vegetation. They were both below the limits set for human health.The news is welcome to the beach community. Sharon Schaffer, the first Black woman to become a pro surfer, looks out on the beach in front of her house in Playa del Rey on a recent March day. The beach looks vacant: no surfers, no volleyball players. “Beach life has ceased in LA,” she says, “and for someone like me, the beach is my life.”View image in fullscreenA rally for a proper cleanup of toxic debris from the ocean and shorelines, in Santa Monica, California, on 9 March 2025.Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock“The fact that I’ve been unable to surf this year locally, except for one sitting, is very traumatizing,” she says. “The only way I get to serve is if I travel out to surf, and that is very stressful and depressing.”Schaffer decided to go out one day to surf in front of her home in February; even though the water was brown and there was debris floating, she couldn’t stop herself from catching a few good waves. But the next day, she says, she felt very sick with flu-like symptoms.Dylan Sohngen, surf program director with the Aqua Surf school, says he has moved all lessons further south on Santa Monica Bay, where there are more assurances about the water quality. He was frustrated by the lack of clear safety guidelines and visible cleanup efforts over the past two months.“This is totally uncharted territory,” he says. “There isn’t a single authority on what to do about when you can go in the water. There’s not a lot of certainty being given to when it will be quote-unquote safe.”When will it be safe?It’s true that there’s no precedent for this situation, says Tracy Quinn, the CEO of Heal the Bay. For example, there are no existing protocols for what contaminants to test – and how to test them – after an urban wildfire.The myriad of unknowns made the process challenging. There was no research done before the fires to establish baseline levels of pollutants like heavy metals in the ocean, nor are there levels determined by public health officials for what is safe for recreation. There was existing guidance for pollutant levels in local fish for eating, and for drinking water – “but it’s not likely that you’re drinking 64 ounces of ocean water”, Quinn says.The EPA weighed two LA beachfront sites for toxic waste sorting. These ‘hippies and hicks’ revoltedRead moreHeal the Bay had to come up with their own methodology. They pinpointed 116 heavy metals to test – including lead, arsenic and zinc, as well as PAHs and PCBs – a group of chemicals banned in 1979 for toxicity that still exist in old coolants, lubricants and insulating materials.The group is still trying to understand all the results. Quinn says they saw the highest concentrations near the burn zone, but there were also surprising spikes at other locations, like the Santa Monica pier, 6 miles south of the burn area, and at Dockweiler Beach, 10 miles south on the coastline.View image in fullscreenBurned houses by the Pacific coastline. Concerns linger about what toxins could lie in the debris.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPart of the problem is that debris is still washing into the ocean from 300 houses located right on the beach in the Palisades and Malibu. Those houses burned and fell onto the beach – and homeowners of 145 of them have either not opted in to the cleanup, or expressly opted out, Quinn says.So is it safe to go back to the beach for a day of surfing, boogie boarding, swimming or digging? The answer isn’t straightforward, Quinn says. “We can’t be definitive, but I would say we are cautiously optimistic for now,” she says, adding: “The general use of the beach is fine,” but she cautions that beachgoers should watch out for sharp, fire-related debris like nails and should never touch any debris with bare hands.Despite the remaining questions, surfers are hopeful. Sohngen says he has a lot of faith in the resiliency of the ocean and the beach, and that the bay has been generally vibrant, considering it sits so close to a mega region of 10 million people. “We are lucky to have this amazing ecosystem so close,” he says.The danger isn’t over yet, though, and the tests showed troubling signs for the greater ecosystem. Eight heavy metals, including lead and copper, were found to be above limits for marine animal health. Those contaminants can move around the food web and affect everything from microorganisms to sea lions.Heal the Bay’s Quinn says that climate-linked events are becoming more likely, and she hopes the lessons here will help other communities in the future. “We weren’t the first, and we certainly won’t be the last community to deal with this,” she says.Sinunu says he’s heartened by the news of the test results, but he’ll wait a few more weeks before getting back in the water close to his home – just to be safe. In the meantime, he’s been reading books and trying to find other activities, but none of them scratch the same itch in his brain. “Surf gear, surf shops, driving to the surf, talking about it,” he says, “surfing culture is a big part of life here.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresOceansSurfingUS wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her nomination was met with outrage by Perry’s family, while school leaders described it as “obscene” and “an insult to every teacher in the country”.Perry took her own life in January 2023, after anOfsted inspection that downgraded her school, Caversham primary in Reading, to the lowest rating of inadequate.After news of Perry’s death first broke, Spielman angered schools by taking a week to say publicly that she was “deeply sorry” for the family’s loss and resisting calls to pause inspections. A coroner ruled that the inspection, at times “rude and intimidating”, contributed to the headteacher’s death, and issued an extraordinary prevention of future deaths report calling for urgent changes to inspections, including training for inspectors on responding to distress. Spielman, however, said in interviews last year thather organisation made no errorsduring the inspection.View image in fullscreenRuth Perry, the school head who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAProf Julia Waters, Perry’s sister, said this weekend: “Amanda Spielman’s legacy is indelibly associated with my sister’s terrible, preventable death – and with defending the unaccountable, inhumane system that led to her death.”She added: “That is not the kind of record that should be rewarded with a place in theHouse of Lords.”Andrew Morrish – a former headteacher andOfstedinspector whose mental health helpline for headteachers, Headrest, has taken “numerous” calls from school leaders who say they have been pushed to the brink by inspections – said it was “obscene” for the Conservatives to give Spielman a peerage.“It shows pure contempt for the sector and for Ruth Perry’s family,” he said. Headrest intends to launch a public petition against the nomination.Spielman angered the government by declaring recently that Labour’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill was “very likely” to make education in England worse, and accused Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, of being in thrall to the unions.No 10 issued a stinging rebuke criticising Spielman’s record at Ofsted. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “Amanda Spielman should spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted and on a teaching profession that entirely lost confidence in her as chief inspector.”But Spielman, who led Ofsted from 2017 to 2023, was admired by a succession of Conservative education secretaries including Gillian Keegan, who praised her for “championing” the curriculum. The new framework she brought in for inspections focused more on drilling down into the “substance” of what was being taught – a narrative that chimed with Michael Gove’s frequent references to academic “rigour”.Former Ofsted chief says Ruth Perry inspection was error-freeRead moreHowever, small primary schools in particular struggled to cope with inspectors’ “deep dives” into four or five different subjects, and teachers complained that judging a school by asking randomly chosen groups of children“pop quiz” questions about what they had learnedwas subjective and often unfair.Spielman commissioned a high profile review into sexual harassment and abuse in schools afterthousands of young people posted their storieson the Everyone’s Invited website in 2021. Ofsted found children no longer bothered reporting incidents because they had become so common. But Conservative MP Maria Millercondemned Ofsted for failing to actto safeguard children years before.Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Amanda Spielman’s appointment to the House of Lords cannot be on the basis of having made any positive contribution to education. Her impact was entirely negative.”He added: “She was blind to the failings of Ofsted, the organisation she headed, which was deemed by a coroner to have contributed to Ruth Perry’s death, and which has certainly driven the retention crisis we have in schools.”Sean Lang, a historian and the chair of governors at Queen Emma primary school in Cambridge, which successfully challenged what they described as a “brutal” inspection during Spielman’s tenure, said: “To give an honour to that woman is a deliberate insult to every teacher in the country.”A Conservative party spokesperson said: “It would be unfair to comment on whether specific individuals have or have not been nominated or vetted for any honour or dignity. We do not comment on speculation or purported leaks.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It was an absolutely overwhelming few weeks.”This was not an excuse, but a reason for his failures, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. “The reality is I got it wrong. As archbishop there are no excuses.”He also said there was a “rush to judgment” of public leaders.“There is an absence of forgiveness; we don’t treat our leaders as human. We expect them to be perfect. If you want perfect leaders, you won’t have any leaders.”Welby became the first archbishop in more than 1,000 years to quit after an independent review found that he should have taken more robust action over allegations ofabuseby John Smyth. His resignation, announced days after the review was published in November, plunged the C of E into crisis.About 130 boys are believed to have been victims of Smyth, a powerful barrister who died in 2018. An independent review by Keith Makin into the abuse concluded Smyth could have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported it to police a decade ago.Welby and other senior figures in the C of E were told of allegations that Smyth had abused dozens of boys who attended evangelical Christian holiday camps, beating them viciously in his garden shed.Welby had volunteered at the holiday camps in the late 1970s but said he was unaware of the allegations at the time. The Makin review said Welby was informed of the abuse allegations in 2013 but failed to take action, and that it was “unlikely” he would have been unaware of rumours surrounding Smyth when he was volunteering at the camps.The review said: “[Welby] may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No one should be too busy to deal with a safeguarding disclosure. The archbishop has never answered why there were not enormous red flags when told about horrific abuse.”Welby’s successor as archbishop of Canterbury is expected to be announced in the autumn after a lengthy and opaque selection processled bythe UK’s former spy chief, Lord Evans of Weardale.Explore more on these topicsJustin WelbyAnglicanismChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer was furious and said he would no longer tolerate malicious briefings, and that there would be consequences if it did not stop.“Cabinet really no longer feels like a safe space for genuine debate,” one minister said, though other sources point out that details of key policies, such as defence spending, have not been leaked.The order from Starmer came after weeks of tension felt by some women in the cabinet. Many are tasked with some of the hardest jobs in government, putting them at the centre of public anger over hard welfare cuts or the toxic environment over immigration, or becoming a target for Tory attacks over school reforms.Almost a dozen female Labour MPs who spoke to the Guardian said they were unnerved at how female cabinet ministers appeared to be getting the brunt of the blame for issues in government – though there is less sympathy for the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, because of anger over the Treasury’s handling of spending cuts and welfare.Among some of the new intake of MPs, there is a strong feeling that any ultimate successor to Starmer should be a woman – and a resentment of what they see as a campaign to anoint Wes Streeting.Allies of the health secretary deny he is behind any negative briefing. One pointed out Streeting’s close and long-running friendships with Phillipson and Reeves.“Keir has given Wes the chance to save the NHS that saved his life. It’s a seven-day-a-week job and he’s completely focused on that,” one ally said.Others in Whitehall and in parliament say they feel it is No 10 or Treasury aides who are responsible for frustrated briefing, whether towards Kendall, who has fought an internal battle over the welfare cuts and funding for jobs programmes; Phillipson, for the handling of the academy changes, or others, such as the deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, because of political differences.Streeting has cemented his status as No 10’s favoured voice in the media – whether on his own health brief or as a political attack dog against the Tories and Reform. He launched the party’s Runcorn byelection on Friday by criticising Nigel Farage, saying Reform would “dismantle our NHS from top to bottom”.It might be expected that Streeting’s ubiquity in the media, his skill at skewering rightwingers and his responsibility for major NHS spending in the policy area, which is a key priority ofLabourmembers, would make him a popular choice among the party grassroots. But he is actually one of the least popular, according to a poll from LabourList, in front of only Kendall, Reeves and the attorney general, Richard Hermer.At the moment he has no obvious female rival as the heir apparent. Senior cabinet ministers who did not want to see Streeting win had previously coalesced around Reeves, but her unpopular decisions as chancellor have meant that is no longer the case. Other ministers would back Rayner, but she would face a brutal press onslaught.Among Labour members there is no doubt, however. Rayner is streets ahead of her rivals in terms of popularity with the grassroots, according to the poll from Survation. There is only one cabinet minister ahead of her, who is probably the least likely of anyone around the table to have another shot at the top job – Ed Miliband.Explore more on these topicsLabourWomen in politicsBridget PhillipsonLiz KendallYvette CooperRachel ReevesAngela RaynerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pranksters took a hand each – the minute hand remains missing.Trixie Baker returned the hour hand to Gonville & Caius, the fourth oldest college at Cambridge University, on a visit late last year.The college archivist, James Cox, said: “I was delighted to welcome Trixie to the college and to receive the clock hand.”It now resides in the college archive alongside other tales of student pranks – known as “rags”.Cox said: “Learning of student escapades is part of the college’s long and varied history. While we don’t encourage students to take part in such pranks, I am happy to learn about them years later, when no one has been hurt and no permanent damage has been done – and they’ve graduated.”Trixie’s father started as a modern languages student at Gonville & Caius in 1934 and graduated in 1937, with the prank happening during this time.Gonville & Caius was first founded as Gonville Hall by Edmund Gonville, rector of Terrington St Clement in Norfolk, in 1348. It was refounded in 1557 by John Caius as Gonville & Caius College.In 1958, engineering students from the college were responsible for placing an Austin Seven van on the roof of Senate House, Cambridge University’s ceremonial building where graduation ceremonies take place.In 1921, Gonville & Caius students removed a German artillery gun from a nearby square and displayed it in Caius Court.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of CambridgeHigher educationCrimeStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

For others, it was about acknowledging shared losses and shared grief.Thousands of Germans who died in Britain during the first and second world wars were laid to rest in local graveyards. British people tended these graves for decades, even laying flowers and wreaths for their former foes.View image in fullscreenMourners at the Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery in 1967.Photograph: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge Image ArchiveA historian has uncovered new details of this extraordinary relationship, and found that more than 7,000 German soldiers and prisoners of war were once buried in cemeteries near the British towns and villages where they died. Tim Grady, professor of modern history at the University of Chester, unearthed a previously overlooked pile of documents “wrapped in brown paper” in the German War Graves Commission (VDK) archives, which turned out to be interwar records about the graves from the German embassy in London that no scholar had ever consulted.After the wars, Grady said, there were so many dead soldiers scattered across the globe that people felt that tending to the war graves in their local area was a “tangible” way of overcoming the “horrors of war”.“If you can do something for the war dead who are close to you, perhaps other people will do the same for your loved ones, wherever they are buried,” he said.The policy of the Imperial War Graves Commission was to leave the bodies of British soldiers in the country where they had died, too, meaning thousands were buried in military cemeteries abroad rather than repatriated.Grady discovered that one British couple who lost their son in the first world war tended the grave of a German fighter whose plane came down near their home. “They’ve got this shared experience of loss that they feel is bonding them together with the other bereaved family,” he said.View image in fullscreenSix white wooden crosses mark the graves of German airmen buried in Plymouth’s Ford Park Cemetery.Photograph: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge ArchiveMost of the time, however, it wasn’t a straightforward reciprocal arrangement, he said. “It was based on a kind of common humanity, coming out of the wars, where I think people wanted to try to build a better future and they saw caring for the enemy dead was a way to do this.”In Bishop’s Stortford, Herts, one family made it “almost their life’s mission” to look after the graves of 15 German war dead buried there. “They spent all their money tending these graves – they say they do it to comfort the mothers back inGermany, and as a basis for reconciliation.”There are even examples of people laying wreaths on German graves onRemembrance Day“because they want to unite them” with British graves, Grady said. Others left flowers or took photos of the graves for bereaved family members back in Germany, inviting them to visit.Some people also responded to letters German families wrote to local councils in the UK, asking for information after learning a loved one had died nearby. “And so you start to get genuine human contact between the two sides – and that breaks down barriers between the British and the Germans after both wars. That’s the initial basis for some form of reconciliation between the two populations that were enemies.”View image in fullscreenBurying the Enemy: The Story of Those who Cared for the Dead in Two World Wars by Tim GradyPhotograph: pr handoutBetween 1962 and 1963 the German government systematically exhumed almost all the bodies of their war dead from graves across the UK and reburied them in a single military cemetery on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire. But its efforts were met with unexpected resistance from British people who had, in some cases, been tending the graves for almost 50 years.“In one cemetery in Yorkshire, a local councillor saw the German team coming to exhume a couple of these German graves and he threatened to call the police,” said Grady, whose book,Burying the Enemy: The Story of Those Who Cared for the Dead in Two World Wars, was published last week.“He said: ‘You can’t take them. These are our Germans. We’ve been looking after them.’ And he tried to stop them. But the exhumation team had papers from the Home Office that say they’re allowed to do this. They can’t be stopped.”The graves of the German war dead in Britain played a crucial role in restoring relations between the countries after the world wars, Grady said.One RAF commander filled 12 wooden urns with soil from German graves near his base in Sussex, and sent the urns to the bereaved German families of those who were buried there. “One of them was an unknown pilot, so they couldn’t trace his family. The VDK has still got that urn sitting in its archive.”In Poole, Dorset, a British man who lived opposite a cemetery bumped into the widow of a Nazi bomber who had been shot down and buried there. “She was visiting her husband’s grave after the war.” After meeting at the graveside, they stayed in contact, exchanging Christmas cards and letters. “He tends the grave, laying flowers there and writing to her about how the grave is. He even ends up going over to Germany on holiday, and stays with her and her new husband.”In Montrose, Scotland, “lots of local people” welcomed the mother of a Nazi killed nearby in a plane crash, when she visited her son’s grave in the early 1950s. “Somebody wanted to drive her to the cemetery, somebody wanted to find her a hotel, someone else wanted to take her out for dinner. All to show her: we’re no longer enemies, we understand your loss, let’s work together.”Such connections were important for Anglo-German relations, Grady said, as they involved ordinary people and their communities. “Because the enemy bodies were buried locally, it forced people locally to recognise that the other side also experienced loss.”Explore more on these topicsSecond world warThe ObserverFirst world warGermanyNazismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That ruling said that failing to disclose plainly to consumers the amount of commission paid to dealers, and get their informed consent, was unlawful.The decision sent shockwaves through an industry already spooked by the potential fallout of a much smaller car loans investigation launched by theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA) last January.The high-profile case is due to run for three days from Tuesday in front of judges including the supreme court president, Lord Reed, in London. Depending on the final ruling, it could have significant implications for both the financial services industry and inbound UK investment.Roughly 90% of new cars, and a growing number of used vehicles, are bought with the help of motor loans, many doled out through car dealers.While the ruling was in reference to car loans, there are fears that it could encompass a range of financial products that are sold on commission, including insurance, resulting in a massive compensation bill that analysts have been loath to estimate.The car loans scandal alone is projected to cost lenders, including Santander UK, Close Brothers, Barclays and Lloyds, a collective £44bn, according to some analysts. That would nearly rival the payment protection insurance(PPI) saga, which cost banks £50bn.View image in fullscreenJudges including Lord Reed, president of the UK supreme court, will hear the case brought by two specialist providers of motor finance.Photograph: Kevin Leighton/UK Supreme Court/PAThe Financing & Leasing Association, which represents car lenders, has been warning the government that a massive bill could end up disrupting the market, forcing some lenders to shut up shop, offer fewer loans or raise interest rates.Concerns over the potential bill prompteda controversial interventionby the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The Treasury wrote to judges in January, urging them to avoid handing “windfall” compensation to borrowers, and warning that the case could “cause considerable economic harm”.Reeves later denied caving in to lobbying by the financial sector or working against consumer interests.While her intervention was ultimately rejected, executives from the wider financial sector – including JP Morgan’s Chase UK and the retirement fund provider Phoenix – have said that the scandal has dampened foreign appetite for British shares.Executives argued that the situation could scare off investors wary of putting money into UK businesses that could face billions in costs on the basis of a ruling by a regulator or court in future. That could compound existing panic about the future of the London stock market, they claim.The Treasury seems to have already heard the message, warning in its letter that the case might “generate a perception that regulation in the UK is uncertain”.That has put further pressure on the FCA to provide extra guidance to lenders. It plans to confirm within six weeks of the supreme court’s decision if it will be proposing a customer compensation scheme and, if so, how it will take this forward.If the scheme floated by the FCA goes ahead, lenders are likely to have to proactively contact all borrowers who meet the mis-selling criteria and offer compensation – dealing a blow toclaims management firms.As it stands, lenders are already steeling themselves for the fallout.Close Brothers, which is the most exposed to motor finance among its peers, with about 20% of its portfolio dedicated to car loans, hasput aside £165m, cancelled dividends and plans to sell off its asset management business to strengthen its finances.Lloyds, the largest provider of motor loans through its Black Horse division, had alreadyput aside a total of £1.2bnfor potential compensation, with its latest provision contributing to a 20% drop in annual profits.Santander UK has allocated £295m, prompting frustration at the top of the Spanish-owned bank, which is said to be considering a potential sale of its retail business.With memories of PPI – Britain’s costliest ever consumer scandal – still fresh for many banking executives, events at the supreme court will be closely watched.Explore more on these topicsMotor financeObserver business agendaBankingFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsConsumer rightsUK supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

But the current leader of theFantasy Premier League(FPL), which allows participants to play at being Premier League managers during the football season, is not a data analyst, a football insider or a computer scientist, but a 67-year-old woman who uses a pen and paper to choose her team each week.Susan Clarke, otherwise known as the Ruby Reds, achieved near-mythical status among committed FPL players this week as she beat millions of competitors to be top of the onlinePremier Leaguegame, despite admitting to a lo-fi approach.The FPL, which gives players a budget to form their own teams of Premier League footballers and gain points on the back of their real-world weekly performances, attracts more than 11 million players around the world. From hobbyists who choose their teams like they would a Grand National runner to enthusiasts who spend unhealthy amounts of time analysing player data, everyone is in awe of Clarke’s status this week, says Mitch Murphy, the co-founder of theLazy FPLnewsletter.Pore over data, obsess about football – and trust your gut: how to become the best Fantasy Premier League manager in the worldRead more“It’s not just that she’s the top of 11.4 million people, it’s that she’s top out of 11.4 million people after 29 game weeks, it’s astonishing,” Murphy said. “It’s like winning the EuroMillions.”Lazy FPL spotted Clarke’s prowess this week, and contacted her via a newsletter subscriber. When asked how she felt about being FPL’s top dog in week 29, Clarke, who has resisted the siren call of other media outlets, said she was “shocked but enjoying the reaction of my family and friends”.The 67-year-old, who competes in a five-person mini-league called Game of Bones, is nearly 200 points ahead of the second-placed team in her league, with a whopping 2,186 points. Asked for her magic formula when picking her team, she told Lazy FPL: “At the ripe old age of 67 (you can call me old fashioned!) my weekly lists with pen and paper seem to be the secret to my success!”That success has delighted other players because it goes against the increasing automation and use of artificial intelligence to help choose the best players, says Murphy. “The game is becoming more data driven, more AI-powered, more automated, more head than heart,” he said. “And then there’s Susan, who has got a pen and paper and everything she touches turns to gold.”The FPL has grown exponentially since it launched with about 70,000 players in August 2002. A decade later that figure had grown to 2.6 million in the UK – and now there are 11.4 million players worldwide, with the largest number of managers in England, Egypt, Nigeria, Malaysia and the US. Andy Murray can often be found on social media moaning about the site crashing under the weight of transfers on a Saturday morning, the rapper Stormzy is known to listen to an FPL podcast by a sports psychologist to help choose his team, while the chess champion Magnus Carlsen managed to become atop-ranking FPL managerin his spare time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he’s rooting for her. “On average, the people who rank highly in FPL are the ones spending an embarrassing amount of time analysing the data,” he said.“But what we really love is when someone like Susan comes along and demonstrates the randomness of football. No one wants to watch or play a game where the results are predetermined. Everyone wants to see Susan top of the league at game week 30.”Explore more on these topicsFantasy FootballPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Four of the territory’s five parties signed the coalition agreement on Friday, which states on page one: “Greenland belongs to us.”The incoming prime minister,Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called for unity. “It is very important that we put aside our disagreements and differences … because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkJD VanceGreenlandEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpArcticnewsShareReuse this content"

The party leader, Özgur Özel, claimed 2.2 million people attended.“They’ve detained hundreds of our children, thousands of our youths … arrested hundreds of them,” he told the crowds. “They only had one goal in mind: to intimidate them, terrify them, make sure they never go out again.”He added: “In theTurkeywe envision presidential candidates will not be imprisoned,” calling for the release of both İmamoğlu and jailed Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtaş, a former presidential candidate who previously ran for office from prison, after he was jailed nine years ago on terrorism charges.Earlier this week, Özel had called an end to nightly rallies outside Istanbul city hall, where hundreds of thousands attended while small groups of demonstrators frequently clashed with police. Security forces used teargas, water cannon and pepper spray on demonstrators, which Human Rights Watch described as an “unwarranted and unlawful use of police force”.“Turkey is facing one of its gravest sociopolitical upheavals in decades,” said Human Rights Watch. Student groups and other small groups of protesters have continued disparate street protests in the days since the demonstrations outside city hall ended.View image in fullscreenÖzgur Özel, the leader of the Republican People’s party, walks on stage during the protest in Istanbul, Turkey.Photograph: Burak Kara/Getty ImagesThe Turkish authorities have arrested 1,900 people in the 10 days since İmamoğlu was detained on corruption charges, before he was removed from office by the Turkish interior ministry and sent to a high-security facility on the edge of Istanbul.Many of those detained by security forces were seized in predawn raids, including 13 journalists. Ten photojournalists were arrested for covering the protests before being freed later in the week, hours before the justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, met reporters, offering a defence of Turkey’s record on press freedom.Around me in Istanbul there is fear on every face – but I see a resilience that refuses to die | Carolin WürfelRead moreThe BBC correspondent Mark Lowenwas deportedafter covering the demonstrations, before Turkey’s presidential communications directorate claimed he was expelled for not having press accreditation. Authorities also arrested a Swedish journalist who flew to Turkey to cover the protests. Two more Turkish journalists were also detained, as well as İmamoğlu’s lawyer, who was later conditionally released.Özel told the French daily Le Monde that Saturday rallies would become a weekly occurrence in different cities across Turkey, while the party would hold similar gatherings in Istanbul each Wednesday.Özel said: “We believe the arrests will slow down from now.”He added that he was “ready to take the risk of spending eight to 10 years in prison if necessary because if we don’t stop this attempted coup, it will mean the end of the ballot box”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With few exceptions, European leaders have failed to offer a strong response.”I’ve never seen such clampdowns in Istanbul.

After winning a re-election once again last year, İmamoğlu is considered the sole candidate capable of beating Erdoğan in elections expected in the coming years.On the same day the Istanbul mayor was imprisoned, 15 million people turned out to vote in a symbolic primary to nominate him as the CHP’s candidate for president.İmamoğluwrote: “Realising he cannot defeat me at the ballot box, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has resorted to other means: having his main political opponent arrested on charges of corruption, bribery, leading a criminal network and aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party, even though the charges lack credible evidence.”He added: “My detention marked a new phase in Turkey’s slide into authoritarianism and the use of arbitrary power.

Earlier this week, Columbia’s presidentannouncedshe would step down after Trump targeted the university for protests on campus last year.On Wednesday, Harvard’s interim dean of social science, David Cutler, said in an email to center affiliates that the Center for Middle Eastern Studies director, Cemal Kafadar, a professor of Turkish studies, would be stepping down by the end of the academic year, according to theHarvard Crimson. Rosie Bsheer, a professor of history, is also stepping down as associate director. Both are expected to remain in their faculty positions.Faculty members who spoke to theNew York Timesanonymously said they believed that Kafadar and Bsheer were forced out of their roles. Harvard did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.The executive committee of Harvard’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the departures in a statement to the Times saying that they were “abrupt termination[s]”.“In the context of recent events, the decision appears to be a shameful attempt to escape punishment from theTrump administrationfor engaging in academic discussions about topics the president disfavors,” the committee said. “These firings cede the university’s decision-making authority to bullies and bad-faith actors committed to silence speech with which they disagree.”The Center for Middle Eastern Studies has been under criticism for alleged anti-Israel bias. Posting on X, economist and former Harvard president Lawrence Summers praised the university for moving to replace the center’s leadership.“Even after egregious delay since it was pointed up right after October 7, I am very glad that Harvard is curbing its institutional support for anti semitism,” Summerswrote.Summers had earliercriticizedHarvard’s president, Alan Garber, on X as “lack[ing] the will and/or leverage” to fight the alleged bias. Summers specifically pointed to a panel that the center held in February on “Israel’s war in Lebanon” as being antisemitic.Garber replaced Claudine Gay , whostepped downas the university’s president in early 2024 after she was accused of plagiarism and was heavily scrutinized for her congressional testimony in 2023 about antisemitism on college campuses.

Outside the ground, flares were let off in the red of FC and United along with green and yellow ones, the colours of Newton Heath, United’s original name. Anti-Glazer chants and songs were sung by fans, with one displaying a flag that showed an image of the former United forward, Eric Cantona, and the legend “Eric the King”.View image in fullscreenFC United supporters at the game with Stockton Town.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The ObserverAt a question-and-answer session at the St Mary’s Road End bar The 1958 stated its next act will be at the 196th Manchester derby. United fans had previously staged a sit-in following a3-2 win over Nottingham Forest in August 2023.“Probably one of the most impactful [protests] was when we did the sit-in, and we will be running another against City,” said Steve Crompton of The 1958. “I don’t think everybody knows yet, but you do now.”Chris Haymes, also from The 1958, said: “We’re going to get people to sit in their seats. Must [Manchester United Supporters’ Trust] did a flash survey and they reckon there’s going to be about 7,000 concessions, OAP, other people, who are not going to renew their season tickets. They’re trying to price them out of their seats, so we’re going to tell you to sit in your seat. That’s your seat that you paid for and probably have done for the last 50 or 60 years.”View image in fullscreenFC United hosted Stockton Town.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The ObserverSir Jim Ratcliffe, who controls United’s football policy, and the Glazers recentlyended all ticket concessions, meaning the cheapest price entry is £66.The American family’s proprietorship of United began with Malcolm Glazer’s leveraged purchase in 2005 that loaded about £500m debt on the club and caused a section of unhappy supporters to break away and form FC United in May that year.After Glazer died in May 2014, his six children took over and they remain the majority owners, with Ratcliffe’s share purchase of 28.94% last year making him the largest individual shareholder. United’s debt is about £730m. The club owes a further £300m in transfer fees and has lost £300m in the past three years.Saturday’s action, called United United Day, was the first formal linking of forces by FC United and a United fan group since the non-league club’s foundation, which caused division between fans. The protest took place after The 1958 reached out to FC.View image in fullscreenA dog wearing a FC United scarf inside the ground.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The ObserverHaymes explained why The 1958 approached FC. “The reason for us is that one thing [United’s] ownership thrive on is division – in the fan base and throughout all the support. So we believe that unity is the best way to be able to look for what we believe is the right treatment and so why not reach out to the ones that have been there and done it before and walked away 20 years ago, irrespective of how angry you were or how passionate you were or what you believed in [then].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Susan Crawford, a liberal judge, is facing off on Tuesday against the conservative judge Brad Schimel for the seat. The winner will determine which party has control of a court that is set to rule on the future of the state’s 1849 abortion ban,collective bargaining rightsand the makeup of the state’s six congressional districts.The election has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $80m spent on both sides so far. Musk began spending in the race earlier this year, shortly afterTesla filed a lawsuitchallenging a Wisconsin law that blocks the company from opening car dealerships in the state.The billionaire’s Super Pac is offering $100 to those who sign a petition in opposition to “activist judges”. So far, Musk and groups he funds have spent more than $20m in the race. On Friday, he posted on Twitter/X and said he would campaign in Wisconsin this weekend and give away $1m as part of a sweepstakes-like contest to people who had voted. He later deleted the post afterexperts pointed outsuch a program could be illegal under state law. He posted a revised tweet saying he would distribute the money to peopleto act as spokespeoplefor the petition. The Wisconsin attorney general, Josh Kaul, a Democrat, alsosued Muskand his Pac on Friday to stop the giveaway.“This is kind of a test case for Elon Musk,” Crawford, a former prosecutor, said in an interview. “He wants to make sure that nothing stands in the way of what he’s doing to try to dismantle the federal government.”Schimel’s campaign did not respond to an interview request.Musk’s entrance in the race comes as he has railed against federal judges who have threatened to halt Trump’s agenda, calling for the impeachment of some and backing Republicans who have heeded the call.So much money being spent in a state supreme court election would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. Wisconsin supreme court justices are elected to 10 year terms, and until recently the candidates had low profiles and few paid attention to the races. In a 2020 state supreme court race, both candidates spenta combined $10m.But in recent years, awareness has grown of the powerful role state supreme courts can play in defining major issues, bringing more money and hard-nosed politics to these races. In North Carolina, a Republican candidate is seeking to overturn a supreme court election he lost to a Democratic candidateby 734 votes.“What we’ve really seen in recent years is just how important state courts are in determining election law and how elections are run,” said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney at the state democracy research initiative at the University of Wisconsin law school. She noted that Trump carried the state by just 30,000 votes in 2024 and Biden by even less in 2020.“Really what we’re seeing is state courts are playing a huge role not just in determining issues for the state, but in determining rules for elections that can have impacts at a national level when you’re looking at a swing state like Wisconsin,” she added.Schimel, a former Republican state attorney general, has made no secret that there would be little daylight between him and Trump, praising the president and talking about the need for a“support network”for him. He has also posed with alarge inflatableTrump andsaid the justices“screwed [Trump] over” by keeping a Green party candidate off the ballot in 2020 (Trump narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden that year). He has also called one of the female justices on the state supreme court “dumb as a sack of hammers” and another female justice “crazy”.TrumpendorsedSchimel on 21 March.State Democrats have made the race a referendum on Musk, putting up “people v Musk” billboards across the state and holding town halls. When the party tested messaging, it showed ads highlighting Musk’s connections to Schimel to “motivate Democrats who otherwise want to tune out politics entirely to come out, cast a ballot, and recruit their friends”, said Ben Wikler, chairman of the state Democratic party.“If Brad Schimel loses this race and Susan Crawford wins, it’ll become clear to Democrats that they can fight back against Musk and win,” said Wikler. “And it’ll be clear to Republicans that Musk may not be able to save their bacon if they keep going along with his attacks on our country. That could have a profound impact on the whole arc of American politics in this era.”The race has energized Democrats. “Back in November and December, I think a lot of people I was talking to were pretty discouraged by some of the results that they saw in the November election after having put a lot of time and energy into some of those campaigns,” Crawford said. “That has dramatically changed in the last couple of months as the administration has taken a lot of actions in a hurry that have made people really worried and concerned about the direction our country is heading.”In the weeks after Musk got involved in race, Wikler said, he saw Democrats “get up off the mat and lean into the fightback”.Even before Musk’s involvement, the high stakes of the race were clear. The court heard oral arguments in a case challenging the state’s 1849 abortion ban last year and is set to consider another one dealing with whether the state constitution protects the right to an abortion.In 2020, the state supreme court narrowly voted 4-3 to turn away a Trump lawsuit challenging his loss in the state and seeking to overturn the results.In 2023, Democrats won a major victory when the liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the court and flipped its ideological balance. Last year, the new state supreme court struck down state legislative maps, getting rid of Republican districts that were so distorted they gave Democrats no chance of ever winning a majority. Republicans went from having a near two-thirds supermajority to a slim majority in the statehouse.The next court could hear a challenge to Wisconsin’s congressional maps, in which Republicans hold six of eight seats. That balance is also considered severely askew in favor of Republicans and could ultimately help determine control of the US House, where Republicans hold a majority of just a few seats.The spending in the race has shattered the more than $50m spent in the 2023 race. Musk has spent more than $18m through America Pac and Building America’s future. The Republican mega-donor Richard Uihlein has gotten somewhat less attention, but Uihlein-aligned groups have spent at least $5.3m in favor of Schimel, funneling it through various entities, according to campaign finance records.In Wisconsin’s supreme court race, a super-rich beer family calls the shotsRead moreLynde Uihlein, a cousin of Richard Uihlein has also been a major donor to the group A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent more than $6m in the race supporting Crawford. The family members werealso on separate sidesof the 2023 state supreme court race.Robert Yablon, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted that the huge spending in the race was only possible because of the state’s loose campaign finance laws. People in Wisconsin can donate unlimited amounts to state parties, which can pass that money on to candidates. There are also very weak anti-coordination laws between independent expenditure groups and campaigns.The race, Yablon said, was a “test for judicial independence”. If Musk succeeds in winning and ultimately gets rulings favorable to him, it could undermine that perception.“You would hope that in a judicial race, you might have different candidates – maybe they have different ideologies or philosophies, different ways that they talk about the law, but it’s shared ground that they believe that the judiciary ought to operate independently from other branches, ought to check those branches,” he said.The turnout in Tuesday’s election is expected to be much lower than the turnout in the November presidential election, making it difficult to make firm conclusions about the voter reaction to Trump so far. But there still may be signals to take away from Tuesday’s contest.“If there is a strong win for Crawford, it will at least be evidence of the energy of liberals and the extent to which opposition to theTrump administration, to Elon Musk, has been effectively activated,” Yablon said. If Schimel wins, he said it “will probably be quite disheartening for liberals, for the Democratic party that’s invested so much in this race, and they may then really have to go back to the drawing board”.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinThe fight for democracyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Much of the deal’s specifics remained unclear, such as how investors may be compensated, how X’s leaders would be integrated in the new firm or the prospect of regulatory scrutiny.“This development feels surprising and somewhat unexpected,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said. “To a certain extent, it closes a chapter in the turbulent saga of X.”“The choice of $45bn is not a coincidence,” said DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria. “It is $1bn higher than the take-private transaction for Twitter in 2022” and he can share the value of the xAI business with X co-investors.Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, has alsoconsolidated his power in Washington DCby overseeing the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. That has also put him in the position to potentially influence agencies that oversee his business dealings.An investor in xAI, and now in the combined entity, told Reuters they were not surprised by the deal, viewing it as Musk consolidating his leadership and management at his own companies. The investor declined to be named.Musk did not ask investors for approval but told them that the two companies had been collaborating closely and the integration would drive deeper integrationwith Grok.Musk’s xAI startup was launched less than two years ago and recently raised $10bn in a funding round that valued the company at $75bn, according to a media report.In February, Musk, 53, made a $97.4bn bid with a consortium for the ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which was rejected, with OpenAI saying that the startup was not for sale. Musk co-founded OpenAI with CEO Sam Altman in 2015.Musk competes directly with the popular OpenAI platform and has sued in federal court in California to prevent his rival from converting from a non-profit to a for-profit business. A judge earlier this month denied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the changeover.The wide release of AI software has set off a flurry of investment and competition in Silicon Valley. In an effort to be more efficient, companies are seeking ways to integrate the software into nearly every part of their operations.As competition in AI intensifies, xAI has been ramping up its data centre capacity to train more advanced models, and its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus, is touted as the largest in the world.xAI introduced Grok-3, the latest iteration of its chatbot, in February, as it tries to compete with Chinese AI firm DeepSeek and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. The X platform can serve to further distribute xAI products, while also providing a real-time feed of users’ musings, screenshots and other data.Muskclinched a deal in 2022 to buy X, then Twitter, for $44bn, ending its run as a public company since its 2013 initial public offering, declaring that “the bird is freed” once the acquisition closed.He gutted the company’s workforce after the acquisition, prompting advertisers to flee the platform and a rapid decline in revenue. Recently, brands have been returning to X as Musk’s influence grows in the Trump administration.The seven banks that extended $13bn in loans to Musk to buy X kept the debt on their books for two years until they could sell it all at once last month, according to a source familiar with the transactions.This was made possible after a surge in investor interest for exposure to AI companies along with X’s improved operating performance over the previous two quarters, among other factors, according to two people familiar with the matter.After the merger, investors who bought the debt from the banks will profit, said Espen Robak, founder of Pluris Valuation Advisors, which specialises in illiquid assets. “For sure the debt is worth more now, if not fully paid off.”Separately, a US judge on Friday rejected a bid by Musk to dismiss a lawsuit claiming he had defrauded former Twitter shareholders by waiting too long to disclose his initial investment in the company.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskXnewsShareReuse this content"

Tebbutt was shot dead. His wife was taken into Somalia andreleased following a ransom payment six months later.View image in fullscreenJudith Tebbutt spent six months as a hostage in Kenya. She believed Kololo had been scapegoated by Scotland Yard detectives.Photograph: APKololo, who is now in his mid-40s, is seeking compensation from the Met, accusing the force of providing misleading evidence to a Kenyan court that played a key role in his wrongful conviction. The first stage of the case will be heard at the Central London county court on Friday.Emails seen by theObserverreveal that theHome Officeauthorised the deployment of Met police officers to Kenya despite knowing the case could result in the death penalty.Reprieve, a legal charity representing Kololo, said the decision violated government rules against providing assistance that “might directly or significantly contribute to ... use of the death penalty, both the imposition of the death sentence and executions”.Preetha Gopalan, Reprieve’s head of UK litigation, said a series of emails between the Home Office and Foreign Office, released after a subject access request, showed a “level of panic” about Kololo having been sentenced to death for the offence of robbery with violence.Kololo, a young father who worked as a honey-gatherer and woodcutter on the island where the Tebbutts were holidaying, was accused of directing the gang behind the attack to a hut where the couple were sleeping.Judith Tebbutt later told theSunday Timesshe believed that Kololo was innocent and had been scapegoated by Scotland Yard. Kololo’s lawyers have accused former detective chief inspector Neil Hibberd, who has retired, of omitting key information that cast doubt on the prosecution’s allegations that a footprint linked Kololo to the crime scene.Reprieve said a Kenyan court was not told that the Met Police’s analysis of a partially washed-away imprint on a sandy beach had been inconclusive. Kololo did not fit a pair of shoes presented as a match for the footprint during his trial, and said he was barefoot on the day in question.Gopalan said the Met’s support for the prosecution and Hibberd’s evidence in court was “the nail in the coffin to secure the conviction”. She added: “His conviction rested heavily on the footprint, but the whole time, the Met had analysis that undermined the evidence.”An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that Hibberd would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct if he were still a serving officer, but that it could take no action after his retirement.Emails released by the Home Office to Reprieve also show that officials were warned in 2012 that “the death penalty remains on Kenya’s statute books and may be available for one of the offences”, but went on to authorise the Met deployment for the case.“The death penalty was mandatory for this offence,” Gopalan said. She added that there was a moratorium on executions in Kenya at the time, but this was “not a sufficient assurance”.The Foreign Office advised the Home Office that it would “not be seeking explicit assurances on the use of the death penalty from Kenyan authorities” because the moratorium made it a “low risk”.Gopalan said Kololo’s trial had also been structurally unfair because he did not have legal representation and had to cross-examine 20 witnesses, including Hibberd, himself. He was illiterate and did not have an interpreter for proceedings that were not conducted in his first language.View image in fullscreenAli Kololo with his sisters after his conviction was quashed.Photograph: ReprieveKololo said in a statement via Reprieve: “Being sentenced to death was torture in itself. It’s by sheer luck that I was able to come out of prison with my mind intact. I pray for my case to succeed so that I can live like other human beings.“I used to work hard to look after my family but my time in prison has left a big gap, which is very difficult to fill. My health has deteriorated and I cannot go back to doing the work I used to do. I have to struggle to provide for my children and look after my mother.”Gopalan said the Metropolitan police should “put its hands up” over the case, apologise and pay appropriate compensation. “[Kololo] is lucky to be free and to be able to mount a claim, but the question remains: is this still happening?” she said.“Is the UK government continuing to provide this kind of assistance to countries around the world and becoming complicit in human rights violations because they haven’t learned the lessons from the past?”Home Office minister Diana Johnson said last week: “Under Section 26 of the Police Act 1996, the Home Secretary is responsible for providing consent for the deployment of all serving police officers and staff from England and Wales forces overseas and where advice or assistance is being provided to a foreign agency. The Section 26 process is a rigorous process undertaken by officials ... exercising due diligence on any proposed police deployments, including that assistance overseas meets the UK’s human rights obligations and values.”The Metropolitan police said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsKenyaThe ObserverMetropolitan policeHome OfficeAfricaPoliceTrial by juryCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Either way, it’s some pretty trenchant visual messaging: whatever society wants to do with middle-aged women, Christie is done with it.It was also a chance for the 53-year-old to dress up as Kate Bush, recreating her 1978 shoot by Gered Mankowitz. And Christie loves dressing up. She did a whole show dressed as Charles II. The actor, writer and comedian is playful: she has way more than the usual number of funny facial expressions; her chat is peppered with silly, surreal ­diversions. Making people laugh is her thing, she says. “It motivates me, it helps me navigate the world, it’s like a drug.”Also her thing? Shaking injustice like a snow globe, and saying, “Guys, guys – there’s a better way to do this.” There was her 2013 Edinburgh comedy award-winning showA Bic for Her, in which she skewered everything from the marketing of a pastel-coloured Biro to the geopolitical significance of violence against women. Her first Radio 4 series,Bridget Christie Minds the Gap, was silly but very much about feminism. Her ­second,Utopia, in 2018, took on all the crushing events of the world, from Brexit to Kim Jong-un to the climate crisis.Now, she has found a home on Channel 4 with The Change, her Bafta-nominated comedy drama. It’s about menopause – women in midlife, raging against the machine, sloughing off their domestic servitude – and centred on long-married Linda, played by Christie, clawing back the millions of minutes she has spent doing drudge work for others. The scenarios are within the envelope of regular sitcom, but the execution has an almost fairytale surrealism – as Christie describes, “it’s like science fiction, magic realism, a western, a comedy, a tragedy”. The second season opens on a menopause joke: Linda, in the middle of a rousing speech on self-empowerment, forgets a word. It’s a simple one, but important; nothing else will do. The word is “log”.“There are so many words, aren’t there?” Christie says, having forgotten a word today. “Too many. It’s the nouns!”We meet in a cafe in Stoke Newington, London, where she has lived for most of her adult life. She is warm and relaxed, but unobtrusive, softly spoken. We have bumped into each other before, doing feminism about the place, and I’ve always been struck by a quality she has, as if she’s fighting shyness, doesn’t really want any of the limelight, but she’s going to make this remark anyway, because it’s funny.We reduce women’s experiences to a set of biological processes – puberty,  childbirth, menopause. Guys don’t have thisLinda isn’t Christie. “I’ve lived an incredibly privileged life. Bloody drama school! Doing standup!” she says. There are similarities, though. Christie, fine-boned and ethereal, with the enchanted curly hair of the pre-Raphaelite sisterhood, even dresses a lot like Linda, in a waxy outdoor jacket and vividly colourful leggings: random and ready for anything, from yoga to living off-grid. She also shares Linda’s core quality, which is not – contrary to all the shorthand around this show – “being menopausal”. It’s that will to amuse. “From my earliest memory, I would pursue that to the end of the Earth,” she says.Christie was born in 1971 – the last of nine (!) c­hildren to two originally Irish parents, who had met in London and then moved to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, when her dad got a job with Wall’s ice-cream. She says her siblings are “all really clever, really great”. Only she and one sister, Annie, went into the creative industries; a couple of her brothers went to polytechnic, a couple joined the RAF. She remembers one time, early in primary school, enjoying the lessons: “We did a class which was about expression or something. ‘What are you feeling?’ I remember her talking to us like we were human beings. And thinking, ‘I’m feeling happy because the sun’s coming through, I can see the dust on the light, and there’s a big old telly here. I remember looking at my skirt, thinking, ‘I love this lesson.’ Then I remember education getting colder as I got older.” She left school at 15 with no qualifications, shaped more by the landscape around her in the Forest of Dean than her teachers.The Change is set in this same eccentric pocket of woodland. “No one’s done up. The vehicles we use – there’s an old Chevy, there’s a Triumph. They could only be in the forest, and I felt like I was recreating a world that I’m trying to get back to.”The Change series two trailer – videoWhile Christie was certain about where the show would be set, she had reservations about centring it around menopause, which a lot of us in the 50s age bracket would, I think, agree with. “We’re always reducing women’s experiences to a set of biological processes – puberty, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause. Guys don’t have this.” And yet, “100% of humans will at some point be affected by it. You’re going to be living with somebody who’s menopausal – your wife or your sister, everyone knows someone. So the fact that it was so invisible, I found annoying. I also found the lack of shows about older people’s experiences very annoying, because older people are just much more interesting, on the whole.”But it’s not about hormones, or brain fog, and nor is it really about that buildup of marital and social resentment, even while chores – who does them, how they get done, who wishes they could live their lives again and never have shaken the crumbs out of a toaster – loom large. “I do see women’s time, a lot of it goes to nothing. Nobody sees us, we don’t get awards, nobody thanks us. It’s tricky, because I’m a comedian, and I don’t want to make anything that’s worthy. But I did really want to say, ‘I know what you’ve been doing, andI’mthanking you.’”Really, it’s about menopause as a retaking of destiny; imagine if, for whatever reason – call it hormones, call it wisdom – you were to stop clearing up after others, stop biting your tongue. What would that be like?Step one of rejecting domestic servitude is, of course, leaving your husband, which Linda does at the start of the first season, and it wasn’t lost on critics on its release in 2023 that Christie must have been writing it at roughly the same time as she was getting divorced in real life. She and Stewart Lee weren’t like the Posh and Becks of standup, in so far as they never noticeably leveraged each other’s success or fame to create a kind of comic super-unit. But it was unusual for the comedy circuit to have a Mr and Mrs, both successfully gigging. They separated during the pandemic after being married for 15years, and have two children together, 14 and 18.James Acaster asked what I would say to someone I fancied. I said: ‘Hello, you have piqued my interest.’ He said: ‘Under no circumstances say that’In the show, Linda and her husband, Steve – played with tremendous subtlety masquerading as unsubtlety by Omid Djalili – stay together. “I wanted for it to not be anything to do with Steve, really, or to be a love story. It’s not about that. It’s about her relationship with herself, that human experience of finding yourself. I think losing yourself is a very common experience, regardless of age, gender or sexuality, or anything like that. You can be a teenager and not know who you are. You can not know at any age.” All that said, being in your 50s, “it’s a lot”, she ventures. “Being our age, kids leaving home, getting divorced, being single, coping with changes to your body. It’s quite a lot.”The empty nest is slowly creeping up for Christie. She took her oldest to look around a university recently. “He went to a talk, I just sat and had a coffee, and I was so excited for his life. And then I remembered being 18, and I felt melancholy. I thought, ‘That is over for me now.’ But then I stopped myself, because, no, it isn’t. You can be excited for yourself as well.”The thing she fears most about getting older isn’t physically ageing, “although that’s inconvenient. It’s ageing mentally, it’s getting stuck, and a little bit sour. I don’t want to have an old brain. I  remember my dad saying he always felt so young because he was always around young children.” Her parents started having children when they were 18, and would have been looking after at least a couple, sometimes a large number, of tiny ones, for the next 17 years. Plainly, Christie’s plan to keep mentally agile can’t involve having seven more children, so I suggest instead that she take a young lover. Her answer starts off highly reasonable, very mature. “I’m really in a great place. I’m at this age now where I don’t need a life partner, I don’t need to have more children, I’ve got my job, so, whoever it is, it would have to be good. My heart is full. I am open to it, but I’m not looking for it.”Then she starts to recreate an impromptu romance workshop that erupted at a friend’s wedding recently, when she mentioned she hadn’t been on a date in years. “A bunch of people were there –Daniel Kitson,James Acaster,Nish Kumar, Josie Long. James said, ‘Tell us what you would do if someone here took your fancy.’ And I said, ‘OK. I would go up and say, “Hello. You have piqued my interest.”’ He said, ‘Under no circumstances must you say that.’ And I said, ‘Why not? They will have done – they will havepiquedmyinterest.’ And he said, ‘Just go up to someone and say, “Would you like to go to a hotel and have sex?”’ What? No! How depressing. That’s the most horrific scenario. Is that what young people do?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon Webb/The GuardianShe doesn’t fancy the apps (with the caveat that some of her best friends met a spouse online). “I’ve heard it’s brutal. Attraction is about chemistry. You can’t get it from ‘Here is a series of things that this person is into. This is what this person looks like.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I really do believe that you’ve got to try and keep something for yourself when you’re in a relationship, try and retain who you are as much as possible. Because we are all alone. I might head off for a walk at the weekend, on my own. And that’s a great scenario – alone with my thoughts and in nature.”She has realised, she says, that being at ease with solitude is fundamental to being a sorted person, and being a sorted person is fundamental to being a good partner. “Easier said than done, I know, but if you’re coming in to a relationship, at this age, you should be bringing your sorted self.” She takes a breath. “Do you want my complete relationship history?” she says, and why not, yes I do. “I had the same boyfriend from 15 to 23, that was the biker. We bought a house when I was 18, we went to music festivals, we rode to the Welsh mountains, we rode to France. Do you like France?” Why, yes, I do. “I was single between 23 and 28 – that’s a good chunk, isn’t it?” These were the drama school years. After a few white lies (about her age – 15 –and her qualifications – which were zero), she got her first job as an editorial assistant at the Gloucester Citizen, but walked out because the editor asked her to get him a McDonald’s without saying please. In her early 20s, she got a grant from the council to study drama, but couldn’t afford it even with that, so applied for and won a scholarship to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, in London. “Then, I graduated. And from 26 to 50, when I cast myself as Linda, I did not get a single acting job.”Sometimes I’m being announced on stage, and I’ll not have a single idea about what I’m going to sayShe thinks it was partly because, “I don’t know whether this is an affliction or a curse, but my brain automatically goes to the funny side. It sounds like I’m having some sort of episode, but I just feel so happy to be alive, and grateful, and I really enjoy everything. So in an audition scenario, if there’s a room full of people staring at me, and I’ve not got a very good script, I will laugh.” Her agent had to explain to her at one point that it wasn’t her job to internalise bad writing; her job was to make it good.View image in fullscreenChristie performing her award-winning A Bic for Her show at Edinburgh in 2013.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianThere are also a lot of unspoken class barriers in the creative industries – she thinks that’s got worse, not better. “The way the arts now are, it’s a pretty closed shop. If I were starting today, from my background, forget it. Unless you’re really well connected, there’s no way in.” Even in the 90s “at drama school, people said to me, ‘Network, network, network; because in this industry, it’s pretty much who you know.’ And I said, ‘I absolutely refuse to believe that.’ And I didn’t network, and I didn’t get any work.” She sounds simultaneously mock aghast at life and low-key amused by her own naivety.The Change series two review – Bridget Christie’s glorious feminist sitcom will leave you ecstaticRead moreA Bic for Her, her breakthrough standup show, came out of one she did the previous year called War Donkey, 2012, in Edinburgh – broadly speaking, it was about the state of the world. It didn’t flop, but “I got a lot of shit”, she remembers, for talking about feminism. “A lot of, ‘She’s funny, but what a shame she has to be banging on about this.’ And that annoyed me. I felt like I was being criticised for subject matter, and I don’t think that’s right. You can write about anything – you should be criticised on whether it worked or not. It was only 10 minutes of that set, and I said, ‘I’m going to come back next year, and I’m going to do feminism for an hour. If they don’t like it for 10 minutes, let’s see how they like it for an hour.’”It’s quite strange, looking back to that time, when a lot of culture foreshadowed the #MeToo movement –Laura Bates’s Everyday Sexism, first as a hive-mind project, then as a book;Caitlin Moran’s How to Be a Woman– but there were still so many prescriptions about where feminism belonged and where it didn’t. Fine in a lecture hall, ladies, but don’t bring your hectoring out to the pub where people are trying to enjoy themselves. I saw A Bic for Her when it transferred to London, and was surprised by how wide of the mark, how completely undescriptive, the reviews were. Like it or hate it, they mainly dealt in the topic: pastel pens “for her”; violence against women in Afghanistan – were these good subjects for comedy? None of that really captured the playfulness and surrealism, the physicality of Christie’s routine. Nevertheless, it marked a new level of recognition, and, from this point, she was in regular meetings with TV producers, batting around ideas that would eventually become The Change.Standup, though, is the work Christie still wants to be doing in her 80s. Describing the circuit in London, especially when she was starting out, in her 30s, she makes the mechanics of it sound stressful and lonely. “I’d be travelling to gigs, and look through windows at people having dinner, or going out to the cinema. I don’t get nervous any more, but for years, at five o’clock, the adrenaline would start. Especially if I was doing new material. And the kids were little. I’d think: ‘What time’s the babysitter coming?’”View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Neusa Neves using Nars and Fenty beauty. Clothes, Christie’s own.Photograph: Simon Webb/The GuardianBut, in the end, if your life’s purpose is making people laugh, that’s the best place for it: in a room full of people. “Sometimes, I’ll be being announced, and I’ll not have a single idea about what I’m going to say, for 40 minutes, or two hours. And then you start speaking, and it’s automatic, it’s like muscle memory. It’s the most extraordinary thing. The more relaxed you are, the better, because you’re just so free. And you’re not afraid of anything. You can go wherever you like.”A lot of Christie’s words, on the page, look slightly melancholy, but the effect she creates in person is the absolute opposite of that – she’s someone who believes the fates have delivered her to exactly where she was meant to be, liberated from gnawing, nonsense anxieties, alive to the possibilities of the future. I  wonder if this might be the last taboo of menopause discourse. What if it was actually a change for the better?The second series of Bridget Christie’s The Change is out now on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsBridget ChristieComedyTV comedyTelevisionWomenMenopauseFeminisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

The duo discuss trying to understand a cultural icon – and how to nailthatvoiceSat 29 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTShareSandringham Road lies in the east of Cardiff; a quiet run of Edwardian terrace houses overlooking Roath Mill Gardens. On a late July day, when the air is warm and the park spills out over its railings, Toby Jones and Harry Lawtey sit on the pavement, wearing matching striped pyjamas. The pair are some way into the filming of Mr Burton, an account of the early life ofRichard Burton. Lawtey plays the actor in his younger years, when he was known as Richard Jenkins, and Jones is Philip Burton, the teacher who fostered his young student’s talent. So close would their bond grow that Jenkins would become Burton’s legal ward and take his surname. “Without Philip Burton there would never have been a Richard Burton,” Elizabeth Taylor once wrote. “That great rolling voice that cracked like wild Atlantic waves would never have been heard outside the valley.”Having starred in three series of theHBO drama Industryas an Oxford graduate from a working-class Welsh background – much as Burton himself had been – Lawtey makes a smart casting. He is, too, a young star in ascendance, diligent and eager to learn, in touch with the thrill of his own potential.Jones, meanwhile, wears his status as one of the country’s finest actors with a kind of gentleness. His work across three decades, from Mike Leigh’s Naked to Marvel’s Captain America, viaUncle VanyaandDetectorists, has shown him to be an actor of both instinct and intellect, meticulous and nuanced, and beautiful to watch. His 2024 role as Alan Bates in ITV’s crusading dramaMr Bates vs the Post Officeraised his profile considerably; playing the wrongfully convicted post office operator with muted heroism. He brings a similar quiet determination to the role of Philip Burton, a man whose own trajectory as a scriptwriter and actor took some time to gather pace, and who invested heavily in the talents of his young charge.View image in fullscreenAll set … Lesley Manville as Ma Smith in Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThere’s a tenderness between the pair as they sit on their folding chairs in the sunshine today. An echo of that Jenkins and Burton dynamic, perhaps, but also the particular magnetism of two actors in the draw of creating something together. This morning they are shooting an interior scene. A house on Sandringham Road has been repurposed as 6 Connaught Street, Port Talbot, where Philip Burton lodged while teaching English at the nearby secondary school, and where Richard, too, would come to live. The crew – complete with cameras, microphones, director and producer – have crammed into a small bedroom, crouching behind the bed and pressed up beside wardrobes.‘There’s are times where I, an Englishman, am playing a Welshman, doing an English accent badly’Harry LawteyIt is a delicate scene, but crucial. Opening with Richard discovering that his teacher has submitted a play to a theatrical agent and been rejected, it is the point in the film when the balance in the pair’s relationship shifts – the mentee now bolstering his mentor. It ends with Richard standing in the doorway, delivering the prologue from Henry V – a performance only slightly undermined by the fact he is wearing his nightclothes.It is hard to overestimate the importance of Richard Burton in Welsh culture. A miner’s son from the Afan valley who became one of the best-known actors in the world, his name is given to the theatre at the Royal Welsh College of Music andDramain Cardiff, while the Richard Burton Archives, including his personal diaries, are housed at Swansea University. In Port Talbot, where Burton appeared in some of his earliest school productions, there is a monument featuring a poem the actor wrote about his childhood in Wales (“The mountain earth feels damp against my hand …” it begins).Still, even before his death in 1984, the myth of Burton had perhaps come to eclipse the extraordinary truth of both his talent and his story. His gift has been boiled down to a kind of theatrical caricature of his voice, and he is arguably remembered as much for the two marriages to Elizabeth Taylor, the lavish spending, the heavy drinking, as for histurn as Hamlet. As he himself once put it: “The public is not interested much in me as an actor. It is interested in the diabolically famous Richard Burton.”‘It has felt so bizarre’: Industry’s Harry Lawtey on coping with sudden fameRead more“Richard Burton existed more as a cultural icon to us in Wales, not really as a familiar actor,” agrees Mr Burton’s director, Marc Evans. “He had the same sort of allure as, say, a George Best. But whereas the genius of Best was easily visible, the work of Burton was not much known to me or much seen by my generation. I didn’t grow up knowing his work and his genius is elusive on film. You have to look for it in dark corners. It was the voice we knew and felt we owned.”In fact, the Mr Burton project began with the voice. The script is a collaboration between the Welsh writer Tom Bullough and Josh Hyams, producer of the long-running seriesThe Trip, starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Hyams had grown accustomed to Brydon, from Baglan, near Port Talbot, slipping into an impression of Burton, his voice suddenly falling bone-deep and rich. “It made me think about how wonderful a voice it is,” Hyams says. “I went back and listened to the legendary recordings of Richard – particularly Under Milk Wood, and to watch his films. When I read about his background, what I learned was a real surprise.”View image in fullscreenMade in Wales … Toby Jones as Philip Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianWhen he was interviewed by Michael Parkinson in 1974, Burton spoke of his voice. “It is the deep dark answer from the valleys to everybody,” he said. “I can’t help the voice, it’s part of me, I didn’t cultivate it or anything, it was given to me.” In many ways, Mr Burton is the story that gives the lie to the actor’s own account of this voice – telling of its cultivation by the young Jenkins and its gift by Philip Burton.When Marc Evans approached Jones about the role, the development of the voice was an aspect of Burton’s story that appealed. “What spoke to me was that tradition of actors learning to lose their accent,” he says. “My father [the actor Freddie Jones] had to lose his voice from the Potteries, and he did it through learning tracts of poetry, for the sheer love, the romantic bewitching of the words.”Philip Burton developed various ways to encourage the projection and resonance of Richard’s voice – most notably by practising on Margam Mountain, near Port Talbot. For the role, Jones drew on his own experiences of working with Penny Dyer, who has been his voice coach throughout his career. “In a way, the voice coach for you is the one whose analogies you respond to in the mouth and in the body,” he says.View image in fullscreenPyjama game … Jones and Lawtey on the Cardiff set of Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe body is particularly important to Jones, who attended the Jacques Lecoq school of physical theatre in Paris. “I learned that if you can’t tell a story with your body, then words become necessary,” he says. In Mr Burton, it brings an interesting tension – a character concerned with the cultivation of a voice, played by an actor who speaks primarily with the body.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Even when I get to what would be recognised as an RP accent, that still can’t sound like me. It would have to sound detached from me, because it’s Richard. And Richard’s voice is just entirely bespoke.”Lawtey, too, worked with a voice coach, and watched hours of footage of Burton. “I started at the end of his career, and moved back to his earliest work, because I thought the earlier work would be most pertinent, and that’s where I wanted to come in to land,” he says. “I really did do a deep dive. Every now and then someone will send me a YouTube clip of Burton, as if I haven’t seen every single one.”View image in fullscreenSword play … Harry Lawtey as Richard Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBy his own account, Lawtey had become “mildly obsessed” with Burton after seeingJack Thorne’s The Motive and the Cuetowards the end of 2023. The play revolves round a 1964 production of Hamlet starring Burton and directed by John Gielgud, and Lawtey sought out footage of the original production on YouTube. “The technique is so strident but grounded,” he says. “You can tell he’s playing jazz with it. Maybe jazz meets punk.”About a month later, by sheer coincidence, Lawtey was sent a speculative script for Mr Burton. “It said it was about someone called Richard Jenkins,” he says. “And I didn’t know that was Richard Burton until about halfway through. I just thought it was this lovely madeup story about this young Welsh kid who wanted to be an actor.”When he won the part, he embarked upon what he describes as “an incredible fact-finding mission, which was pretty comprehensive on my part, and to be honest just a joy. There’s a burden of responsibility in doing something like this, which I certainly felt, but I relished it. I loved learning about him.” He describes Burton’s diaries as “my north star in terms of getting to know him and feeling familiar and close to him”.Gradually, Burton shifted in Lawtey’s imagination from a name with which he was familiar into someone with whom he felt great kinship, and an actor he found compelling and inspiring. “There were times I would watch Richard’s work in preparation for this film where I just got it,” he says. “It just feels like he’s burning on screen. Like there’s this presence or aura or light round him, and he’s so invigorating and propulsive and aggressive but also vulnerable at the same time.”View image in fullscreenBackstage pass … behind the scenes of Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe following morning, the film crew have relocated to St Augustine’s in Rumney, dressing the church hall to replicate Port Talbot YMCA, where Philip Burton would direct amateur productions, and where Richard first performed on stage. The room is cool and dimly lit, a respite from the day’s heat. Outside, in their heavy suits and tea dresses, the extras prowl the gardens, trying to find shade.Watching today is Kate Burton, Richard Burton’s daughter, also an actor. To see Lawtey playing her father as a young man has been “an out-of-body experience”, she says. Hitherto, she has avoided dramatisations of Burton’s life, but this production felt different. “I was intrigued about this one because the story focused on Dad as a very young man, and Grandpa” – as she refers to Philip Burton – “coming into his life,” she says. “I thought that was such an important story, and integral to Dad becoming Dad.”Beyond the green velvet curtains, the extras fall quiet, the children cease fidgeting and a stillness settles over the hall. Lawtey, in Jenkins’ role as a convict, takes to the stage wearing a ragged overcoat. He has stage-paint daubed across his face to resemble dirt, and he wields a wooden knife. “If you call out, you are a dead man!” His opening line is delivered with unexpected fervour, but slowly he finds his pitch; force becomes desperation, his words grow real and resonant. “I have a wolf inside me,” he says, “tearing at my entrails, tearing me apart …” From the wings, Jones’s Mr Burton looks on; a small man, tightly held. But as his student speaks, something in him seems to give way; across his face moves revelation, wonder, pride. He lifts his eyes, meets his student’s gaze, and gives an almost imperceptible nod.Mr Burton is in cinemas from4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsToby JonesRichard BurtonDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2009, he moved to Berlin, the setting of his fourth novel,Perfection, currently longlisted (in Sophie Hughes’s translation) for the International Booker prize. Ecstatically reviewed, it updates Georges Perec’s 1965 novelThings: A Story of the Sixties, about advertising’s impact on an aspirational young French couple, recast by Latronico as expat digital creatives whose first reflex “if they spilled some coffee... was to press Command-Z” to undo it. Speaking from Milan, his home again since 2023, Latronico laughs when I quote the line: “That happens to me all the time!”Why did you want to rewrite Perec’sThings?It was almost a way to keep my mental health in lockdown. I thought: “OK, you’re not managing to write anything creative, so just pedantically rewrite Perec.” It took on a life of its own but began as an exercise in keeping busy. I’d been struggling for years to capture the way our inner life is shaped by the flow of images we see online. My sexuality is defined by images I’ve seen of how people have sex; my apartment is defined by images of other people’s apartments... I readThingsand immediately saw parallels. Perec was trying to describe the life of someone whose identity is defined by their relationship to objects. He flipped the hierarchy of a traditional novel by putting his characters in the background; the detail of their surroundings becomes the main stage, which was exactly what I needed.I didn’t want to write a smug satire about the superficiality of millennial life – it’s my life!What attracted you to writing in such an impassive style?I was trained by reviewing for the art magazineFrieze. I’d be giving my opinion on works of art and my editor would say: “No: describe the pieces in detail and make your opinion transpire from the way you describe them.” Ultimately, that aligned with my way of writing. I have a terrible ear for dialogue and can never quote verbatim what somebody said, even at important moments of my life. But I memorise details of clothing immediately; description, more than dialogue, resonates with what seems salient to me in the world.How did you strike a balance between satire and sympathy?I’d never claim I’ve done anything better than Perec, but he clearly judges his characters as fools brainwashed by consumerism. I didn’t want a smug satire about the superficiality of millennial life – it’s my life! The chapter that most closely represents my thinking is the one about sex. Anna and Tom have passionate sex, even after 10 years, but they’re afraid it isn’t enough. This is the “extension of the domain of struggle”Michel Houellebecqrefers to in the title of his first novel [translated into English asWhatever]. Once you start saying: “This aspect of my life could be optimised,” it immediately isn’t enough, because anything can be “better” by some definition. This also happened to me with food. In the past, you’d make some pasta, a salad, and that’d be it. Then it became: “It shouldn’t only be healthy, but also look good.” Once something enters the domain of optimisation, there’s no turning back.Was the book as rapturously received in Italy?Within a month in the UK, it’s sold as many copies as in three years in Italy [laughs]. Italian literature looks more to the past. People felt the novel wasn’t something that spoke about everyday life but was instead an exotic document of something that happens elsewhere.What first got you into writing?Playing Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. I wrote heaps of fantasy and basically taught myself English to understand Magic: The Gathering.You’ve translatedF Scott Fitzgerald and Isaac Asimov,among many other writers. Has your work as a translator shaped your fiction?The effort to inhabit the way somebody else uses language widens the boundaries of what you think is possible. Being a translator is like hosting a writer literally within your own voice; when the guest leaves, they maybe leave a pair of shoes behind and you start wearing them.What’s Italy like as a place to write?When I left for Berlin, it was a different universe; now there’s a thriving community of writers my age and younger. In Berlin, I was part of an international community of writers but almost nobody could read one another. We spoke in German or English but the Germans couldn’t read my books and the Americans couldn’t read my books or the Germans’ books. We’d talk aboutSheila Hetior Rachel Cusk but not about what we were doing. It’s part of the reason I moved back.Tell us what you read growing up.Comic books, obsessively. I listened to the albumTales of Mystery and Imaginationby the Alan Parsons Project because it was referenced in a series I loved, [Battle Angel]Alita. When I realised the album was based on a book by Edgar Allan Poe, I got it out of the library - probably the first book I read that school hadn’t forced me to. I remember so clearly the afternoon I read The Cask of Amontillado; I could feel my heart beating from the tension.What was the last novel you enjoyed?In Ascensionby Martin MacInnes. I’ll definitely write science fiction one day but I’m not ready yet.How come you left Italy for Berlin in the first place?Out of sadness; I was tired of politics. My first novel [Ginnastica e rivoluzione, 2008] was about the G8 in Genoa in 2001,one of the biggest demos in Italy’s history, which got nothing, except thata kid was killed by police. It showed the inefficacy of a way of doing politics that had started in the 60s. In the 00s, I was part of a collective in Milan that squatted a building to organise many activities: an after-school club, community gardening, free meals with leftovers from food markets, a collaborative gallery involving local schools and artists. It was an early anti-gentrification fight; of course, we lost. If you Google Milan, the luxury skyscrapers you see with the forest on top [theBosco Verticale] were built on our building. After we got evicted, I wanted to move somewhere where I was no longer a citizen, where I had no stake and couldn’t fight for anything but just care about my own business. I’m not proud of that.Perfectionis the story of two people sheltering themselves from the real world, whatever that is.Perfectionby Vincenzo Latronico, translated by Sophie Hughes, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

Not just a guarantee of intelligent content delivered succinctly and with style, but a host who’s at once establishment and outsider. His eminent career – hostingQuestion Timeand general elections, as well as commentating on royal jubilees and state funerals – means he is intrinsically connected to Britishnessandholding Britishness to account.His new Radio 4 series,Invisible Hands, unpicks a real establishment fundamental: capitalism and the free markets. Many people in Britain – me included, and I’m hardly a spring chicken – can barely remember a time when this country wasn’t in thrall to the idea that the best way to run an economy is by handing power to a market where everything – strappy sandals, war weapons, water supplies – is up for sale.The series starts with Antony Fisher, a second world war RAF pilot who took up farming after 1945. There’s a touch of Jon Ronson in picking Fisher: the pinpointing of a flapping butterfly event that cascades into a future that could never be imagined. Here, the flap is to do with Fisher’s frustration with the postwar Attlee government and its meddling in everything. “The heavy hand of state,” says Dimbleby. “Government bodies with dreary bureaucratic names like the Milk Marketing Board and the Egg Marketing Board.” At some point Fisher reads aReader’s Digestarticle by Prof Friedrich Hayek, in which Hayek argued that the government’s micromanagement of the economy was actually “pretty well what the Nazis had proposed”, and actually what the allies had been fighting against. A light goes on in Fisher’s head. The butterfly flaps its wings.By the end of episode one, Fisher is in the US at a competition called the Chicken of Tomorrow(!) and everything is about to change.Invisible Handscovers a lot of ground, but it’s well paced, and Dimbleby makes it all enjoyable and easy to understand. Politics students may be familiar with the Fisher story but I didn’t know it, and the programme is an engaging way to learn how the Chicken of Tomorrow became the State of Today.Also on Radio 4 last week, Elbow’s Guy Garvey, the warm and eloquent 6 Music presenter, hosted an episode of the excellent seriesArtworks. The subject was British pop group Talk Talk and, specifically, their 1988 albumSpirit of Eden: a great work, completely at odds with the times.Garvey is a romantic, and he clearly delights in the bucketful of romantic tropes in this tale.Mark Hollis, Talk Talk’s leader, was a musical genius unaffected by (capitalist) dreams of fame and fortune. After three albums, as stardom beckoned, he turned left; made a deliberate retreat from the commercial in favour of art.Spirit of Edentook nine months to make and was done in the literal and metaphorical dark. Every note had to be spontaneous, insisted Hollis, who kept the bad guys (the record company) at bay by simply locking them out.View image in fullscreenTalk Talk’s Lee Harris, Mark Hollis and Paul Webb, 1984.Photograph: AlamyThe result? An album so groundbreaking and out of sync that the record company had no idea how to sell it.Talk Talkbecame unmarketable, Hollis and EMI sued each other (EMI said the album was “not commercially satisfactory”: lovely use of words there) and Hollis bid a retreat. And – yep, you guessed it – almost 40 years on,Spirit of Edenis lauded as a masterpiece.It was interesting to hear the effect on Tony Wadsworth, then head of marketing at EMI, who worked his way up to become the company’s boss. “It was a great lesson that came in very useful later on with artists like Radiohead,” he said. And Hollis, a man who, outside the studio, was affable and companionable, said this: “I can’t imagine not playing music, but I don’t feel any need to record music or perform it.” A message that’s often forgotten: it’s in the doing that the delight in art is found.A couple of shows about US antiheroes for the single-minded-obsessive lovers among you. Actually, the first,White Hot Hate: Agent Pale Horse,about an undercover FBI agent called Scott Payne, reveals his very un-loner-ish approach. Though Payne is tattooed, bearded and leather-jacketed – all things that freak out many Americans – he’s a fun guy, able to make friends easily. And his look and demeanour have meant that he has been able to infiltrate neo-Nazi cabals, biker gangs, dodgy fringe groups – though always with the fear of being discovered. Payne is painted as a tattooed angel on the side of the righteous, but whether or not you enjoy this show will depend on how much you warm to his convivial but rather egotistical company.View image in fullscreenFinally, brace yourself, ladies, there’s a podcast aboutLuigi Mangione. Of course, no show can ever go deep enough on the man accused of killing the CEO of United HealthCare in December. The circumstances – and, to be honest, Mangione’s looks – trump any banal insights offered by friends and neighbours. He might have been brought up with “a strong foundation of community”, have been “a friendly, lovely young man” with “intelligence and ambition”, and had “a relentless, grinding struggle” with back pain, but that’s not really why people will listen. It’s for Mangione’s hood-up smile before he allegedly committed the murder, and for the Italian loafers (no socks) he wore while in court. Fans can never get enough of this kind of thing, it seems. Still, this four-part series has the right amount of silly schlock to keep the Luigi legend bubbling.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioPodcastsDavid DimblebyTalk TalkDigital mediaFactual radioShareReuse this content"

Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.”“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for makingNo Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”The Academy initially responded to the incident on Wednesday, but it did not refer to Ballal directly. The open letter signed by actors, producers and documentary film-makers criticised the initial statement.“We sincerely apologise to Mr Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the Academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,” the fresh statement, released on Friday, read.“We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances. It is indefensible for an organisation to recognise a film with an award in the first week of March, and then fail to defend its film-makers just a few weeks later.”It also condemned the “brutal assault and unlawful detention” of the Oscar winner.“The targeting of Ballal is not just an attack on one film-maker – it is an attack on all those who dare to bear witness and tell inconvenient truths.“We will continue to watch over this film team. Winning an Oscar has put their lives in increasing danger, and we will not mince words when the safety of fellow artists is at stake.”High-profile actors who signed the letter included Mark Ruffalo, Olivia Colman, Emma Thompson, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Joaquin Phoenix and Penelope Cruz.The incident shed light on the escalating violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers and soldiers against Palestinians in theWest Banksince the onset of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, amid threats by the far-right government of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to annex occupied Palestinian territory – an objective that could be put in reach by the administration of the US president, Donald Trump.Israeli settlers and state forces have killed at least 870 Palestinians, including 177 children, in attacks across the West Bank since the start of the latest Gaza war,according to the Palestinian ministry of health.From 7 October 2023 to 31 December 2024, at least 1,860 incidents of settler violence in the West Bank wererecorded– an average of four a day, according to data from theUnited Nationsoffice for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.Explore more on these topicsOscarsNo Other LandWest BankPalestinian territoriesAwards and prizesDocumentary filmsIsraelShareReuse this content"

My family is from Uganda and also Kenya, so the food here takes me right back. The music they play is Kenyan. The aesthetic is very familiar. They serve some really good local foods, such as ugali, a maize flour staple in a lot of east African food; nyama choma, or grilled meat; and sukuma wiki, a veg dish with sauteed greens. It has the feel of a family-run business, with really nice service. My family and I go for special occasions. I love that place.2.MusicKeys the PrinceListen to Gbe Mi De Be by Keys the Prince.I came across Keys on social media. What grabbed me was the visual aspect: it wasn’t the most flashy, but it was authentic. He creates music videos in locations that are relevant to the African community in London – for example, in material shops, where you can buy materials to tailor your own clothes with – and he does it in a really stylish way. And then the music is so easy, so relaxed, and he does a good job of infusing it with Nigerian sounds and Yoruba language. I’ve recently really been into his song Gbe Mi De Be, featuring Bxujii.View image in fullscreen3.AppR DiscoveryOnce upon a time, in order to find academic papers, you had to go to Google Scholar or sift through the library, but that’s an imperfect process, especially when, like me, you’re doing a PhD part-time. R Discovery is a tool I came across through an education influencer called Dr Amina Yonis. It streamlines that whole process. You can search by theme, by author, by field. There’s also an AI feature that allows you to listen to the audio version of a paper. It’s made my PhD journey less of a panic.4.InfluencerEly WanandaView image in fullscreenQuestions and provocations: Ely Wananda.Wananda is a YouTuber who comments on different aspects of Black British life. He’s a data scientist and I appreciate anyone in a technical job who makes an effort to demystify his field. He poses questions or provocations, such as “What’s holding back Black British businesses from success?” and “Why wealth and marriage go hand in hand”. These are topics that some of us will never tire of grappling with, and Ely approaches them with a nice conversational style. I find it easy to get material online about Black America, but the focus on Black Britain, especially from an academic perspective, is often lacking.5.TVSquid Gameseason 2View image in fullscreen‘A naked analysis of capitalism’: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game season 2.Photograph: NetflixLet’s acknowledge a crowd pleaser! I lovedSquid Gameseason one. Yes, there’s a lot of shock and gore, but I value the emotional intensity of it. It’s a thriller focusing on a series of games that participants are enticed into with the promise of money, but these games turn out to be lethal. It’s quite a naked analysis of capitalism, exploring all the ways people get into debt, and also a reflection on human behaviour. I just binged season two. It’s more of the same but with new characters and some interesting developments. I enjoyed it very much.6.YouTubeKunda and FriendsView image in fullscreen‘Particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids’: Kunda and Friends.My life at the moment is dominated by a toddler and a newborn. I usually tune out when I hear kids’ programmes, but whenever Kunda comes on, I appreciate it. First of all, it’s educational and talks your child through language, behaviour and all of that good stuff. But particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids – it’s important for my child to be able to see darker shades on TV. Songs from kids’ programmes can get annoying very quickly, but Kunda has yet to annoy me. It’s entertaining, it’s well animated – it’s just fun.Explore more on these topicsGeorge the PoetOn my radarRestaurantsInternetYouTubeFoodAppsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I buy it in bulk and rely on it to bring a voluptuous, fragrant, dairy-free creaminess to so many of my favourite dishes, from curries and dals to soups and rice dishes. It’s also indispensable for puddings for vegan friends, and for my sweet-toothed, lactose-intolerant husband.

Ideally, coconut milk should contain two ingredients: coconut milk and water. Buying a good-quality one – as opposed to one bolstered with sweeteners, emulsifiers and stabilisers – often makes the difference between a great dish and a bad one. I try to use ones with no stabilisers or emulsifiers added, such as Biona (see below) andClearspring. I also like some of the less widely available Asian brands, such asAroy-D, which, though it contains a thickening agent, has a whopping 70% coconut content, making it one of the most coconut-forward, creamiest milks on the market.The best canned coconut milkBest all-rounderEssential Waitrose coconut milkView image in fullscreen£1.15 for 400ml at Waitrose★★★☆☆A good, distinctive, nutty flavour overall, with a creamy texture and only a slight sweetness.Best splurgeBiona organic coconut milkView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 400ml at Ocado£11.95 for 6 x 400ml at Amazon★★★★★The Ferrari of coconut milks – this has 50% organic coconut, with water being the only other ingredient.

Styling: Andie RedmanKris Marshall photographed in 1979 and 2025. Later photograph: Pål Hansen. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Jolanda Coetzer. Archive image: courtesy of Kris MarshallBorn in Bath in 1973, Kris Marshall landed his first major screen role in 2000, as layabout Nick Harper in the sitcom My Family. He went on to play Colin Frissell in romcom Love Actually and joined the cast of the cosy crime drama Death in Paradise as DI Humphrey Goodman in 2013. Marshall left the show in 2017 but later reprised the role in the BBC spin-off Beyond Paradise, which returned for a third series this month.This photo was taken on Easter day and is one of my first ever memories. I was standing in the dining room of my grandparents’ house near Newark, Nottinghamshire. My dad spent 30 minutes trying to get me to sit still so he could take this picture. The moment I stopped fidgeting, my grandfather popped up behind him with a camera and said: “Click! Got it!”My little navy suit would have been made by mum. Until I was nine, she made all my clothes. There was one particular Lincoln green suit I would wear quite a bit, but deep down I craved a pair of jeans. The Marshalls were neatly turned out in general. I come from a military family – my father, uncle and grandfather flew in the RAF. This meant my father was often away for long periods of time, working abroad. Because of his career, we were quite a disciplined household. Everything changed when my parents got divorced when I was 12. The shackles were thrown off!Aged six, I was cherubic and naive. I lived in the countryside and went to a very small, rural school. There were about 90 children in total and I was not particularly worldly, even for a young child. All of which made my experience of boarding school a real baptism of fire. Being a force kid, my parents wanted me to have a base – somewhere steady so I wouldn’t have to move around if they got posted anywhere else in the world. Hence, Wells Cathedral boarding school. Suddenly I was surrounded by 700 kids. I had to find my feet fast and wise up.This all happened around the time my parents divorced, and with that loss of naivety I became a bit more rebellious, which led to me getting expelled. It wasn’t a single major incident but rather a gradual buildup of resistance against the system. Although, there was the time I hid a motorbike at the top of the rugby field in the rhododendron bushes so I could disappear to London for a weekend to visit some friends. That didn’t go down too well.My academic achievements were dwindling too. While I managed to cram all of my GSCE revision and sail through those exams, I couldn’t exactly wing my A-levels. Especially as I chose maths, economics and French.It was a classic case of pushing against the institution again and again, to the point where the school had no option but to ask me to leave. Which they did seven weeks before my final exams. My parents weren’t particularly impressed, but they quickly became supportive when they saw how serious I was about acting.I was never the kid who performed plays for the family– my sister was that sibling, and my parents did amateur dramatics. I only became aware of how much I enjoyed being on stage when my studies started to fall apart. I had romanticised the idea of being an actor, as if I was James Dean. If anything, being chucked out of school was just part of “my story”. Whenever something went wrong, I’d think: “That’s fine. It’s all good material for the autobiography!”After being expelled, I had two options: retake exams, with my tail between my legs. Or say “sod all that” and try to become an actor. The only problem was, I had no idea how to get into the industry. Instead, I worked the odd crazy job to make ends meet – doing shifts in a toothpaste factory or in the laundry of an abattoir. That one was pretty grim – the smell will never leave me. I was once fired from Iceland for wearing blue sunglasses on the till, and for a while I knocked on the doors of people who hadn’t paid their TV licences.I was serving snake bites in a bar when I met a guy who said: “You seem like a pretty stand up guy. You can’t just want to work here for the rest of your life?” After confiding my ambitions to be an actor, he said he worked in the industry and gave me a couple of numbers. I called up the first one and it was an agent based on Charing Cross Road, like something out of Withnail and I. I assumed I would get the brush off. But he got me a job at one of the last travelling rep companies – which I did for seven years, not really making any money, but touring the country putting on plays.I was tenacious in thosedays. I had a rule that I would do one small thing per day that would help towards my goal. Being an unemployed actor is not like being an unemployed musician or artist – there is no painting or song to work on, and quite easily your days could drift into months, into years. I didn’t take no for an answer either. I used to fax the National Theatre in London every week with my CV, then phone them up afterwards. They’d say: “Yes, we got your CV, you called us last week. What’s that? You’ll call again next week? Fine.” Eventually, that determination paid off. In 1997, I went from hiding under my bed from the landlord because I couldn’t pay my rent, to flying over to the Toronto film festival to promote my first lead role in a film 18 months later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Turns out, it’s just me’Read moreMy first screen job was a day’s work and a couple of scenes in a film with Jane Asher. I was absolutely over the moon – another chapter for the autobiography! However, I overslept my alarm on my first and only day of filming. It’s a cardinal sin to be late when you are shooting, never mind if you are some bit-part actor. I was absolutely mortified, but I’ve never been late since. In fact, I did a movie with Jane called Death at A Funeral about 10 years later. Thankfully, she had no recollection of the incident.The first time I got recognisedwas after I did a show called Metropolis in 2000. It was exciting enough that I was in the paper the next day, but then a guy stopped me on the street and said: “I saw you on TV last night – really good!” My feet didn’t touch the ground for days. It became more frequent after My Family – the show had 13 million viewers a week, and I would get recognised daily. Since then, it hasn’t stopped, but I don’t mind – it’s a small price to pay for what is a wonderful job.Now I’m a dad I’ve become more risk-averse, compared with the motorbike days. But I still enjoy extreme sports – sailing, surfing and throwing myself down mountains. I like to do my own stunts. Part of me never really grew up or lost that teenage sense of adventure.As for my aesthetic choices, I wouldn’t say I dress quite as smart as I did when I was six. I mainly mess around in clothes I would have worn in my 20s. Unless of course I am playing DI Humphrey Goodman, a man who wears a lot of linen. You wouldn’t catch me dead in linen.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFlashbackTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I tuck my sound gear into my backpack, clip into my cross-country skis and glide out on to a frozen lake, looking for a small ice-fishing hole.It’s a quiet day, with no snowmobiles or other skiers about. Conditions are perfect for the fishing I hope to do: not for dinner, but for sounds.I find the hole, kneel next to it and slowly feed a hydrophone – a waterproof microphone attached to a long cable – down into the slushy water. Then I press record, cover up my gear and ski away.I’ll be back in a while to see what, if anything, felt like talking.View image in fullscreenListening for Swedish fish on a frozen lake.Photograph: Amy MartinWe are living through a quiet revolution – a renaissance of listening to the more-than-human world. Scientists around the globe are increasingly setting up audio recorders in wild places and letting them run, and using the sounds they collect to learn new things about different habitats or species.It’s called “passive acoustic monitoring”, and it’s been booming over the last decade, as the cost of high-quality recording equipment has plummeted while data storage capacity has rapidly increased. The process of decoding that data is accelerating quickly too, with help from artificial intelligence. As a result, scientists have been collecting more sounds from more places than ever before, and everywhere they listen, they discover there’s more to hear.But at the same time, a counter-revolution is also underway. Humans have become very loud. After millennia of careful attunement to the life around us, many of us now move through our days, or even our entire lives, hearing almost nothing but the sounds of just one species: our own. If life on Earth were a dinner party, we would be the obnoxious guest who talks over everyone.It’s happening everywhere, but our sonic impact is especially pronounced underwater – according toone study, global shipping noise is doubling every 11 years, causing measurable damage todolphins,whalesand other creatures. Noise pollution hasnegative effects on human healthtoo – not only physically, but mentally. It doesn’t feel good to feed exclusively on our own human dramas, and yet when those stories feel extra chaotic and scary, it’s even harder to turn away from them and take in the voices of our planet-mates.For the last two years, I’ve been exploring the crossroads of these two opposing trends for my podcast,Threshold. I’ve talked to dozens of people who are devoting their lives to listening to creatures like dolphins, elephants and other famously soniferous beasts. But I’ve also been introduced to some of our planet’s less-listened-to and perhaps harder-to-love beings, three of which I profile here.Through them, I’ve begun to wake up to how many conversations are happening around me all the time that I can’t hear, or failed to pay attention to.Like between fish, for instance. Yes, fish talk. In fact, they’re surprisingly chatty.Single unknown callAn unknown call by a type of spadefish, recorded in 2016.

It’s dark. You need a way to be able to talk to each other and work out where you are. And sound travels very well in water,” says Miles Parsons, an underwater acoustics researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. As a result, “virtually all animals underwater, whether it’s freshwater, brackish or marine, use sound as their main sensory modality”.Parsons and other scientists have recorded a wide range of fish sounds, which they give fun names like sneaks, unks, snorts and boops. “There are an amazing variety of different sounds that are absolutely fantastic,” he says.To make these sorts of sounds, fish contract air-filled sacs in their bodies called “swim bladders”. They do this individually and in choruses, which can swell to hundreds of members that together produce an ear-splitting amount of sound.Blackspotted Croaker chorusA group of Blackspotted Croakers calling, or croaking, in a chorus.

Their calls were documented by Aristotle and Darwin, and recorded underwater as far back as the 1940s. But most of the details of the acoustic lives of fish are still shrouded in mystery.Fish acousticians collect sounds all the time that they can’t yet identify, like this one, labeled “unknown kwa” at theFishSoundsdigital library.Unknown KwaThis sound, recorded by Marta Bolgan, is simply labeled “unknown kwa” at the digital library FishSounds.

That means there are a whole lot of fishy conversations happening in our oceans, lakes and rivers that we’ve never heard, or can’t identify.So why bother trying to learn? Other than the sheer delight of these sounds, why go to the trouble of recording them? Why listen to fish?View image in fullscreenThe most obvious answer is that we need them. Without fish, food webs would collapse, and billions of people would go hungry. Tuning in to the sounds of fish is one way of keeping track of how many there are, where they live, and whether their populations are growing or shrinking.But fish can also serve as emissaries from parts of the planet that are hard for us to access – turbulent rivers, ice-covered lakes, mysterious deep-sea realms. “So much of the ocean is still unexplored,” says Lauren Hawkins, a researcher at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “We have to find ways to monitor the health of our marine environments, and fish are very good indicators for that.”Hawkins says fish sounds can be used to infer important information about changes in water temperature, currents, salinity, pollution and more. They can also help researchers assess whether conservation projects are actually working. “Using acoustics is a way of looking at measuring the changes that are happening. And the more tools we have, the better.”But it all begins with identifying who’s talking. Or unk-ing. Or … splooshing? That’s the best word I can come up with to describe this sound:Unknown fishCredit: Amy MartinSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/4_Unknown_fish_credit_Amy_Martin.wav00:00:0000:00:25This is the voice of a very cold Swedish fish, most likely a grayling, Arctic char, perch or trout. While I was off skiing around that lake, it swam up to my hydrophone and introduced itself. It may not have the haunting allure of the cuckoo’s call, or the ferocious power of a lion’s roar, but when I listened back to my recording and heard this sound, I found myself unexpectedly moved. Suddenly that lake didn’t just have some fish in it, it hadthisfish. One particular animal that had survived under the ice, all winter long.It was a moment of contact, not just with this creature, but with a whole world that in many ways feels alien to me, even though it’s right there, just below the surface.I had a similar feeling of dropping into an alternate realm when I clipped a small microphone on to the stem of a plant in a park in Iowa City, Iowa, and heard this sound:Mystery bug – Part 1Credit: Amy MartinSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/5_Mystery_bug_part_1_Credit_Amy_Martin.wav00:00:0000:00:22The sound was quite loud in my headphones, but when I pulled them off, I couldn’t hear it all. I also couldn’t see what was making it.Intrigued, I sent the recording to Rex Cocroft, a biologist at the University of Missouri, and he confirmed my suspicions: I had managed to capture the sounds of a small insect, likely some sort of leafhopper, communicating in a hidden world of sound called the vibroscape. Even more exciting, he thought the odds were good that no one had ever heard or recorded this sound before.Mystery bug – Part 2Credit: Amy MartinSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/6_Mystery_bug_part_2_Credit_Amy_Martin.wav00:00:0000:00:45That’s because leafhoppers and their cousins, treehoppers, don’t transmit their sounds through the air, like we do, or through water, like fish. These little creatures shake their abdomens, causing acoustic waves to move through their legs and out into the stems and leaves of plants. Other hoppers pick up on these vibrations with their legs, and often respond in kind. “It’s like they take a different transect through acoustic space and put together sound in ways that we never thought to do,” Cocroft says.Potnia brevicornisCredit: Rex CocroftSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/7_Potnia_brevicornis_Credit_Rex_Cocroft.wav00:00:0000:00:52These calls are not subtle at all – they are big, bold and sometimes even a little scary. But without the right kind of microphone, a person standing right next to two conversing treehoppers will not hear a thing. It’s almost like they turn the plants, and their own bodies, into magical musical instruments that only they can hear.Planthopper, Dominican RepublicCredit: Rex CocroftSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/8_Planthopper_Dominican_Republic_Credit_Rex_Cocroft.wav00:00:0000:00:32The key to tapping the lines of communication between treehoppers was Cocroft’s curiosity, not technological wizardry. He was doing research for his PhD in animal communication when he decided to find out if treehoppers had anything to say. This was at Cornell University in the 1990s.“I just walked out onto a meadow near where I lived,” he says. “I had a cassette tape recorder and headphones.” He found a goldenrod plant with some treehoppers on it, leaned a sensitive microphone up against it, “and immediately I heard these wonderful sounds I’d never heard before. Just this tiny insect, this beautiful song. And then I was hooked. I never looked back.”Before Cocroft started documenting their sounds, treehoppers had attracted quite a bit of attention for their ornate and sometimes downright whacky body shapes. The ones Cocroft studies the most, thorn bugs, look like rose thorns with legs. Others appear to have sand castles on their heads, “or a little Starship Enterprise on their backs”, he says.View image in fullscreenRex Cocroft studies thorn bugs, treehoppers that look like rose thorns have spawned legs.Photograph: Jacopo WertherThese minute rockstars of the insect world, pushing the boundaries of sound and fashion, live on every continent but Antarctica. If it happens to be warm outside where you are today, odds are good they’re calling on some plants nearby. That means hundreds of millions of us probably walk right by treehoppers and leafhoppers every day, unaware of the messages they’re sending to each other.But what about plants? What, if anything, are they doing with all of this acoustic information, coursing through their plant-y veins?In 2007, Cocroft stumbled upon this question in a casual conversation with another scientist, Heidi Appel. “We both immediately thought, ‘No, that’s very far-fetched and unlikely,’” Cocroft says. The idea of plants being able to detect sound waves produced by insects – in a sense “listen” to the vibroscape – just seemed too out there. But they decided to test the idea anyway, almost as a lark.I tell the full story of what happened next inthis episode of Threshold, but (spoiler alert) what they discovered ended up kicking off a whole new era of plant bioacoustics.Missouri leafhopper chorusCredit: Rex CocroftSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/9_Missouri_leafhopper_chorus_Credit_Rex_Cocroft.wav00:00:0000:00:52Talking fish. Bellowing insects. Listening plants. Again and again, organisms have evolved ways to use sound to help them survive. That includes us.“I think for humans, language and cooperation are some of the features that really helped move us forward and helps us be successful,” says neuroscientist Alison Barker.I met Barker at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Germany, where she studies connections between cooperation and acoustic communication in naked mole rats – small mammals that spend their whole lives in underground colonies in east Africa.View image in fullscreenA naked mole rat in an underground burrow.Photograph: Tennessee Witney/Getty Images/iStockphotoNaked mole rats are not moles, or rats, but they are mostly naked, other than the hundred or so highly sensitive hairs on their finger-sized bodies.

She leads a team of researchers who are working on figuring that out. They’ve installed an array of microphones which allows them to eavesdrop on naked mole rat conversations, and they’ve cataloged more than 25 sound types, including the scream, the hiss and the toilet call.View image in fullscreenNaked mole rat toilet callCredit: Alison Barker, Lewin Lab, Max Delbrück Center for Molecular MedicineSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/11_Naked_mole-rat_toilet_call_Credit_Alison_Barker.wav00:00:0000:00:03Barker carefully plucks one naked mole rat out of its burrow, cradling it gently while I point my microphone toward its mouth. There’s no denying that this little creature has a face made for radio – it has tiny eyes, a pig-like snout and beaverish teeth. But when it calls, my heart melts. Its voice is sweetly beautiful and highly reminiscent of birdsong. This is the sound that Barker has researched the most, called the “soft chirp”.Naked mole rat soft chirpsCredit: Julian Burger, Barker Lab, Max Planck Institute for Brain ResearchSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/18/12_Naked_mole-rat_soft_chirps_Credit_Julian_Burger.wav00:00:0000:00:22The soft chirp is the most common sound naked mole rats make, and Barker believes it contains information about individual identity and group membership. Naked mole rats are the longest-lived rodents in the world, with lifespans of 30 years or more, and their long list of seeming superpowers has been researched much more than their communication. They rarely develop cancer, they have a high tolerance for pain and low-oxygen environments, and they usually stay very healthy even into old age.They’re also the only mammals known to live in a eusocial system, with a queen at the center, similar to how bees or ants live. The queen chooses a few males for her harem, and she’s the only one who gives birth. All other members of the colony do the work of foraging for food, caring for the pups and fighting off intruders.But when Barker first encountered naked mole rats at a lab in Berlin, it was their voices, not their intriguing physiological adaptations, that captured her. “It wasn’t really love at first sight – although that’s not to say that I don’t think they’re very adorable,” she said. “It was more love at first sound. There was a brief moment of sensory disconnect, where you hear a sound and you think it should be coming from something else, and then you realize it’s coming from this unusual-looking creature that you’ve never seen before. It was a real moment of wonderment. Both my brain and my heart were kind of screaming together: you have to study this.”I posed the same question to Barker that I pose to every other researcher I interviewed for this series. Why should we care about this creature, plant or habitat that you’re so passionate about listening to? In this case, why listen to naked mole rats?Barker had several answers, including what these animals can teach us about the evolution of our own communication. But her last thought was perhaps the most powerful. “Why not listen to the naked mole rats?” she asked. “Why are we not listening to all the animals on the planet? Why are we not trying to understand what’s happening in the world that we’re a part of? We’re part of a larger ecosystem. And I think in some ways we have a duty to engage with that.”Amy Martin is the founder and executive producer ofThreshold, a Peabody award-winning documentary podcast.

It’s a long story, but the short version is that I love animals alive and vegetables on my plate.If I think about who I am and how I eat, I am built from Gujarati ingenuity and Lincolnshire produce when it comes to putting vegetables at the centre of the table. While I eat mainly plants, I do leave a little room in my diet for other things that I enjoy – a fish curry shared with my husband, Hugh, an omelette for a quick dinner, or tidying the edges of a hunk of manchego – and three of my cookbooks,Fresh India,EastandDinner, overall reflect that way of eating.I have variously followed a vegan or vegetarian diet, but the moment I fell off the wagon by eating some meat, I feared I lacked conviction. I’d question my values and feel as if I’d failed, and I’d want to throw in the towel. But, left to my own devices, I very rarely ate meat or fish, say once or twice a month, and dairy and eggs more regularly, but there was no wagon to fall off – and overall I was moving in the right direction.I’ve never labelled myself a vegan or, for that matter, a vegetarian, pescatarian or meat-eaterEven though I’ve written thevegan columnat the Guardian for eight years, I’ve never labelled myself a vegan or, for that matter, a vegetarian, pescatarian or meat-eater. So when the Guardian recently asked me to broaden my horizons to include vegetarian recipes every other week, I said yes.Back in 2017, many of the vegan recipes being written weren’t especially tempting and, having grown up eating the most beautiful home-cooked, largely vegan Indian food, I had a lot to add to the conversation. But things have changed since then. Now many of the UK’s brightest brains are creating fantastic plant-based dishes: it’s where the greatest innovation in food is. There are vegan ranges in every supermarket and every fast-food chain, and most restaurants and pubs have at least one vegan option.And so perhaps now is the right time for me to go full panda. Before I do, I’d love to share a couple of things I’ve learned along the way.Veganism is far from the restrictive diet I once thought it was. Initially, I felt it was so limited that I’d have to give up my column within two months (thanks toItamar SrulovichandDiana Henryfor talking me out of it). But the limitation forced me to think more creatively. I had to learn different ways of cooking vegetables to get to a delicious and satisfying meal quickly. It has opened up my palate and given me new skills; I’ve learned how to extract the most flavour from a celeriac. Overall, it has made me a better cook, and it has been fun along the way.It has also made me more conscious of what I eat. It’s forced me to read every label and, in doing so, I’ve become more aware of what I’m putting into my body (and what I’m recommending you put into yours). It’s led me to be much more aware of ultra-processed ingredients and foods, for example, of which there are lots when it comes to pre-packaged vegan food.Finally, the community around my column has been amazing in all sorts of ways. I’ve learned that most of my readers are Meat-Free Monday-ers or part-time vegans, and have shown enormous enthusiasm for weekly vegan options. Many are not, as I initially thought, part of a small, east London bubble, but from as far as the Outer Hebrides and of all ages. Both my father in-law and stepfather-in-law, for example, who are in their late 70s and grew up eating meat daily, now eat vegan food regularly.If we all, in our millions, eat less meat more regularly, that’s where the greatest change will happenI am conscious that I’m making this change at a time when Donald Trump has pulled out of the Paris agreement, and just after the Los Angeles fires. But I believe that one of the most empowering things we can all do in the face of the climate crisis is to choose what we put on our plates three times a day. And if we all, in our millions, choose to eat less meat more regularly, that’s where the greatest change will happen.I’ll still be writing vegan recipes every other week here and my food will still be about flavour, vegetables and pleasure. For the time being, because so much of what I do is tinkering in the kitchen, I am thrilled to have new ingredients for my weekly column – the equivalent of new paints to paint with. Sometimes I might not get it right, but I’m enthusiastic to learn and to see what I can create for you.Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkVegetarianismFoodVegan food and drinkVeganismVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This tiny animal, just 0.2mm in size, is also a fantastic cleaner.There are more than 450 described species ofbdelloid rotifer, including the common rotifer, and their greatest superpower is their supreme resilience. Like tardigrades, they can withstand extreme heat and cold by going into dormancy, contracting into an inert “tun”. In this state, a common rotifer can survive desiccation or being zapped with radiation, and can sit out unfavourable conditions for decades.Researchers recentlydug up a rotifer relativefrom the Alazeya River in Siberia where it had been frozen for 24,000 years. Remarkably, once thawed,it returned to lifeand was able to reproduce.The common rotifer produces clones by parthenogenesis, whereby females produce an embryo without needing to fertilise an egg with sperm from a male.Rotifer means “wheel-bearer” and the common rotifer propels itself around using tiny hairs called cilia that draw water and food towards it in a circular motion.It is a detritivore, eating detritus in the water, playing its part in the decomposition of organic matter and helping to maintain balance in aquatic ecosystems and remove pollution from bodies of water. Despite being so small, they are also an important source of food for young fish and other small animals.The Canadian limnologist, science fiction writer and Guardian reader Nina Munteanu makes a brilliant case for the common rotifer in her nomination for invertebrate of the year 2025.“Highly variable environments tend to support organisms uniquely equipped for change,” she says. “These are the explorers, misfits, and revolutionaries who do their work to usher in a new paradigm. They carry change inside them, through phenotypic plasticity, physiological stress response mechanisms, or life history adaptations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

More than $30bn (£23bn) would be spent drilling a 91km circular tunnel in which subatomic particles would be accelerated to near light speeds and smashed into each other. From the resulting nuclear debris, scientists hope they will then find clues that would help them understand the detailed makeup of the universe.It is an extraordinarily ambitious project. However, it is also a controversial one – for many scientists fear the machine, theFuture Circular Collider (FCC), could soak up funding for subatomic physics for decades and leave promising new research avenues starved of resources.Others argue that the mega-­collider is being imposed on physicists by senior officials atCern, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, without properly consulting researchers.“I’m amazed to see how they are lining up this concept,” particle physicist Halina Abramowicz of Tel Aviv University told theObserver. “This is not how things are supposed to work. The physics community is supposed to tell Cern what should be the next step, not the other way round.”These arguments have led the journalNatureto warn this month that “a battle is under way for the future ofparticle physics”. Its analysis of the views of dozens of leading physicists revealed that many were critical of the proposed collider and warned it could trigger dangerous divisions between groups. As Prof Ruben Saakyan of University College London told the journal: “The [physics] community was never split like this before.”For its part, Cern says that the FCC offers scientists a chance to undertake “a unique exploration of space, time and matter”. The plan is supported by many senior physicists and vigorously promoted by Cern’s current director general, Fabiola Gianotti, and also backed by Mark Thomson, who is set to take over her post in January 2026. “If approved, the FCC would become the most powerful instrument ever built to study the laws of nature at the most fundamental level,” Gianotti toldNature.Since its formation in 1954, Cern – which is based in Geneva – has become a much-lauded example of the effectiveness of international scientific cooperation and has earned itself a reputation for generating world-­leading research over the decades.ItsLarge Hadron Collider (LHC)– currently the world’s biggest machine – revealed the existence, in 2012, of the Higgs particle. This was thefirst direct evidencethat a field – known as the Higgs field – permeates the ­universe and is responsible for giving different fundamental particles their various masses.However, the LHC is scheduled for closure by 2040 and many puzzles about the structure of the universe remain unsolved, despite hopes it would provide more major insights. Persisting mysteries include the nature of dark matter, whose existence is inferred from its gravitational influences on galaxies but whose exact makeup is unknown. Similarly, the fact that our universe is made up of matter – while antimatter is almost nonexistent – cannot be explained from current observations.View image in fullscreenProf Peter Higgs, who first predicted the existence of the subatomic Higgs boson particle.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/the GuardianTo get round these problems, Cern has proposed building its new mega-collider, which would be a much more powerful and much bigger version of the LHC. It would be built in two stages. The first would generate Higgs particles in vast numbers in order to understand their critical role in influencing other fundamental forces and would come online around 2040. Then it would be repurposed after a few decades so it could collide protons at vast energies and provide new data about the universe. This version would begin operations around 2070.However, the technology to accelerate protons at the unsurpassed energies proposed for the FCC does not exist yet. It is merely assumed that, in 40 years’ time, it will have been developed. Such an assumption worries some scientists, as well as the fact that the FCC will cost so much that it will lock scientists into a device that would monopolise funds for particle physics for decades.“What worries me most is that, by investing all this money, we will ​be stopping the development of other technologies because there will be no money for them. The FCC could soak up funds for years and years,” said Abramowicz, who dismissed the idea of the mega-collider as “a toy” that could certainly not be guaranteed to fix the holes that exist in current theories.Cern aims to build €20bn collider to unlock secrets of universeRead moreInstead, researchers have suggested that linear accelerators – which would fire particles in straight lines – might prove to be cheaper, more flexible and more likely to achieve results than a circular collider. This point was backed by Jenny List, a researcher based at the German accelerator centre Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg.“There are other technologies on the horizon that could be used to accelerate particles like the proton without needing huge magnets or tunnels,” she said. “Plasma wave technology is one of these. Current devices are small, but within 20 years or so we could find they are ready to use to run a big collider.”However, if the FCC were given the go-ahead, it could lock up funds for decades and end up dictating the direction that particle physics will have to take for much of the century, List added.“We will be telling future generations exactly what to do scientifically, and so we need to ask ourselves today: who are we to decide what our grandchildren should research and not research?”Explore more on these topicsLarge Hadron ColliderThe ObserverParticle physicsCernHiggs bosonPhysicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was also a remarkable turn of events for a university that had for years been a home for cutting-edge academic discourse on Palestine, beginning with the scholarship of Edward Said, a leading Palestinian intellectual.It was precisely that legacy that also made Columbia a target of campaigns to censor Palestinian narratives – long before the protests that kicked off after 7 October 2023 drew the attention of conservatives and others who believe American campuses have become too leftwing. In the latest twist in the drama engulfing the university, its interim president, Katrina Armstrong, announced Friday she was stepping down. She is the second president of the university to resign in eight months.A Palestinian American medical student objected to working alongside IDF soldiers. The university suspended herRead moreColumbia’s announcement followed the Trump administration’s cancellation of $400m in federal funding, mostly for scientific research, over what the White House said was the university’s failure to protect faculty and students “from antisemitic violence and harassment”. Notably, Columbia’s bending to the government’s demands did not immediately restore the funding, withTrump administrationofficials indicating they would continue to monitor adherence to the policies they forced on the university.Columbia’s submission prompted the condemnation of academic freedom advocates nationwide, who warned of more government interference to come.View image in fullscreenEdward Said in his office at Columbia University in 2003.Photograph: Jean-Christian Bourcart/Getty Images“Columbia is the canary in the coalmine of totalitarianism,” saidSheldon Pollock, a Columbia professor and former chair of the Mesaas department. “This is a very worrying development across the board for university faculty.”Trump had demanded Columbia place the Mesaas department under “receivership” – meaning, outside control, and the university has, at least in part, agreed. The department played no formal role in last year’s protests, and Said and other prominentscholars of Palestine, like Rashid Khalidi, were more closely affiliated with other departments. But Mesaas became a symbol for what was viewed as a pro-Palestinian climate on campus that some faculty note is a function of the university’s longstanding commitment to the humanities, which has long attracted more progressive scholars.“Columbia has been associated with the Palestinian cause for a long time because it was possible to say things on the Columbia campus that in many places it was not possible to say,” Bruce Robbins, a professor of English literature, who is Jewish, said. “People who were involved in Palestine – in the issue, and in the study of the subject – found a home at Columbia where they might not have found a home somewhere else.”A history of backlashColumbia scholars have been studying the Middle East since the 18th century, when the university appointed its first professor of “Oriental languages”, as the academy at the time referred to the study of non-western cultures. Two hundred years later, Said’s book Orientalism became a foundational work of postcolonial scholarship. But it was his writing about the Middle East, and Palestine in particular, that established him as an icon for Palestinian scholarship.In one of his seminal works, The Question of Palestine, Said wrote that discussion of the Arab world, and Palestinians in particular, was “so confused and unfairly slanted in the west that a great effort has to be made to see things as, for better or worse, they actually are”. Elsewhere, he noted that there was no “permission to narrate” the Palestinian experience in western discourse, and that those who tried were punished. In dozens of articles and books, Said forcefully insisted on the need for Palestinians to reclaim dominant narratives of their history, fundamentally reframing what was then a discourse largely echoing the Israeli perspective.View image in fullscreenRashid Khalidi speaks at the Geneva press club in in Switzerland on 24 November 2003.Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/EPABut what made his work so groundbreaking also made him, and Columbia, where he spent his entire career, a target.On multiple occasions, Said’s office at Columbia was raided and vandalized. The FBIkept tabson him. And he was often the subject of smear campaigns, including an article in the conservative Jewish magazine Commentary, which memorably called him “Professor of Terror”.Said’s career coincided with – and likely contributed to – the gradual shifting of American students’ views on Israel, particularly following the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the two intifadas, or Palestinian uprisings. When he died in 2003, the backlash shifted on to Columbia itself, and other critics of Zionism who had found a home there, like the Mesaas professorsHamid DabashiandJoseph Massad. (Neither responded to an interview request.)In 2004, four Columbia undergraduates were interviewed in a documentary, Columbia Unbecoming, in which they accused three university professors with what at the time was the Middle East and Asian languages and cultures department, or Mealac – including Dabashi and Massad – of unfair treatment and intimidation over their pro-Israel views. The documentary was produced by the David Project, a Boston-based group created to counter negative narratives about Israel on US campuses. The documentary ignited a sweeping controversy and calls on Columbia to fire its faculty, including from the thencongressman Anthony Weiner. Some of the students featured in the film, as well as the conservative journalist Bari Weiss, who was an undergraduate at Columbia at the time, launched an initiative called Columbians for Academic Freedom, which represented students who said they had been intimidated by their professors for their views.Following the Columbia Unbecoming controversy, the university convened a panel to investigate the allegations and found no misconduct. But it also reorganized the Mealac department, tacking on south Asian and later African studies and cross-appointing faculty from other disciplines to expand its scope. Now called Mesaas, it remained a cosmopolitan home for critical theory, the academic critique of social structures and systems of power. But it is only one of several venues in which Columbia students are exposed to scholarship on Palestine, which is also hosted by the university’s Middle East Institute and Columbia’s Center for Palestine Studies, established in 2010 as the first of its kind at a US university. (The center is also to be placed under receivership.)Antisemitism accusationsSince Israel’s war in Gaza started after the 7 October Hamas attacks, Columbia has been at the forefront of the debate over alleged antisemitism on campuses. A conversation that had previously centered on “tolerance” of pro-Israel views had made way for mounting allegations of antisemitism, a strategy that has been increasingly pursued by pro-Israel groups. Such allegations have resulted in congressional hearings, several lawsuits, the former presidentMinouche Shafik’s resignation, faculty and studentexpulsions, and the targeting by immigration authorities offoreign studentswho expressed pro-Palestinian views.There was internal pushback as well, includinga letterlast month signed by about 200 Columbia faculty calling on the university to implement “concrete action” to protect the Jewish community on campus. That letter included many of the same demands later presented by the Trump administration, including a mask ban and the adoption of adefinitionof antisemitism that critics argue wrongly conflates some criticisms of Israel with antisemitism. It also asked for an investigation of Massad, who faced backlash and calls on the university to remove him after an op-ed he published in the Electronic Intifada a day after the Hamas attacks, referring to scenes from the attacks as “awesome” and “stunning”.People are beginning to wonder who is vetting their syllabus, who may be listening in class and reporting on themSheldon PollockThe letter also called for measures against faculty who participated in last year’s encampment, the expulsion of students who “disrupt teaching”, and the hiring of at least three tenured “pro-Israel” faculty at Mesaas “to allow ideological diversity and to combat indoctrination against the west and Israel under the guise of ‘academic independence’”. (It did not, however, call for the department to be put under receivership. The Guardian reached out to the four faculty who led the letter effort but got no response. The only Mesaas faculty member who signed it, the retired professor Nehama Bershon, declined to comment.)Last year, Robbins, the English professor, taught a class on literary representations of atrocity. The syllabus included a week dedicated to the war inGaza, which happened to coincide with the protest encampment. Robbins took his students to visit the encampment, offering those who didn’t want to go the possibility to opt out. The timing was a “historical coincidence”, he said. “It would almost be crazy not to take advantage of this.” In response, two students filed a formal complaint, accusing Robbins of interfering with their education by holding the class at the encampment. The university has launched an investigation, and Robbins is “awaiting judgment”, he says.“I got into the profession thinking that making students uncomfortable is part of my job description.”A canary in the mineMany Columbia faculty and students were away for spring break last week and were stunned by the news that the university would bend to the Trump administration’s demands. On Tuesday, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, two unions representing faculty, sued the Trump administration on behalf of their members at Columbia over the cancellation of federal funding. Faculty have also talked about a possible strike. Some scholars outside Columbia have called for aboycottof the university.Pollock said that a chill was sweeping through faculty. “People are beginning to wonder who is vetting their syllabus, who may be listening in class and reporting on them; colleagues who are green card holders have looked at theMahmoud Khalilattack as a test case,” he said. (The Guardian reached out to several scholars affiliated with Mesaas and other departments, but few agreed to talk on the record, with one senior professor citing a “dangerous” situation on campus.)What is clear to all is that this is just the beginning, said Jeremy Young, a historian and higher-education advocate who until recently worked as the director of state and higher-education policy at PEN America.“It’s a terrible precedent to set,” he said of the Trump administration’s demands and Columbia’s response; Young emphasized he was not speaking for PEN. “The government is acting like a bully, and if a bully gets what they want from using bullying tactics, they’re just going to keep going until someone stands up to them. And that wasn’t Columbia, but I hope it’ll be another institution.”Explore more on these topicsUS campus protestsUS universitiesPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump and RFK Jr linking it to vaccines scares parents like meWe’re afraid the baseless theory spread by the president stigmatises our kids – and could affect access to careRobert Taitin WashingtonSat 29 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareIt was a moment whenDonald Trump’slarger-than-life presence on the global stage became unexpectedly personal.Near the end of his one-hour, 40-minutespeech to a joint session of Congresson 4 March, the US president diverted from his favoured themes of a new golden age of American greatness and grievances against his adversaries to address a more unlikely topic: autism.The president drew his audience’s attention toRobert F Kennedy Jr, his controversial, newly confirmed choice as health secretary, and charged him with one overarching responsibility.“Not long ago, you can’t even believe these numbers – one in 10,000 children had autism,” Trump intoned. “Now it’s one in 36. There’s something wrong. One in 36 think of that. So we’re going to find out what it is. And there’s nobody better than Bobby.“Good luck. It’s a very important job.”It was not the first time that Trump had waded into the controversy swirling around autism – a neurodivergent condition affecting an estimated 75 million people worldwide. Nor was it the first occasion that he had touted Kennedy’s credentials as being able to tackle it.But the high symbolism of the setting brought home to me, a watching journalist, with sobering clarity that a life-changing decision, taken for the most pressing of family reasons, had taken on unforeseen contours.It puts a stigma on our children that their parents did something wrong when they were pregnant with themDavina KleidJust over two years ago, my wife and I had moved to the United States so that we could better address the needs of our son, who had been diagnosed with autism just before his third birthday. We had gradually despaired of finding a practical solution in the Czech capital of Prague, where we previously lived, and where state-of-the-art therapeutic remedies were still fledgling works in progress.America, by contrast, seemed to be a land of possibility and innovative approaches and to offer a more amenable environment to our circumstances – and had the added attraction that we all held US citizenship.In the period since our arrival, we found progress uneven, but engaged an outstanding therapist who made up for our difficulties navigating the Maryland state education system. I shifted my career from one centered in Europe, to covering US politics – and the secondTrump administration.Now here – in the highest shrine of US democracy – was the graphically vivid figure of Trump digressing from his usual weaving script to elevate the very topic that had brought us to America’s shores to a national priority.It was not, to put it mildly, exactly what we had envisioned.The uptick in the autism trend Trump cited was exaggerated; whilethe most recent US autism statistics, recorded in 2020, did indeed record one in 36 children in the US having received a diagnosis of autism, the jump was less dramatic than he described – comparing with a rate of one in 150 in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Nevertheless, the undoubted spike in instances of the condition meant that his proclaimed zeal to find a cause resonated with many, us included.The catch lay in his choice of Kennedy, who has declared that autism is caused by vaccines – a scientifically baseless theory whichTrump himself has previously indulged– as the lead figure in a national crusade to discover a cause.I spoke with other parents of children with autism, who used a range of pejorative adjectives to deride this conviction; among them “dangerous”, “scary”, “batshit crazy”, “despicable” and “disgusting”.Debunked myths that vaccines cause autism are increasing stigmaRead moreKennedy’s views carry weight which, experts fear, will be lent still greater authority by his new health portfolio. The CDC is reportedly nowplanninga large study into potential connections between vaccines and autism.“Were I the father of a child with autism, I would be really angry at the anti-vaccine community for taking this story hostage and for diverting resources and attention away from the real cause, or causes, of autism,” said Paul Offit, a pediatrician specialising in immunology and author of the 2008 bookAutism’s False Prophets, which rebutted the alleged links between the condition and vaccines.“There’s financial or emotional burdens that make it hard enough for parents, but to have this offered as a reason for why a child has autism is just spurious and in some ways malicious, because I think it puts the burden on the parent.”Belief in the alleged connection between vaccinations and autism gained traction after a 1998 study conducted by a British physician, Andrew Wakefield, and published in the Lancet asserted a causal link with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The paper ignited a firestorm of controversy in Britain, with the then prime minister, Tony Blair, pressured to say whether his baby son had been administered the MMR shot.But research underpinning the finding was later debunked as fraudulent, leading tothe Lancet retracting the paperand Wakefield being struck off the UK medical register. Multiple subsequent studies have found no connection between the vaccine and autism.Despite the countervailing evidence, suspicions persisted – fuelled in no small part by Kennedy himself, who has shown himself unmoved in the face of challenge.My personal interest in Kennedy and his views on vaccines was piqued after hearing a2023 podcast interview with the New Yorker. He was adamant under questioning from the magazine’s editor-in-chief, David Remnick, who – disclosing himself as the parent of a child with “quite severe” autism – asked if he had second thoughts about “slinging around theories … that don’t have any great credibility among scientists”.“I’ve read the science on autism and I can tell you … If it didn’t come from the vaccines, then where is it coming from?” Kennedy responded.Scientists say there are multiple potential answers to that question, including genetics, drugs taken during pregnancy, age of conception – albeit none giving a definitive explanation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some – like my son – are functional, verbal and teachable, with aspects of high intelligence; others are non-verbal and may have severe intellectual disabilities; many others may fall somewhere in between.“If you’ve met one child with autism, you’ve met one child with autism,” goes the refrain among many specialists.Common to all, however, are atypical behaviours that for the parents, are life-changing and force them to make painful adaptations, sometimes at high financial cost.A complaint frequently heard about Kennedy’s views is that they heap stigmatisation on their children and unwarranted blame on the parents.“It puts a stigma on our children that their parents did something wrong when they were pregnant with them, and thus it’s the parents fault,” said Davina Kleid, 38, an executive assistant in a real estate development company in Maryland, whose nine-year-old daughter has autism.Kleid feared Kennedy’s views have the potential to unleash an eventual crackdown conjuring scenes resembling The Handmaid’s Tale, Margaret Atwood’s novel dystopian novel depicting a bleak patriarchal future and female subjugation.“Who knows? Maybe I could be arrested for having a child on the spectrum, because they’re going to say that I did something to purposely cause her to have this condition,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong with my child. It’s how she was born. I’m not ashamed of it, and I don’t think anyone should be ashamed of it.”Madeline, a publisher from Maryland who requested that her real name not be disclosed, said Kennedy’s views amounted to a disparagement of her 24-year-old son, who was born at the height of the MMR controversy arising from the Wakefield paper but who showed signs of developmental delay before being vaccinated.“It is just insulting that people would think that it would be better to get measles or mumps or pertussis or whooping cough than to have autism,” she said. “And RFK Jr has said as much. It’s like this is worse than getting these terrible, life-threatening diseases.”RFK sees disabilities as a problem that needs to be fixed. He has a dangerous belief systemLux BlakthorneLux Blakthorne, 33, a professional gardener living in Chester county, Pennsylvania, said fears for the future over her non-verbal, nine-year-old autistic son, Kai, had prompted her to make plans to emigrate to Germany, the country of her ex-husband’s birth and where she said provisions for autism had made great strides.The breaking point, she said, would be cuts to Medicaid, the public healthcare system that Kennedy oversees and which pays for Kai’s daily needs including education at a special private facility.An added factor is a recent White House executiveorder banning puberty blocking medicationfor those under 18, a measure aimed at stymying gender-affirming care for transgender youth but which, Blakthorne says, would prevent her trying to mitigate harmful autism-related behaviour that is likely to be exacerbated by the onset of puberty.“I think RFK sees disabilities as a problem that needs to be fixed,” said Blakthorne. “He has a dangerous belief system, and it’s not science- or fact-based.”Yet amid the negativity, theAutism Science Foundation, a research group, says Kennedy has a unique opportunity to discover its causes.“Many of us in the autism community give RFK credit for wanting to study the causes of autism,” said Alison Singer, the foundation’s president and the mother of a daughter with autism.“What would be very positive is if as health secretary, he can declare profound autism as a national public health emergency,” she said.“That would open up a variety of actions he could take, like making additional grants, entering into new contracts [and] really focusing funding on investigating the causes of autism, treatments and prevention.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrAutismNeurodiversityUS politicsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it is clear that modest reductions in spending put forward in the spring statement cannot be described as a return to austerity, they are expected to deliver considerable harm to vulnerable people at a time when wealth inequality continues to rise.Critics also believe the chancellor’s policies to improve living standards are flawed, and more radical reforms of the way Britain’s economy operates need to be supported by the government. Here we look at some of the options open to the chancellor.Borrow moreAsking the international money markets to lend the UK more money was like a free lunch in the years after the 2008 financial crash. It is a tragedy that the chancellor from 2010,George Osborne, spurned this opportunity.These days, global lenders demand a much higher price from governments, and especially those sitting on large mountains of debt, like the UK. Reeves will spend more than £100bn on debt financing in the next financial year on a budget of £1.2tn. As Reeves said last week, “That is more than we allocate on defence, the home office and justice combined.”Economists have tried to define how much borrowing is too much and always failed, which leaves the financial markets to decide. Last year France was told by the ratings agencies, after it went over 110% of gross domestic product (GDP), that its credit rating would be downgraded. Paris is now on track to save €50bn from its 2025 budget. The UK, which has a lower level of productivity than France and a more open economy susceptible to trade wars, seems to have hit the buffers when nearing the 100% debt to GDP ratio.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves prepares to deliver her spring statement on March 26.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesTax moreStarmer has boxed in Reeves with pledges to maintain income tax, employee national insurance and VAT at current levels. Most economists agree that in a period of stagnation it would be a growth killer to raise them, anyway. However, there was a missed opportunity to raise fuel duty last year as an environmental measure when oil prices were low, raising almost £5bn (and Brent crude is still trading just above $70 a barrel).The enormous hole in the public finances left by the Conservatives is also a reasonable excuse for breaching the income tax pledge and slapping a surcharge on millionaires. Tax experts don’t believe it could raise as much as the £460m a week claimed on the side of a busfunded by the group Patriotic Millionaires. That said, like fuel duty, it could raise enough to replenish welfare funds to allow for a more generously supported route back to employment for disabled people who want to work.Cut spending in other waysThere is little fat on the bone of Whitehall departments. And while there are quangos that are wasteful, the savings from reforming or abolishing them will be small.Another route could be to examine the £200bn of tax breaks identified by the National Audit Office that successive governments have failed to monitor and prove are effective. One of the largest tax breaks is the tax-free allowance for pension saving. This costs the government about £40bn a year. Would savers stop putting money in a pension if the government subsidy was reduced? No one knows.Is it fair that pension savers can take a quarter of their pot as a tax-free lump sum? This subsidy is likely to come under review in the autumn budget, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside Downing Street on March 26 during a demonstration against benefit cuts announced in the spring statement.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockRedefine investmentMany aspects of day-to-day spending can be considered investment. For example, there are projects that bring together local government and health service bodies to tackle the mental health crisis. With more than 1 million people on the waiting list for NHS talking therapies, a boost to spending would result in millions of pounds of savings.Academic studies show dramatic reductions in the level of support people need once they have been through the latest programmes.The budget rule for investment is more relaxed than the budget rule for day-to-day spending. Switching some costs from one to the other would help Reeves keep within the targets for both.Rewrite the budget rulesSpring statement 2025: what does it mean for your finances?Read moreReeves adopted looser fiscal rules than the previous government, but they are still proving to be a constraint in uncertain times.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research is one of the biggest critics of the chancellor’s budget rules, arguing it creates unnecessary stress. It says the OBR could produce a “state of the economy” overview and only assess the government against targets Whitehall can control, such as welfare and public service spending.It would mean that the recent spike in interest rates, which cost about £10bn in extra debt financing and was the primary reason for cuts in the spring statement, would be noted, but action could be delayed until it is known to be a persistent problem.Abolish or reform the Office for Budget ResponsibilityAfter 15 years, there is a growing concern that the OBR commands an undue influence over government planning. Its twice-yearly reports arguably force the Treasury to be tactical – constantly adjusting spending plans – when it wants to be strategic. The OBR is also viewed as conservative in its assessments of new ventures by the government.While this was sensible whenLiz Trussdeclared that £40bn of unfunded tax cuts would boost growth and eventually tax receipts from higher incomes, it might be considered less forward thinking when assessing the long-term benefits of state-funded mental health therapies. However, the OBR would benefit from being strengthened rather than abolished. It should have its own resources and staff, making it even more independent of the Treasury. The flipside of this reform would be that while its twice yearly reports would score departments against budget projections and continue to make an assessment of the economic outlook, the chancellor would be freed from the tyranny of continually adjusting plans to meet short-term targets.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe ObserverSpring statement 2025EconomicsTax and spendingLiz TrussGeorge OsborneKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Now his patients, including the actor Celia Imrie and the former model Linda Keith, are trying to piece together what happenedJon StockSat 29 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareFrom the reinforced windows of ward five, high up in the Edwardian eaves of London’s Royal Waterloo hospital for children and women, a 14-year-oldCelia Imrieused to stare down, hoping to spot her mother. “When I walk past that old, redbrick hospital building today, on my way to the Imax or the National Theatre,” says Imrie, who went on to become a successful actor, “I can see the window where I’d sit waiting for her and a deep chill passes through me.”Every day, thousands of commuters and tourists pass beneath the former hospital. Some might look up to admire the terracotta facade, with its ornate colonnades and glazed tile lettering, but few are aware of the medical horrors that took place in one small room on the top floor: the Sleep Room. It was here, on ward five, that female patients – they were almost always women – were put to sleep for three to four months (in one case, five), only roused from their beds to be fed, washed and given electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a shock of up to 110 volts that passed bilaterally through the temporal lobe of the brain, triggering a grand mal seizure.Almost 60 years on, Imrie and other former patients want to know why they were subjected to such extreme treatments without consent. “My father was absolutely shattered when he saw me,” remembers Anne White of her time in the Sleep Room. “He said I just looked like a walking zombie.” Shelley, who worked as a nurse on ward five for six months in 1968, recalls the patients’ glassy skins. “They had this dozy, greasy sheen to them. They were like people you just don’t see. We knew them all, but not at all really.”The Royal Waterloo became part of its more famous neighbour, St Thomas’ hospital, in 1948, the year the NationalHealthService was formed. It was an important year for William Sargant, too. An ambitious 41-year-old doctor, Sargant was appointed the physician in charge of the department of psychological medicine at St Thomas’, one of the world’s most prestigious teaching hospitals. It wasn’t long before ward five, a psychiatric unit for inpatients, was being referred to as the William Sargant ward. It was Sargant’s personal fiefdom, a place  where he could pursue, unchecked, his own mechanistic approach to psychiatry: the brain, like any other organ or limb, was best fixed with physical treatments, he believed. If it was damaged, it first needed to be “splinted”.Not for Sargant the couch-based therapists who had dominated psychiatry in the early 20th century. It was, in the words of one of his heroes, Lord Moran, personal doctor to Winston Churchill, time to “cut the cackle” and allow psychiatry, for so long seen as a Cinderella speciality, to take its rightful place in the medical mainstream. And deep-sleep therapy, or continuous narcosis, was his most notorious procedure.View image in fullscreenWilliam Sargant at home in 1975 …Photograph: Homer Sykes/AlamyView image in fullscreen… and the Royal Waterloo hospital in London where he experimented on young women.Photograph: Panoramic Images/AlamySleep has long been recognised as a way to calm the distressed – the “balm of hurt minds”, as Shakespeare called it in Macbeth – but for Sargant it had another use. The Sleep Room allowed him to administer treatments that his patients might not otherwise agree to, such as intense courses of ECT. Informed consent was implicit rather than sought – the wishes of desperate relatives were often sufficient. “I am not sure consent forms were in abundant use in the 60s,” remembers one medic who worked on ward five in 1968 and wishes to remain anonymous. “In those days, doctors rarely discussed the risks associated with treatments.”Narcosis combined with ECT, Sargant believed, broke up set patterns, or circuits, of behaviour, and reprogrammed disturbed minds with more positive thoughts. A factory reset. But for many it was a terrifying ordeal that destroyed memories and left them wrestling with existential crises of identity. “As a rule, the patient does not know how long he has been asleep, or what treatment, even including ECT, he has been given,” Sargant said. “Under sleep … one can now give many kinds of physical treatment, necessary, but often not easily tolerated.”Few people had the courage to stand up to Sargant. He belonged to an era of unfettered medical authority, when doctors, particularly male consultants, exuded a sense of droit du seigneur. They were treated like gods, by colleagues as well as by patients, breezing through swing doors, minions trailing behind them.“He still features in my nightmares,” Imrie says today. “There was a whiff of sulphur about him,” said the late Malcolm Lader, emeritus professor of clinical psychopharmacology at King’s College London. He wore immaculate chalk-stripe suits (never a white coat), whether he was presenting TV programmes on the BBC, conducting his rounds, or making frequent trips across the Atlantic to lecture about Battle for the Mind, his bestselling book on brainwashing. Over 6ft tall, he was an imposing physical presence, on the wards as well as the rugby pitch. “If he’d been a gorilla, he would have been one of those huge male silverbacks,” says Henry Oakeley, Sargant’s registrar in the 1960s.Sargant had administered narcosis to traumatised soldiers in the second world war, but admitted it was “not without its dangers”. He only started to champion the treatment again in the 60s, when one of his registrars, Chris Walter, noticed that if patients were treated with ECT, antidepressants and narcosis, they did better than those who were just given ECT and antidepressants. As was so often the case in psychiatry, no one was quite sure why. But patients were now sent to the Sleep Room instead of being lobotomised – they would only go under the knife if narcosis failed. The Sleep Room, in other words, had become a last-chance saloon.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pete Reynolds/The GuardianBehind the medical rationale, however, the Sleep Room served a more sinister purpose. As the 60s started to swing and Sargant’s reputation soared, middle-class parents sent their wayward daughters to him for moral correction. In the mid-60s, for example, a wealthy businessman contacted Sargant, explaining that his daughter had fallen in love with an “unsuitable” local man in Europe and wanted to marry him. Could Sargant help? A photo later emerged of Sargant, the father and a heavily sedated daughter standing at the door of the aeroplane that had returned her to the UK. “Basically, Sargant brought this attractive young woman back at the end of a needle,” recalls a retired professor, who was a student at St Thomas’ at the time.In the past 15 years, online communities websites such asWilliam Sargant at the Royal Waterloo Hospitalhave tried to bring survivors together to tell the world what happened to them. It hasn’t been easy. Some of the medical records of patients who passed through the Sleep Room, including five who died, have disappeared or been destroyed, fuelling conspiracy theories that  Sargant had been conducting experiments on behalf of the intelligence services. And there is still a stigma attached to mental illness. Patients are often reluctant to tell their story, one comparing the shame of her time in the Sleep Room to admitting to a stretch in prison.Sargant’s surviving patients believe he represented the epitome of patrician arrogance, echoing the way men have, throughout history, exerted control over women’s bodies. Suffering from a range of eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety, as well as postnatal depression, many were in their teens or early 20s during their treatment, which means they are now in their 70s. Sixty-year-old recollections can be unreliable, particularly those dimmed by repeated electric shocks and large doses of drugs. And there are those who will argue that memories set down while thoughts are distorted by mental illness are not real and should not be trusted. But the brain is a resilient organ. Sargant underestimated its plasticity, its resistance to being permanently “repatterned”. And now his patients, for so long neither heard nor believed, are ready to tell their story.‘I used to gaze at the dead-looking women lying on the floor on grey mattresses, silent’Celia ImrieView image in fullscreenCelia Imrie was admitted to the hospital at 14, when she had anorexia.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianMy poor mother used to come and visit me every day when I was an anorexia patient on ward five at the Royal Waterloo. It was 1966 and I was only 14 at the time. There were moments when she sat down beside my bed and I didn’t even know who she was. At other times, they wouldn’t let me see her because I was still struggling to eat my midday lunch at 2.30pm. It was like being in a prison camp. They are horrible memories, as you can imagine, and sometimes I struggle to recall exactly what happened.I was brought up in Guildford, the fourth of five siblings. My mother was a true-blue aristocrat; my father was born in a tenement block in Glasgow. He went on to become a successful doctor, dentist and radiologist, who worked at the Royal Surrey County hospital in Guildford. I think it was embarrassing for him to have a daughter who starved herself.I was put on heavy medication as soon as I arrived on ward five. Three doses of liquid Largactil daily. I can remember the tumbler cup quite clearly. The side‑effects were startling. My hands shook uncontrollably for most of the day, and I’d wake up to find clumps of my hair on the pillow. But the worst consequence was that everything I saw was in double vision. When Sargant came into the room, there were two of him. It was horrific.I was injected with insulin every day, too. Sargant was a big believer in fattening up his patients to get them well, and you soon put on weight with insulin. I think I had what was called “sub-coma shock treatment” – you weren’t given enough insulin to induce a hypoglycaemic coma, but it was enough to make you drowsy, weak, sweaty and hungry.Some years back, I tried to find my hospital records, to see the details of my treatment. Unfortunately, Sargant seems to have taken away a lot of his patients’ records, including mine, when he retired from the NHS in 1972. Either that, or they were destroyed. I can’t remember ECT happening to me, but I can remember it happening to others.I vividly recall the strange cry she made as her tormented body shuddered and jerked – the scent of burning hair and fleshAt one point during my stay I shared a room with another woman and I witnessed her having electric shock treatment right next to me. I vividly recall every sight, sound and smell. The huge rubber plug jammed between her teeth; the strange, almost silent cry, like a sigh of pain, she made as her tormented body shuddered and jerked; the scent of burning hair and flesh. It was a terrible thing for a 14-year-old to witness. Afterwards, Sargant came into our room and said in front of the woman, “Well, if we hadn’t caught her, she would have been out of the window.”The Great Man was very grand when he came on his ward rounds, tall, with an evil presence. The other doctors and nurses all bowed and scraped – they were in thrall to this self-appointed god of psychiatry. He was brusque and cold, and he never talked directly to you. Instead he issued orders over your head, talking about “this one” and “that one”. But that was preferable to making eye contact with this proud, incorrigible man with his hard, dark eyes.I remember having to go over to St Thomas’ hospital and be paraded in front of a theatre full of students as part of one of Sargant’s “grand round” presentations. He was there in the middle of everyone, with me, addressing a group of medical students. I can’t remember exactly what Sargant said, but I suspect he boasted about the insulin I was being given – and possibly the electric shocks. I had to take my clothes off because the students had to see how thin I was.Being taken to the loo is another memory – I clearly wasn’t able to walk on my own. And at some point I went down the end of the ward to look at the Sleep Room. I used to peer through the portholes in the swing doors and gaze at the dead-looking women lying on the floor on grey mattresses, silent, in a kind of electrically induced twilight. I can remember the distinctive smell, too – the smell of sleep.I can’t be sure if I ever spent any time inside that room, but I can picture it so clearly. And, although I saw many female patients come back to the ward from there, I never saw anyone emerge from the place awake. You went in asleep and you came out asleep, and you were totally unconscious while inside. So you wouldn’t necessarily be aware that you’d had the treatment. Today, I must accept the very real possibility that I was taken there. Certainly the insulin treatment that I received was often a precursor to narcosis. Like the electric shocks, I have to assume that it might have happened to me, even though I can only recall it happening to others.I do know that lobotomy – or leucotomy, as the doctors called it – was a very real threat. I distinctly remember patients on the ward with big bandages on their heads, barely able to walk.Many years later, I went with friends to see Coma. It is a second-rate film starring Michael Douglas and Geneviève Bujold, in which Bujold discovers a ward full of patients suspended in hammocks in drug-induced comas. When we came out into Leicester Square in London, my friends were laughing at the silliness of the plot, but I had the shakes and it took me some days to recover. They probably thought I was coming down with something. In fact, it wasn’t until much later that I realised why that film had upset me so deeply.Sargant continues to cast a long shadow over me, 60 years later. Even today, I can still see his face so clearly; his ape-like features. And sometimes I go to the depths of despair for no real reason. Most of the time I manage to pull myself out of it, but there’s no question that Sargant damaged me in some way.‘Waking up after a dose of ECT was absolutely terrifying. I didn’t even know who I was’Mary ThorntonView image in fullscreenMary Thornton (pictured with her husband John) was admitted at 20, for anxiety treatment.Photograph: courtesy of Mary ThorntonMy memories of ward five are a series of detached snapshots. Electrodes attached to the side of my head; being given a general anaesthetic; seeing an image of myself in the mirror one day, a strange face staring back at me. It was early 1971 and I was barely 20. I understood that I was being treated for an acute anxiety state. And, as part of that treatment, Dr Sargant would give me continuous narcosis to help my head have a nice long rest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionInitially, I stayed in a single room along a narrow corridor. Ward five was mostly for female psychiatric patients, but I can distinctly recall a tall, thin man wandering up and down, singing Hello, Dolly! endlessly. I was given ECT soon after my arrival. I was also given Largactil – we used to call it the liquid cosh – and Haldol, another antipsychotic.My parents used to bring me cigarettes, and I was allowed two during meals. There was never enough time to smoke those damn things. I remember the baths, too, because the doors had a horrible peepy hole in them so that the nurse could take a look at you while you were having a bath.In the early days, my boyfriend John would come and take me out for a walk on the Embankment. One day, he came in and I didn’t recognise him. I had no idea who he was. The ECT and drugs had destroyed my memories of him. He was so upset that he stormed into the Great Man’s office to confront him. Reaching across Sargant’s desk, he tried to strangle him, shouting, “What the fuck have you done to my girlfriend?” Sargant must have pressed a panic button, because John was grabbed by two beefy orderlies, who threw him out on to the Embankment and told him never to return. After that, I forgot all about John until much later.It was then, I think, that Sargant decided it was time to move me into the Sleep Room. During narcosis, we slept continuously, only woken every six hours for meals, washing and toileting. We were also given an anaesthetic followed by ECT, but I have no memory of this – it’s what I’ve since read and been told. As for the Sleep Room itself, I can clearly recall the darkened ward. I can remember the smell. The stink. There were six divan beds, low on the ground. I was in the one on the left-hand side.I could have had as many as 24 shocks but I can’t be certain because my memory was obliterated by the treatmentI was on ward five for 12 weeks in all, and received ECT throughout my stay there. Waking up after a dose of it was absolutely terrifying. I felt complete and utter terror because I didn’t even know who I was, or what my name was … I remember rubbing my temples and feeling these sort of dry salt patches where they had put the electrodes on either side of my head. Apparently, Sargant used to give it to people in my state at least twice a week, so I could have had as many as 24 shocks. I can’t be certain, though, as my memory was obliterated by the treatment. I have tried in vain to track down my records. For six to eight of those 12 weeks, I was in the Sleep Room. I remember the end of my bed being up on bricks, and some kind of enema being dripped in very, very slowly. What was that all about?Incredibly, Sargant only lost five of his patients through his inhumane narcosis treatment. But there must have been patients with other complications, intestinal ones, for example, if they were kept asleep, without exercise, for months on end. In later life I certainly had horrible problems with my gut, and with various obstructions, which led to me losing half my bowel and ending up with an ileostomy, where your small intestine is brought through an opening in the abdomen to allow waste to exit. I can’t  help feeling that my time in the Sleep Room is at least partly responsible for my subsequent medical problems.One memory of the Sleep Room that I used to think was false and imagined, but I now know to be true, was that if the ECT and narcosis were to fail, I would be given a lobotomy. That would be the next course of treatment for me. I was absolutely terrified at the prospect. I had it in my head that this was going to happen if I didn’t pull my socks up, and fast. They had tried to persuade me to visit occupational therapy. I hated stuff like making baskets and fiddling around with bits and pieces. But then I thought, if I don’t play ball, I’ll never get out of this place. I have no recollection of leaving there after three months, or who came to get me, or anything.After I was released, I was sent to my eldest brother in Yorkshire. He was a dentist and had five children at the time. One day, while staying there, I suddenly remembered there was someone in my life called John. I must have found his phone number in my luggage or something. I rang him and said, “Can you meet me at King’s Cross station?” It must have been a big shock for him because he’d been told I’d never come out of hospital. Thankfully, I recognised him, and six months later we decided to get married. We brought up four children in Brampton, Cumbria, and I went on to run an antique shop from my house before going into teaching. Sadly, John died in June 2021 after many years of fighting cancer. I miss him dreadfully.Anxieties have haunted me for most of my life, but I don’t get depressed. And I’ve always had an interesting relationship with food – it’s a lot better now than it used to be. But I can’t deny that I have had a life of pain since I left the Sleep Room. For over 15 years, I was addicted to fentanyl. That’s another story, and one that’s made me angry for a long time.‘I remember a block of rubber being placed in my mouth and jelly rubbed into my temples’Linda KeithView image in fullscreenLinda Keith, a ‘pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict’, was admitted at 23 because ‘my parents wanted a house-trained lapdog’.Photograph: Rex/Evening NewsI was a wild child of the 60s, and from a ridiculously young age I’d had a passion for R&B music. I first met Keith Richards when I was 17 and he was 19, and he wrote the songRuby Tuesday about meafter we’d split up. As a model, I worked with all the great fashion photographers of the time, including David Bailey. By the time I met Jimi Hendrix, in 1966, drugs had become a big part of my life. Within a year, I had become a detached and elusive spectre.My parents always referred to me as “being ill” rather than the more accurate description of me: a pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict. What they wanted was a tame, house-trained lapdog. They couldn’t face my real afflictions, which is why, in early 1969, when I was 23, they sought out completely the wrong person to cure me: Dr William Sargant.My parents drove me past his house on Hamilton Terrace in St John’s Wood to persuade me what a great man he was. They even gave me his book – as if, by reading it, I’d consented to his treatments. I couldn’t read a page, and refused to see him. No way was I going to be violated by his brutal methods, but my parents had already contacted him, describing me as being ill with depression.I wanted to sort myself out in my own way, but I knew it would take a great deal of soul-searching. Going cold turkey at some point was also inevitable. I didn’t want to do it just yet, so I went out to score – one more time. When I returned, I headed straight up to my bedroom and got myself high. Everything was fine and then the peculiar sensations began. My head felt enormous, full of fluid, red and bloated, my eyes seemingly popping out of their sockets. Then I had a fuzzy feeling, like pins and needles, and my tongue started to feel too large for my mouth. And then I realised that I was struggling to breathe. I phoned 999 but couldn’t talk, so I had to find my parents for help. I put a towel over my ridiculously elongated tongue and grunted at my  parents as I handed over the phone. The paramedics gave me a shot of something, and the facial paralysis weakened. My tongue went back to its normal size, too. I agreed, in my terrified state, to see Sargant.My parents arranged for me to be admitted to ward five under his care. I have no memory of getting there or of being put to sleep in his Sleep Room. All I know is that I didn’t wake up for six weeks. My memories are necessarily patchy, dim recollections from when I was woken up to be fed, washed or be given ECT. The room was in almost complete darkness, except for a small pool of light from a dim lamp. It was eerie. Silence, apart from the moan of sleeping patients, as many as eight of us crammed close together. I was in the first bed on the right, behind the door.They must have assumed I was delusional: ‘Been hanging out with Jimi Hendrix in New York, have you? Of course you have’We were woken every few hours to go to the loo and be fed. It was a twilight world, and I have a tinge of fear even now as I force myself to think about the enormous amount of ECT that I was given. I have no idea how they dealt with my withdrawal from drugs. I’m guessing that the cocktail of medication they gave me to put me to sleep tempered my physical withdrawal symptoms. I had no understanding of what was going on or being done to me. Time didn’t exist. I had been rendered completely helpless, but I was strangely aware of my helplessness at some unconscious level.After my narcosis treatment, I was taken from the Sleep Room to a small room on ward five overlooking Waterloo Bridge. My memory of these few months is also limited – just vague impressions. But I do remember being taken in a van with other patients over to St Thomas’ to have ECT twice a week. It was the same anaesthetist every time: a good-looking man, tall and kindly, who would always say, “Small prick coming.” It made me laugh every time.I remember a block of rubber being placed in my mouth and the contact jelly rubbed into my temples. Then I was off. I never recalled anything of the shock itself and would come to in the recovery room shortly afterwards. There were so many patients being treated with ECT – it was like a conveyor belt. I must have had almost 50 ECTs in total during my entire stay. I count myself lucky, blessed even, to have a full complement of faculties today, in my mid-70s.Only once was there a glimpse of the old me. My mother told me later that I had managed to manipulate her into bringing in my passport for some practical administrative reason. Somehow, I managed to get myself to New York and the Salvation Club for a private gig that Jimi Hendrix wanted me to attend. Once I had my passport, the rest was a breeze. A car was waiting for me outside the hospital, arranged by Jimi, and I was whisked off to Heathrow and on to a flight to New York. I arrived just in time to go to the club. I have little recollection of the gig or the rest of the night, but I do remember telling everyone that I was in a psychiatric hospital in London. I also took some drugs. Of all things, I took Tuinal, a sleeping pill. It’s what people took in clubs before Mandrax.Don’t be afraid to cry – or to interrupt: doctors’ tips for making the most of your medical appointmentRead moreThe next morning, I found myself on a plane bound for London. I dutifully rolled up to the Royal Waterloo and rang the bell. I’d become so institutionalised that I wanted to return to hospital. I suppose nobody believed where I’d been – they must have assumed I was delusional, like a lot of Sargant’s patients: “Been hanging out with Jimi Hendrix in New York, have you? Of course you have.”My time in the Sleep Room left me hugely mentally incapacitated. I couldn’t make any decisions on my own. I needed help to choose what clothes to put on in the morning, what to order in a restaurant, and what to do with myself during the day. Most shockingly of all, I could no longer read. I recognised letters and words, but they made no sense to me, so I gave up. I watched television instead and sat with my parents like the dutiful lapdog they had always wanted me to be. I wasn’t happy or unhappy – I wasn’t there. It was as if my brain and personality were dead. I have no idea if my parents were satisfied with the new me, or whether they regretted Sargant’s brutal annihilation of my character.Once, after my release, I had an outpatient appointment with Sargant at his private practice at 23 Harley Street. He was a huge man, tall, with an ugly mouth. My parents called him dapper. I asked him when I might read again, and he said he didn’t know. No one had had as much ECT as me, so he had no frame of reference. I found this horrifying, but not as much as what happened next – he actually came on to me. Tried to hug me and kiss me on the mouth. I wasn’t as docile as he expected and lashed out. I ducked and ran, hitting him sideways, and he went over on to an ottoman pouffe in the middle of the room. He was lying sprawled on the floor as I made my exit.I sometimes wonder what I would say to Sargant if I saw him again. Probably what I said when I saw him on Bond Street a few years after he’d stopped treating me. He thought he was being very friendly and that I’d be thrilled to see him, but I called him a monster – to his face. I said it to the person walking past me, too.“This man is a monster.”And then I walked on.This is an edited extract from The Sleep Room by Jon Stock, published by The Bridge Street Press on 3 April at £25.

That is an example of harassment and bullying at scale.”On Tuesday, Prince Harry quit as patron of the charity. He released a joint statement with co-founder Prince Seeiso ofLesotho, claiming they had been forced to step down “in support of and solidarity with” the board of trustees who had also resigned, due to a dispute with Chandauka, which reportedly arose from a decision to focus fundraising in Africa.Harry and Seeiso wrotethat the relationship “broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation”.Sky News reported that one of its sources, who is “close to the former trustees of the Sentebale charity”, said that Chandauka’s accusation that she was bullied by Prince Harry and the “Sussex machine” was completely baseless.Accusations and resignations mark remarkable 24 hours at charity founded by Prince HarryRead moreIn a statement earlier this week, Chandauka said: “There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.“Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to the press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued.”Sentebale was set up in 2006 by Harry after spending two months in Lesotho during his gap year in 2004.The prince’s acrimonious departure from the charity comes five years after he told a Sentebale dinner party in 2020: “When I lost my mum … you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long. Together, you have given me an education about living, and this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could ever have imagined,” he told dinner guests. “We are taking a leap of faith, so thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step.”Representatives for Harry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAfricaCharitiesAids and HIVMonarchyLesothonewsShareReuse this content"

Tebbutt was shot dead. His wife was taken into Somalia andreleased following a ransom payment six months later.View image in fullscreenJudith Tebbutt spent six months as a hostage in Kenya. She believed Kololo had been scapegoated by Scotland Yard detectives.Photograph: APKololo, who is now in his mid-40s, is seeking compensation from the Met, accusing the force of providing misleading evidence to a Kenyan court that played a key role in his wrongful conviction. The first stage of the case will be heard at the Central London county court on Friday.Emails seen by theObserverreveal that theHome Officeauthorised the deployment of Met police officers to Kenya despite knowing the case could result in the death penalty.Reprieve, a legal charity representing Kololo, said the decision violated government rules against providing assistance that “might directly or significantly contribute to ... use of the death penalty, both the imposition of the death sentence and executions”.Preetha Gopalan, Reprieve’s head of UK litigation, said a series of emails between the Home Office and Foreign Office, released after a subject access request, showed a “level of panic” about Kololo having been sentenced to death for the offence of robbery with violence.Kololo, a young father who worked as a honey-gatherer and woodcutter on the island where the Tebbutts were holidaying, was accused of directing the gang behind the attack to a hut where the couple were sleeping.Judith Tebbutt later told theSunday Timesshe believed that Kololo was innocent and had been scapegoated by Scotland Yard. Kololo’s lawyers have accused former detective chief inspector Neil Hibberd, who has retired, of omitting key information that cast doubt on the prosecution’s allegations that a footprint linked Kololo to the crime scene.Reprieve said a Kenyan court was not told that the Met Police’s analysis of a partially washed-away imprint on a sandy beach had been inconclusive. Kololo did not fit a pair of shoes presented as a match for the footprint during his trial, and said he was barefoot on the day in question.Gopalan said the Met’s support for the prosecution and Hibberd’s evidence in court was “the nail in the coffin to secure the conviction”. She added: “His conviction rested heavily on the footprint, but the whole time, the Met had analysis that undermined the evidence.”An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that Hibberd would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct if he were still a serving officer, but that it could take no action after his retirement.Emails released by the Home Office to Reprieve also show that officials were warned in 2012 that “the death penalty remains on Kenya’s statute books and may be available for one of the offences”, but went on to authorise the Met deployment for the case.“The death penalty was mandatory for this offence,” Gopalan said. She added that there was a moratorium on executions in Kenya at the time, but this was “not a sufficient assurance”.The Foreign Office advised the Home Office that it would “not be seeking explicit assurances on the use of the death penalty from Kenyan authorities” because the moratorium made it a “low risk”.Gopalan said Kololo’s trial had also been structurally unfair because he did not have legal representation and had to cross-examine 20 witnesses, including Hibberd, himself. He was illiterate and did not have an interpreter for proceedings that were not conducted in his first language.View image in fullscreenAli Kololo with his sisters after his conviction was quashed.Photograph: ReprieveKololo said in a statement via Reprieve: “Being sentenced to death was torture in itself. It’s by sheer luck that I was able to come out of prison with my mind intact. I pray for my case to succeed so that I can live like other human beings.“I used to work hard to look after my family but my time in prison has left a big gap, which is very difficult to fill. My health has deteriorated and I cannot go back to doing the work I used to do. I have to struggle to provide for my children and look after my mother.”Gopalan said the Metropolitan police should “put its hands up” over the case, apologise and pay appropriate compensation. “[Kololo] is lucky to be free and to be able to mount a claim, but the question remains: is this still happening?” she said.“Is the UK government continuing to provide this kind of assistance to countries around the world and becoming complicit in human rights violations because they haven’t learned the lessons from the past?”Home Office minister Diana Johnson said last week: “Under Section 26 of the Police Act 1996, the Home Secretary is responsible for providing consent for the deployment of all serving police officers and staff from England and Wales forces overseas and where advice or assistance is being provided to a foreign agency. The Section 26 process is a rigorous process undertaken by officials ... exercising due diligence on any proposed police deployments, including that assistance overseas meets the UK’s human rights obligations and values.”The Metropolitan police said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsKenyaThe ObserverMetropolitan policeHome OfficeAfricaPoliceTrial by juryCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

As the three are not completely aligned, only 30-40% of the sun was obscured when viewed from the UK.0:36Partial solar eclipse visible across northern hemisphere – videoRobert Massey, the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, speaking from the town of Lewes, Sussex, said: “There’s a really nice crowd of people, everybody’s really excited. There’s people wearing eclipse glasses, looking through the telescopes we’ve got set up.“We’re loving it and it’s a lot of fun. It’s a great public atmosphere, it’s a really nice event. There’s a huge amount of enthusiasm about it.”Partial solar eclipse live: moon blocks part of sun for people in northern hemisphereRead moreMassey added: “As expected, the moon started moving in front of the sun about an hour ago; it’s got a bit under an hour to go and it’s blocking out some of the sun.”Skygazers across a broad swathe of the northern hemisphere had a chance to see the moon appear to take a bite out of the sun as the eclipse swept from easternCanadato Siberia.View image in fullscreenLiverpool, England.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAImo Bell, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said at 11.15am: “There’s been nothing unexpected, but that’s the cool thing, we’ve known this has been coming for a very long time.

If you’ve got good weather, you’re pretty lucky.”Jake Foster, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory, said: “These eclipses, whether they be partial or total, it is effectively watching the clockwork of the solar system in action.”The Met Office said earlier on Saturday that southern and eastern areas of the UK would have the best viewing conditions, with cloudier skies in the north and west.View image in fullscreenHalifax, Canada.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe partial eclipse, which is the first of the year and the 17th this century, lasted about four hours from 8.50am GMT to 12.43pm GMT.The next partial solar eclipse visible in the UK will be in August 2026, which is expected to reach 90% obscurity.However, it will be visible as a total solar eclipse across much ofEurope, including parts of Spain. The next total solar eclipse visible from the UK is in 2090.Explore more on these topicsSolar eclipsesSpaceThe moonLondonCanadaGreenlandAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Witness reports and social media footage suggest extensive damage in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second biggest city, where buildings, religious sites and main roads were either destroyed or damaged.1:24Rescue operations underway in Thailand and Myanmar after earthquake – videoMyanmar’s military junta said 1,644people had been killed and 3,408 injured, while a further 139others were missing. Six deaths have also been confirmed in Bangkok, the Thai capital, where a high-rise building under construction collapsed, trapping dozens of workers. A further 26 are injured and 47 still missing.The update came after rescuers pulled a woman alive from the wreckage of a collapsed apartment building in Mandalay, 30 hours after a devastating quake hit Myanmar.View image in fullscreenYe Aung accompanies his wife, Phyu Lay Khaing, to hospital after she’s rescued from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/GettyPhyu Lay Khaing, 30, was brought out of the sky villa condominium on a stretcher by rescuers and was embraced by her husband, Ye Aung, and taken to hospital.“In the beginning I didn’t think she would be alive,” Ye Aung told AFP. “I am very happy that I heard good news,” said the trader. The couple have two sons:William, eight, and Ethan, five.A Red Cross official told AFP earlier that more than 90 people could be trapped under the remains of the apartment block.The Thai authorities are using drones fitted with thermal-imaging technology to search for survivors and believe there are indications that at least 15 people are still alive.‘Our town looks like a collapsed city’: Myanmar earthquake – in picturesRead moreThe Junta chief in Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing, issued a rare appeal for international aid, suggesting deep concern over the damage, and declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions.Several countries, including Malaysia, Russia and China, have dispatched rescuers and relief teams.Many humanitarian agencies have been cutting back their programmes in Myanmar after Donald Trump’s cuts to the US Agency for International Development.The World Food Programme’s country director, Michael Dunford, said it could be “days and weeks” before the true scale of the damage in Myanmar, which has been gripped by conflict since a military coup in 2021, is known.View image in fullscreenPeople gather near a collapsed building in Mandalay in the aftermath of the earthquake.Photograph: Myo Kyaw Soe/APHe said: “This was a highly complex, extremely difficult operating theatre before the conflict. This catastrophe – and it really is a catastrophe – is simply going to make it more so. Already a third of the population requires humanitarian assistance. That number is inevitably going to rise.”Since seizing power in a widely opposed coup in 2021, the junta has struggled to control an armed resistance movement to its rule, which is formed of a patchwork of groups, including civilians who took up arms to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed organisations that have long fought for independence. The junta has suffered humiliating defeats on the battlefield, with a BBC study estimating that it has full control over only 21% of Myanmar’s territory – though it does retain control of big cities such as Mandalay.The junta has repeatedly been accused of blocking humanitarian aid to areas where its opponents are active. Agencies that are delivering aid must obtain travel authorisations from the military, which has in the past been repeatedly accused of blocking humanitarian aid.It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in more than a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of miles away from the epicentre.View image in fullscreenRescuers work on a collapsed building in Bangkok, Thailand.Photograph: Lauren DeCicca/GettyCrews worked on Saturday in the capital Naypyidaw to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday.Bangkok city authorities said more than 100 engineers will inspect the city’s buildings, after it received more than 2,000 reports of damage.While there was no widespread destruction, the shaking brought some dramatic images of rooftop swimming pools sloshing their contents down the side of many of the city’s towering apartment blocks. Hospitals, hotels, offices and high-rise condos were all evacuated.One woman delivered her baby outdoors after being moved from a hospital building, while a surgeon also continued to operate on a patient after evacuating, a spokesperson told Agence-France Presse.But the worst of the damage was in Myanmar, wherefour years of civil warsparked by a military coup have left healthcare services severely overstretched.Map showing earthquake’s locationRescue teams have been deployed from China and Russia, two of the isolated junta’s only allies. A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached Yangon early on Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Russia’s emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass.India also sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as provisions, while Malaysia’s foreign ministry said the country would send 50 people on Sunday.The United Nations allocated $5m (£3.9m) to start relief efforts. President Trump said on Friday that the US was going to help with the response.India, France and the EU offered to provide assistance, while the WHO said it was mobilising to prepare trauma injury supplies.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had spoken to Min Aung Hlaing, the Chinese embassy said, while state media reported he had “expressed deep sorrow” over the destruction and said China was “willing to provide Myanmar the needed assistance to support people in affected areas”.The military regime has called for blood donors as public hospitals in the Sagaing and Mandalay regions have become overrun with patients.Images on social media have shown scenes of devastation, including collapsed buildings, and volunteers scrambling to rescue those trapped beneath rubble.View image in fullscreenA man looks at the collapsed Maha Myat Muni pagoda in Mandalay after the earthquake.Photograph: EPA“The whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake,” said a witness, who asked not to be named. “The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun.

This government has taken action,” he said.“You don’t like it, do you? It is terribly sad, but it is the record you are responsible for.”Sivaraman said during an economic crisis, it was often migrants who were left without social or economic support.“What we should be doing is talking about how economic inequality exacerbates racism – rather than using economic inequality, exploiting it through racist rhetoric.”Particularly around an election campaign, he said, he was concerned such rhetoric could inflame tensions across communities.“If someone … uses racist rhetoric or dehumanises migrants to exploit an economic insecurity, that will lead to migrants and people of colour not being treated with equality, dignity and respect,” he said. “That’s what history shows us.”Sivaraman’s comments followed a broader anti-migration debate across parliament in recent months, with calls from the Coalitionto introduce a referendumto give politicians the power to deport criminal dual citizens, and to change the citizenship test to include questions on antisemitism.On 19 March, spurred on after a video emerged of two Sydney nurses allegedly threatening Israeli patients, Dutton said it was time to “assert our values” by changing the test.“If you give a pledge of allegiance to our country and it turns out that you hate our country, or you want to harm people in our country, what should be the consequence?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dutton denied the accusation and described the remark as “offensive and unparliamentary”, and Steggall later withdrew it “to assist the house” – though shelater told Guardian Australia she stood by her comments.The opposition leader has continued to attack Labor over arrivals from Gaza since 7 October, alleging they have arrived without adequate checks.“[The] minister [for home affairs, Tony Burke] is bringing in 3,000 people from a terrorist-controlled zone with no security checks,” he said on 13 March.Speaking generally, Sivaraman said political debates such as those surrounding the voice referendum and Covid-19 had seen the “bile of racism” spill out into the public forum.“Every time we have these ruptures in our society we see the bile of racism just pouring out,” he said.“During Covid: anti-Asian racism; during the referendum: anti-First Nations racism; more recently: antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian [and] anti-Arab racism.

And they are actually earthworms, albeit magnificent ones.Their size is truly remarkable, says Dr Beverley Van Praagh, a species specialist. A garden variety earthworm might be the length of your finger, whereas an average giant Gippsland earthworm is longer than an outstretched arm, its body as thick as a thumb.“To be really honest, little worms kind of freak me out,” she reveals, “they’re all squiggly and squirmy.” These earthworms don’t move like that, she says, they move slowly and gracefully.The giant Gippsland earthworm can grow up to 3 metres in lengthYet despite their immense size, a song is needed, as you won’t see these introverted invertebrates on the campaign trail, if at all.Giant Gippsland earthworms live underground in burrows, in small, isolated colonies scattered across 40,000 hectares (98,842 acres) in south-eastern Australia, and rarely come to the surface.Mysterious and vulnerable: the secret lives of Australia’s giant wormsRead moreExperts prefer not to dig them up, as doing so causes harm.“There’s an old rumour that if you cut a worm in half, you get two worms,” says Simon Hinkley, the collection manager of terrestrial invertebrates at Museums Victoria Research Institute.Don’t even think about doing that with a Gippsland giant, he warns. “If you cut a giant Gippsland worm in half, or even nick it, it’s not going to survive.”Instead, scientists study the species by stomping about on the surface and listening for the sucking and gurgling of live worms squelching through their subterranean tunnels.“The worm in the burrow gets a fright, and pulls back, retracts back down its burrow to go deeper,” Hinkley says, producing a sound like water draining from the bath. “As far as we know, nothing else makes that sound.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The lead was a 6ft specimen, which lifted its head inquiringly for the camera, according to newspaper reports at the time.Seventy-five years later they starred again, alongside Sir David Attenborough inLife in the Undergrowth, who declared them “one of the rarest and most extraordinary of all earthworms”.These giants have little need for such notoriety. These elusive animals seem to prefer a humble life, a colony of one or two worms might occupy a patch of suitably moist slope or creek bank as small as 10 square metres.Hinkley says: “Everything about them is big and slow.”The Gippsland worm is thought to live tomore than 10years, possibly even 20, and produce only one amber-coloured egg cocoon each year, which emerges about 12 months later as a 20cm-long big baby.Patient, gentle and understated.

We intend to run a very serious campaign,” Albanese said, standing alongside Labor’s candidate in the seat, Ali France.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDickson sits on a margin of 1.7%, which means it is eminently winnable, at least, on paper.With Labor strategists expecting losses in Melbourne and New South Wales, the government needs to win in other states if Albanese wants to retain majority government.But the choice of campaign location on Saturday was less about electoral arithmetic than about sending a message:Dutton, we’re coming for you.Coalition weak spotThat Albanese chose a Medicare urgent care clinic was no coincidence.Health is a perceived strength for Labor and a perceived weakness for the Liberal leader, who was once named Australia’s “worst health minister” by doctors after he attempted to introduce a$7 GP co-paymentunder then prime minister Tony Abbott.Dutton has tried to neutralise those attacks, matchingLabor’s $8.5bn boost to Medicare(and promising a further $500m for mental health) and its investment to slash the price of PBS-listed medicines.But Labor still sees a vulnerability, one which Albanese, his health minister, Mark Butler, and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, sought to ruthlessly expose on Saturday morning.This was a political equivalent of a full-court press; a prime minster and two of his strongest performers hammering their opponent on his home turf.In his budget reply speech, “Peter Dutton tried a new version of the promise he made to Australians 10 years ago that there would be no cuts to health,” Butler said, claiming – without evidence – that Dutton would introduce an American-style health system.“There might be some fancier words, but it’s just as hollow.”Chalmers went personal, calling outDutton’s decisions to dash to Sydney for a harbourside fundraiserwhile both of their Brisbane communities braced for Cyclone Alfred.“When 5m homes in south-east Queensland and northern NSW were at risk and were in harm’s way … this prime minister came to Queensland to see how he could help,” Chalmers said.“Peter Dutton fled Queensland to see if he could raise money in a harbourside mansion in Sydney. Peter Dutton might be from here, but he is not as committed to the people and the local economies of Queensland as this prime minister.”2:49Voting 101: The Australian election has been called, here’s what that means for you - videoChalmers, not surprisingly, omitted the fact thatAlbanese had attended a political fundraiserin Sydney himself earlier that day before flying to Queensland.At one point, a far-right agitator interrupted Saturday’s press conference to heckle Albanese about housing and immigration.The man was peddling an agenda but the disruption drew attention to a pair of politically sensitive issues for Labor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He didn’t need to, so clear and obvious is the spectre of Trump and his America-first agenda over the global and domestic economies and Australia’s federal election.Australia and the rest of the world are bracing for“liberation Day”on 2 April, when Trump will unveil the targets for his retaliatory tariffs.US drug companies are stalkingAustralia’s PBS-scheme. Albanese had a message for them, too.“We’ve put a very clear message to anyone who’s listening, wherever they are in the world. Our PBS is not up for negotiation,” he said.Labor won’t win Hinkler and – barring a major upset – it won’t win Dickson either.It is in the box seat in Eden-Monaro in southern NSW where Albanese made a pit stop on Saturday afternoon to promise $16m for a local pool.But Albanese’s opening day wasn’t about winning seats.It was about sending messages.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsLabor partyAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonCoalitionanalysisShareReuse this content"

The US president has already announced plans for25% levieson imports of cars, steel and aluminium to the US.One vital battleground now is over Washington’s threat to impose blanket reciprocal 25% tariffs on all countries that impose VAT on US exports. These countries include the UK and EU nations. The US does not impose VAT on its imports.graphicThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned last week that a 20% increase in tariffs between the US and the rest of the world would cut UK growth by 1% and “entirely eliminate” the £9.9bn of fiscal headroom that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restored in the public finances by a painful programme of welfare and other cuts in herspring statement last week.Starmer appears to be waiting to judge how to react, based on the level of any tariffs imposed on the UK.He is said by government officials to be ready to “act in the national interest” if Trump does hit the UK hard. But his team also says that he will be “pragmatic” if need be – suggesting he may not retaliate immediately, in the hope of talking Trump round over time and with the aim of creating the conditions for signing a wider UK-US trade deal.Starmer has already been warned by theLiberal Democrats against “appeasing” Trumpby reducing a major tax for US tech firms at the same time as imposing savage welfare cuts including on disabled people.Diplomats now say Starmer, who has refused to issue a word of criticism of Trump since his return to the White House, must be prepared to retaliate or run the risk that the US president simply deploys the same tactic again and again, knowing his opponent will not fight back.View image in fullscreenFormer British ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch said Keir Stramer should learn from the robust stance to Donald Trump’s tariffs by Canadian PM Mark Carney.Photograph: Sait Serkan Gurbuz/APSpeaking to theObserver, the former UK ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch said Starmer should learn from the experience over recent days of the Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, who appears to have softened Trump’s tariff threat by warning of strong Canadian retaliation and making clear his displeasure at the US president over this threats towards his country’s sovereignty – an approach that has lifted his Liberal party substantially in the polls. Carney said: “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.”Lord Darroch said: “It’s understandable that, faced with deeply damaging US tariffs on British cars, steel and aluminium, the government should think about concessions like reducing digital tax. But they need to be wary of giving Trump wins; tariffs are his all-purpose forcing mechanism and he’ll use them again and again if he sees them working. And they should note the dramatic turnaround in Canadian politics, where on the back of a robust and defiant response to US tariff threats, Mark Carney’s Liberals have gone from 14 points behind the Canadian Conservative party at the end of January to eight points ahead last week.”It is expected that Trump may impose less punitive tariffs on the UK than on member states of the EU, which he believes have taken an anti-US approach on trade over decades.João Vale de Almeida, former EU ambassador to the US and the UK, said he did not expect the UK to retaliate in the way the EU was bound to. But he said it was important that Starmer hit back in some way by criticising the way the US president used tariffs as a tool of policy.“He [Starmer] should at least condemn the tariffs, as they are bad for everyone,” Vale de Almeida said.In her spring statement last week, Reeves – who is said to oppose retaliating to US tariffs – said the “global economy had become more uncertain” but at no point mentioned that it was Trump who had fuelled the uncertainty and created the conditions in which a global trade war is now entirely possible.Carney, by contrast, has taken on Trump, telling him on Wednesday thatCanadawould retaliate against the US with tariffs of its own, potentially escalating a damaging trade conflict between the neighbouring countries. But Carney and Trump then sounded a more friendly note after a phone call on Friday. Carney’s office described it as a “very constructive conversation”, while Trump said in a social media post that the call was extremely productive.An Opinium poll for theObservershows that, after the spring statement, just 11% of UK voters expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months, with 23% saying it will stay the same and 61% that it will get worse.‘Down to the wire’: inside the UK’s crunch talks with the US as it bids to avoid Trump tariffsRead moreAbout 17% said they expected their finances to get better, 38% that they would stay the same and 41% that they would get worse.Voters in this country rate the UK economy relatively poorly compared with other large economic nations, particularly China. The UK economy is rated better than China’s by just 9% of UK voters, with 10% saying it is about the same and 43% saying it is worse. Only 15% say the UK economy is better than that of the US, with 16% saying it is about the same and 36% saying it is worse.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe ObserverKeir StarmerDonald TrumpTrade policyTax and spendingMark CarneyCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

As students we can’t,” Jade said.Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Tesla, Starbucks, KFC and X are among the US brands that have been cited as those to be shunned. Those questioned by pollsters also cited Apple, Microsoft, booking platforms Airbnb and Tripadvisor, Nike and Converse.Alain, 43, a pest controller, walked past carrying a Nike bag, having just bought new trainers. “I understand the boycott, but they are the best and they are what I always buy,” he said.View image in fullscreenAn anti-Musk slogan sprayed on a Tesla in Lyon.Photograph: Konrad K/SIPA/REX/ShutterstockWhat France’s consumers say and what they do are different matters, said François Kraus from pollsters Ifop, which carried out the study.“We are starting to see a sanctioning of the US and its policies in people’s attitudes, but there is a gap between the position people have in principle and what they do in practice,” Kraus told theObserver.The poll found leftwing Democrat sympathisers, those over the age of 65 and those with net incomes above €2,400 a month were most in favour of the boycott.“We found the one-third who say they are boycotting are mostly people who are well-educated and reasonably well off who are making a considered and informed decision. These are people who once they change their habits they stick to it,” Kraus added.“They are aware of transatlantic tensions and, as long as Trump is in office, they will beboycotting US products. It is difficult to see, however, what impact this will have in the long term.”The poll found the French were particularly angered by trade tariffs, Trump’s diversity and inclusion clampdown and the treatment of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump’s threats to raise import duty on French and European wines and champagne to 200% have also dampened enthusiasm for the US.Support for the boycott appeared to transcend social groups usually associated with political activism, the poll found. Kraus said the popularity of the US as a student, holiday and business destination is at a 40-year low.Today, 22% of those quizzed would like to study in the US compared with 48% in 2010. The number who want to live there has dropped from 30% to 22%, and only 20% now want to work in the US compared with 37% 15 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the aim was to encourage his compatriots to choose French and European goods over American products.“We hope the idea will enter people’s minds when they are in the supermarket and have to decide between two products 50cm apart, and they will choose a product that is in keeping with their values. Most French and European people will do this in silence, discreetly, instinctively,” Roussez said.Speaking on RMC radio, journalist Jean-Philippe Doux dismissed the idea of a boycott as “ridiculous”.Roussez disagreed: “It’s not about overthrowing Trump or the US economy – it’s about doing something, however modest, to redress the balance. It’s symbolic, and we know Americans are fond of symbols. We remember the freedom fries symbolism used during the Iraq war. Now we are using those same symbols against them.“Boycott is a strong and hard word but what we are really saying is buy French and European. Just as the Americans are saying ‘America first’, we are saying ‘France and Europe first’.“As an individual I feel I need to do something. I don’t care if it’s considered ridiculous. Economies are the sum of individuals, and I’m voting using my custom to choose French and European products for my future and the future of my children.”Out on the Grands Boulevards, plenty of French consumers seemed to want to be left to enjoy their Big Macs made from French beef and their chicken nuggets made from French fowl.Delphine, 35, a care assistant, said a boycott was a good idea in theory. “I don’t go to McDonald’s and I don’t drink Coke. While I might think twice about buying something from the US, there would have to be an obvious and not inconvenient alternative. In any case, it’s not like I’m going out tomorrow to buy aTesla.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverMcDonald'sCoca-ColaTrump tariffsProtestDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The party leader, Özgur Özel, claimed 2.2 million people attended.“They’ve detained hundreds of our children, thousands of our youths … arrested hundreds of them,” he told the crowds. “They only had one goal in mind: to intimidate them, terrify them, make sure they never go out again.”He added: “In theTurkeywe envision presidential candidates will not be imprisoned,” calling for the release of both İmamoğlu and jailed Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtaş, a former presidential candidate who previously ran for office from prison, after he was jailed nine years ago on terrorism charges.Earlier this week, Özel had called an end to nightly rallies outside Istanbul city hall, where hundreds of thousands attended while small groups of demonstrators frequently clashed with police. Security forces used teargas, water cannon and pepper spray on demonstrators, which Human Rights Watch described as an “unwarranted and unlawful use of police force”.“Turkey is facing one of its gravest sociopolitical upheavals in decades,” said Human Rights Watch. Student groups and other small groups of protesters have continued disparate street protests in the days since the demonstrations outside city hall ended.View image in fullscreenÖzgur Özel, the leader of the Republican People’s party, walks on stage during the protest in Istanbul, Turkey.Photograph: Burak Kara/Getty ImagesThe Turkish authorities have arrested 1,900 people in the 10 days since İmamoğlu was detained on corruption charges, before he was removed from office by the Turkish interior ministry and sent to a high-security facility on the edge of Istanbul.Many of those detained by security forces were seized in predawn raids, including 13 journalists. Ten photojournalists were arrested for covering the protests before being freed later in the week, hours before the justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, met reporters, offering a defence of Turkey’s record on press freedom.Around me in Istanbul there is fear on every face – but I see a resilience that refuses to die | Carolin WürfelRead moreThe BBC correspondent Mark Lowenwas deportedafter covering the demonstrations, before Turkey’s presidential communications directorate claimed he was expelled for not having press accreditation.

Two more Turkish journalists were also detained, as well as İmamoğlu’s lawyer, who was later conditionally released.Özel told the French daily Le Monde that Saturday rallies would become a weekly occurrence in different cities across Turkey, while the party would hold similar gatherings in Istanbul each Wednesday.Özel said: “We believe the arrests will slow down from now.”He added that he was “ready to take the risk of spending eight to 10 years in prison if necessary because if we don’t stop this attempted coup, it will mean the end of the ballot box”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British people tended these graves for decades, even laying flowers and wreaths for their former foes.View image in fullscreenMourners at the Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery in 1967.Photograph: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge Image ArchiveA historian has uncovered new details of this extraordinary relationship, and found that more than 7,000 German soldiers and prisoners of war were once buried in cemeteries near the British towns and villages where they died. Tim Grady, professor of modern history at the University of Chester, unearthed a previously overlooked pile of documents “wrapped in brown paper” in the German War Graves Commission (VDK) archives, which turned out to be interwar records about the graves from the German embassy in London that no scholar had ever consulted.After the wars, Grady said, there were so many dead soldiers scattered across the globe that people felt that tending to the war graves in their local area was a “tangible” way of overcoming the “horrors of war”.“If you can do something for the war dead who are close to you, perhaps other people will do the same for your loved ones, wherever they are buried,” he said.The policy of the Imperial War Graves Commission was to leave the bodies of British soldiers in the country where they had died, too, meaning thousands were buried in military cemeteries abroad rather than repatriated.Grady discovered that one British couple who lost their son in the first world war tended the grave of a German fighter whose plane came down near their home. “They’ve got this shared experience of loss that they feel is bonding them together with the other bereaved family,” he said.View image in fullscreenSix white wooden crosses mark the graves of German airmen buried in Plymouth’s Ford Park Cemetery.Photograph: Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge ArchiveMost of the time, however, it wasn’t a straightforward reciprocal arrangement, he said. “It was based on a kind of common humanity, coming out of the wars, where I think people wanted to try to build a better future and they saw caring for the enemy dead was a way to do this.”In Bishop’s Stortford, Herts, one family made it “almost their life’s mission” to look after the graves of 15 German war dead buried there. “They spent all their money tending these graves – they say they do it to comfort the mothers back inGermany, and as a basis for reconciliation.”There are even examples of people laying wreaths on German graves onRemembrance Day“because they want to unite them” with British graves, Grady said. Others left flowers or took photos of the graves for bereaved family members back in Germany, inviting them to visit.Some people also responded to letters German families wrote to local councils in the UK, asking for information after learning a loved one had died nearby. “And so you start to get genuine human contact between the two sides – and that breaks down barriers between the British and the Germans after both wars. That’s the initial basis for some form of reconciliation between the two populations that were enemies.”View image in fullscreenBurying the Enemy: The Story of Those who Cared for the Dead in Two World Wars by Tim GradyPhotograph: pr handoutBetween 1962 and 1963 the German government systematically exhumed almost all the bodies of their war dead from graves across the UK and reburied them in a single military cemetery on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire. But its efforts were met with unexpected resistance from British people who had, in some cases, been tending the graves for almost 50 years.“In one cemetery in Yorkshire, a local councillor saw the German team coming to exhume a couple of these German graves and he threatened to call the police,” said Grady, whose book,Burying the Enemy: The Story of Those Who Cared for the Dead in Two World Wars, was published last week.“He said: ‘You can’t take them. These are our Germans. We’ve been looking after them.’ And he tried to stop them. But the exhumation team had papers from the Home Office that say they’re allowed to do this. They can’t be stopped.”The graves of the German war dead in Britain played a crucial role in restoring relations between the countries after the world wars, Grady said.One RAF commander filled 12 wooden urns with soil from German graves near his base in Sussex, and sent the urns to the bereaved German families of those who were buried there. “One of them was an unknown pilot, so they couldn’t trace his family. The VDK has still got that urn sitting in its archive.”In Poole, Dorset, a British man who lived opposite a cemetery bumped into the widow of a Nazi bomber who had been shot down and buried there. “She was visiting her husband’s grave after the war.” After meeting at the graveside, they stayed in contact, exchanging Christmas cards and letters. “He tends the grave, laying flowers there and writing to her about how the grave is. He even ends up going over to Germany on holiday, and stays with her and her new husband.”In Montrose, Scotland, “lots of local people” welcomed the mother of a Nazi killed nearby in a plane crash, when she visited her son’s grave in the early 1950s. “Somebody wanted to drive her to the cemetery, somebody wanted to find her a hotel, someone else wanted to take her out for dinner. All to show her: we’re no longer enemies, we understand your loss, let’s work together.”Such connections were important for Anglo-German relations, Grady said, as they involved ordinary people and their communities. “Because the enemy bodies were buried locally, it forced people locally to recognise that the other side also experienced loss.”Explore more on these topicsSecond world warThe ObserverFirst world warGermanyNazismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreAsked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed the US administration did not think that “is ever going to be necessary”.“We think this makes sense, and because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we’re going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump-style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America,” Vance said.Greenland, a former Danish colony, is a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark and its foreign and security policies are run by Copenhagen.Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also hit back at Vance in a statement.“For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations,” she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.“The vice-president’s reference to Denmark is not accurate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four of the territory’s five parties signed the coalition agreement on Friday, which states on page one: “Greenland belongs to us.”The incoming prime minister,Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called for unity. “It is very important that we put aside our disagreements and differences … because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkJD VanceGreenlandEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpArcticnewsShareReuse this content"

We dealt with it positively and accepted it,” Khalil al-Hayya said in a televised speech.“We hope that the [Israeli] occupation will not undermine [it],” said Hayya, who leads the Hamas negotiating team in indirect talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the Hamas-Israel war in Gaza that erupted in October 2023.”Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said after “a series of consultations pursuant to the proposal that was received from the mediators, Israel conveyed a counter-proposal in full coordination with the US’’.Netanyahu’s government insists on the release of 10 of the 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, according to media reports quoting officials in Israel. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel, 58 remain in Gaza including 34 who the Israeli military says are dead. Hamas is reportedly open to releasing their bodies.In exchange, Israel is supposed to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Khalil added that Hamas’s weapons are a “red line” and it will not disarm as long as Israel’s military occupies Gaza.Israel is not actively participating in negotiations for a ceasefire deal taking place in Doha between Egypt, Qatar and Hamas, despite increasing efforts to reach an agreement before Eid al-Fitr.The news came three days after security sources told Reuters that Egypt, one of the mediators in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, had received positive indications from Israel over a new ceasefire proposal that would include a transitional phase.Last weekIsraelresumed its military operation in Gaza, shattering the calm of the ceasefire with Hamas. According to the Palestinian health ministry, 921 people have been killed in the renewed assault.On Saturday, Hamas’s armed wing released footage showing an Israeli hostage in Gaza calling on the government to secure his release, the second such video shared by the militant group within days.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group identified the man as Elkana Bohbot, who was abducted from the site of a music festival in southern Israel during Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war.The footage lasts more than three minutes and shows Bohbot speaking in Hebrew and repeatedly raising his hands in desperation as he pleads for his freedom.The Guardian could not verify when or where in the Gaza Strip the video was recorded.In the clip, Bohbot said the bombardment could cost him his life, and pleaded to be reunited with his wife and son.In a separate development, Israel’s militaryadmitted on Saturday it had fired on ambulancesin the Gaza Strip after identifying them as “suspicious vehicles”. Hamas condemned the attack as a “war crime” that killed at least one person.The incident took place last Sunday in the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.The Gaza health ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 have been wounded since the beginning of the war.AFP and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Attacks on medical staff, hospitals and ambulances are potential war crimes.‘This is no isolated event’: attack on Palestinian director brings rising settler violence into focusRead moreIsraeli troops had “opened fire towardHamasvehicles and eliminated several Hamas terrorists”, the military claimed in a statement to Agence France-Presse.“A few minutes afterward, additional vehicles advanced suspiciously toward the troops … The troops responded by firing toward the suspicious vehicles, eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.”The military did not say if there was fire coming from the vehicles.It added that “after an initial inquiry, it was determined that some of the suspicious vehicles … were ambulances and fire trucks”, and condemned what it claimed was “the repeated use” by “terrorist organisations in the Gaza Strip of ambulances for terrorist purposes”.The day after the incident, Gaza’s civil defence agency said in a statement that it had not heard from a team of six rescuers from Tal al-Sulta who had been urgently dispatched to respond to deaths and injuries.On Friday, it reported finding the body of the team leader and the rescue vehicles – an ambulance and a firefighting vehicle – and said a vehicle from the Palestine Red Crescent Society was also “reduced to a pile of scrap metal”.Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, accused Israel of carrying out “a deliberate and brutal massacre against civil defence and Palestinian Red Crescent teams in the city of Rafah”.“The targeted killing of rescue workers – who are protected under international humanitarian law – constitutes a flagrant violation of the Geneva conventions and a war crime,” he said.Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said since 18 March, “Israeli airstrikes in densely populated areas have killed hundreds of children and other civilians”.“Patients killed in their hospital beds. Ambulances shot at. First responders killed,” he said.“If the basic principles of humanitarian law still count, the international community must act while it can to uphold them.”On Friday, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) mourned the killing of Osama Al-Bali, a paramedic who served at MAP’s Solidarity polyclinic in Gaza.‘‘Osama, his wife, and their 13-year-old son were killed on 27 March 2025 when Israeli forces shelled their tent in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza,’’ read a statement from Map. ‘‘His brother’s family was also killed in the attack. MAP unequivocally condemns this attack and demands the immediate protection of all healthcare workers and civilians in Gaza.’’According to data from theUnited NationsOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least1,060 healthcare workershave been killed in Gaza since October 2023.Last week,Doctors Without Borders (MSF)condemned Israel’s killing of a Palestinian worker affiliated with the group in Gaza. MSF issued a statement announcing the death of 29-year-old Alaa Abd-Elsalam Ali Okal, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his apartment building incentral Gaza’s Deir al-Balah.Last December, four doctors were killed at Kamal Adwan hospital in besieged northern Gaza, after Israeli forces stormed the compound, killing and injuring dozens of people in surrounding areas.Israel has long claimed that Hamas was using ambulances to carry out their military operations.However, last January, the Israeli army admitted that its forces had also used an ambulance to infiltrate the Balata refugee camp in the city of Nablus, in the occupied West Bank.Five armed Israeli soldiers emerged from the vehicle and took part in a raid that resulted in the deaths of two civilians, one of them an 80-year-old woman.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is feared more than 90 people remain trapped there.graphicIn neighbouring Thailand Bangkok’s governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said the search for construction workers at the site of a collapsed 30-storey building in the capital would continue. “We believe that there are still survivors. We will do everything possible to rescue them,” he said on Saturday evening, adding that heavy machines, including cranes and diggers, were being used to clear access at the site. The building fell to the floor while under construction near the city’s Chatuchak weekend market.Drones and sniffer dogs have been deployed to identify signs of life. At least 10 people have died in Bangkok. Dozens more are missing.Myanmar’s ruling junta said in a statement that 1,644 people have now been found dead and another 3,408 injured. Others are still missing.Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued a rare appeal for international help on Friday, and declared a state of emergency across six areas of the country. Aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday with Russia and China, two of the isolated junta’s few allies, flying in rescue teams and supplies. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team, and Malaysia said it would send 50 people on Sunday.View image in fullscreenYe Aung accompanies his wife, Phyu Lay Khaing, on their way to hospital after she was rescued from a collapsed building in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesThe response to the disaster is complicated not only by communication outages and damaged roads, but also the conflict that has gripped the country since themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta has faced dogged armed resistance to its rule, formed of a patchwork of groups, including civilians who took up arms to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed organisations that have long fought for independence. It has lost swathes of territory, and responded with relentless airstrikes, which continued even after the devastating quake, including in Sagaing, close to the epicentre.The World Food Programme’s country director, Michael Dunford, said that coordinating a response to the disaster would be “very challenging”. He added it could be “days and weeks” before the true scale of the damage in Myanmar is known. An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said hospitals and health facilities had sustained “extensive damaged or destruction”, adding that there were “a severe shortage of medical supplies”.Major bridges, roads, universities, hotels, historical and religious sites and public buildings have also been heavily damaged or destroyed, according to reports cited by UNOCHA.The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, which was followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock, was felt across the region, and is the largest quake to hit Myanmar in decades.Myanmar’s junta chief invited “any country, any organisation” to help with relief and said he “opened all ways for foreign aid”.The junta has in the past repeatedly been accused of blocking humanitarian aid to areas controlled by its opponents. The Norwegian Refugee Council said “immediate and unhindered access for aid workers” would be critical.View image in fullscreenMotorists pass a building rocked by the 7.7-magnitude earthquake.Photograph: ReutersOn Saturday evening many in Mandalay prepared to sleep outside overnight, either because their homes had collapsed or they feared continued quakes.‘No one came’: Myanmar volunteers dig with bare hands to save earthquake victimsRead moreThe disaster comes at a time when many aid agencies are scaling back their work following Trump’s cuts to the US Agency for International Development, a major donor.

It’s the new era … and thank you for bringing me home and I’ve never been so proud to be an American citizen.”Hall added: “I just want you to know all the women in the Afghan jail, they always ask me: ‘When [is] Trump coming? … They just treat you like their savior. They’re waiting for you to come and set them free.”In response to Hall’s video, Trump wrote: “Thank you Faye – So honored with your words!”Hall was arrested together witha British couple, Barbie and Peter Reynolds.British media reported that the couple, in their seventies, had been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years, deciding to stay even after theTalibanseized power.Khalilzad’s post made no mention of the couple, whose family has pleaded for their release amid concerns over their health.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsiaQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

The two-storey building collapsed with dozens of children aged between two and four trapped inside. For hours, rescuers sifted through the rubble, searching desperately for survivors.“We were clearing the building using diggers and rescuing people with manual tools,” said Thar Nge, a volunteer. They needed better equipment – metal cutters and generators – but made use of what they had. Thar Nge helped carry a four-year-old girl to safety. She pleaded, over and over, for him to save her, he said. He held a bottle of water to her mouth before her dusty body was freed.The girl was among 12 children saved, along with four teachers. A further 16 children and a teacher were found dead. Thar Nge barely had time to feel any emotion.Afterwards, his team of 11 volunteers moved onwards across Kyaukse, one of many areas devastated by Friday’s earthquake.Similar scenes have played out across centralMyanmar, with teams of volunteers using anything at their disposal to free survivors, digging with their bare hands and crawling through collapsed structures, often with no safety equipment.The injured are taken to hospitals that were already overstretched before the disaster and are now completely overwhelmed. According to Myanmar’s military junta, more than 1,600 people have been killed and more than 3,400 injured in the quake.Aidagencies warn that it could take days or weeks for the real scale of the disaster to emerge.On social media, images have painted a picture of destruction – historic monasteries, pagodas and mosques in central areas crumbled or partially collapsed, the wooden stilt houses that surround the famous Inle Lake, in Shan State, flattened. There are pictures of apartment buildings, hotels, and roads, all damaged.Graphic showing the quake intensityOnline there are pleas too from desperate relatives. On Facebook a man in Mandalay called for help, filming a mass of concrete slabs, wooden beams and metal bars. His mother and children were beneath the rubble, he said. No rescuers had come.In another Facebook video a man, choked with emotion, prays for his mother. He sits beside her body, still trapped in debris, holding her hand.“Please go on to a good life, Mum.

A rescue worker there said teams had worked through the night, adding the most difficult thing was having to give up on people who were trapped.“I feel very heavy. There are still a lot of bodies to move. Not just move, but dig up,” said the volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous. Bodies were being sent to a morgue in the city, but there was no electricity there.In both Naypyidaw and Mandalay there simply weren’t enough teams to respond to all calls. “Charity teams and youths are collaborating to do rescue works. Yesterday, incidents happened everywhere. We have to manage with the human resources we have,” said Thein Min Tun, another volunteer rescue worker in Mandalay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The currency, the kyat, has since crashed and 15.2 million people – nearly a third of Myanmar’s population – are facing acute food insecurity.On Friday, the junta made a rare appeal for foreign aid. Aid agencies warn that coordinating the response will be complex. Key roads have been damaged, phone and internet are cut off, power is down and some airports closed. The military, which according to local reports continued airstrikes after the quake, also has a track record of blocking humanitarian aid from areas where its opponents are active.The junta is struggling to halt an armed opposition movement made up of pro-democracy civilian groups formed after the coup, as well as more established ethnic armed groups. It has lost control of swathes of territory on its borders. The junta does retain control of the main cities, including Mandalay and areas of the centre, though local people have little faith in its ability to respond to the disaster.View image in fullscreenThe offices of a construction firm lie in ruins after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar.Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock“There’s no management or public statements from the authorities. Government services did nothing; they just patrolled around the town yesterday,” said a local man who, like many, asked not to be named, fearing reprisals from the authorities. He said he was at Ramadan prayers at Ywar Taw mosque when the earthquake struck. “No one came to rescue us. We had to save people on our own.” He believes 28 people died at six mosques in his township, Yamethin.Mosques were especially vulnerable as some were up to 100 years old, he said, and the authorities, which are associated with the Buddhist Bamar majority, had not granted permission for the structures to be renovated.For now, volunteers do what they can. After the nursery, Thar Nge’s team went to a collapsed silk and fabric store where seven people were trapped, a restaurant where six bodies were recovered, a tea shop where two bodies were found, and a market where they discovered three more.They go back and forth from rescue sites to hospitals and cemeteries.Han Myo Aung, a fellow volunteer, said there was still an overwhelming amount of work, even if the chances of finding more people alive were low, adding: “We also need to demolish the buildings at risk of collapsing.”Their local hospital was still receiving patients but allocating them to an open space nearby, because of the risk of further collapse. The team had been overjoyed to find the children at the collapsed nursery, he said. But they are finding only about 10% of the people they rescue are alive.“This situation is very difficult, trying to save people from beneath the rubble,” he said. “We have never experienced a quake like this before.”Explore more on these topicsMyanmarThe ObserverSouth and central AsiaMyanmar coupEarthquakesAung San Suu KyiAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The 87-year-old also refused a number of offers to paint the lateQueen Elizabeth IIbecause he only paints people he knows.Speaking in an interview with the Times, before his latest art show, Hockney said of the king’s visit to his Marylebone home: “He came on Monday for about an hour. But I didn’t offer to paint him.”Of Elizabeth II he said: “It’s difficult to do the majesty … I thought, she is a genuinely majestic figure, and I just couldn’t see a way to do it.”The Bradford-born artist said in the interview that his pictures were better if he knew the subject “really well”, and he criticised Lucian Freud’s portrait of the late Queen. He said: “When you look at the queen, her skin is absolutely marvellous. It’s very beautiful skin. Well, he didn’t get that at all.”In the interview, Hockney explained that he had moved back to London from his former home in Normandy, France in 2023 because of “intrusion”, as “people kept coming round”.The 87-year-old painter’slatest show, called David Hockney 25, will open in Paris at the Fondation Louis Vuitton art museum and cultural centre.Hockney talked about the new paintings he had produced from his Marylebone home. One of his efforts, which he calls Play Within a Play Within a Play and Me with a Cigarette, is a pro-smoking message. “I’m nearly 88 years old and I didn’t think I’d be here. I’m still a smoker, but I’m surviving,” he said.“I read in the newspaper the other day that lung cancer was going up and smoking was going down. Well, what did that tell me? It told me that it wasn’t really smoking.”The outspoken artist also remarked on his perceived rise of officiousness: “People are getting very … bossy. There’s an awful lot of bossy people about now. They’re little Hitlers, aren’t they? And there’s lots of them. Bossy bossy boots.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What is this operation?“Is it a terror cell, is it a drug den they’re about to raid? No, it was two parents in a dispute with the school. I would like to know how [Hertfordshire police] made that decision, that that was the appropriate and necessary operation.”View image in fullscreenDoorbell footage of the moment six police officers arrived at the home of Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine in January.Photograph: Twitter/X/Times radioAllen had reportedly communicated to the school in May 2024 regarding the recruitment of a new headteacher but his queries were rejected.The school’s governors then reportedly wrote to the parent body about “inflammatory and defamatory” comments on social media, warning that the school would take action against anyone who caused “disharmony”.The Times reported that Allen and Levine communicated disbelief about the warnings on a privateWhatsAppgroup, and the school subsequently banned them from entering its premises. After their ban, the pair said they emailed the school “regularly” about the needs of their daughter, who is disabled.An officer warned the family in December, telling them to remove Sascha from the school, which they did the following month, a week before the arrests, The Times reported.Allen claimed he and Levine were not abusive and were never told which communications were criminal, which they said was “completely Kafkaesque”.Levine told Sky News that the incident remains “inexplicable” to her. “We cannot fathom what happened; it doesn’t make any sense. We made a few inquiries, we had a bit of banter on a WhatsApp group, and then we were arrested,” she said.A spokesperson for Cowley Hill primary school told the Times that they’re happy for parents to raise concerns as long as they do it in a “suitable” way.Hertfordshire constabulary added: “Following reports of harassment and malicious communications, which are criminal offences, a man and a woman from Borehamwood, both aged in their 40s, were arrested on Wednesday 29 January.“In relation to the police visit on 20 December, a complaint was submitted which was reviewed by our Professional Standards Department. It was deemed that the service provided by officers was appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceSchoolsWhatsAppHertfordshireChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

She said police seized attenders’ phones and laptops.Youth Demand describes itself as “a youth-led nonviolent civil resistance campaign demanding the UK stops arming Israel and cancels all new oil and gas granted since 2021”.The Quakers’ statement said they “strongly condemned the violation of their place of worship” and pointed to the stricter protesting laws brought in by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023, which they claimed were directly responsible for the raid.The Met police said it had arrested six people at the meeting on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. It said it arrested five other people for the same offence on Friday – four in London and one in Exeter.The police said those arrested were part of Youth Demand and claimed those attending the meeting were planning direct action in the capital next month.“Youth Demand have stated an intention to ‘shut down’ London over the month of April using tactics including ‘swarming’ and road blocks,” police said.“While we absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.”Police said all those arrested had been released on bail, except for one who was released and will face no further action.Quakers, a nickname for members of the Religious Society of Friends, follow a religious tradition that grew from Protestant Christianity in the 17th century.Quakers have a long history of supporting protest movements and nonviolence is one of their core beliefs.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is campaigning for Andrea Jenkyns, the former Tory MP, to become Reform’smayor of Greater Lincolnshirein the local elections on 1 May. Lowe comes up a lot when he’s “out footsoldiering” and is a popular figure, Elwick said.Another activist, Ian from Worcestershire, laughed when asked how he thought things were going. “Itwasgoing quite well, wasn’t it?” he said. “He’s had a bad press with theRupert Lowething, but one man doesn’t make a party I suppose, like the Tories with Boris. But I like his [Lowe’s] plain speaking, to be fair.”He hesitated. “Nigel is plain-speaking but he tends to go around the houses a lot.”May’s local elections will be the first big test of whether Farage’s party has managed to maintain its momentum from the general election. The party was polling at 26% last month, a pip ahead of Labour, and is standing candidates in most of the 1,650-odd council seats being contested in 23 councils in England, and for six directly elected mayors.Winning council seats is a way to increase its base of activists and potential candidates for the next general election, and Reform had billed the event at Birmingham’s Utilita Arena as the “biggest rally in modern political history”.Outside, protesters from groups including Stand Up To Racism and National Rejoin March waved EU flags, while Led By Donkeys put up images of Farage and Vladimir Putin saying “Vladimir and Nigel welcome you to Birmingham”.Inside, the Reform supporters – a mix of angular young men in sharp suits and pointy shoes, and older men wearing turquoise ties queuing for selfies with Lee Anderson – were buying “Make Britain Great Again” caps, rosettes and placards.When the event got under way there were plenty of empty seats in upper tiers of the 10,000-capacity arena, and only the first 10 rows of premium seats in front of the stage were full. But Reform’s opponents will not sniff at its ability to gather even 5,000 or 6,000 people to a political event on a Friday night – not many fewer than at Neil Kinnock’s Sheffield rally in 1992 or during Jeremy Corbyn’s 2016 leadership campaign.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage arrives at the rally on a JCB digger.Photograph: Jacob King/PAReform had decked out the arena with a vignette of how it sees modern Britain – a broken-down pub, rubbish on the streets, a dilapidated bus stop and a road strewn with potholes. David Bull, the former Brexit party MEP who Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, described to the crowd as a “modern day Larry Grayson”, toured the set and interviewed some of the mayoral candidates, who includeArron Banks. The Leave.EU founder is standing for the West of England and described himself as being “as popular in Bristol as a pork pie at a bar mitzvah”.Farage arrived on the footplate of a JCB digger, which turned out to be a “Pothole Pro”, he told the crowd. It had been lent to him by JCB’s founder, Anthony Bamford – a longtime Tory donor who recentlygave Faragea helicopter flight worth £8,000 – and can apparently fix potholes for half the price of other diggers. Councils could use them if they weren’t “tied in to five- and 10-year contracts with inferior providers, but we’ll fix that, won’t we, when we control those county councils”.A question for Farage’s party is whether or not he can broaden Reform’s appeal beyond a base that has different priorities and concerns than the rest of the country, and is closer to Donald Trump’s supporters.Polling by Opinium shows that Reform voters are more pessimistic about the economy than the rest of the UK: 80% of Reform voters think things will get worse over the next 12 months, compared with 60% of all voters. And they remain much more concerned about immigration than others, with 77% putting it as one of the most important issues facing Britain compared with 39% overall. Previous polling has revealed them to be more sceptical about sending British troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers and more positive about Trump.Like Trump, Farage has been holding a succession of events – Birmingham was just the latest and largest – and the MBGA caps and razzmatazz production values were matched by some Trumpian policies. He pledged to create a “British form of Doge”, Elon Musk’s controversial cost-cutting unit, to pay for “the cuts that people deserve”, and said civil servants would bebanned from working from home. He took aim at net-zero policies, complained about inheritance tax, promised to end “unskilled migration” and got a standing ovation for the line: “Everyone who comes here illegally will be deported.”He finished to another standing ovation, but there had been a brief moment of dissent during the two-and-a-half-hour rally, when Lowe supporters shouted his name. It may be mentioned again over the next five weeks.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe ObserverNigel FarageRupert LoweLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Elliott Ingram, an expert in digital security, was stunned when a CCTV camera installed at his home recorded a hooded thief stealing his Hyundai Ioniq 5 car in less than 20 seconds.The thief is believed to have used a device, available online, to mimic the car’s electronic key. It is the latest in a spate of thefts involving the vehicle, and many owners now resort to a steering lock. Ingram’s car was later recovered by police, but he is terminating the lease and seeking compensation from the motor company. He says the South Korean car giant should have alerted customers to the security vulnerabilities.“This security system has been completely blown open, so anyone can attack it,” he said. “It’s no longer fit for purpose.”Hyundai promotes the convenience of its digital and smart keys, which allow motorists to lock or unlock the doors and start the engine while carrying just a key fob or digital key. The new technology includes several security measures but can be defeated by criminal gangs.Ingram discovered a key emulator device being marketed online for €15,000 (£12,500), which claimed to be able to gain entry to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and a number of other models. The physical appearance of the device is based on the Nintendo Game Boy games console, and it can be operated in either English or Russian. “The device records the signal from the car and within 10 seconds to two minutes completely [duplicates] the native one,” says the website promoting the device. “The key can be stored in the device’s memory. Open, close, start and go at any time.”TheObserverrevealed last yearthat the car industry ignored warnings more than a decade ago that keyless technology risked a surge in vehicle thefts. Experts warned keyless systems could be “successfully undermined” and vehicles stolen without forced entry.Ingram, 38, who lives in north London, says Hyundai had warned him of other modifications the vehicle required, but failed to alert him and other motorists that its security systems were compromised. He intends to file a claim against the company over the theft unless he receives compensation, citing a breach of the Consumer Rights Act. In a letter to Hyundai, he wrote: “The thief was able to enter the vehicle and steal it effortlessly in seconds. Had I been informed of this specific security risk, I could have taken additional deterrent measures, such as installing a secondary immobiliser or using a steering lock.” He said the motoring manufacturer should “urgently inform” its customers of the vulnerability and ways to avoid theft until the security risk is remedied. Hyundai said in its response to Ingram that there was an industry-wide issue of organised criminal groups deploying electronic devices to illegally override smart key locking systems. It said it was working with police to understand more about the devices and track vehicles as possible.View image in fullscreenCCTV footage shows Elliott Ingram’s Hyundai Ioniq 5 was stolen in less than 20 seconds.Photograph: Elliott IngramHyundai said its vehicles met all the required security standards for the UK market, and it was developing updates to reduce the risk of keyless thefts. It said vehicles sold from February 2024 have the latest updates to “mitigate” risk and it was working on offering retrospective action to customers with cars placed in the UK market before February 2024.Car thefts in England and Wales have risen from 70,053 in the year to March 2014 to 129,127 in the year to March 2024, a rise of 84%. According to the 2022 to 2023CrimeSurvey for England and Wales, remote devices were used by offenders in 40% of vehicle thefts.Under the crime and policing bill currently going through parliament, a ban on the electronic devices used to steal vehicles with keyless ignition will be introduced. Under the new laws, anyone who is found in possession of such a device, or to have manufactured, imported or distributed them, could receive five years’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine.Ministers hope the new laws will disrupt the distribution of car theft devices to organised crime groups. The RAC says car thefts are driving higher insurance costs and the new laws “cannot come soon enough”.Ken Munro, a founding partner of Pen Test Partners, a cyber security testing house, said car manufacturers were improving car security, but there was a lucrative criminal industry in designing products that exploit “cracks” in the technology. “The average car thief doesn’t need to be a hacker,” he said. “They just need to buy a product that allows them to hack and steal a car.”Hyundai said it was working hard to combat the thieves, but was not planning a recall of any vehicles. “The software and hardware updates that we have and are implementing will significantly reduce the risk of this particular form of vehicle theft occurring in the UK,” said a spokesperson. “However, this is a race against very determined, well-funded individuals who stop at nothing to steal vehicles for multiple purposes.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringThe ObserverCrimeConsumer affairsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The organization employs about 300 people.Others retained for now are regional vice-presidents who will be working with the staff in their areas to return to the US, according to one employee who was affected.An executive order last month from Donald Trump targeted the institute, which seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, and three other agencies for closure. Board members, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and the institute’s president were fired. Later, there was a standoff as employees blocked Doge members from entering . Doge staff gained access in part with the help of the Washington police.A lawsuit ensued, and the US district judge Beryl Howell chastised Doge representatives for their behavior but did not reinstate the board members or allow employees to return to the workspace.A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, said in an email Saturday that the institute “has failed to deliver peace” and that Trump “is carrying out his mandate to eliminate bloat and save taxpayer dollars”.The letter to employees said that as of Friday, “your employment with us will conclude”, according to one longtime employee who shared part of the communication. A second email, obtained by the AP, said the terminations were at the direction of the president.Workers were given until 7 April to clear out their desks.Mary Glantz, a former foreign service officer who was working as a senior adviser at the institute, said she was not surprised by the late-night firings, calling it part of Doge’s playbook.Glantz studied how Russia has fomented conflicts around the world and analyzed options for resolving them. She hoped her research could be continued and used elsewhere. She said the institute plays a unique role because of its narrow focus on conflict resolution.“We are the other tool in the tool box,” she said. ”We do this work so American soldiers don’t have to fight these wars.”George Foote, a former institute lawyer fired this month who is with one of the firms providing counsel in the current lawsuit, said lawyers were consulting Saturday to discuss possible next steps. He said employees are not part of the pending lawsuit, so they would have to file separate cases.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this week, Columbia’s presidentannouncedshe would step down after Trump targeted the university for protests on campus last year.On Wednesday, Harvard’s interim dean of social science, David Cutler, said in an email to center affiliates that the Center for Middle Eastern Studies director, Cemal Kafadar, a professor of Turkish studies, would be stepping down by the end of the academic year, according to theHarvard Crimson. Rosie Bsheer, a professor of history, is also stepping down as associate director. Both are expected to remain in their faculty positions.Faculty members who spoke to theNew York Timesanonymously said they believed that Kafadar and Bsheer were forced out of their roles. Harvard did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.The executive committee of Harvard’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the departures in a statement to the Times saying that they were “abrupt termination[s]”.“In the context of recent events, the decision appears to be a shameful attempt to escape punishment from theTrump administrationfor engaging in academic discussions about topics the president disfavors,” the committee said. “These firings cede the university’s decision-making authority to bullies and bad-faith actors committed to silence speech with which they disagree.”The Center for Middle Eastern Studies has been under criticism for alleged anti-Israel bias. Posting on X, economist and former Harvard president Lawrence Summers praised the university for moving to replace the center’s leadership.“Even after egregious delay since it was pointed up right after October 7, I am very glad that Harvard is curbing its institutional support for anti semitism,” Summerswrote.Summers had earliercriticizedHarvard’s president, Alan Garber, on X as “lack[ing] the will and/or leverage” to fight the alleged bias. Summers specifically pointed to a panel that the center held in February on “Israel’s war in Lebanon” as being antisemitic.Garber replaced Claudine Gay , whostepped downas the university’s president in early 2024 after she was accused of plagiarism and was heavily scrutinized for her congressional testimony in 2023 about antisemitism on college campuses. Summers was openly critical of Gay and was initially supportive of Garber’s appointment as her replacement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each rally was locally organized with original themes. In Ireland, it was “Smash the Fash”, and Switzerland had “Down with Doge”. Photos posted to Bluesky by Tesla Takedown showed demonstrators inSan Jose, California, close to where Tesla was previously headquartered, andAustin, Texas, where its headquarters are now.Musk, the world’s richest person, heads the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), whichhe’s tasked with slashing federal budgetsin the US, including laying off thousands of workers, though he saidin an interview Thursday: “Almost no one has gotten fired.” He’s gone after the Social Security Administration, the Department of Education, the National Park Service and several more departments and agencies, causing widespread backlash and criticism. Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment.View image in fullscreenA protest at a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas, on 29 March 2025.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesIn San Francisco, a crowd of around 200 people gathered in front of the Tesla showroom. Protesters spilled into the busy street and onto the median, confusing the self-driving Waymos trying to get around people darting back and forth.A boombox blasted We’re Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister and cars drove by honking enthusiastically. Even passing postal trucks, public buses and fire engines honked in support. People propped up signs with slogans like “Burn your swastikar before it burns you” and “No Doge bags”. Others flew massive American flags mounted upside down.The block-long Tesla showroom was emptied of all cars, and only a few security guards stood inside, with some San Francisco police outside. At one point, a group of four men wearing red Maga hats and black Doge shirts walked through the crowd, but everything remained calm.“I’m out here protesting because what I see is a hostile takeover of our country,” said Myra Levy, who was holding a sign that said “Pinche Ladrón” (“fucking thief”). “That is not OK for me. That is not OK for all of us.”Her friend, Karen Heisler, emphatically added: “We did not vote for this.”View image in fullscreenProtester Myra Levy (on far left) at the San Francisco Tesla dealership in San Francisco on Saturday.Photograph: Dara Kerr/GuardianIn Berkeley, California, the Tesla showroom has shut down every Saturday for the last month because of the weekly protests, according to salespeople from neighboring retailers. Only security guards have stayed on to guard the building. It’s been the scene of lively demonstrations that have included a mariachi band and a 10-foot cardboard Cybertruck for people to spray-paint. Earlier this month, the showroom’s front door was splattered with red paint. The showroom manager declined to comment.In New York City, several hundred anti-Tesla protesters gathered outside the EV company’s Manhattan showroom on Saturday. Sophie Shepherd, 23, an organizer with Planet Over Profit, explained that the rally was not about protesting electric cars.“We’re here to protest Musk, who has essentially held a Tesla car show on the White House lawn,” she said. “We want to disrupt his business as much as possible, so that includes all Teslas, and not just the Cybertruck.”Marty, 82, said he was attending the New York City rally “because I’m worried about my country”. In the 1960s, he protested the Vietnam war. “Now, it’s the overthrow of our country by oligarchs,” he said. The rally, he went on, was a message to “this guy Elon who is buying our government”.On Friday, the New York police department said its officers were searching for two suspects who allegedly carved the word “Nazis” and a swastika on the doors of a Tesla Cybertruck in Brooklyn this week, part of an uptick inattacks on Tesla vehicles and facilitiesacross the US since Trump took office.View image in fullscreenA protest in London on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn Washington DC, organizers planned a rallyin front of a new Tesla showroom in Georgetown, making the theme “Tesla Takedown Dance Party”. “Dump the meme stock, join dance lines,” read the flyer. “The stakes couldn’t be higher but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun!”“The hypocrisy is so deep,” said Manissa Maharawal, an assistant professor at American University who has studied anti-tech protests and points out that Tesla hasreceived billions in government funding. “It’s this company that’s been subsidized in a lot of ways by the government, but now the CEO is trying to dismantle the government because he thinks he knows better than everyone, because he comes from the tech industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

States with the most planned rallies included Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Texas, Washington and California, totaling more than 100. Several protests also took place throughout Canada.In London, dozens of demonstrators gathered at a Tesla showroom along the three-lane A40 in West London.“Musk is hugely abhorrent. He is funding the far right, and meaning that any Republicans who speak out end up not being funded in their next election,” said gay rights campaigner Nigel Warner.“It’s too overwhelming to do nothing,” said Louise Cobbett-Witten, who has family in the US and was protesting at the Tesla dealership in west London. “There is real solace in coming together like this. Everyone has to do something. We haven’t got a big strategy besides just standing on the side of the street, holding signs and screaming.”Tesla Takedown organizers reiterated the need for people to continue to speak out and protest against Musk, Trump and Doge. The stakes are high and “no one is coming to save us”, they say on theirwebsite.Maharawal, from American University, said she was struck by that sentiment, saying: “For there to be a nationwide and global protest saying ‘no one’s coming to save us’ just speaks to the level of anger and desperation right now.”Eggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against MuskRead moreOrganizers have also been careful to distance themselves from the violent vandalism that has been carried out against Tesla showrooms. Dozens of Tesla facilities have beenattacked in the middle of the nightwith molotov cocktails, gunshots or graffiti saying things like “Fuck Elon” and “Tesla Is Fascist”.Trump has vowed to designate any violence against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism.Tesla Takedown organizers condemn the vandalism. “We are a non-violent grassroots protest movement,” the group says. “We oppose violence and destruction of property.

It may be a winning strategySat 29 Mar 2025 13.49 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 14.28 EDTShareWhen it comes to Trump-era scandals, the shameless responses to “Signalgate”, in which top administration officials discussing details of an impending strike in Yemen in a group chat without noticing the presence of a prominent journalist, should set alarm bells ringing for its brazenness and incompetence.In a particularly jaw-dropping exchange, Tulsi Gabbard, the United States’ director of national intelligence, was forced to backtrack during a house hearing after she had said that there had been no specific information in the Signal chat about an impending military strike. Then, theAtlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published the chat in full, contradicting Gabbard’s remarks that no classified data or weapons systems had been mentioned in the chat.Q&AWhat is Signal?ShowSignal is a messaging app founded in 2012 that allows users to transmit texts, photos, videos and documents, as well as make audio and video calls. It uses end-to-end encryption, which protects messages against hackers and cyberattacks via an extra layer of security. Several other privacy features, such as the ability to automatically delete messages, have made it popular among communities such as journalists and activists that frequently deal with sensitive information.Signal is run by the non-profit Signal Foundation and relies on donations to function, giving it a different business model than other encrypted messaging services such as Meta-owned WhatsApp. It does not track user data to the same extent as Meta and publishes its code to allow for public auditing of its security measures. Signal, like any messaging app, is still vulnerable to human error through methods like phishing attacks or  spyware which can allow hackers to gain access to users’ devices. The Signal Foundation’s president called the addition of The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief a user error rather than a problem with her app’s security.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there,” said Gabbard. “What was shared today reflects the fact that I was not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat.”Then there was the US secretary of defense,Pete Hegsethwho – staring straight down the camera – baldly stated: “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.” The next day, Goldberg revealed that Hegseth himself had texted the precise timing of the attacks and the weapons systems to be used, specifically F-18 jets and MQ-9 drones.It’s unlikely that anyone will be punished. Trump has told his aides that he doesn’t want to give the Atlantic a scalpAnd Michael Waltz, the White House national security adviser, was left scrambling on live television as he was quizzed by a Fox News anchor on how Goldberg’s number had ended up on his phone. “You’ve never talked to him before so how is the number on your phone?” asked conservative television anchor Laura Ingraham. “It gets sucked in,” Waltz, a former congressman and army special forces soldier, replied – without explaining how a number can get “sucked in” to a phone.But despite all this, no one is really taking the prospects of an investigation seriously. At heart, this is about politics – and the fact is that Democrats simply don’t have the votes or the sway to deliver a body blow to the administration at this point.It’s unlikely that anyone will be punished.Donald Trumphas told his aides that he doesn’t want to give theAtlantica scalp, and vice-president JD Vance responded forcefully during a trip to Greenland on Friday: “If you think you’re going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody you’ve got another think coming … I’m the vice-president saying it here on Friday: we are standing behind our entire national security team.”For decades, national security was broadly seen as the last bastion of bipartisanship in Washington, an area where Democrats and Republicans put aside their differences for a general consensus on supporting the national interest. Members of Congress on the intelligence and foreign affairs committees often maintained cordial relationships. There was also an understanding that big scandals could jump the partisan line, and lead to serious repercussions even with tensions between the parties at their highest.Scooter Libby, once chief of staff to vice-president Dick Cheney, was sentenced to prison after an investigation into the leak of the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame. The Department of Justice under Barack Obama launched more Espionage Act investigations for leaking sensitive information than all previous administrations combined.Hillary Clinton warns Trump ‘stupidity’ will leave US ‘feeble and friendless’Read moreAnd the FBI, of course, launched a years-long investigation into Hillary Clinton for keeping emails on a home computer server that ultimately may have helped sway the elections. “It’s not the hypocrisy that bothers me; it’s the stupidity,” Clinton wrote in aNew York Timesop-ed on Friday. “We’re all shocked – shocked! – that President Trump and his team don’t actually care about protecting classified information or federal record retention laws … What’s much worse is that topTrump administrationofficials put our troops in jeopardy by sharing military plans on a commercial messaging app and unwittingly invited a journalist into the chat. That’s dangerous. And it’s just dumb.”Observers have remarked that the scandal would have been far greater if it had taken place at a lower level in the intelligence community. Mid-level officers and defence officials would all face far harsher blowback if they were caught divulging the kind of information that Hegseth sent into the chat, including the specific timing of the strikes and the weapons systems to be used.But the Trump administration believes that it can simply divert and divide public attention until there is a new scandal. That may be a winning strategy. Trump is to introduce tariffs this week that will probably dominate the news agenda for weeks. And his deputies are out on cable news every day, pushing back at the media for covering the scandal and suggesting that Goldberg somehow sneaked his way into the chat rather than being added directly by Waltz, the national security adviser.“They have treated this as a media event to be spun rather than a grievous error to be rectified,”wrote Phil Klay, a military veteran and guest columnist for theNew York Times. The early indications are that the Trump administration will skate through this scandal, crossing into new territory in Washington where even a major security leak can be repainted as the fault of the media for covering it.Andrew Roth is the Guardian’s global affairs correspondent based in Washington DCExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakThe ObserverTrump administrationUS politicsPete HegsethUS national securityDonald TrumpSocial mediaanalysisShareReuse this content"

A male opened the door and immediately shut the door on the officers,” theAtlantapolice lieutenant Andrew Smith said, adding that police subsequently cordoned off the area to search it for a suspect.“During the process of establishing the perimeter, two males fled out of the rear of the house,” Smith said. “One male returned back into the house. The other male jumped two fences as he was fleeing. When officers located him on the other side of the fence, he appeared to have suffered an injury to his leg.”He added: “Just to be very clear, the injury that was sustained was not via the officers on scene. It was when the male was fleeing.”According to the medical examiner’s office, Bailey was taken to the Grady Marcus trauma center and died there from his injuries.His cause of death was not immediately determined, with an autopsy pending.Born in Waterboro, South Carolina, Bailey entered the hip-hop scene in Atlanta at a young age where he maintained a “consistent presence … during its commercial boom in the 2010s”, Varietywrote.Besides appearing on songs by other rappers including Future and Young Thug, Bailey worked with Juicy J, Kodak Black and Rick Ross.Speaking toComplex in 2013 about his creative process, Bailey said: “I don’t really care what I say on a beat as long as it’s about some money.“When you try to think hard and write it out, that’s when it’s gonna be fucked up.”Last March, he released one of his latest projects, Trap’s Last Hope, featuring songs including Grind Dont Stop, Ice Game, Free Bands and Letter to God.Explore more on these topicsAtlantaHip-hopUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Multiple Democrats have called for his resignation while a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to the defense department calling for an inquiry into the group chat.Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer Hegseth, has been present at two meetings where sensitive information was discussed, according to the Journal,citingmultiple people who were present at the meetings or have knowledge of her presence at them.Pete Hegseth’s Arabic tattoo stirs controversy: ‘clear symbol of Islamophobia’Read moreThe first meeting reportedly was a high-level discussion at the Pentagon with top UK military officials, including the UK secretary of defense, John Healey, that took place in early March, a day after the US announced it would stop sharing military intelligence with Ukraine.The second reportedly took place in Brussels in mid-February at Nato headquarters during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a forum of about 50 nations meant to help coordinate military support for Ukraine as it tries to fight off the invasion Russia launched in 2022.A defense secretary has the discretion to invite anyone to meetings with foreign counterparts, but officials cited by the Journal said that those attending these types of meetings usually have high-level security clearances. While the spouses of defense officials sometimes receive low-level security clearances, it is unclear whether Hegseth’s wife has any clearance.Hegseth’s wife is a former producer of the network television show Fox & Friends, where Hegseth was a co-host starting in 2017. The couple married in 2019.Hegseth also brought his brother, Philip Hegseth, a podcast producer, on official visits, according to the Journal. Philip Hegseth accompanied his brother to Guantánamo Bay and is currently with him during Hegseth’s tour of Asia.The defense department did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. In a statement to the Journal, department spokesperson Sean Parnell said that it is “pretty clear to me that [the Journal’s] story is going to be filled with inaccuracies and will not be written in good faith”.Chuck Hagel, a former Republican secretary of defense who served under Barack Obama, told the Journal that national security officials have to be careful about whom they invite to meetings with foreign counterparts.“If you are going to discuss top-secret, national-security issues, you have to be very selective,” Hagel said. “What’s the relevancy of the person you are inviting?”Though the Pentagon has largely pinned the blame for the Signal group chat leak on the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, Hegseth’s ability to handle the sensitive nature of his job as the top military official in the country has also been called into question. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered officials, including Hegseth, topreserveall messages in the Signal group chat.Republicans have largely defended Hegseth and havebrushed offthe group chat fiasco in public. But reports suggest that there are some who are privately concerned about Hegseth’s conduct.“You’re not going to hear a huge public outcry,” an anonymous GOP official toldPolitico. “But privately, there is a lot of concern about his judgment.”Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethUS militaryTrump administrationSignal group chat leaknewsShareReuse this content"

A reflection of her consistency, Sabalenka is the third WTA No 1 in history to reachthe finals of the Australian Open, Indian Wells and the Miami Open in the same year.Defiant Djokovic on verge of making more history against teenage starRead more“I’m speechless,” said the Belarusian. “The last couple of finals were really tough, tight and close ones for me. Going into this one I was so focused on myself, I was super-focused and I was playing point by point. Now it feels super-special. I’m just speechless right now and super-happy with the title, first one in Miami.”Over the past year, Sabalenka and Pegula have met in three of the five most significant hard court finals after their 2024 meetings at the US Open and Cincinnati Open. In both of those,Sabalenka overpowered Pegulawith her superior weight of shot despite considerable fight from the American.Sabalenka’s dominant performances en-route to the final further positioned her as the clear favourite. She faced two other top 10 opponents in the sixth seed Jasmine Paolini and the ninth seed Zheng Qinwen, plus the defending champion Danielle Collins, yet she did not drop a set in her six matches.After rain had delayed the start of play by an hour, the final began with a series of breaks as the initiative swung sharply between both players early on. It was Sabalenka who settled down in the second half of the opening set, first finding her rhythm on serve and then perfectly timing her best return game of the match. Up 6-5, Sabalenka picked Pegula’s serve apart, taking the set by breaking to love. “I’m super happy that I was there,” she said. “I was fighting no matter what.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As has been the case in most of their recent encounters, Pegula simply does not possess the variety of shot, defensive skills or comparable weight of shot to put this focused, determined version of Sabalenka under sustained pressure and she had no answer as the world No 1 took control of the second set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The competition’s newfound disdain for replays allowed Nottingham Forest to become the first team to win three consecutive FA Cup penalty shootouts. History was made, novelty was witnessed, but in a setting that emphasised the traditions of the grand old Cup. After Exeter and Ipswich, fell Brighton, and soForest matched the featof the Moroccan army side FAR Rabat, who beat MC Oujda, Wydad Casablanca and Rachad Bernoussi on penalties in successive rounds to win the Coupe du Trone in 2007.It was a game characterised by caution, reflecting both Forest’s habitual preference for a low block and Brighton’s wariness afterlosing 7-0 to Forest last month. But it also perhaps reflected how much both sides cared, a welcome, if retro, feature of the latter stages of the FA Cup this season.Nuno applauds Nottingham Forest after reaching Wembley FA Cup semiRead moreDefeat would have meant the loss of an opportunity that neither side could take lightly. Of the four sides involved in the first two quarter-finals, only one had won the FA Cup: Forest, who last won the Cup in 1959 when their opening goal was scored by Roy Dwight, Elton John’s cousin. This will be their first semi-final since 1991, when they beat West Ham.Brighton may have been in two semis in the past six years, but there is no sense of them being sated. Success both for them and Forest remains an improbable dream; each step further up the mountain opens up new vistas of possibility. They are not desperately clinging to achievement, grasping desperately at each trophy to stave off the fear of failure, hoarding silverware like a gloomy dragon in an Anglo-Saxon epic, which is how it often seems for superclubs.The sense of occasion, the yearning for a semi-final, was palpable and, as so often in the FA Cup, there was a self-awareness, the game played amid echoes of the competition’s past, as though conscious of its own history. One home fan had brought a cutout of the FA Cup, albeit one that, rather than being made of cardboard or plywood as it would have been in a Pathé clip, it was fashioned of foam and had an inflatable seagull dangling from it. There was even a homage to Ian Rush in the 1986 FA Cup final as Carlos Baleba’s flashed just wide and knocked over a remote-controlled camera.But this was also a very contemporary occasion, and not just because of the pyrotechnics that cast this thoroughly modern stadium in the rolling Sussex hills in a cordite-scented haze just before kick-off. Only seven of the starting XIs were British, an obvious contrast to the 1959 final, when the greatest exoticism was supplied by Bill Whare, Forest’s Guernsey-born right-back.That’s a curiosity that takes on greater significance when it is considered how many of them had played in World Cup qualifiers in the past week.A total of 13 players from the two squads were involved in action outside of Europe. Seven of them travelled more than 10,000 miles in doing so. And one of them, Forest’s Chris Wood, travelled over 23,000 miles in helping secure New Zealand’s qualification with wins over Fiji and New Caledonia. A hip injury sustained in the latter of those kept the centre-forward out.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s João Pedro and Nottingham Forest’s Murillo were on international duty together with Brazil.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe two managers, equally, were avatars of very modern types: Nuno Espírito Santo, a classic Portuguese pragmatist with an excitable backroom staff, and Fabian Hürzeler, a terrifyingly youthful German devotee of pressing football and loud swearing.They had both been sent offin the corresponding league fixture for their reactions to the sending-off of Morgan Gibbs-White.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPerhaps the most modern aspect of all, though, was the presence of the two players on the respective right flanks: Yankuba Minteh for Brighton and Elliot Anderson for Forest. It was the ever-industrious Anderson who seemed to have his ankle hooked by the trailing arm of Kaoru Mitoma midway through the second half, only for Peter Bankes to overturn his initial call of penalty following a VAR review – another intrusion of the modern into the palimpsest.Both were sold by Newcastle last summer, apparently for profit and sustainability regulations. It’s probably not great that there is an incentive for clubs to sell promising young local talent, like Anderson, that they have developed, and it’s certainly frustrating for Newcastle, but on the other hand, this might be an example of PSR ensuring a wider spread of talent than would otherwise be the case. It would be dangerous to draw too many conclusions from one season but the sense is this campaign has been that, Liverpool and the bottom three aside, the Premier League has been a far more level and competitive division than it has been for a decade.And then a final modern twist: not a replay but extra time and penalties. And this season in the Cup, in shootouts Forest have been impeccable.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverNottingham ForestBrighton & Hove AlbionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Japan’s Sara Shimizu took silver with 90.75, while Mitsuki Ono earned bronze with 88.50.“I think I’m back,” Kim said. “I really started to find the joy for the sport again, and that’s been a really positive change for me.”The victory guarantees Kim’s place at the Milano Cortina Olympics next February, where she will attempt to become the first snowboarder to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in halfpipe.Kim’s win caps a comeback season after a two-year break from competition. She stepped away following her second Olympic gold at the 2022 Beijing Games, citing mental health struggles and burnout. After returning to competition in January, she won the X Games in Aspen – tying Shaun White for most women’s SuperPipe titles – and became the first woman to land both frontside and cab double cork 1080s in competition.Saturday’s final was delayed more than two hours due to poor weather. Kim acknowledged the conditions took a toll on the riders.“Today was definitely a big mental battle, I think for all the ladies,” she said. “I definitely had a couple mental breakdowns during practice, so I’m just really happy I was able to land something.”View image in fullscreenKim soars on Saturday in St Moritz.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesHer second run served as a victory lap, during which she attempted a cab 1260 – another trick no woman has landed in competition – but fell on the landing.“My favorite part about a victory lap is trying to progress the sport and try to do the craziest run I’ve ever done,” Kim said. “I was hoping to put that down here, but next time.”Kim first won the world championship in 2019 and repeated in 2021.

She remains one of the most dominant and decorated athletes in the sport.“Chloe’s ability to push the progression of women’s halfpipe riding while staying consistent at the top is remarkable,” said US Snowboard head coach Danny Kass. “She’s not just winning – she’s reinventing what’s possible.”Kim has credited her renewed success to changes she made off the snow. She began intensive therapy last summer, a move she says helped her regain her confidence and perspective.“There was a time I couldn’t imagine competing again,” Kim said earlier this season. “Now, I’m having fun again. I’ve let go of what I think I’m supposed to do and just focus on what I love about snowboarding.”The remainder of the US women’s Olympic halfpipe team will be named in early 2026.Explore more on these topicsSnowboardingWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

We are united in our message: this behaviour is unacceptable and has no place in our league or in our stadiums.”Banda has faced similar before. In November, the Zambia forward was the focus of a wave of abuse after she was named the BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year for 2024. The unveiling of Banda as the BBC’s winner should have been a moment of celebration and it was, for herself, her teammates, fans, opposition players and the world of women’s football. But some – including JK Rowling and the former British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies – used it as an opportunity to perpetuate a narrative about the involvement of trans and DSD (differences in sex development) athletes in women’s sport.View image in fullscreenBarbra Banda vies for possession with Gotham FC’s Emily Sonnett. The Orlando Pride player was abused by members of the home crowd.Photograph: Jess Stiles/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockIt was also an opportunity to crucify the BBC, the public service broadcaster, despite the award being won on the basis of a public vote. But just the most cursory bits of research would have exposed the contradictions in information around Banda’s case.In 2018 and 2022 Banda was not selected by the Football Association of Zambia (Faz) for either of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, organised by the Confederation of African Football (Caf). The Faz president, Andrew Kamanga, told BBC Sport Africa in 2022: “All the players had to undergo gender verification, a Caf requirement, and unfortunately she did not meet the criteria set by Caf.”However, Caf said that it did not conduct testing on the player and that she had been withdrawn by Faz. BBC Sport​has since reportedthat two sources told them that Banda did not take a gender eligibility test before the 2022 tournament.At the time, her agent, Anton Maksimov, said she had not been banned or suspended by any governing body and said she had taken no tests. “She has not undergone and consequently has not failed any ‘gender verification’ or ‘gender eligibility tests’ administered prior to the tournament. Barbra is also perfectly healthy and fit.​”Multiple sources in a position to know have said the same to this reporter. Somewhere, someone was being economical with the truth and the evidence suggests that Banda, who was born and raised as a woman, is the victim of this misrepresentation of the facts.Orlando Pride’s sporting director, Haley Carter, brutally and concisely exposed the contradictions at play in those who condemned the BBC’s award for Banda. “For anyone worried about the safety of women athletes, especially in Zambia, here’s a cause to take up,” she said on social media, linking to articles about the grievance she filed with Fifa against Fazover a lack of carearound the midfielder Grace Chanda during the 2024 Olympics,allegations of sexual misconductmade against the Zambia head coach, Bruce Mwape, who denied the accusations, andthe death of Norin Betaniwhile in camp before the Olympics.View image in fullscreenBarbra Banda during Zambia’s game against Germany during the 2024 Olympics, at Saint-Étienne.Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/ReutersThere have been inconsistencies and inadequacies in reporting on Banda, but there has also been inconsistencies and inadequacies in the reporting on gender testing and research around it too. As in many areas of women’s health, the science on testosterone levels in women of different ethnicities, and in female athletes of different ethnicities, is limited. Most studies into testosterone levels are carried out on men and some have shown higher levels in African-American men when compared with white American men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The history of gender testing, which is gone into in depth in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation podcastTesting, is fraught with scientific holes and has contributed to a dehumanisation of those investigated.It was somewhat inevitable that other players would find themselves targeted in a similarly dehumanising way. Last month, it was the Chelsea and Colombia forward Mayra Ramírez who was the subject of a mountain of online abuse and querying of her gender. The evidence? Ramírez doesn’t look “feminine​” enough.The reality is that the chances of a trans woman being able to compete as a top women’s football player, while not zero, are extremely slim. They would have had to transition at a very young age, gone through the development pathways and worked their way up to be at the requisite level, or would have to have been a relatively good athlete competing in men’s football before transitioning mid-career and then attempting to play in the women’s game.What the hysteria over an almost impossible hypothetical situation does is open the door for transphobic and racist targeting of female football players and creates an environment that makes trans people, young trans people, or those questioning their gender identity at grassroots level feel as if they don’t belong in football or sport.For decades women have had to fight for the right to play sport and reap all the benefits – physical, social, mental, emotional – from it. Why on earth would we want to exclude trans people, some of the most marginalised in our society, from those experiences and benefits? The starting point in this discussion should be: how do we help everyone benefit from and enjoy sport? And how do we achieve that in a way that is safe and fair for all?Women’s football can be a safe and inclusive place because female footballers are vocal advocates for the positive impact sport can have on everyone. Let’s discuss that.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballNWSLGenderZambia women's football teamUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Aside from his one encouraging result, a supreme performance in hisAustralian Open quarter-final win over Carlos Alcaraz, the first few months of the year had been grim. Father time had undeniably gained ground on him.The hamstring injury Djokovic suffered against Alcaraz forced him to withdraw from hissemi-final against Alexander Zverevafter one set. After tearing hismedial collateral ligament at the French Openlast year, this setback marked his second grand slam withdrawal inside a year after two decades of good health.Miami breakout star Alexandra Eala has the world of tennis at her feetRead moreDjokovic looked well off the pace in his return to competition at the Qatar Open, then he was dumped out of the first roundin Indian Wells by Botic van de Zandschulp, a lucky loser. He started Miami on a three-match losing streak.With the exception ofhis Olympic gold medal, where he summoned his best through sheer force of will, 2024 was complicated for Djokovic. He was unusually blunt about his struggles in the aftermath of his early exit in California.“Things are different for me the last couple of years,” he said. “I’ve been struggling to play on the desired level. Every now and then, I have a couple of good tournaments, but mostly it’s really a challenge. It’s a struggle for me.”Few athletes have demonstrated the brand of resilience that has become second nature to Djokovic and this past week has underlined those qualities again. The 24-time grand slam champion put his head down and worked hard to find a way through. As a result, he now stands on the verge of more historic achievements.On Sunday, in the Miami Open final,Djokovic will face the Czech teenager Jakub Mensikas he attempts to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the third male player in the Open era to win 100 ATP titles. At 37 years and 10 months, Djokovic will also try to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 champion.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic’s partnership with his new coach Andy Murray (left) appears to be paying dividends.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesIt is also important to Djokovic that, rather than dragging himself to the final through sheer doggedness and mental strength, he has played quite well. He has not dropped a set in Miami and when things have become difficult he has summoned a high level of play.Having spent another four weeks working together, it is also clear the coaching partnership between Djokovic and Andy Murray has strengthened with time and familiarity. A victory in Miami would signify a significant breakthrough and a reflection of the work they have done together.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mensik, who, at 19, is 18 years the Serb’s junior, followed up his second-roundwin against the Indian Wells champion, Jack Draperby putting together an immense breakout tournament. He reached the final with another upset, edging out Taylor Fritz, the world No 4, in a third-set tiebreak. Ranked No 54 at the start of the tournament, the Czech will break into the top 30 on Monday.In his five wins in Miami, Mensik has shown he is blessed with a well-rounded game, including a potent forehand and solid athleticism. His success, however, has been dictated by his outlandish serve, which has been untouchable since the beginning of the tournament.As Djokovic attempts to add to his legacy in the final stretch of his career, he will have to neutralise yet another teenager determined to take him down.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicThe ObserverTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They also became the fourth Southeastern Conference team to reach a regional final, with the SEC joining the Atlantic Coast Conference (2016) and Big East (2009) as the only leagues to do that.Auburn will face Michigan State in the South Region final on Sunday, with a trip to the Final Four on the line. The Spartans held off Mississippi 73-70 in the first game of the night in Atlanta.Johni Broome scored 22 points to go along with 16 rebounds, but it was Pettiford and Jones who took control with Auburn’s season on the brink.The Wolverines (27-10) built their biggest lead, 49-38, and seemed headed for their most improbable performance yet in a remarkable comeback season under first-year coach Dusty MayMichigan State 73, Mississippi 70Jace Richardson scored 24 points and Michigan State surged past Mississippi in the second half for a victory in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16.Ole Miss (24-12) was denied in its bid for its first Elite Eight appearance despite leading by 10 points in the first half and by nine in the second half.Michigan State (30-6), the South Region’s No 2 seed, rallied to keep alive coach Tom Izzo’s bid for his ninth Final Four and second national championship. The Spartans will play No 1 seed Auburn on Sunday.Izzo, in his 16th Sweet 16, earned his 59th NCAA Tournament win, breaking a tie with Jim Boeheim of Syracuse for fourth all-time.Tennessee 78, Kentucky 65Zakai Zeigler had 18 points and 10 assists, and Tennessee outhustled and outplayed Kentucky on both ends of the court in a victory that sent the Volunteers to a second consecutive Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.The second-seeded Vols (30-7) beat their border rival in the first all-Southeastern Conference Sweet 16 matchup since 1986 and will play Sunday against Houston in the Midwest Region final.Chaz Lanier added 17 points and Jordan Gainey had 16 for the Vols, who lost twice to Kentucky in the regular season but prevailed on a much bigger stage this time.No one enjoyed the show at Lucas Oil Stadium more than Peyton Manning, who was back in the town where he spent 13 years and won a Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts. The Vols’ most famous sports alum was in a bright orange ballcap seated behind the bench as Tennessee ran off with a no-doubt victory in the “House Peyton Built”.Lamont Butler scored 18 points to lead first-year coach Mark Pope’s third-seeded Wildcats (24-12), who were held 20 points under their season scoring average. Their 65 points matched their fewest in a game this season.Houston 62, Purdue 60Milos Uzan soared for an uncontested layup on a beautifully executed inbound play with 0.9 seconds left, and No 1 seed Houston survived a late collapse to beat fourth-seeded Purdue in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.Houston led 56-46 with just under eight minutes remaining but made only one field goal from there until Uzan’s tiebreaking bucket. He inbounded the ball from the baseline to Joseph Tugler, who threw a bounce pass back to Uzan, and the 6ft 4in junior took it to the rim.Houston, the Big 12 regular-season and tournament champion, became the fourth No 1 seed to reach the Elite Eight. The Cougars haven’t lost since 1 February and won this time at Lucas Oil Stadium, where their 2021 tourney run endedwith a loss in the Final Fourto eventual national champion Baylor.Uzan scored 22 points and Emanuel Sharp had 17 as Houston survived an off night from leading scorer LJ Cryer, who finished with five points on 2-of-13 shooting.Fletcher Loyer scored 16 points, Trey Kaufman-Renn had 14 and Big Ten player of the year Braden Smith added seven points and 15 assists to lead Purdue (24-12).

Score again. Go back to Wembley again. Yeah. Did I mention Wembley? Eberechi Eze has had a fairly decent last five days of his footballing life, bookended here by a performance of supreme incision on a crisp, boisterous day in south-west London, when he was the very obvious point of difference between Crystal Palace and Fulham.Not just in his numerical contribution to Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win: a jaw-dropper of an opening goal, all thrilling, controlled power; followed by a proper, actual high-skill assist. But also in terms of style and a Palace system that leans right into its own strengths when all the parts function like this.Eze fires Crystal Palace to emphatic win over Fulham and into FA Cup semisRead moreFulham had the ball here but not the chances. Palace had a compact defence and quick transitions. Best of all they had Eze, by some distance the most luminous presence on the pitch. The second goal on 38 minutes killed the game. It was a perfect miniature, Eze taking the ball far out by the left touchline, surging inside, then producing just a tiny flash of the razor’s edge as Sander Berge blocked his path to goal.There were no stepovers or feints, just a switch of feet, Eze passing the ball to himself, one foot to the other, creating the space and delivering the cross in two rat-a-tat touches, with just enough deception – did you think I was a rightie? Here’s my left – and with nothing wasted, even the cross placed just right for Ismaïla Sarr to head into the corner of the net.It was Eze’s 10th assist of the season to go with six club goals. The last of these had arrived four minutes earlier from the same pocket of space. This time it was more obviously spectacular, Eze gliding inside, then gliding inside again, like a dancer hitting his mark, before shooting thrillingly hard and flat, the ball curling from outside the line of the far post before finding itself suddenly fizzing about in the back of the net.Those two pieces of skill settled the game. Best of all they were basically pulled out of the air, entirely distinct from the 86 minutes of noise either side. Eze has often been called a cage-baller or street player, with an idea his skills are homemade, maverick, unorthodox.In the early days at Palace, when Ray Lewington would come marching up to the touchline in his shorts just to yell at Eze, making sure he was running and covering, he did look a bit raw. Although, to be fair, it was hard to tell how much of this was just a function of having a man in shorts constantly yelling at him.Here he seemed utterly in control, physically stronger, and basically a nightmare to play against, sniping both ways with that startling lateral spring, the 360-degree scan in operation even as he’s easing past you. It is an elite level of skill. The real step up is, of course, to apply it every game, to be relentless, as Eze was here.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze shows off his maverick skills against Fulham on a day when the England international stood out above everyone else.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThis was a lovely English football occasion. Craven Cottage, which always feels like a boat trip or a picnic, was washed with chilly spring sunshine before kick-off. The perimeter was lit with tongues of fire, the air crackling with early-day excitement. The Palace end had even brought its red-and-blue balloons, a nice birthday-party-ish touch.For both sets of payers, both clubs and both managers this was a flag day, with no too-cool-for-school team rotation, no plates spinning on grander stages elsewhere. Fulham may have Europe on their minds. But this was basically everything for everyone here in that moment, a self-contained moment of theatre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is what the Cup demands. Find a way to win. Shake the day by its lapels. But even here the distinction between the two teams was clear. Fulham were vigorous but blunt, buzzing against the surface of the game like a fly on a window pane. For long periods their version of urgency was to play patient, passing football slightly more quickly.There were moments of mild disorder, There was also the reassuring sight of Jean-Philippe Mateta back on the pitch, albeit wearing a protective device described pre-match as a helmet. In reality this was something more pared back, a minor head-gusset, a low-denier stocking with bespoke ear-pad feature.Mateta played with energy and led the Palace breaks in that misleading style, a little rangy and loose, but always quicker than his frame suggests. Adam Wharton had an unusual afternoon behind him. He was combative and buccaneering, occasionally just making the game seem easy with the speed and accuracy of his passing, all the while looking like he might actually be playing with his hands in his pockets. But Wharton was also lucky not to get a second yellow card after a minor, harmless but stillverbotenkick that the referee missed.It was comfortable for Palace by the end. Afterwards, as journalists asked questions about Eze, as Oliver Glasner answered questions about Eze, a knot of children could be heard simultaneously chanting Eze’s name outside the press room. There was only one outstanding presence here, expertly deployed in that hard-running system. On this form Palace will be a match for any team left in their way. And Eze does like Wembley.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverCrystal PalaceFulhamanalysisShareReuse this content"

A not so subtle expression of soft Saudi Arabian power? A wonderful example of the synergy between a city and its football club? Or a Sunderland supporter’s worst nightmare?Saturday’s celebrations on Newcastle’s Town Moor staged to commemorate Eddie Howe’s team’sCarabao Cup triumph against Liverpoolat Wembley two weeks ago was all those things and much, much, more.Newcastle’s new stadium video gives added impetus to proposed moveRead moreIf the collection of the team’s first major domestic trophy since the 1955 FA Cup meant different things to different people it was also quite some statement. While around 200,000 fans crammed into a small area of the city centre towatch two open-top buses transport Howeand his players the short distance separating St James’ Park from the Town Moor, a further 150,000 gathered on an expanse of urban green space larger than New York’s Central Park.Only those who had applied for free, electronic tickets were admitted and, having passed security, they stood from 1.30pm until approaching 8pm, watching a re-run of the final on big screens before being entertained by not only local bands but – inevitably – by Ant and Dec.A little earlier that ubiquitous pair were aboard the buses conducting interviews relayed on those big screens. As a fan outside St James’ Park sat atop Sir Bobby Robson’s statue, and others balanced on the top of bus shelters or perched precariously up trees, Howe struggled to contain his emotions. “I hoped people would show up but this is unbelievable,” said Robson’s latest successor against a soundtrack of the cheers and “Toon Army” chants echoing well beyond Gallowgate. “I didn’t know what to expect today but it’s incredible. I can’t thank the people of Newcastle enough. It’s very emotional.”View image in fullscreenOne Newcastle fan greets the players from a unique vantage point on route.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThis, though was merely the warm-up for the main event – the moment when Howe and his squad took to the temporary Town Moor stage. It arrived at 6.30pm. By then the broadcasters’ helicopters overhead had filmed the sort of dramatic aerial shots of seething humanity that Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners would doubtless see as emphasising their ability to not merely shape a football club but an entire UK city.When Howe arrived on stage and lifted the cup his smile was as broad as the Tyne. “We’re desperate for more,” said Newcastle’s manager. “When you get a taste of something like this it makes you hungry. Hopefully this is just the start.”As Newcastle’s players took turns to hoist the trophy a day that had begun with fans queuing outside the club shop at St James’ well before its 9am opening was drawing to a close. No matter that the weather was chilly enough to necessitate supplementing the uniform black and white striped replica shirts with winter coats and woolly hats, this was a city feeling the power of the sun on its back after finally emerging from a footballing ice age.Although the celebration was ostensibly “dry”, many attendees warmed up with a few drinks in the packed bars of Gosforth and Jesmond, two suburbs within walking distance of the Town Moor.View image in fullscreenTwo dogs don black and white stripes.Photograph: Harriet Massey/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesAmid multiple road closures and public transport chaos the city drew, happily, to a standstill as an extraordinary, uniquely monochrome, festival unfolded. Even the mannequins used to promoted the latest spring women’s fashions in the city centre window of Fenwick department store were dressed in black and white.Outside John Lewis, shoppers queued to have their photographs taken alongside a replicaCarabao Cupwith the excitement of children waiting for a Christmas audience in Santa’s grotto.More hardcore, if ticketless, fans milled around St James’ Park as lengthy queues built up around the Town Moor. Attendees frequently encompassed three or four generations of the same family as fans from as far afield as Australia, North America, Kenya and South Korea mingled with locals who view Sunderland as a foreign country.Back in town, pavements filled with fans already in position for the bus parade, with the more enterprising lining the ramps of an empty car park near the Haymarket in order to gain prime vantage points.As the sound of vuvuzelas filled the air the front of the Sandman Signature hotel opposite St James’ Park was covered with a giant banner of Howe. Newcastle’s manager could not miss it as, at 4.30pm precisely, the team’s two open-topped buses pulled on to the road and, amid a cacophony of noise and serenaded by a series of flares, the players visibly gasped in awe.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães (centre) enjoys the moment on stage at Town Moor.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images“Oh my God,” said the winger Jacob Murphy. “It’s amazing.” His fellow wide man, Harvey Barnes, did not disagree: “This,” he said, “is something else.”Fans who witnessed the 1955 FA Cup win were in a minority, with 95-year-old Elsie Burns foremost among them. During a six-month stay in a sanatorium spent recovering from tuberculosis she had held that trophy herself in the course of a morale-boosting visit from Newcastle players.Seventy years on the mere thought of catching a glimpse of the Carabao Cup provoked delirium as streets blending brutalist 1960s and 1970s architecture with some of the finest Georgian buildings outside Bath became almost alarmingly packed and images of Sandro Tonali, Alexander Isak, Dan Burn, Bruno Guimaraes and the rest of Howe’s heroes stared down from lampposts.One of the parade buses, a retired London doubledecker with its roof chopped off, failed the first of two MOT tests last week but as it headed to the Moor the engine seemed as finely tuned as Howe’s midfield. “We could get used to this,” reflected Newcastle’s former England centre-forward Alan Shearer, speaking for many. “The last two weeks have probably been the best of my life.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedThe ObserverCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United fans had previously staged a sit-in following a3-2 win over Nottingham Forest in August 2023.“Probably one of the most impactful [protests] was when we did the sit-in, and we will be running another against City,” said Steve Crompton of The 1958. “I don’t think everybody knows yet, but you do now.”Chris Haymes, also from The 1958, said: “We’re going to get people to sit in their seats. Must [Manchester United Supporters’ Trust] did a flash survey and they reckon there’s going to be about 7,000 concessions, OAP, other people, who are not going to renew their season tickets. They’re trying to price them out of their seats, so we’re going to tell you to sit in your seat. That’s your seat that you paid for and probably have done for the last 50 or 60 years.”View image in fullscreenFC United hosted Stockton Town.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The ObserverSir Jim Ratcliffe, who controls United’s football policy, and the Glazers recentlyended all ticket concessions, meaning the cheapest price entry is £66.The American family’s proprietorship of United began with Malcolm Glazer’s leveraged purchase in 2005 that loaded about £500m debt on the club and caused a section of unhappy supporters to break away and form FC United in May that year.After Glazer died in May 2014, his six children took over and they remain the majority owners, with Ratcliffe’s share purchase of 28.94% last year making him the largest individual shareholder. United’s debt is about £730m. The club owes a further £300m in transfer fees and has lost £300m in the past three years.Saturday’s action, called United United Day, was the first formal linking of forces by FC United and a United fan group since the non-league club’s foundation, which caused division between fans. The protest took place after The 1958 reached out to FC.View image in fullscreenA dog wearing a FC United scarf inside the ground.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The ObserverHaymes explained why The 1958 approached FC. “The reason for us is that one thing [United’s] ownership thrive on is division – in the fan base and throughout all the support. So we believe that unity is the best way to be able to look for what we believe is the right treatment and so why not reach out to the ones that have been there and done it before and walked away 20 years ago, irrespective of how angry you were or how passionate you were or what you believed in [then].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At FC United we argue unity is strength. We’re a cooperative here at FC and it’s our greatest strength. It’s our people.“But I think [The 1958] are leading with their chin at the moment, everyone’s having a swing at them about what they’re not doing, but they’re putting themselves out there.

A short remark back to the boss is not advised. It was a respectful one, but it still got the treatment.Hamer strikes as Sheffield United go top with emphatic victory over CoventryRead more“It probably wasn’t my character when I was a player but I have developed it. It’s a stressful job. So, yes, I gave them a rocket at half-time and there has only been two or three of those this season. I feel like the players are mentally strong enough to take that, otherwise I wouldn’t do it.”Neither side could conjure a clearcut opening until the 28th minute and with Watford clearly below par that fell to Plymouth. Ryan Hardie turned sharply to find that in one move he had left the defence behind him. His shot was firm and accurate and would have crept inside the post had the Watford goalkeeper, Egil Selvik, not pushed it to safety with a strong left hand.If Rocco Vata’s low drive on the half-time whistle had crept inside rather than flashing past the outside of the Plymouth goal it might have saved Watford’s players from the full force of their roasting during the break.The same player handed Plymouth another escape two minutes after the restart when one touch too many allowed two defenders time to block his shot when it eventually arrived.A sharp cross from Giorgi Chakvetadze failed to get the touch it needed and Plymouth continued to ride their luck when Vata’s deflected shot hit the crossbar.By this stage Kwadwo Baah’s not inconsiderable presence had been added to the mix, but when put through one-on-one it was guile he needed rather than blasting the ball straight at Conor Hazard.View image in fullscreenPlymouth Argyle’s top scorer Ryan Hardie went close with his team’s best chance for a goal.Photograph: Frankie Okeeffe/PPAUK/ShutterstockOn a different day, perhaps Vakoun Bayo would have bundled the ball in at the far post or done better than find the side netting with two gilt-edged chances.

We’re striving for perfection and today we were halfway there.“My job is to keep the team believing because we’ve reduced our margin for error. Until it’s mathematically [impossible] to make the playoffs, it’ll always be alive in my eyes.”Plymouth could even have snatched an unlikely win at the end when the substitute Muhamed Tijani shot just wide in the closing minutes. With rivals Luton winning, a single point looks just as forlorn for Argyle in their hunt for survival.Plymouth’s manager, Miron Muslic, said: “A point is a small step forward but we take it.

The Manchester City manager holds Michael Jordan in high esteem and it feels as if the next two months may be the club’s version ofthe basketball legend’s Last Dancedocumentary for some of their senior players. The FA Cup is the NBA championship for those wondering where they may start next season.City face a second trip of the season to Bournemouth, where their 32-match unbeaten runended in November, hoping to reach a semi-final at Wembley for the seventh successive year. Guardiola and his side have barely recovered since losing Rodri, City’s Jordan according to his coach, and a second defeat by Andoni Iraola’s men on Sunday would remove any chance of a trophy for the Spaniard and his ageing charges this season. Jordan was asked for one great final year with the Chicago Bulls. Guardiola, who regards the Club World Cup as the start of the 2025-26 campaign, needs two months from his creaking squad.‘Not even a watch’: No prizes if City win Club World Cup, warns GuardiolaRead moreCity are the only team left in the competition to have won it since Nottingham Forest triumphed in 1959. They are favourites to lift the trophy for the third time under Guardiola but they face arguably the best-coached team in the country and losing would not go down as a shock. A victory on the south coast would be an ideal platform for City to achieve ambitions up to the end of May, proving to themselves and others they are in the process of reclaiming their status.The futures of Ederson, John Stones, Nathan Aké, Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gündogan, who returned after a year away, and Jack Grealish are uncertain, and Bernardo Silva attracts annual interest. It would be surprising if all were to depart this summer but some almost certainly will, and no one wants to end on a low. Kyle Walker will almost certainly not return from his loan with Milan, which he eagerly arranged in January, leaving with a haul of medals after eight years.The Club World Cup is another potential trinket to add to the collections for Guardiola’s old guard but they are not currentlycapable of competing with Real Madrid.Fitness problems have caused Ederson, Stones and De Bruyne to miss numerous games. Guardiola believes he needs more durable players to cope next season with the rigours required to battle on four fronts; five if you count the sojourn in the United States. City will have the option to bring in players before the Club World Cup, which could hasten the sale of those under contract. De Bruyne’s deal expires mid-tournament.View image in fullscreenMichael Jordan in action against Utah Jazz in the NBA finals in June 1997. Pep Guardiola is a big basketball fanPhotograph: Vincent Laforet/AFP/Getty ImagesDe Bruyne has started 12 of City’s 29 Premier League games this season. Gündogan has been a regular but doubts abound over whether he has the physicality and stamina for another year in England. Their shared part in City’s successes will go down in history but neither is offering Benjamin Button vibes.Grealish looks in need of an exit to reignite a career moving in the wrong direction, having played 605 Premier League minutes, almost a thousand fewer than Savinho. On a positive note, the Englishman has played every minute of theFA Cuprun – 270 minutes – and will be desperate for another full match.He has just over a year to find form and regular football in order to push his way into Thomas Tuchel’s plans for the 2026 World Cup, for which England will almost certainly qualify. Grealish was picked for the 2023 Champions League final when he was fully trusted by Guardiola to do what was demanded of him in the big games, but is now often an unused substitute in critical fixtures, showcasing his talents against Salford City, Leyton Orient or Plymouth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Italy’s Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri delivered a solid but beatable free dance – scoring 123.42 points, nearly five below their season’s best – for an overall total of 206.46, the opportunity was there. All the British pair needed was 122.61 to secure a bronze medal, a score around three points under their own top mark for the year. It might have seemed straightforward enough. It almost wasn’t.Alysa Liu left figure skating behind. She came back better than ever | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreSkating third-to-last in the final group, Fear and Gibson performed their free dance to a string of Beyoncé hits, a fan-favourite programme that has earned ovations across the circuit. After a tight, nervy first half, the crowd inside TD Garden rewarded their strong, confident finish with roars of approval before the technical panel went to work. Several elements, including the levels on their steps and one of the lifts, came under scrutiny.The tension during the wait was excruciating. Finally, after a seemingly interminable wait, their score flashed up: 123.25 in the free dance – sixth place on the day but just enough for the podium over two segments. Their total of 207.11 gave them bronze by a margin of 0.65 points over the Italians. The crowd erupted. So did the British camp. “I can’t even describe my feelings, Fear said. “I’m still shaking. It’s a dream come true, and I’m kind of in disbelief. But I’m so grateful for the results.”View image in fullscreenLilah Fear and Lewis Gibson delight the crowd in Boston during their free dance routine which sealed a bronze medal.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesIt marked Britain’s first world or Olympic ice dance medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean’s comeback bronze at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games – a 31-year drought finally broken. It was also a redemption of sorts for Fear and Gibson, who had placed fourth at the past two world championships.It was alsoBritain’s first medal at worldsin any discipline since Torvill and Dean won the last of their four consecutive ice dance titles in 1984.“This is crazy, right?” Gibson said. “It’s just unbelievable. We’ve been compared to them [Torvill and Dean] a lot, and I love it every time. It’s such an honour. I was inspired by them, and I hope so much that there are little kids out there in Great Britain seeing this and wanting to put their skates on as well.”Despite Saturday’s sixth place in the free dance, their rhythm dance score of 83.86 from Friday – a career high – proved crucial in keeping them ahead of Guignard and Fabbri, who were fourth in both segments.The gold medal went to the home favourites, Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who dazzled once again with a confident and technically masterful free dance to their Take Five and ‘Round About Midnight medley. The flawless skate, which included a level four for the twizzles and lift and a level three for footwork, earned them a season-best score of 222.06. That sealed their place as the first team to three-peat since Russia’s Oksana Grishuk and Evgeni Platov in the 1990s – and the first Americans ever to do it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were the last of the three teams to leave the ice after the medal ceremony, signing autographs and snapping selfies with clusters of travelling fans and expats at rinkside. As they left the ice, hand in hand, the emotion was overwhelming – a mix of joy, relief, and history made. The door opened. They walked through.

We are delighted.”Asked what the secret is behind their success in penalty shootouts, he added: “It’s a lot of practice and credit to the players for keeping their focus. The first thing that I noticed when I came to this club was the good atmosphere among the players and it’s the foundation for everything.“Good goalkeeping but also good shooting. The third time and it’s the first penalty we missed in all the shootouts. It’s credit to the players.

But she knew exactly who she wanted to call first.“My siblings,” she said, laughing. “They have no idea [what] is happening.”No one really did.

Before that, it was Sarah Hughes’ gold and Michelle Kwan’s bronze in Salt Lake City in 2002.Now in the span of three 72 dizzying hours in Boston, the conversation around US women’s skating has shifted. Thedroughtis no longer a millstone. It’s an opportunity for Liu to make her mark.Alysa Liu is GOLDEN. ✨Relive her stellar free skate that secured the first world title for a U.S. women’s singles skater since 2006.pic.twitter.com/Z5DPG3x9po— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics)March 29, 2025“That was the best performance I’ve laid down all season, even my practice programs have not been that good,” she told a throng of about 100 reporters late Friday night. “I really thought if I did clean skates I’d be hopefully top 10, definitely not first. This moment is so unreal, that’s the only word I can use to describe it. I still have to process it to be honest.”Liu didn’t just meet expectations – she redefined what they meant. For theone-time child prodigy, it’s no longer about chasing medals or proving herself to anyone else. It’s about expression, fulfillment and skating on her own terms. “I didn’t have expectations coming in,” she said. “I never have expectations coming into competitions anymore. It’s more so, ‘What can I put out performance-wise?’ I really met my expectations on my part.”‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreShe added: “Everything that I have been through, my time away and all that. This time around I’m so happy, I guess. I’m mostly glad that I could put out two of my best performances, and I am really happy with how things went today.”That mindset took shape during her two-year break from the sport. After winning bronze at the 2022 world championships, Liu stunned the skating world by announcing her retirement. She’d made the decision privately months earlier, then made it Instagram-official before anyone could talk her out of it.“I’m going to be moving on with my life,” Liu wrote.She spent the time rediscovering life outside the rink: hiking in the Himalayas, traveling with family, starting school at UCLA. But it was a spontaneous ski trip to Lake Tahoe that changed everything.Gliding downhill with friends, wind in her face, Liu felt something familiar: joy in motion. “I love sports. I like moving. I also love music and I love dancing,” shetold the Guardian. “That’s literally skating?” She laughed at the realization, but she didn’t ignore it.Back in Los Angeles, while balancing her winter quarter at UCLA, Liu started skating once a week at public sessions in El Segundo. To her surprise, the jumps came back. The pull of the ice was undeniable.“If there’s days where you just want to be on the ice for fun when it’s not planned in your training schedules,” she said, “I feel like that’s kind of when you know you still like it.” And she did.View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu performs her free skate on Friday at TD Garden in Boston.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesSoon, skating for fun turned into skating with purpose. She entered a small competition in Budapest – and won. Then Zagreb – and won again. She camethiscloseto winning nationals, getting pipped by Amber Glennin one of the closest contests everat the US championships. And in Boston, shedrilled seven clean triples, skated to Donna Summer in a gold-sequined dress, and cartwheeled onto the ice before Wednesday afternoon’s short program … and Friday night’s medal ceremony.Liu became the 14th American woman to win the sport’s biggest competition outside the Olympics, helping Team USA secure three quota spots for the 2026 Games. With Isabeau Levito and Glenn finishing fourth and fifth, respectively, it was the strongest collective US women’s showing at a world championships since 2001. “Go Team USA. That’s all I can say,” Liu said. “I’m so proud of both Isabeau and Amber for putting up such great performances and such great fight.”Sakamoto, who stood on the podium with Liu at worlds in 2022, praised her growth. “She went away and now she’s back – and the world champion,” the 24-year-old from Kobe said through a translator. “Her cheerfulness and kindness and the way she’s always happy brought her to the top step of the podium.”Liu isn’t thinking too far ahead, even if the rest of the sport is. She’s no longer just a comeback story. She’s a contender. “I have never regretted anything in my life – every decision that I made, I am glad that I did,” Liu said. “It all brought me to this moment.”A moment she met with wide eyes, a gold medal and one perfectly chaotic exclamation that captured the entire journey:What the hell?Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuFigure skatingUS sportsWinter Olympics 2026featuresShareReuse this content"

Skating in a shimmering gold dress to the pulsing sounds of Boston-born Donna Summer, Liulanded all of her jumps cleanlyand drew a standing ovation before finishing with 222.97 points overall – enough to secure gold in front of a rollicking home crowd.Quick GuideWorld Figure Skating Championships 2025ShowScheduleAll times EST.Wed 26 Mar• Women's Short, 12.05pm (Peacock)• Women's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Remembrance Ceremony, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Short, 6.45pm (Peacock)Thu 27 Mar• Men's Short, 11.05am (Peacock)• Men's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Pairs' Free, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Free, 8pm (USA Network)Fri 28 Mar• Rhythm Dance, 11.15am (Peacock)• Rhythm Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Women's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Women's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sat 29 Mar• Free Dance, 1.30pm (Peacock)• Free Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Men's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Men's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sun 30 Mar• Exhibition Gala, 2pm (Peacock)How to watch outside the USUnited KingdomAs of last year, Premier Sports holds the broadcasting rights for the World Figure Skating Championships in the UK, with coverage extending until 2028.

I don’t know how to process this.”It's not a dream, Alysa Liu, you are the new 🏆 WORLD CHAMPION 🏆. What a comeback! What a night of skating these women gave us! 🤩⛸️👏#FigureSkating#WorldFigurepic.twitter.com/AUcOg2WI82— ISU Figure Skating (@ISU_Figure)March 29, 2025Sakamoto finished with 217.98 points over both segments to take silver, her lone mistake Friday coming when she two-footed the landing on a combination early in the routine. Japan’s Mone Chiba took the bronze with 215.24 after a composed and elegant program with small errors on two of her triples. Just behind, the Americans Isabeau Levito and Amber Glenn placed fourth and fifth respectively, marking the first time since 2001 that the US had three women finish in the top five at a world championship.But the night belonged to Liu. Her clean, confident performance to Summer’s disco epic MacArthur Park Suite featured seven triple jumps, including three in combination, connected by high-velocity step sequences and fluid transitions that brought the crowd to its feet. By the time she closed with a graceful layback spin, the 17,850-seat arena was a white-hot wall of sound.“I’m not going to lie, this is an insane story,” Liu said. “I don’t know how I came back to be world champion.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu reacts with her coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali, after winning the world title on Friday night in Boston.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesLiu became the first US women’s singles skater to win the world title since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, and just the second American to win any medal in the event since then. That it came in a citystill mourning the recent lossof six local skating figures in a January plane crash only heightened the emotional stakes.The outcome was the culmination of one of the most unusual arcs in the sport’s history. Liu burst onto the scene in 2019 as theyoungest ever US national championaged 13 beforerepeating the feat a year later, then competed at the 2022 Olympics and won bronze at that year’s worlds – before abruptly retiring that same spring, citing fatigue and burnout.Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson push for historic world medal after strong startRead moreShe stayed away for nearly two years. But by mid-2023, she was back training quietly in California, with eyes on rediscovering joy in the sport and possibly targeting the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.“Personally, I can be so much better,” she said afterwinning Friday’s short programwith a career-best score. “That’s why I call this a starter season, because this season is me picking up the pieces. So I don’t know how I just did this.”While Liu’s gold provided the high point, the rest of the American contingent also delivered. Levito, last year’s world silver medallist, produced a strong comeback free skate after a fall on her opening triple flip-triple toeloop combination, scoring 209.84 overall to finish fourth in her return from a foot injury that kept her sidelined much of the season.Glenn, who went off on Wednesday as one of the favorites after an undefeated Grand Prix season but finished ninth in the short after falling on her signature triple Axel, climbed from ninth after the short program to finish fifth with 205.65, marking her best ever result at a world championship. The 25-year-old was the only woman in the field to attempt the triple Axel in the free skate. Though it wasn’t landed cleanly, she showed resilience and composure throughout the program.“I was really proud of the fight that I had out there,” Glenn said. “That I stayed calm and that I finished on a positive note on the season.”View image in fullscreenKaori Sakamoto of Japan, left, Alysa Liu of United States, center, and Mone Chiba of Japan pose after Friday’s medal ceremony.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesSakamoto, bidding to become the first woman to win four consecutive world titles since the American great Carol Heiss bagged five straight from 1956 through 1960, rallied with a powerful free skate that scored 147.00 – just short of Liu’s mark.Chiba, too, had much to celebrate. Her bronze marks her first podium finish at a world championship and caps a season in which she’s shown growing maturity and presence. Her 139.44-point free skate was clean and artistically rich, helping to ensure Japan placed two skaters on the podium.With the continued absence of Russian athletes – banned from international competition due to the ongoing war in Ukraine – the women’s field remains in flux. But for Liu, who returned not to chase medals but to rediscover her love of skating, that shifting landscape made her moment possible.Earlier Friday afternoon, the American ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates posted the world’s highest rhythm dance score in two yearsin their chase of a third consecutive world title, beating out Canada’s Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier and Britain’s Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson ahead of Saturday’s free dance.Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuFigure skatingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Much of the deal’s specifics remained unclear, such as how investors may be compensated, how X’s leaders would be integrated in the new firm or the prospect of regulatory scrutiny.“This development feels surprising and somewhat unexpected,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said. “To a certain extent, it closes a chapter in the turbulent saga of X.”“The choice of $45bn is not a coincidence,” said DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria. “It is $1bn higher than the take-private transaction for Twitter in 2022” and he can share the value of the xAI business with X co-investors.Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, has alsoconsolidated his power in Washington DCby overseeing the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. That has also put him in the position to potentially influence agencies that oversee his business dealings.An investor in xAI, and now in the combined entity, told Reuters they were not surprised by the deal, viewing it as Musk consolidating his leadership and management at his own companies. The investor declined to be named.Musk did not ask investors for approval but told them that the two companies had been collaborating closely and the integration would drive deeper integrationwith Grok.Musk’s xAI startup was launched less than two years ago and recently raised $10bn in a funding round that valued the company at $75bn, according to a media report.In February, Musk, 53, made a $97.4bn bid with a consortium for the ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which was rejected, with OpenAI saying that the startup was not for sale. Musk co-founded OpenAI with CEO Sam Altman in 2015.Musk competes directly with the popular OpenAI platform and has sued in federal court in California to prevent his rival from converting from a non-profit to a for-profit business. A judge earlier this month denied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the changeover.The wide release of AI software has set off a flurry of investment and competition in Silicon Valley. In an effort to be more efficient, companies are seeking ways to integrate the software into nearly every part of their operations.As competition in AI intensifies, xAI has been ramping up its data centre capacity to train more advanced models, and its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus, is touted as the largest in the world.xAI introduced Grok-3, the latest iteration of its chatbot, in February, as it tries to compete with Chinese AI firm DeepSeek and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. The X platform can serve to further distribute xAI products, while also providing a real-time feed of users’ musings, screenshots and other data.Muskclinched a deal in 2022 to buy X, then Twitter, for $44bn, ending its run as a public company since its 2013 initial public offering, declaring that “the bird is freed” once the acquisition closed.He gutted the company’s workforce after the acquisition, prompting advertisers to flee the platform and a rapid decline in revenue. Recently, brands have been returning to X as Musk’s influence grows in the Trump administration.The seven banks that extended $13bn in loans to Musk to buy X kept the debt on their books for two years until they could sell it all at once last month, according to a source familiar with the transactions.This was made possible after a surge in investor interest for exposure to AI companies along with X’s improved operating performance over the previous two quarters, among other factors, according to two people familiar with the matter.After the merger, investors who bought the debt from the banks will profit, said Espen Robak, founder of Pluris Valuation Advisors, which specialises in illiquid assets. “For sure the debt is worth more now, if not fully paid off.”Separately, a US judge on Friday rejected a bid by Musk to dismiss a lawsuit claiming he had defrauded former Twitter shareholders by waiting too long to disclose his initial investment in the company.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskXnewsShareReuse this content"

The US national security adviser,Mike Waltz, celebrates bombing Yemen with them. Prince William has a fondness for the aubergine.Emoji use may seem childish or trite, but it’s not a passing fad. It’s increasingly a language in its own right and evolving fast. Not so long ago, few would bother searching for an icon when just typing a word is clearer and – crucially – quicker. That was then. Now, more and more people lean on those ubiquitous little icons.Why? Because the printed word is a hopeless carrier of tone. If you want to transmit how you feel in writing, emojis are your friend.But take Waltz’s leaked Signal message. To some, it conveyed patriotic pride. To others, shocking crassness. This tension between intended and perceived meaning is the beating ❤️ of emoji culture.The craving for nuance goes back decades. The first recorded emoticon appeared in Reader’s Digest in 1967, with a tongue-in-cheek -) credited to “Aunt Ev”. Two years later, the Russian-American writer Vladimir Nabokov is quoted in the New York Times arguing for a “typographical sign for a smile”.Then in 1982, the computer science professor Scott Fahlman proposed :-) as a joke marker to help students misreading message board posts.Emojis themselves trace back to a 1988 Sharp palmtop computer. Then in 1999 the Japanese designer Shigetaka Kurita’s 176-icon set was the first to go mainstream. Perhaps surprisingly, the emoji was conceived without an aubergine in sight.Using pictures in language is hardly new. From cave art to Egyptian hieroglyphs, graphical communication predates the alphabet. Roman curse tablets have been discovered containing images whose meanings are partly lost. Was this ancient trolling, with pictures thrown in for effect?Today, people of all ages are using emojis – and miscommunication is everywhere. If you use the most basic smiley face, innocently assuming this means “happy”, beware. For Gen Z, this humble-seeming emoji often denotes sarcasm and is as inadvisable as finishing a text with a full stop.It’s a minefield. An Emojipedia exists, but maybe it’s time the Oxford English Dictionary added an emoji appendix – an official, regularly updated barometer of these ubiquitous images and their shifting definitions, as portrayed heartbreakingly in Adolescence. Sound far-fetched? The OED made 😂 its word of the year in 2015, noting it had caused the biggest linguistic spike that year. To deny the importance of emoji is to be 👑 Canute holding back the 🌊.As the cliche goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. In the march of the emojis, the only real surprise is why any of us were surprised.Explore more on these topicsLanguageSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, should a user search for “Sub5” content, they are offered a stream of material on the platform.“We argue that facilitated by its rebranding through the frameworks of looksmaxxing and the PSL scale, misogynist incel ideology is being mainstreamed”, write Solea and Dr Lisa Sugiura.“These mechanisms reframe overtly toxic, misogynistic and extremist rhetoric into socially palatable discourses of self-improvement and biological and racial essentialism, enabling its diffusion into broader digital spaces.”TikTok has more than 1.9 billion users worldwide. A third of users in the UK are said to fallbetween the ages of 13 and 17, with 40.32% in the 18 to 24 age group.The conclusions of the new paper followed analysis of videos on five accounts on TikTok identified as promoting incel theories.Solea said: “What they try to do is to attract wider audiences and also to be permitted on the platform and accepted by others through rebranding. So you’ll see Sub5s, you’ll see the PSL scale, and then also they are being less directly offensive and violent towards women.“I’m just going to mention theAdolescenceshow because everybody’s talking about that: the 80:20 rule, where 80% of women go for the 20% of men. There are lots of these theories. You’re more likely to believe that women are bad when they show you that, rather than just saying: ‘Oh, women are such sluts,’ especially when those words and insults are not allowed on TikTok.”A TikTok spokesperson said: “Misogyny is strictly prohibited on TikTok and we take swift action to remove content that violates our policies.“We continually refine our moderation using technology and expert insights, and 93% of hateful content that was removed from our platform last quarter was removed before it was reported to us.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokYoung peopleMenSocial mediaDigital mediaViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

This information can be used for marketing purposes and is often sold on to third parties for a profit.“Usually, somewhere along the way, the user has ticked a box that enables companies to collect, store and sell on this data,” Mehrnezhad says.While this “third-party tracking” is common with big retailers, it could breach laws to protect individuals’ rights to privacy or data protection, Mehrnezhad adds.“A lot of online services don’t offer a pathway to withdraw consent from previously accepted privacy settings,” she says.Even if you opt out, it can be difficult to enforce the right to remove your personal data.

He studied politics, psychology and sociology at King’s College, Cambridge and is now doing a PhD at UCL about the economic and cultural potential of black music. Aged 22 he signed with Island Records and released an EP before stepping away from the music industry. His award-winning podcast,Have You Heard George’s Podcast?, launched in 2018. Last year he publishedTrack Record: Me, Music and the War on Blackness. He will perform inRISE at the Royal Festival Hallon 25 April, as part of the Southbank Centre’s new arts festival, Multitudes.1.RestaurantKenya Kitchen, EdgwareView image in fullscreen‘It has the feel of a family-run business, with really nice service.’This is a comfortable, accessible restaurant in Edgware that does a nice mixture of grilled meats and stews. My family is from Uganda and also Kenya, so the food here takes me right back. The music they play is Kenyan. The aesthetic is very familiar. They serve some really good local foods, such as ugali, a maize flour staple in a lot of east African food; nyama choma, or grilled meat; and sukuma wiki, a veg dish with sauteed greens. It has the feel of a family-run business, with really nice service. My family and I go for special occasions. I love that place.2.MusicKeys the PrinceListen to Gbe Mi De Be by Keys the Prince.I came across Keys on social media. What grabbed me was the visual aspect: it wasn’t the most flashy, but it was authentic. He creates music videos in locations that are relevant to the African community in London – for example, in material shops, where you can buy materials to tailor your own clothes with – and he does it in a really stylish way. And then the music is so easy, so relaxed, and he does a good job of infusing it with Nigerian sounds and Yoruba language. I’ve recently really been into his song Gbe Mi De Be, featuring Bxujii.View image in fullscreen3.AppR DiscoveryOnce upon a time, in order to find academic papers, you had to go to Google Scholar or sift through the library, but that’s an imperfect process, especially when, like me, you’re doing a PhD part-time. R Discovery is a tool I came across through an education influencer called Dr Amina Yonis. It streamlines that whole process. You can search by theme, by author, by field. There’s also an AI feature that allows you to listen to the audio version of a paper. It’s made my PhD journey less of a panic.4.InfluencerEly WanandaView image in fullscreenQuestions and provocations: Ely Wananda.Wananda is a YouTuber who comments on different aspects of Black British life. He’s a data scientist and I appreciate anyone in a technical job who makes an effort to demystify his field. He poses questions or provocations, such as “What’s holding back Black British businesses from success?” and “Why wealth and marriage go hand in hand”. These are topics that some of us will never tire of grappling with, and Ely approaches them with a nice conversational style. I find it easy to get material online about Black America, but the focus on Black Britain, especially from an academic perspective, is often lacking.5.TVSquid Gameseason 2View image in fullscreen‘A naked analysis of capitalism’: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game season 2.Photograph: NetflixLet’s acknowledge a crowd pleaser! I lovedSquid Gameseason one. Yes, there’s a lot of shock and gore, but I value the emotional intensity of it. It’s a thriller focusing on a series of games that participants are enticed into with the promise of money, but these games turn out to be lethal. It’s quite a naked analysis of capitalism, exploring all the ways people get into debt, and also a reflection on human behaviour. I just binged season two. It’s more of the same but with new characters and some interesting developments. I enjoyed it very much.6.YouTubeKunda and FriendsView image in fullscreen‘Particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids’: Kunda and Friends.My life at the moment is dominated by a toddler and a newborn. I usually tune out when I hear kids’ programmes, but whenever Kunda comes on, I appreciate it. First of all, it’s educational and talks your child through language, behaviour and all of that good stuff. But particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids – it’s important for my child to be able to see darker shades on TV. Songs from kids’ programmes can get annoying very quickly, but Kunda has yet to annoy me. It’s entertaining, it’s well animated – it’s just fun.Explore more on these topicsGeorge the PoetOn my radarRestaurantsInternetYouTubeFoodAppsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will they overthrow the traditional big military manufacturers, and what would that mean for the battlefield?Zoë CorbynSat 29 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 17.45 EDTShareVisit tech startup Skydio’s headquarters on the San Francisco peninsula in California and you’re likely to find flying robots buzzing on the roof overhead. Docking stations with motorised covers open to allow small drones that resemble the TIE fighters fromStar Warsfilms to take off; when each drone lands back again, they close. The drones can fly completely autonomously and without GPS, taking in data from onboard cameras and using AI to execute programmed missions and avoid obstacles.Skydio, with more than $740m in venture capital funding and a valuation of about $2.5bn, makes drones for the military along with civilian organisations such as police forces and utility companies. The company moved away from the consumer market in 2020 and is now the largest US drone maker. Military uses touted on its website include gaining situational awareness on the battlefield and autonomously patrolling bases.Just across the water from its headquarters is Skydio’s manufacturing facility, where about 200 workers assemble hundreds of drones a month, including the defence model. The company has agreements to supply its drones to the US defence department, as well as 24 US allies, and they have been used by the Ukrainian military fighting Russia. “It is an absolute certainty that small, inexpensive, software-defined systems with rapid iteration are the future of defence,” says Adam Bry, Skydio’s co-founder and chief executive.It is an absolute certainty that small, inexpensive, software-defined systems with rapid iteration are the future of defenceAdam Bry, Skydio co-founder and chief executiveSkydio is one of a number of new military technology unicorns – venture capital-backed startups valued at more than $1bn – many led by young men aiming to transform the US and its allies’ military capabilities with advanced technology, be it straight-up software or software-imbued hardware. The rise of startups doing defence tech is a “big trend”, says Cynthia Cook, a defence expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based-thinktank. She likens it to a contagion – and the bug is going around.According to financial data company PitchBook, investors funnelled nearly $155bn globally into defence tech startups between 2021 and 2024, up from $58bn over the previous four years. The US hasmore than 1,000venture capital-backed companies working on “smarter, faster and cheaper” defence, says Dale Swartz from consultancy McKinsey, adding that Europe has seen an uptick in defence tech startups too. While most of the funding has gone to US-based companies, some, such as German startup Helsing, have seen significant amounts. Yet a sector set on reinventing defence with Silicon Valley values also raises concerns, including whether it could bring us closer to war – and Donald Trump looms large.View image in fullscreenA Skydio drone returning to the startup’s rooftop dock.Photograph: SkydioAs the upstart defence industry sees it, the current system is not set up to meet the needs of the modern war fighter. We are entering a new era where machines go to war, albeit working with humans, and there is a huge need for autonomy and AI that the “defence primes” – the massive companies the defence department has traditionally partnered with to build ships, planes, tanks and strategic deterrence weaponry such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Boeing – do not have the right muscles to deliver. As a result, the US risks losing its edge in its ability to respond, which is something the startups say they can help fix.And thepotential rewardsare enormous. The US spends about$850bn annually on its military, approximately half of which goes on procuring new items or maintaining old equipment, while the totalmilitary spending globally is more than $2.4tn– an amount set to rise significantly as Europe assumes an increased burden for its own security.Not, says the defence startup sector, that it is just about money. Imbuing it is a zeal to help the US and its allies retain a military advantage over their adversaries in an increasingly dangerous world. “The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defence of the nation,” states the preface ofThe Technological Republic, a new book by Alex Karp, which can be viewed as a manifesto for the fast-rising industry. Karp is the chief executive and co-founder, along with billionaire Peter Thiel, of AI-drivensoftware companyPalantir Technologies, which, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is seen as a trailblazer for the upstart industry.If the best defence against AI is more AI, this could be tech’s Oppenheimer momentRead moreAnd the sector is bullish about its prospects under the Trump administration, whichhas signalledit wants to revamp and modernise procurement. Their approach, say the startups, can deliver more for less money.The types of technologies the defence upstarts are working on are many and varied, though autonomy and AI feature heavily. To give a flavour, in addition to autonomous aerial drones such as Skydio’s, there are those that travel on the surface of the sea and underwater, as well as generative AI to enhance military planning and decision making, AI-powered counter-drone technology, autonomous strike weapons and even AI pilots for fighter jets, negating the need for human ones.One startup known for its aggressive and rapid expansion is southern California-basedAnduril Industries. The company,which has received $3.7bn in venture capital funding and is valued at $14bn, was co-founded in 2017 by the inventor of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, Palmer Luckey. The business, which is focused on autonomous systems and weapons – including the Thunderbird-likeFury war fighter– is building a manufacturing facility in Ohio and is also reportedly planning a drone factory in the UK to serve as a European base.It is only in the past few years that defence has come to be seen as a viable market for startups. The prevailing belief before that was the US defence department was limited to working with the primes.View image in fullscreenDefence tech startup Epirus is developing its Leonidas high-power microwave counter-drone system.Photograph: Courtesy of Epirus/SkydioYet the lion’s share of the funding is still going to the primes, the startups complain. The industry is “emerging fast in the outside world, but not so fast in terms of budgetary reassignment”, notes Andy Lowery, chief executive of Epirus, another high-valuation startup that is focused on disabling swarms of many thousands of attack drones using high-energy microwave forcefields, and is working with the British military’s Army Futures directorate on how the technology may be useful to the UK.The problem – and what needs to be disrupted, many in the emerging sector argue – is the US defence department’s antiquated system of military acquisition and procurement, which has long budget planning cycles and is oriented towards buying large, expensive, static hardware systems that can take many years to come to fruition and leave little space for innovation because the contracts are so overly prescriptive.View image in fullscreenUS defence tech unicorn Shield AI is focusing on developing AI pilots.Photograph: Courtesy Shield AIThe defence department is “very stuck in old cold war ways of doing things”, says Michael Brown, a partner at venture company Shield Capital and the former director of the US military’s defence innovation unit (DIU). And that strategy does not work well when threats are changing rapidly and new technology needs to be leveraged.Ryan Tseng, co-founder and chief executive of Shield AI, a defence tech unicorn focusing on AI pilots, agrees that military acquisition is overdue a shake-up. Tseng would like to see “millions of AI pilots”, so the US and its allies are ready for the future of war. “[But] at the moment it is basically at zero adoption,” he says.Another defence tech startup Castelion, also based in southern California, was founded in 2022 by former SpaceX employees and is pursuing autonomous strike weapons: hypersonic long-range missiles with AI capabilities. Hypersonic weapons – of which China has the world’s leading arsenal – can travel at above five times the speed of sound and though the US doesn’t have any yet, it is actively developing them with some of the primes. Castelion has won military contracts to build and test its prototypes, and in January announced its first big funding round of $100m to accelerate test cycles and build production facilities.Castelion’s approach is different from what the US is known for, says Bryon Hargis, its co-founder and chief executive. Rather than build limited numbers of costly and long-lasting systems with exquisite, high-end capabilities, Castelion wants to manufacture fear-inspiring quantities of low-cost “sufficiently capable weapons” – an approach, he says, that will “actually achieve a deterrent effect”. It is hoping to deliver its first weapons at scale in 2027, which would be exceedingly fast.View image in fullscreenUS defence tech startup Castelion has won $100m in venture capital funding to develop hypersonic missiles, a weapon missing from the US arsenal.Photograph: CastelionYet the push to remake defence has left some worried. Elke Schwarz, a professor of political theory at Queen Mary University of London,has analysedthe effect of venture capital dynamics on military norms. It is not, she argues, that the defence sector may not benefit from an overhaul – a shift towards new technologies and greater agility. But the high risk/reward venture capital funding model comes with such huge expectations of rapid growth – the company must scale up fast to try to reach a high valuation – it can lead to products being oversold.“The hyperbolic AI discourse that we know from the domestic sector also happens in the military environment,” she says. The risk is that the products fielded, which often rely on hastily produced prototypes being quickly tested and improved, do not work as advertised and are flawed and unreliable in their capabilities. (Though, to be sure, such potential problems are not just limited to startups, as demonstrated by the issues that have dogged theLockheed-manufactured F-35 fighter jet). Schwarz is particularly concerned that the acquisition of all these relatively low-cost tech products pushes the US and its allies closer to wanting to use them in war.The startups counter that an agile, iterative approach does not mean they are delivering inferior products, and checks and balances at the defence department ensure the technologies that are adopted are up to snuff. Broader acquisitions are not made until the technology has been put into the hands of operators to test, said a DIU spokesperson: “They provide the unvarnished opinion on whether [it] works as promised, addresses defence problem sets and would be useful in key scenarios.”Our intention is just to give the US and its allies the best possible capabilities… without military strength, I truly believe we’re all in for a worse futureByron Hargis, Castelion co-founder and chief executiveOn pushing us towards war, the companies note that they do not decide how what they sell will be employed. What, if any, payloads the military attaches to Skydio’s drones is up to the military. “These things are just tools,” says Castelion boss Hargis. “Our intention is just to give the US and its allies the best possible capabilities… [and] without military strength, I truly believe we’re all in for a worse future.”Moving forward, doubtless the primes will do some adapting – indeed some have started uptheir ownventure capital funds. None of the primes approached or their US trade associations agreed to be part of this feature, though Kevin Craven, the chief executive of the ADS Group, the UK trade association for the aerospace, defence, security and space industries, highlights the longevity and experience the primes bring. “[They] are innovators in their own right,” he says.It is also anticipated that, as the new military tech industry matures and takes shape, there will be some consolidation – even among the larger players. Lowery points to the way the primes rose, which was through mergers, particularly after the cold war. “History repeats itself,” he says.Roberto González, a professor of cultural anthropology at San José State University, California, who hasalso dissectedhow the tech sector is transforming the US military-industrial complex, adds that it is worth thinking too about what may not get funded when venture capital money is ploughed into defence; for example, some climate startupsare now pivotingtheir pitches to defence. “There are opportunities lost through military spending,” he says. “Opportunities to invest in biomedicine, clean energy, smart farming technologies and much more.”Meanwhile, there is “a little pent-up demand” to see if the startups that have been funded are successful, says Shield Capital’s Brown. If companies “go under” and returns are not realised, it could mean an “investment winter” for the technology, which “wouldn’t be good” for competition. For Brown, it all hinges on reforming the US defence department’s acquisition and budgeting system.And whether that will be as bold as the interlopers are hoping under Trump remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsDrones (military)The ObserverDrones (non-military)Donald TrumpElon MuskArms tradeUS defence spendingArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Tesla’s European market share fell to 9.6% last month, the lowest it has registered in February for five years.However, in the UK the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported analmost 21% risein the number of new Tesla cars registered in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper.Hundreds ofTeslaowners got in touch with the Guardian to share how their feelings about owning Teslas have changed over time. Here are some their views.‘Our daughter keeps asking us to sell it’As a birthday present in 2019, my wife booked me a test drive for the Tesla Model S. I thought, “My God, what an amazing bit of kit”. It was very smooth, very fast, and I was keen to drive something more environmentally friendly. So we bought one.We’ve now done about 80,000 miles on it – driving to Switzerland one year, Italy another, and last summer to the south of France. It’s been incredibly cheap, reliable, spacious, and with virtually no servicing.But we are horrified by Trump and Musk’s extreme politics. Our 26-year-old daughter keeps asking us to sell it. When I saw Trump and Musk showcasing the modelsoutside the White House, I felt a bit sick. I’m on Tesla owners’ forums, it’s getting very polarised.We’re now in a series of constant dilemmas. I don’t want to have to put stickers on my Tesla like others are, with things like, “Love the car, not the CEO”. I feel very torn. The seconhand market has plummeted. Our warranty runs out in 2027, and then we’ll see. I never thought owning a car would be this difficult.Jonathan, 64, OxfordView image in fullscreenAn anti-Musk poster in Broadstairs, Kent.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/SOPA Images/Rex/Shutterstock‘Do we regret it? Morally, yes. Practically, no’Last spring, my girlfriend and I were looking for a new car. A Tesla wasn’t even on our radar, but it turned out to be a cheaper option than the electric alternatives, and during a test drive it felt like the best car I’d ever driven … unfortunately. We thought, let’s go for it.When Musk started campaigning for Trumplast summer, I began to get questions about the car. Now it’s even worse. Friends or colleagues joke around, saying: “Ah! So you’re for Mr Musk?” But for me, having something that’s in any way a symbol of the far right is extremely painful. We feel a moral pain at being owners.Do we regret it? Morally, yes. Practically, no. I hope this will be a passing moment, that the brand will outlive Musk. We hope someone can take over as CEO from Musk.Patrick*, 40, Belgium‘I’m a Tesla fanboy who jumped ship’When I first drove a Tesla, while I was visiting Las Vegas for work in 2019, I was absolutely blown away. Going back to my Ford Mondeo felt like travelling back in time. I got the Model 3, which was a joy to drive, like a go-kart around the country roads, and later we got the Model Y.I didn’t see the rightwing stuff coming. When Musk aligned with Trump, we thought, well … the car’s great. I was still prepared to stick with Tesla right up until Musk’s so-called “Roman salute”. The day I saw that, I thought, “Oh, man”.My car was up for renewal a few weeks ago. I was on the phone to Tesla – they were really persistent, trying to convince me to stay – when a Polestar 4 [a competitor] drove by. I booked a test drive the same day and now I’m waiting for my Polestar 4 to arrive. I’m prepared to take a slight step down in software.I was like, “Actually, I’ve got to stick to my morals, without that I haven’t got anything”. Even so, the Polestar is made in China, and we thought, is that any better? It’s almost impossible to have a fully ethical supply chain today. But Elon really put me off staying with Tesla – I’m a Tesla fanboy who jumped ship.Henry, 50, Bedfordshire‘There’s no way I’d sell my Tesla because of the CEO’s political views’They are incredible cars. I bought a Model 3 Performance in 2019, and get software updates on a regular basis so the car consistently improves and offers new features. For me, once you’ve owned a Tesla, there’s no going back. It’s the iPhone equivalent of cars – everything works really well and is easy to use.We’ve seen on the news the fools who think it’s OK vandalising Teslas. I get quips from friends, saying, “Has anyone keyed yours yet?” But this hasn’t worried me about my car. I don’t think these activists represent more than a fraction of a per cent of the population.There’s no way I’d sell my Tesla because of the CEO’s political views. I disagree with some things Musk says and does, but I could say the same for everyone, and I don’t see what the fuss is about with Doge. The attacks he’s endured have been disproportionate and dishonest. What I worry about is how easily people can be programmed to hate a company to such an extent. It’s been pretty astonishing.Tom, 51, SpainView image in fullscreenThe burnt-out remains of a Tesla in the Steglitz district of Berlin. Police were investigating after four Tesla cars parked in different streets went up in flames earlier this month,Photograph: Omer Messinger/Getty Images‘It really hurts to think that some of our savings have gone to someone like Musk’I’m not rich, and my wife and I planned for a long time before we put our savings together to buy an electric vehicle. A car is not a status symbol for me, it’s a practical object and we wanted to reduce our carbon emissions as much as possible.There’s no Tesla showroom in Slovakia yet, so a couple of years ago we had to get a company in Bratislava to import one from Austria. Tesla drivers here still wave at each other because we’re so rare. While buying it, a friend warned me about Musk. Back then I just thought, probably if you dig deep enough into any corporation you’ll find someone with unpleasant views.But if I were buying a car today, there’s no way I’d get a Tesla. It really hurts to think that some of our savings have gone to a company led by someone like Musk. When he started supporting the AfD in Germany, or his associations with Trump, or what they’re now doing to USAid and federal employees – I’ve just felt worse and worse about giving the company thousands of euros.It’s now worth a lot less than we paid. And it was a lot of money to us, we can’t just ditch it. It’s a symptom of a rather sad time that we live in, really.Steven, 50, Slovakia*Some names changed.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEthical and green livingMotoringElon MuskEuropeTravel and transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The not-causing-a-national-outcry part of that was easy. All I had to do was show up and not be a thinly veiled agent of Trumpian expansionism while pretending to care about dog sled races.The other part – going to Greenland in the first place – is harder to explain. I’m not an explorer, a sailor or a climate scientist. I don’t belong to any of the vanishingly few occupations with legitimate reasons to visit the Arctic Circle. I was there, inexplicably, as a literary journalist.In 2014, a 24-year-old Greenlandic writer called Niviaq Korneliussen published her debut novel, written in Greenlandic rather than the dominant Danish language. (Greenland is self-governing on domestic policy, but has been a Danish territory since the 18th century.) Four years later, it had been translated into English with the titleCrimson, and become a bestseller. I had been sent to profile this unlikely literary superstar.A few days after the editor first emailed me about the assignment, a car arrived in the middle of the night to take me to Heathrow. I was halfway there when I realised that my weatherproof coat was still hanging, supposedly unmissably, next to my front door. I landed in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, with nothing but a big cardigan to protect me from the elements.My preparation was lacking in other ways too. I’d made contact with Korneliussen before travelling, but intended to call to confirm arrangements when I arrived. Except Greenland isn’t covered by EU mobile roaming agreements, so my phone didn’t work. No matter: I could use the wifi at my hotel to email.So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreBut the hotel – actually a seamen’s hostel – hadn’t put a password on its network. When I arrived, a large cruise ship was sitting in the nearby harbour, soaking up all the bandwidth. As I stood at the front desk, almost in tears about this professional disaster, a sailor walked past and called out a cheerful greeting of “Hey, English!” I’ve never felt so foreign in my life.The amazing thing, really, is that I could make it to Greenland in such chaotic fashion and not die of exposure. For millennia, the ice-smothered island had been luring travellers on to its barely habitable fringes, and then repulsing them. The earliest known settlers were Norse – walrus hunters who traded the ivory with visiting ships, and scratched out a difficult living from Greenland’s small patch of farmable land.Sometime in the 15th century, the Norse Greenlanders vanished and nothing in the historical record can say whether it was famine, disease or the sheer chilly isolation that finished them off. Their disappearance, writes the journalist Jon Gertner in his excellent bookThe Ice at the End of the World, “remains one of European history’s supreme mysteries”.The Inuit ancestors of today’s majority Greenlanders only arrived about 800 years ago, and maintained a healthily suspicious attitude to their home. In their folk stories, the ice caps were a place of strange creatures and unknown horrors. The few Europeans who visited tended to agree. Hans Egede, an 18th-century Danish missionary, declared that the centre of Greenland could have “no use to mankind”.Some men, though, wanted to change that. In the late 19th century, two explorers staked their claim to the strange, hostile landscape. First the Dane Fridtjof Nansen crossed the island from west to east, surviving brutal temperatures and terrifying crevasses to make the 260-mile journey by foot and on ski. It took 11 weeks.That stung the American Robert Peary into competition. He undertook an even longer and more fearsome route, crossing the northern part of Greenland. It was physically punishing, but perhaps even more so mentally, surrounded by nothing but blaring whiteness in the endless sun of the Arctic summer. On the ice, wrote Peary, “the nightmare of emptiness possessed us”.It wasn’t clear at that point in history whether Greenland would end up being Danish or American, but the Danes staked their claim first, establishing trading posts in the early 20th century. Since then technology – and climate change – have made Greenland ever more accessible.You no longer have to make iceberg-dodging approaches to the coast by ship: you can get a plane. And when you get there and find yourself improperly attired, you don’t have to get native Greenlanders to make you clothing from reindeer hide that’s been arduously chewed until it’s soft enough to stitch (which is how Peary got himself fitted out).I sat in the airport marvelling at how ill-equipped I was to survive in a place so implacably indifferent to my plansInstead, you go to Nuuk’s shopping centre to buy yourself a new jacket, which is what I did. It was gougingly expensive (island prices), but still better than the pitying look I got from Korneliussen when we eventually met and she saw I was dressed in knitwear. Still, I wasn’t in danger of hypothermia: the temperature while I was there was a blazingly summery 10C.You shouldn’t imagine that Greenland has become too tame, though. Nuuk is the size of a small market town, and wilderness presses in as soon as you reach its limits. Hard, black volcanic rocks rear up from the shallow turf. There are no roads connecting Greenland’s settlements: the terrain is too rugged.The weather turned the day I was going home. It was touch and go whether my connection to Iceland would be able to take off at all: I believe it was the last flight to leave Greenland for 48 hours. I sat in the airport, hugging myself in my new jacket, marvelling at how ill-equipped I was to survive in a place so implacably indifferent to my plans.The lesson the Vances should take from their ill-fated expedition is that Greenland doesn’t care about human ambition and desires. Donald Trump’s attempt to take possession of it is just another episode in its contested history. But, even today, you cannot simply stroll on to the island and take it. So far, the Greenlanders themselves have made it very clear that they won’t be welcoming this new generation of American adventurers.Sarah Ditum is a journalist and the author of the bookToxic: Women, Fame and the Noughties.

That’s undoubtedly true in the age of Trump – but maybe it’s always been so. The White House’s undisguised contempt for loyal allies in the UK and Europe necessitates a robust reciprocal rethink. How healthy – and desirable – is this partnership? Has it caused more problems than it’s worth?Those, myself included, who throughout their professional lives have taken close transatlantic ties for granted, face some awkward questions. Is the US-UK “special relationship” an embarrassment, even a strategic liability? Today’s America is evidentlynot a trustworthy, disinterested friend. Was it ever?As I write my lastforeign affairs commentaryfor theObserver, I look back over nearly 50 years and wonder, firstly, at the false narrative, not confined to Donald Trump, that American altruism is exploited by “freeloading” European Nato allies. What tosh! US troops and missiles are based here primarily to defend the US. Since 1945, Washington has viewed Europe as its first line of defence against Russia. Germany was the US’s preferred cold war battlefield, Britain its airfield. Perish the thought that Americans might actually fight on their own soil (except against each other). US wars are typically waged in faraway places. That’s why the 1962 Cuba missile crisis came as such a shock.The trouble with America began at conception. The “war of independence” that started as a middle-class taxpayers’ revolt was a stab in the back for Europe’s struggle against Napoleon’s tyranny – the Vladimir Putin of his time. American resistance to British efforts to suppress the global slave trade perpetuatedanother evil.Claims the US saved Britain in 1940 are overblown. Britain saved itself. Franklin Roosevelt steered clear until forced to fight by Pearl Harbor and Hitler’s 1941 declaration of war. Postwar Britain, devastated and penniless, watched as the US grabbed its global markets and military bases. Suez in 1956 cemented its fall. It was stillpaying off war loans in 2006. Americans may dispute these historical perspectives, yet they lend present-day context. The nuclear arms race, numerous cold war coups and proxy wars in Africa and Latin America, catastrophe in Vietnam, Nato’s 1980s Euro-missile crisis and the first Gulf war were all troublesome US storylines for which UK-Europe support was expected, indeed demanded.View image in fullscreenExplosions rock the World Trade Center after being hit by two planes on 11 September 2001 in New York City.Photograph: Allsport UK/AllsportMore Uncle Sam craziness followed in the shape of the post-9/11 “global war on terror”, Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and the vengeful madness of “King” George (W Bush). Nato backed the invasion of Afghanistan. But then came Iraq, nonexistent weapons of mass destruction,Abu Ghraib, and all the ensuing democracy-damaging lies, misery and failures.Out of Iraq came Islamic State; out of Afghanistan, after 20 years of bloodshed, came a resurgent, gloating Taliban.Barack Obama abandoned Syria. Now Trump, America’s burger-eating surrender monkey,sides with Russia, and betrays Ukraine and the west. For all these made-in-the-US calamities, a weak Europe shares some blame. But the high price paid by allies grows unaffordable.Unquestioning US support for Israel and the mass murder of Palestinians fuels antisemitism, far-right nationalism and European instability.Emboldened by Trump, Putin’s threat to Poland and the Baltic republics intensifies. US foreign aid cuts and reckless climate and energy policies imperil millions, accelerating northwards migration from Africa. Trump threatens Iran with all-out war,pushing it towards nuclear weapons.Are US policymakers innately incompetent, uninformed or simply unlucky? It scarcely matters as long as Britain and Europe feel locked in a toxic relationship from which there is no escape. Except Trump and his good ’ol boys,oozing online hillbilly hostility, unwittingly offer a chance of deliverance to those bold enough to take it.The American hegemon has always exacted onerous tribute. Trump’s tariffs reflect abiding lust for loot and domination. US pharmaceutical companies, food and drink multinationals and tech and social media giants plunder the empire’s subject lands onfavourable, ill-regulated terms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Concepts of shared values and universal laws are fracturing as Trump targets “woke” andtears up the UN rulebook.Billy-no-mates Britain faces a particular problem, post-Brexit. Its nuclear weapons, armed forces, security services, defence industries, financial markets and export businesses are inextricablyin thrall to the US imperium. The UK clings desperately to a sense of “specialness” to sustain fading self-belief.Yet Steve Witkoff, Trump’s useless Ukraine envoy,calls Keir Starmer’s plan a “pose”. Vice-president JD Vance,the intrepid Greenland explorer, mocks the UK as a “random country”. Some weird geezer named Hegseth claims we are “pathetic”. What depth of insult, what degree of disrespect, would convince Britain’s too-nice prime minister to stop propping up collapsing transatlantic bridges?Such rudeness and condescension do not come out of nowhere. We British know; those ugly Americanslearned their imperial arrogance from us. What’s new is Trump’s debasement and corruption of America’s constitutional and democratic tradition. Moral authority is being lost, and with it the right to lead.Huge convulsions punctuate US history: the civil war, prohibition, the Great Depression, McCarthyism, Watergate, 9/11. The Trump-Maga spasm follows that pattern. It, too, will pass. Or will it? While the US prefers dictators to democrats, punishes its friends, and lies, bullies and plots to stealallies’ sovereign territory, there is no going back. Many, perhaps most, Americans abhor this vile behaviour – yet unaccountably fail to stop it.Forget what Starmer says. Britain will have to choose. It has kowtowed to the US all our lives, and this is where it has got us. Gradual strategic disengagement from America, coupled with renewed integration in a reformed, revitalised Europe, is the only sane, safe path. Stop feeding the monster.

Europe, and Britain, must offer them sanctuarySat 29 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 12.38 EDTShareAt international academic conferences recently, one sees an interesting trend. Some American participants are travelling with“burner” phonesor have minimalist laptops running browsers and not much else. In other words, they are equipped with the same kind of kit that security-conscious people used to bring 15 years ago when travelling to China.So what’s up? Well, these academics have a finger on the pulse of Trump’s America, and are concerned about what might happen when they return home. They’ve read onRobert Reich’s Substackabout the French scientist who was prevented from entering the country because US Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his “personal opinion” to colleagues and friends about Trump’s science policies.Or they’ve heard about DrRasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the US after visiting relatives in Lebanon. She was deported, reports Reich, “despite having a valid visa and a court order” blocking her removal. “Federal authorities alleged that they found ‘sympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures’ in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February.”And they also know aboutMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, whom – though he is a legal permanent resident of the US and has not been charged with a crime – the government is trying to deport because he had participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.Those pro-Gaza demonstrations so irked the Trump regime that it demanded the return of $400m of federal research funding. When Columbia sought a meeting to discuss the matter, itreceived a lettersetting out the conditions that it would have to accept before the government would deign to talk. These included a stipulation that Columbia must “begin the process of placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for a minimum of five years”.The bullying of Columbia is the canary in the coalmine which reveals the Trump-Musk junta has it in for American universities. There are two reasons for their hostility. The first is that, as elite institutions devoted to freedom of inquiry and the telling of uncomfortable truths, they are anathema to the new autocrats in Washington. The second is that some of them (the so-called Ivy League) are fabulously wealthy, being for the most part hedge funds with nice universities attached. And if there’s one thing thatDonald Trumpcannot abide, it is large pots of money that he and his ghastly tribe can smell but not touch. So if the aloof trustees of Harvard, Princeton, Yale et al think that their august institutions lie beyond his reach, perhaps they should understand that Trump looks on them much as Henry VIII looked on the rich monasteries of his heyday.What are UK institutions doing to meet the coming challenge? The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing muchMany teachers and researchers in US universities are now fearful of what lies ahead. No line of inquiry is safe from the raging firestorm of Maga intolerance. Many of the most vulnerable areas of inquiry lie in the health sector – LGBTQ+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and so on. But there’s also endangered research on environmental issues and the climate crisis, socioeconomic inequality, plus the humanities, social science and astrophysics.The looming crisis in the US is beginning to remind people in Europe of the 1930s, when the UK and the US began to realise that Jewish scientists needed to be rescued from the Nazis. About 2,000 scientists and academics fled the fascist countries between 1933 and 1941, fearing for themselves or Jewish family members. Then, universities in the US and the UK made space for and welcomed a whole generation of geniuses – Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Max Born, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, to name just a few. Likewise, members of the Frankfurt School were rescued and installed in New York, where they becamemightily critical of American capitalismbut at least lived to tell their particular tale. As did Thomas Mann.Now, in a different age, there are stirrings in Europe to provide safe places for American researchers. In France, Aix-Marseille University iswelcoming American scientistswhose work has become untenable after the Trump administration’s cuts in certain academic sectors. The Free University of Brussels (VUB) is opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, which areopen to American researchersworking in socially relevant fields. The fellowships come with substantial funding (€2.5m) as part of the European Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. It’s also aiming to attract American professors looking to relocate. VUB, with its Francophone sister university ULB, is providing 18 apartments for international researchers seeking temporary residence at the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies.This is the beginning of something hopeful. But it also raises the question of what UK institutions are doing to meet the coming challenge. The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing much. Perhaps that’s because most of British academia still can’t get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the “special relationship” is yesterday’s story.What I’ve been readingHow I accidentally got sent Trump’s Yemen textsJeffrey Goldberg’sastonishing storyabout the White House security leak in theAtlantic.Philosophy and fatherhoodA curious tendency among western philosophersexplored in an intriguing post by Doug Muir.AI has learned to reason …… or has it?

It seems like the creepy billionaire’s insemination obsession has rubbed off on Trump: the legally definedsexual predatoris now calling himself “the fertilization president”.Trump proudly unveiled this new nickname for himself on Wednesday at aWhite House eventcelebrating Women’s History Month. Someone should probably report this event to the DEI police, by the way, because I am pretty sure the president himself made acknowledging women’s history verboten. Earlier this year, for example,it was reportedthat a number of federal agencies were banning celebrations related to Martin Luther King Jr Day, Black History Month, Women’s History Month and other “special observances” because they didn’t want to fall foul of Trump’swide-ranging executive orderon diversity, equity and inclusion.This particular event, however, appears to have been permitted because thecurated crowdconsisted of the sort of women Trump approves of: very white, and very deferential. The White House has uploaded a number of videos of the attenders gazing adoringly at Trump – who once vowed to be aprotector of women“whether the women like it or not” – as he rambled on.“We’re going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too, the women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we’re talking about. It’s going to be, it’s going to be great,” Trump told the crowd. When the crowd started laughing appreciatively, Trump said “fertilization” again, before adding: “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president, that’s not bad, that’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right? I like it.”To be clear: a cat didn’t accidentally walk over my keyboard while I was writing this. This is a precise transcription of what Trump said. The man has always beenalarmingly incoherent– and yet with much of this, the press still seems intent on editing his wild ramblings into something that makes them seem more normal. Poynter has termed this “sanewashing”.I’m afraid I can’t seem to find what was in the goody bags that were given out at the Women’s History Month event. (Elon Musk’s phone number, perhaps?) Nor can I tell you exactly what was going through Trump’s head as he was waxing lyrical about fertilization – amid digressions about theprice of eggsand gas – at an event meant to celebrate women’s achievements. But, to put the fertilization remarks in a little more context, he brought them up after boasting that he’d signed an executive order expanding access to (often very expensive) fertility treatments like IVF.This boast is technically true: in February, Trump signed an executive order directing the domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the costs for accessing IVF. However, this was really nothing more than a PR move. As the Guardian’s Carter Shermannoted at the time:“[T]he lack of direct action on IVF in Trump’s … order is striking, especially in the context of Trump’s other executive orders, which have issued sweeping – and potentially illegal – mandates … The order does not, for example, mandate private employers cover IVF in the way that they are required to covercontraception.”His (totally meaningless) executive order was meant to fulfil promises Trump had made on thecampaign trail, where – in a brazen attempt to appeal to female voters – he supported making IVF more affordable. He also declared himself the “father of IVF” last October, while also admitting he’d only just found out what the procedure was. During, his debate with Kamala Harris, he similarlyproclaimedhe had “been a leader on IVF, which is fertilization”.Will Trump go any further than giving himself weird nicknames, and actually do something meaningful to increase access to IVF? Possibly. On the one hand, he has to tread carefully around IVF because it’s a sensitive topic for many anti-abortion zealots who believefrozen embryosshould be legally considered children, and who have been pushing toseverely curtail accessto the procedure. On the other hand, however, Trump does have Musk, one of the world’s most passionate pro-natalists, whispering in his ear about how the US needs more babies.If Trump does make IVF more accessible, it certainly won’t be more accessible for everyone. Just look at Viktor Orbán’s Hungary – a rightwing autocracy that many conservatives in the US look to as a blueprint for what they want to achieve at home – and the pro-natalist policies there. Hungary has a state-run IVF system and offers generous fertility and parental benefits to a certain subset of people. AsMother Jones has explained: “[T]he closer you look at Hungary’s eligibility requirements for family benefits, the more clearly you see the kind of babies Orbán wants to populate his boom: not just Hungarian nationals, but children from married, heterosexual, middle-income and up Hungarian nationals with stay-at-home moms.”My wife and I spent a huge amount of money on fertility treatments to have our child and I know a lot of people who have made enormous financial sacrifices to access IVF. Ordinarily, I’d cheer on any attempts to broaden access to it. But, amid his wider war on reproductive rights, Trump’s declaration that he’s the “fertilization president” feels menacing.Women, it seems Trump is going to protect you, whether you like it or not!

Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid into Gaza over the last few weeks, for example, and roughly1 million kids are without basic necessities yet again.The week in pawtriarchyI suggest you don’t look up why they are there (the answer is grim) but season 2 of the Apple TV series Severance features a lot of goats. According to Gwendoline Christie, they were chaotic little divas on set. “Goats don’t care about being on television,”she quipped to People. “Goats also have an incredible self-confidence. They feel comfortable to eat clothes whilst you’re wearing them.” Never work with children or animals, they say.

But today, that threat is very real.Just this week, Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student at Tufts University,was arrestedmere blocks from where I live after publishing an op-ed in her university newspaper describing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as genocide. That was the full extent of her activism, yet despite having all her documentation in order, she was taken abruptly and transported to Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from her home.At the university where I work, many colleagues and students are foreign nationals, and recent conversations have revolved around how to navigate this chilling new reality. A Middle Eastern friend who attended protests recently told me she’s started altering her daily route to and from campus – knowing Ice typically conducts arrests in public spaces.White House asks supreme court to allow deportations under wartime lawRead moreAnother international couple told me they’ve exchanged social media passwords to alert each other immediately if something happens, and created an emergency protocol in case one of them suddenly disappears. As I wrote this column, another colleague emailed a Spanish newspaper asking them to erase her previously published opinion pieces out of fear of retaliation. Several German colleagues, similarly cautious, have begun regularly deleting WhatsApp conversations after a French scientist was turned away at the US border for private text messages criticizing Donald Trump.Whether or not these specific individuals face imminent deportation is beside the point. The real danger lies in the chilling effect: the Trump administration’s policies deliberately target not only undocumented immigrants – as seen during Trump’s first term – but also perfectly legal immigrants. It is no coincidence that only those who publicly criticize the administration or its allies find themselves under threat. This represents a calculated strategy to silence dissent.Mark Twain once observed that history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And the rhyme with the US’s darker chapters is undeniable here. The current use of state security apparatuses to suppress activism resembles tactics employed during the 1960s and 1970s, when US intelligence agencies infiltrated student, leftwing and anti-racist movements. Back then, the strategy was to sow distrust and dismantle resistance through systematic infiltration. Today, it involves silencing voices of opposition by arbitrarily detaining students for peacefully exercising their right to dissent. The abuses of J Edgar Hoover and James Jesus Angleton were only exposed through the courageous efforts of activists and the Church and Pike committees, awakening the US’s collective conscience. Today, such repression occurs openly in broad daylight, exemplified by the sight of six men arresting a doctoral student without a judicial warrant – and thus without the need for probable cause – for the simple act of writing an opinion article.Democratic backsliding is gradual; authoritarian regimes always begin by targeting the most vulnerable. A few years ago, it was undocumented immigrants; today, it’s lawful residents speaking out against Trump. Americans who oppose the values espoused by this administration should harbor no illusions: if this arbitrary repression goes unchallenged, they will certainly become the next targets.Berna León is a visiting fellow at Harvard University, where he teaches political theory.

Although the secretaries of defense, state and treasury, the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, the vice-president, and the president’s chief of staff were among the 18 people included, neither the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, who is a statutory member of the principals committee of the National Security Council, nor any military designee was invited into this group. Instead, the editor of the Atlantic,Jeffrey Goldberg, was sent a link. Waltz noted: “Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days.”The Atlantic’s publication of Goldberg’s article about the Signal group’s exchanges was followed by a spray of attempts to cover it up. Trump and the rest of his administration simply denied that anything classified had been released; there were no “war plans”, it was a “hoax”, Goldberg was “scum”, “a loser” and “discredited”, and what about Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton? Which prompted Goldberg to publish the detailed war plans he had withheld in his first article. He was the only responsible person involved in the incident.Quite apart from the glaring incompetence and illegality of the whole affair – Goldberg’s careless inclusion, the fact that a provision of the Espionage Act (18 USC § 793) criminalizes “gross negligence” for mishandling classified national security material, and that operating on Signal with timed deletion of messages violates the preservation of records for the National Archives – the conversation pulled back the curtain on the White House.For all intents and purposes, Stephen Miller acted as the de facto presidentThe transcript exposed the internal pecking order of theTrump administrationand its actual chain of command, if it could be called anything that regular. In the end, the final decision-maker within the group to whom the others deferred was not any cabinet secretary or the chief of staff. They turned to “SM” – Stephen Miller – the deputy chief of staff who is Trump’s zealous enforcer. The chief of staff, Susie Wiles, came across as a cheerleader. Miller was the one who gave the stamp of approval. He conveyed Trump’s word. For all intents and purposes, Stephen Miller acted as the de facto president.The desultory discussion on Signal also highlighted the juvenile towel-snapping bro culture at the top of the administration. The Fox News personalities in the cabinet and the others who have habituated themselves to blathering forceful opinions appeared in the leaked transcript to have seamlessly carried over their habits of loud and thoughtless talk. Above all, they don’t know when not to speak; nor do they know what they reveal about themselves when they do. They don’t know how to conduct themselves as serious people in the room. Their incompetence comes naturally.About the military plan on the eve of being executed,JD Vanceopined: “I think we are making a mistake.” By venturing his view at this advanced point in the operation, he showed that he had been out of the loop. Vice-presidents since Walter Mondale, under President Jimmy Carter, have been made indispensable figures in important decisions, especially involving national security. But Vance sounded like an outsider, a guest on a podcast.The Trump team group chat news is obscuring an essential question | Mohamad BazziRead moreHe went on about how the Houthis menacing the trade in the Hormuz Strait affected Europe more than the United States. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” he said. Vance felt that it was Trump who was out of the loop or assumed Trump’s ignorance. If only Trump understood his own contradictions.But Vance conceded: “I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself.” Where did he think he would voice his dissent, Joe Rogan’s show? He did not know Goldberg was already listening in. Then Vance suggested: “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”“There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line,” piped up Joe Kent, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, lending support to Vance. Kent has been an overlooked figure in the scandal. He has anextensive historyof associations with extremist domestic terrorist organizations. As a Republican congressional candidate, he paid a consulting fee to a member of the Proud Boys; he has also been close to the Christian nationalist Patriot Prayer group involved in violent street brawls in Portland;defendedthewhite supremacist Nick Fuentes; and stated: “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with there being a white people special interest group,” during an interview with a group called the American Populist Union. In 2022, after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Kentcalledhim “very reasonable”. When Kent ran for the House that year, after his ties to the far right were exposed, he claimed he had distanced himself from such groups. Kent was the deputy of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, on the Signal group.Waltz joined in the Europe-bashing with talking points to buttress Trump’s zero-sum mercantilist view of the world, explaining: “Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”Vance broke in to say that if Hegseth wanted “to do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”Hegseth agreed: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” He added: “Question is timing.”Enter Stephen Miller. “As I heard it,” he said, “the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”The allies are not really allies; they are renters, and the rent should be raised“As I heard it …” Miller spoke as if he were the only one to hear Trump. No one else said they had. Miller was definitive. He was more than the Trump whisperer. He was the voice of Trump.Miller also chimed in on the chorus of contempt for Europe. It was as though Europe was the enemy. The allies are not really allies; they are renters, and the rent should be raised.On 15 March, Hegseth returned with an “update” of precise details of the attack. “I will say a prayer for victory,” he wrote. It was a go. As it proceeded, Waltz chronicled the targets hit on Signal.Susie Wiles weighed in: “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.”Waltz posted three emojis – a fist, a flag and a fire.“Great work all. Powerful start,” said Miller. He was the one to give the praise. He apparently had the authority.In Russia, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy, responded with two prayer emojis, a flexed muscle emoji and two American flag emojis.Afterward, Witkoff, a former New York real estate operator and Trump golfing partner, gave aninterviewto Tucker Carlson, the far-right podcaster who is highly influential with JD Vance and Hegseth, in which Witkoff said he “liked” Vladimir Putin, who was not “a bad guy”, “straight up”, and had presented him with a portrait of Trump to take home – “such a gracious moment”.What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreProclaimed a “success”, the operation itself will do little to quell the Iran-backed Houthis, who resumed their missile attacks on shipping in the Hormuz Strait after Benjamin Netanyahu, seeking to maintain his fragile grasp on power, abandoned the ceasefire in Gaza, which Trump declared he “fully supports” after doing nothing to sustain it. Instead, Trump proposed turning the ravaged Palestinian territory into a beachfront property, a “riviera of the Middle East”. Trump shared an AI-generated video of himself and Netanyahu lolling on the beach with dollars raining down and half-naked dancing women. Trump’s policy, of which the Houthi strike supposedly demonstrates “success”, has further entangled the US in cycles of violence without any clear path forward.As soon as Goldberg’s article appeared, the cover-up effort began. “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic; to me it’s a magazine that is going out of business,” Trump said. “I know nothing about it. You’re saying that they had what?”Republicans in the Congress stammered or were silent. At last, the senator Roger Wicker, of Mississippi, chair of the Senate intelligence committee, called for an expedited report from the Pentagon’s inspector general. Unfortunately, there is no such inspector general – at least not a permanent one. Trump fired him on 27 January along with 16 others across federal agencies and departments, without reason, contrary to the Inspector General Act of 1978, tightened in 2022. “I don’t know [the fired inspectors general],” Trumpsaid, “but some people thought that some were unfair or were not doing the job.” For now, there is an acting inspector general.The scandal might have been avoided if Hegseth could have consulted with the Pentagon’s legal authorities, the judge advocate generals. But hefiredthe top Jag officers of the army, navy and air force three weeks before the Signal group was formed.Nor did Hegseth, or anyone else, apparently think to include the joint chiefs of staff, who just might have objected to the obvious sloppiness and illegality of the Signal setup. But on 21 February,Trump firedthe chair of the joint chiefs, the four-star general CQ Brown Jr, the chief of naval operations and the air force vice-chief of staff. He had alreadyremoved the chief of the US Coast Guard.Brown, the former air force chief, was the first Black person to head a branch of the armed forces. “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt,” said Hegseth in dismissing Brown. Adm Christopher Grady, serving as the acting chair of the joint chiefs, was not sent the invitation for the Signal group that Goldberg received.To replace Brown, Trump has nominated a retired three-star general, Dan Caine, whom Trump insists on calling “Razin’ Caine”. But no one raised Caine to participate in the chat.He might be grateful to have been ignored. Instead of the three-star general, Waltz mobilized three emojis.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakOpinionTrump administrationUS national securityDonald TrumpJD VancePete HegsethUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

But what if it spares us from learning, writing, painting and exploring the world?Joseph EarpIf I reduced my existence to a series of ChatGPT prompts, the act of my living is only shorter – not betterSat 29 Mar 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 21.41 EDTShareAs much as I have the general vibe of a luddite (strange hobbies, socially maladjusted, unfathomable fashion choices, etc) I have to hand it to automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives less boring.I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls anaesthetised dentistry an “unmixed blessing”.I would add some other unmixed blessings to that list: I like watching videos of cool birds on YouTube; I’m happy when my phone gently reminds me that it’s time to get up and go for a walk after I’ve watched too many cool birds on YouTube; and I have no problems whatsoever with the printing press.For great stories, we need people, not AI | LettersRead moreBut one of the many things about the so-called “AI revolution” that makes me want to run for the hills is the promise that AI will simplify things that should not be simple – that I would neverwantto be simple.In matters of technology, I operate on one guiding principle: I give my computer the work that I do not want to do, and that I gain little by doing myself. The ideal model of the computer, I think, is the calculator: if I sat there with a piece of paper and a pen, I could probably do most of the sums myself that I ask my calculator to do. But that would take time, and I’m a busy man (lots of cool bird videos to watch), and so I give it to a computer to work out.What I am not happy to outsource is most of the things that AI is desperate for me to outsource. I do not want a computer to summarise texts sent by my friends into shorter sentences, as though the work of being updated on the lives of those I love is somehow strenuous or not what being alive is all about. I do not want Google’s AI feature to summarise my search into a pithy (often incorrect) paragraph, rather than reading the investigative work of my fellow humans. I don’t want AI to clean up the pictures that I take on my phone that are rich and strange in their messiness.And I certainly do not want AI to write my books for me, or paint my pictures. Not only would the work be terrible: it wouldn’t even be work. As all creatives know, there is limited joy inhaving written a book– as soon as it is done, most of us are on to the next thing. The thrill, the joy, the beauty, is in thewriting of a book. If you outsource your creative work to a computer, you are not a creative. Someone who merely churns out product is not an artist – they are a salesperson. The artist is the person who makes, not who has made.Simply put: I don’t know where this endless march of shortening the act of living leads us to. AI promises to free up time. But if what it spares us from is learning from our friends, writing, painting and exploring the world, then what, actually, are we meant to do with that time?It’s increasingly clear that a computercouldlive my life for me, all while I atrophy, never going outside. But if I reduced my existence to a series of ChatGPT prompts, the act of my living is only shorter, not better. And despite what tech bros tell me, those are not the same thing.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

Such organisations shouldn’t have to do what is properly the work of the government, and perhaps the Wigmore’s decision is the start of resistance to this. I certainly hope so.On the face of it, the Wiggy, which specialises in chamber and early music, seems the opposite of radical. Its cloakroom and old-fashioned, over-lit basement restaurant always remind me of the Sheffield City Hall I knew as a child; I love it and think of it as a safe space, but whenever I’m there, I spend most of my time worrying that I’ll cough, thus incurring the disapproval of members of its crazily attentive and committed audience. But hey, appearances can be deceptive. The revolution will not be televised, but it may accompanied by a lute and a soaring tenor voice.Middle-earth magicView image in fullscreenSt Hubert’s Roman Catholic church at Dunsop Bridge in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire.Photograph: Martin Berry/AlamyLike Queen Elizabeth II, who owned quite a lot of it, I sometimes dream of retiring to the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Unknown to many, it unfolds before you, magical and secret, its incomparable brown-greenness somehow always tipped with gold even on a grey day. Tolkien went to Stonyhurst College, which is close to the Ribble, one of two rivers that flow through it, and once you’ve seen it with your own eyes, you know there’s no doubting this was the inspiration for Middle-earth.In Dunsop Bridge, a tiny village bordered only by fells, we wandered into St Hubert’s, a Catholic church designed by Edward Pugin for the Towneley family in 1865. A notice informed us that the Towneleys funded the building with the winnings of their racehorse, Kettledrum, and, sure enough, high on the painted roof of the apse, we found the thoroughbred, as glossy and brown as a conker. God moves in mysterious ways, and it seems he may have played his part in the last-minute faltering of the favourite at the 1861 Epsom Derby, a drama that allowed Kettledrum to win by a length.Unpicking White LotusView image in fullscreenSarah Catherine Hook playing Piper Ratliff in a scene from The White Lotus.Photograph: HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.Is it my imagination, or is the third season ofThe White Lotusreceiving a level of attention the first two did not?

Scientists are only just beginning to understand what this does to usRuth OgdenOur research in October showed that ‘falling back’ had a negative impact on women, especially mothers. Do we need to shift the way we think about time?Sat 29 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 04.27 EDTShareTwice a year we change the clocks. For many it is not clear why and how this change affects us. So last October, with the help of the Guardian, a group of scientists at Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Oxford conducted anationwide surveyto understand the impact on people’s daily lives.More than 12,000 people answered questions about their wellbeing, satisfaction with life and stress levels, completing the survey in the week before the clocks went back and again in the days immediately after. When we compared the responses, we found that women’s mental health and wellbeing suffered in the immediate aftermath of the clocks going back, while men experienced greater wellbeing and greater satisfaction with life. So what does this tell us about the way we experience time?The changing of the clocks –introduced in Britainduring the first world war – is a long debated issue. For some people, it provides a welcome sign of the changing seasons. However, this is not the case for everyone. Our analysis showed that women were more likely to associate the autumn clock changing with worry, confusion, guilt and stress. The fact that we observed these differences within one or two days of the clock change suggests that it caused the negative effects, rather than the gradual accumulation of dark nights. As one female participant said: “I am spinning out of control. Mind is overactive. Very behind in tasks. No idea what time it is.”Women reported particular difficulty in adjusting young children to the new routine. Disrupted bedtimes and difficulty getting them ready on time in the morning added additional stress to family life. Many women reported that after the October clock change, their sense of the days dragging increased. In our analysis of the sentiment of written accounts, we found men reporting significantly more positive experiences than women. One felt he had “accomplished more already” in the “extra” hour.Both men and women also reported a worsening of work-life balance following the changing of the clocks in October. Perhaps the sudden change to darker evenings reduces how much time we feel we have outside the working day for ourselves. While dark nights are unavoidable during winter, the overnight clock change prevents us from gently adjusting over a period of weeks. As one female participant said: “The feeling of the sudden darkness this evening filled me with dread for the dark months … A gradual daily shift would be so much easier to cope with.” In a society in which burnout is a leadingcause of absencefrom work, the health and economic consequences of a policy that impairs work-life balance should clearly be closely monitored.For lovers of lighter evenings, however, there is also bad news about the coming switch to British summer time. Research suggests that the spring clock change is associated with an increase incar accidentsandheart attacks. There is also some evidence to suggest that it may negatively affect mental wellbeing, with the change in time appearing toexacerbate symptomsin people with pre-existing conditions such as seasonal affective disorder and depression.Perhaps waking earlier makes us feel as though we have even less time than before, increasing stress levels and reducing satisfaction with life. It might only be one hour that we “lose”, but the effects for wellbeing may be substantial. To understand this, we are inviting Guardian readers to take part in ournew studyexploring the impact of the spring clock change on wellbeing.Some of these negative effects of the clock change may be explained by its impact on our biological clock. Circadian rhythms, which dictate when we eat and sleep,become disruptedby the changing time – a bit like jet lag but without the joy of travel. Disruption to sleep and the burden of adjusting to a new rhythm can raise levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which if prolonged can leave usmore vulnerableto a range of physical and mental health conditions. Such negative consequences for health and wellbeing led the American Medical Association to propose that we shouldstop changing the clocksaltogether.Our work on clock changes makes us think about the effects of time more generally. This work is part of abigger projectwhere we look at all the ways in which the power of time is used to shape society and our lives within it. This work always tells us the same tale: our experience of time is a barometer for our wellbeing. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, 80% of people felt as thoughtime warpedas a result of lockdown measures. Those who struggled with the loss of routine and social interactions experienced longer, slower lockdowns than those who thrived under lockdown conditions.I’ve got a new secret weapon against insomnia: a £20 strip of padded fabricRead moreImpositions of time, such as clock changes and lockdowns, illustrate how modern life puts us at the mercy of the ticking of a clock. It is the invisible hand of power that forces us to do things, often without our realising. Our bodies have evolved to be carefully attuned to our environments. We thrive on having predictable rhythms around when we sleep, eat, work and socialise. These rhythms keep us in sync with our bodies and communities, helping to give us a sense of belonging and stability.Now, however, work and sleep are no longer cued by the emergence of light, but by the demands of corporations. Advances in digital technology mean that many of usnever really switch off. Our time is becoming ever denser as we strive to fill every moment with productivity, leaving many people burnt out, ill and exhausted. In our current state of time poverty, it is no wonder that a sudden change in clock time causes stress and disruption. Maybe it isn’t just the hour change we need to rethink.The implications of these types of time-based policies are rarely experienced equally across society. Time policies that benefit some often have profound personal, social and economic consequences for others. Understanding the implications of external impositions of time is therefore critical to developing fairer, more equitable policies.We could start by looking at the changing of the clocks. But, ultimately, if we want tofeel as if we have more time,fundamental shifts in societal expectations about time, working practices and gender roles are required. Maybe if we had a right to free time, a guaranteed block during which we could switch off from the demands of the world around us, we could all live happier, healthier lives.Ruth Ogden is professor of the psychology of time at Liverpool John Moores University. Her study of the effects of clocks changing was undertaken with Prof Patricia Kingori, a sociologist at the University of Oxford’s Ethox CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet, even after Ekrem İmamoğlu’s arrest, they have hopeCarolin Würfel is a German writer based in IstanbulSat 29 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 13.34 EDTShareWhen I first visited Istanbul nearly 20 years ago, I spoke with an academic who had lived through Turkey’s military coups and political upheavals – some that had unfolded overnight. He was wise and wary, and though I didn’t fully grasp the weight of his words then, they have stayed with me. “If we’re not careful,” he warned in 2006, “we’ll end up under an authoritarian regime.”For two decades, his premonition lingered, occasionally breaking through the surface. But last week, the erosion of democratic principles became undeniable. Istanbul’s mayor,Ekrem İmamoğlu, was arrested on charges of corruption after a court ruling.Fear about the future has returned to a city that is usually loud and relentless. It is in the streets, in people’s faces, in the air. Tens of thousands gathered outside the city hall next to Saraçhane Park, marched through the streets, and protested outside the Çağlayan courthouse. Hundreds of thousands havemobilised nationwide, and the unrest – especially in Istanbul – shows no signs of fading. An elderly woman interviewed at a protest at Saraçhane Park looked into the camera and said: “I thought the youth was asleep. Turns out, they are wide awake.” A young man added: “We won’t turn a blind eye.”Sincemoving to Istanbulin 2021, I have been an observer – half tourist, half resident – in a city that may be both the hardest of any to grasp and yet the most alive. If one thing is certain, it is that Istanbul thrives on paradox. It is the only city in the world straddling two continents, constantly navigating the friction between east and west, tradition and modernity, faith and scepticism. Histories collide here every day. You don’t even need to cross the Bosphorus to witness it; a simple walk through Beyoğlu is enough.From Galataport – a sleek waterfront designed for cruise passengers and Instagram feeds – you walk through strictly religious Tophane, where alcohol remains taboo, butchers shout orders and Palestinian flags hang from balconies. Then, suddenly, you’re in Galata with its Italian architecture, or bustling Tomtom, where customers from wine bars spill on to the streets and church bells mix with the call to prayer. On İstiklal Caddesi, contradictions clash head on – beauty clinics advertising sculpted noses and hair transplants next to women in headscarves and others in crop tops.Children rummage through trash outside grand consulates. Elderly men walk arm in arm, deep in conversation. By night, queer clubs pulse with music just steps from the fish market. The city itself seems to insist: I won’t surrender. I am always everything at once. Or as the historian Ekrem Işın once wrote: “When we look at Istanbul, we always step into plurality. For Istanbul has never had just one civilisation, but civilisations; not just one history, but many histories; not just one way of life, but countless ways of living.”Daily life here means yielding to it all – the beauty, the struggle, the absurd. Over the past four years, I have seen my share, and I believe this resilience – this refusal to be flattened into a single story or ideology – is one of the city’s greatest strengths. (Even the language resists absolutes. Turkish, untouched by gender, is fluid and elusive.)View image in fullscreenA poster of Ekrem İmamoğlu, 19 March 2025, in Istanbul, Turkey.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesBut resilience isn’t immunity. I have watched as economic problems spiralled and inflation soared. Just four years ago, 10 Turkish lira bought €1; now, €1 buys 41 lira. Small coins are nearly worthless. The minimum wage was recently set at 22,104 lira a month, yet in Beyoğlu, renting an apartment for less than 30,000 lira is almost impossible. Many landlords demand payment in dollars. On dark days, my Turkish friends Google “the Great Depression” for solace; on lighter days, they laugh at the casino-like atmosphere. I have observed it all, fascinated and guilty, my euro income shielding me from struggles that aren’t mine to claim.I was here when theearthquake in south-eastern Turkeystruck. It had an immediate effect on life in Istanbul. Everyone I speak to now knows they should have enough supplies for three days, that rope ladders made of lightweight plastic exist, and that the safest place during a quake is the room with the fewest pieces of furniture.I watched the2023 presidential electionand the aftermath – some fell silent, others screamed with joy. I saw many friends apply for visas to leave Turkey and be turned down. Istanbul is magnetic, metaphorically and geographically, but the barriers between it and Europe often feel unbridgeable (even with three bridges in sight). Applying for a Schengen visa if you are Turkish has become a humiliating ritual – endless paperwork, arbitrary rejections. “It’s like begging for a holiday, and you’re the one paying for it,” a friend said bitterly.A passport is now not only a privilege but an investment. The current price: 11,281 lira for 10 years. Many abandon travel plans altogether – it’s not worth feeling like a “third-class citizen”. My German passport is a key that opens doors my friends can only dream of. Their reality reminds me of my East German grandmother, who spent most of her life trapped behind a wall.In Turkey, we are showing the world how to challenge a callous, authoritarian leader | Ece TemelkuranRead moreBut I have also seen hope. Hope returned with the municipal elections in 2024. İmamoğlu was reelected. The CHP partywon districtsit never had before – even Üsküdar, where Erdoğan lives, was taken by a woman. People exhaled. They started talking again. They even dared to speak about theGezi Park protests– processing that trauma, believing that those years, those brutal weeks, wouldn’t return. Life went on. Ideas spread. A kind of renewal, a kind of uplift. There was space to think, to create, to imagine possibilities. Yes, the lira kept losing value, and life in Istanbul became unbearably expensive. But the fear had dimmed – until the mayor was suddenly arrested. History, once again, took a sharp, brutal turn.What is happening now is shocking, cruel. And yet it is also what this city knows intimately: nothing is safe. Life can change in a moment. Spontaneity – the very thing that captivated me from day one – isn’t just a cultural quirk; it is survival. When I first arrived, my German habit of planning weeks in advance puzzled my Istanbul friends. “Who knows how we’ll feel next week?” they’d joke. Now I understand. Plans don’t make sense. You never know if you will be able to keep them.After İmamoğlu’s arrest last week, people adapted immediately, cancelling whatever they were doing that evening and taking to the streets. They defied the demonstration ban, banged on pots and pans in Beyoğlu, threw open their windows and called for resistance. They didn’t let despair win. They didn’t fall silent.Maybe it is no coincidence that I notice more and more young women in Istanbul cutting their hair into bobs – like in the 1920s. That, too, was a time of upheaval, of shifting worlds, of economic collapse and ideological extremes. But we know how that decade ended, what was lost. The course isn’t set yet. And to change it, one needs a free neck – to stretch, to see what is and what could be. No time to fuss with hair.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist.

Either way, it’s some pretty trenchant visual messaging: whatever society wants to do with middle-aged women, Christie is done with it.It was also a chance for the 53-year-old to dress up as Kate Bush, recreating her 1978 shoot by Gered Mankowitz. And Christie loves dressing up. She did a whole show dressed as Charles II. The actor, writer and comedian is playful: she has way more than the usual number of funny facial expressions; her chat is peppered with silly, surreal ­diversions. Making people laugh is her thing, she says. “It motivates me, it helps me navigate the world, it’s like a drug.”Also her thing? Shaking injustice like a snow globe, and saying, “Guys, guys – there’s a better way to do this.” There was her 2013 Edinburgh comedy award-winning showA Bic for Her, in which she skewered everything from the marketing of a pastel-coloured Biro to the geopolitical significance of violence against women. Her first Radio 4 series,Bridget Christie Minds the Gap, was silly but very much about feminism. Her ­second,Utopia, in 2018, took on all the crushing events of the world, from Brexit to Kim Jong-un to the climate crisis.Now, she has found a home on Channel 4 with The Change, her Bafta-nominated comedy drama. It’s about menopause – women in midlife, raging against the machine, sloughing off their domestic servitude – and centred on long-married Linda, played by Christie, clawing back the millions of minutes she has spent doing drudge work for others. The scenarios are within the envelope of regular sitcom, but the execution has an almost fairytale surrealism – as Christie describes, “it’s like science fiction, magic realism, a western, a comedy, a tragedy”. The second season opens on a menopause joke: Linda, in the middle of a rousing speech on self-empowerment, forgets a word. It’s a simple one, but important; nothing else will do. The word is “log”.“There are so many words, aren’t there?” Christie says, having forgotten a word today. “Too many. It’s the nouns!”We meet in a cafe in Stoke Newington, London, where she has lived for most of her adult life. She is warm and relaxed, but unobtrusive, softly spoken. We have bumped into each other before, doing feminism about the place, and I’ve always been struck by a quality she has, as if she’s fighting shyness, doesn’t really want any of the limelight, but she’s going to make this remark anyway, because it’s funny.We reduce women’s experiences to a set of biological processes – puberty,  childbirth, menopause. Guys don’t have thisLinda isn’t Christie. “I’ve lived an incredibly privileged life. Bloody drama school! Doing standup!” she says. There are similarities, though. Christie, fine-boned and ethereal, with the enchanted curly hair of the pre-Raphaelite sisterhood, even dresses a lot like Linda, in a waxy outdoor jacket and vividly colourful leggings: random and ready for anything, from yoga to living off-grid. She also shares Linda’s core quality, which is not – contrary to all the shorthand around this show – “being menopausal”. It’s that will to amuse. “From my earliest memory, I would pursue that to the end of the Earth,” she says.Christie was born in 1971 – the last of nine (!) c­hildren to two originally Irish parents, who had met in London and then moved to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, when her dad got a job with Wall’s ice-cream. She says her siblings are “all really clever, really great”. Only she and one sister, Annie, went into the creative industries; a couple of her brothers went to polytechnic, a couple joined the RAF. She remembers one time, early in primary school, enjoying the lessons: “We did a class which was about expression or something. ‘What are you feeling?’ I remember her talking to us like we were human beings. And thinking, ‘I’m feeling happy because the sun’s coming through, I can see the dust on the light, and there’s a big old telly here. I remember looking at my skirt, thinking, ‘I love this lesson.’ Then I remember education getting colder as I got older.” She left school at 15 with no qualifications, shaped more by the landscape around her in the Forest of Dean than her teachers.The Change is set in this same eccentric pocket of woodland. “No one’s done up. The vehicles we use – there’s an old Chevy, there’s a Triumph. They could only be in the forest, and I felt like I was recreating a world that I’m trying to get back to.”The Change series two trailer – videoWhile Christie was certain about where the show would be set, she had reservations about centring it around menopause, which a lot of us in the 50s age bracket would, I think, agree with. “We’re always reducing women’s experiences to a set of biological processes – puberty, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause. Guys don’t have this.” And yet, “100% of humans will at some point be affected by it. You’re going to be living with somebody who’s menopausal – your wife or your sister, everyone knows someone. So the fact that it was so invisible, I found annoying. I also found the lack of shows about older people’s experiences very annoying, because older people are just much more interesting, on the whole.”But it’s not about hormones, or brain fog, and nor is it really about that buildup of marital and social resentment, even while chores – who does them, how they get done, who wishes they could live their lives again and never have shaken the crumbs out of a toaster – loom large. “I do see women’s time, a lot of it goes to nothing. Nobody sees us, we don’t get awards, nobody thanks us. It’s tricky, because I’m a comedian, and I don’t want to make anything that’s worthy. But I did really want to say, ‘I know what you’ve been doing, andI’mthanking you.’”Really, it’s about menopause as a retaking of destiny; imagine if, for whatever reason – call it hormones, call it wisdom – you were to stop clearing up after others, stop biting your tongue. What would that be like?Step one of rejecting domestic servitude is, of course, leaving your husband, which Linda does at the start of the first season, and it wasn’t lost on critics on its release in 2023 that Christie must have been writing it at roughly the same time as she was getting divorced in real life. She and Stewart Lee weren’t like the Posh and Becks of standup, in so far as they never noticeably leveraged each other’s success or fame to create a kind of comic super-unit. But it was unusual for the comedy circuit to have a Mr and Mrs, both successfully gigging. They separated during the pandemic after being married for 15years, and have two children together, 14 and 18.James Acaster asked what I would say to someone I fancied. I said: ‘Hello, you have piqued my interest.’ He said: ‘Under no circumstances say that’In the show, Linda and her husband, Steve – played with tremendous subtlety masquerading as unsubtlety by Omid Djalili – stay together. “I wanted for it to not be anything to do with Steve, really, or to be a love story. It’s not about that. It’s about her relationship with herself, that human experience of finding yourself. I think losing yourself is a very common experience, regardless of age, gender or sexuality, or anything like that. You can be a teenager and not know who you are. You can not know at any age.” All that said, being in your 50s, “it’s a lot”, she ventures. “Being our age, kids leaving home, getting divorced, being single, coping with changes to your body. It’s quite a lot.”The empty nest is slowly creeping up for Christie. She took her oldest to look around a university recently. “He went to a talk, I just sat and had a coffee, and I was so excited for his life. And then I remembered being 18, and I felt melancholy. I thought, ‘That is over for me now.’ But then I stopped myself, because, no, it isn’t. You can be excited for yourself as well.”The thing she fears most about getting older isn’t physically ageing, “although that’s inconvenient. It’s ageing mentally, it’s getting stuck, and a little bit sour. I don’t want to have an old brain. I  remember my dad saying he always felt so young because he was always around young children.” Her parents started having children when they were 18, and would have been looking after at least a couple, sometimes a large number, of tiny ones, for the next 17 years. Plainly, Christie’s plan to keep mentally agile can’t involve having seven more children, so I suggest instead that she take a young lover. Her answer starts off highly reasonable, very mature. “I’m really in a great place. I’m at this age now where I don’t need a life partner, I don’t need to have more children, I’ve got my job, so, whoever it is, it would have to be good. My heart is full. I am open to it, but I’m not looking for it.”Then she starts to recreate an impromptu romance workshop that erupted at a friend’s wedding recently, when she mentioned she hadn’t been on a date in years. “A bunch of people were there –Daniel Kitson,James Acaster,Nish Kumar, Josie Long. James said, ‘Tell us what you would do if someone here took your fancy.’ And I said, ‘OK. I would go up and say, “Hello. You have piqued my interest.”’ He said, ‘Under no circumstances must you say that.’ And I said, ‘Why not? They will have done – they will havepiquedmyinterest.’ And he said, ‘Just go up to someone and say, “Would you like to go to a hotel and have sex?”’ What? No! How depressing. That’s the most horrific scenario. Is that what young people do?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon Webb/The GuardianShe doesn’t fancy the apps (with the caveat that some of her best friends met a spouse online). “I’ve heard it’s brutal.

I really do believe that you’ve got to try and keep something for yourself when you’re in a relationship, try and retain who you are as much as possible. Because we are all alone. I might head off for a walk at the weekend, on my own. And that’s a great scenario – alone with my thoughts and in nature.”She has realised, she says, that being at ease with solitude is fundamental to being a sorted person, and being a sorted person is fundamental to being a good partner. “Easier said than done, I know, but if you’re coming in to a relationship, at this age, you should be bringing your sorted self.” She takes a breath. “Do you want my complete relationship history?” she says, and why not, yes I do. “I had the same boyfriend from 15 to 23, that was the biker. We bought a house when I was 18, we went to music festivals, we rode to the Welsh mountains, we rode to France. Do you like France?” Why, yes, I do. “I was single between 23 and 28 – that’s a good chunk, isn’t it?” These were the drama school years. After a few white lies (about her age – 15 –and her qualifications – which were zero), she got her first job as an editorial assistant at the Gloucester Citizen, but walked out because the editor asked her to get him a McDonald’s without saying please. In her early 20s, she got a grant from the council to study drama, but couldn’t afford it even with that, so applied for and won a scholarship to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, in London. “Then, I graduated. And from 26 to 50, when I cast myself as Linda, I did not get a single acting job.”Sometimes I’m being announced on stage, and I’ll not have a single idea about what I’m going to sayShe thinks it was partly because, “I don’t know whether this is an affliction or a curse, but my brain automatically goes to the funny side. It sounds like I’m having some sort of episode, but I just feel so happy to be alive, and grateful, and I really enjoy everything. So in an audition scenario, if there’s a room full of people staring at me, and I’ve not got a very good script, I will laugh.” Her agent had to explain to her at one point that it wasn’t her job to internalise bad writing; her job was to make it good.View image in fullscreenChristie performing her award-winning A Bic for Her show at Edinburgh in 2013.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianThere are also a lot of unspoken class barriers in the creative industries – she thinks that’s got worse, not better. “The way the arts now are, it’s a pretty closed shop. If I were starting today, from my background, forget it. Unless you’re really well connected, there’s no way in.” Even in the 90s “at drama school, people said to me, ‘Network, network, network; because in this industry, it’s pretty much who you know.’ And I said, ‘I absolutely refuse to believe that.’ And I didn’t network, and I didn’t get any work.” She sounds simultaneously mock aghast at life and low-key amused by her own naivety.The Change series two review – Bridget Christie’s glorious feminist sitcom will leave you ecstaticRead moreA Bic for Her, her breakthrough standup show, came out of one she did the previous year called War Donkey, 2012, in Edinburgh – broadly speaking, it was about the state of the world. It didn’t flop, but “I got a lot of shit”, she remembers, for talking about feminism. “A lot of, ‘She’s funny, but what a shame she has to be banging on about this.’ And that annoyed me. I felt like I was being criticised for subject matter, and I don’t think that’s right. You can write about anything – you should be criticised on whether it worked or not. It was only 10 minutes of that set, and I said, ‘I’m going to come back next year, and I’m going to do feminism for an hour. If they don’t like it for 10 minutes, let’s see how they like it for an hour.’”It’s quite strange, looking back to that time, when a lot of culture foreshadowed the #MeToo movement –Laura Bates’s Everyday Sexism, first as a hive-mind project, then as a book;Caitlin Moran’s How to Be a Woman– but there were still so many prescriptions about where feminism belonged and where it didn’t. Fine in a lecture hall, ladies, but don’t bring your hectoring out to the pub where people are trying to enjoy themselves. I saw A Bic for Her when it transferred to London, and was surprised by how wide of the mark, how completely undescriptive, the reviews were. Like it or hate it, they mainly dealt in the topic: pastel pens “for her”; violence against women in Afghanistan – were these good subjects for comedy? None of that really captured the playfulness and surrealism, the physicality of Christie’s routine. Nevertheless, it marked a new level of recognition, and, from this point, she was in regular meetings with TV producers, batting around ideas that would eventually become The Change.Standup, though, is the work Christie still wants to be doing in her 80s. Describing the circuit in London, especially when she was starting out, in her 30s, she makes the mechanics of it sound stressful and lonely. “I’d be travelling to gigs, and look through windows at people having dinner, or going out to the cinema. I don’t get nervous any more, but for years, at five o’clock, the adrenaline would start. Especially if I was doing new material. And the kids were little. I’d think: ‘What time’s the babysitter coming?’”View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Neusa Neves using Nars and Fenty beauty. Clothes, Christie’s own.Photograph: Simon Webb/The GuardianBut, in the end, if your life’s purpose is making people laugh, that’s the best place for it: in a room full of people. “Sometimes, I’ll be being announced, and I’ll not have a single idea about what I’m going to say, for 40 minutes, or two hours. And then you start speaking, and it’s automatic, it’s like muscle memory. It’s the most extraordinary thing. The more relaxed you are, the better, because you’re just so free. And you’re not afraid of anything. You can go wherever you like.”A lot of Christie’s words, on the page, look slightly melancholy, but the effect she creates in person is the absolute opposite of that – she’s someone who believes the fates have delivered her to exactly where she was meant to be, liberated from gnawing, nonsense anxieties, alive to the possibilities of the future. I  wonder if this might be the last taboo of menopause discourse. What if it was actually a change for the better?The second series of Bridget Christie’s The Change is out now on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsBridget ChristieComedyTV comedyTelevisionWomenMenopauseFeminisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

The duo discuss trying to understand a cultural icon – and how to nailthatvoiceSat 29 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTShareSandringham Road lies in the east of Cardiff; a quiet run of Edwardian terrace houses overlooking Roath Mill Gardens. On a late July day, when the air is warm and the park spills out over its railings, Toby Jones and Harry Lawtey sit on the pavement, wearing matching striped pyjamas. The pair are some way into the filming of Mr Burton, an account of the early life ofRichard Burton. Lawtey plays the actor in his younger years, when he was known as Richard Jenkins, and Jones is Philip Burton, the teacher who fostered his young student’s talent. So close would their bond grow that Jenkins would become Burton’s legal ward and take his surname. “Without Philip Burton there would never have been a Richard Burton,” Elizabeth Taylor once wrote. “That great rolling voice that cracked like wild Atlantic waves would never have been heard outside the valley.”Having starred in three series of theHBO drama Industryas an Oxford graduate from a working-class Welsh background – much as Burton himself had been – Lawtey makes a smart casting. He is, too, a young star in ascendance, diligent and eager to learn, in touch with the thrill of his own potential.Jones, meanwhile, wears his status as one of the country’s finest actors with a kind of gentleness. His work across three decades, from Mike Leigh’s Naked to Marvel’s Captain America, viaUncle VanyaandDetectorists, has shown him to be an actor of both instinct and intellect, meticulous and nuanced, and beautiful to watch. His 2024 role as Alan Bates in ITV’s crusading dramaMr Bates vs the Post Officeraised his profile considerably; playing the wrongfully convicted post office operator with muted heroism. He brings a similar quiet determination to the role of Philip Burton, a man whose own trajectory as a scriptwriter and actor took some time to gather pace, and who invested heavily in the talents of his young charge.View image in fullscreenAll set … Lesley Manville as Ma Smith in Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThere’s a tenderness between the pair as they sit on their folding chairs in the sunshine today. An echo of that Jenkins and Burton dynamic, perhaps, but also the particular magnetism of two actors in the draw of creating something together. This morning they are shooting an interior scene. A house on Sandringham Road has been repurposed as 6 Connaught Street, Port Talbot, where Philip Burton lodged while teaching English at the nearby secondary school, and where Richard, too, would come to live. The crew – complete with cameras, microphones, director and producer – have crammed into a small bedroom, crouching behind the bed and pressed up beside wardrobes.‘There’s are times where I, an Englishman, am playing a Welshman, doing an English accent badly’Harry LawteyIt is a delicate scene, but crucial. Opening with Richard discovering that his teacher has submitted a play to a theatrical agent and been rejected, it is the point in the film when the balance in the pair’s relationship shifts – the mentee now bolstering his mentor. It ends with Richard standing in the doorway, delivering the prologue from Henry V – a performance only slightly undermined by the fact he is wearing his nightclothes.It is hard to overestimate the importance of Richard Burton in Welsh culture. A miner’s son from the Afan valley who became one of the best-known actors in the world, his name is given to the theatre at the Royal Welsh College of Music andDramain Cardiff, while the Richard Burton Archives, including his personal diaries, are housed at Swansea University. In Port Talbot, where Burton appeared in some of his earliest school productions, there is a monument featuring a poem the actor wrote about his childhood in Wales (“The mountain earth feels damp against my hand …” it begins).Still, even before his death in 1984, the myth of Burton had perhaps come to eclipse the extraordinary truth of both his talent and his story. His gift has been boiled down to a kind of theatrical caricature of his voice, and he is arguably remembered as much for the two marriages to Elizabeth Taylor, the lavish spending, the heavy drinking, as for histurn as Hamlet. As he himself once put it: “The public is not interested much in me as an actor. It is interested in the diabolically famous Richard Burton.”‘It has felt so bizarre’: Industry’s Harry Lawtey on coping with sudden fameRead more“Richard Burton existed more as a cultural icon to us in Wales, not really as a familiar actor,” agrees Mr Burton’s director, Marc Evans. “He had the same sort of allure as, say, a George Best. But whereas the genius of Best was easily visible, the work of Burton was not much known to me or much seen by my generation. I didn’t grow up knowing his work and his genius is elusive on film. You have to look for it in dark corners. It was the voice we knew and felt we owned.”In fact, the Mr Burton project began with the voice. The script is a collaboration between the Welsh writer Tom Bullough and Josh Hyams, producer of the long-running seriesThe Trip, starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Hyams had grown accustomed to Brydon, from Baglan, near Port Talbot, slipping into an impression of Burton, his voice suddenly falling bone-deep and rich. “It made me think about how wonderful a voice it is,” Hyams says. “I went back and listened to the legendary recordings of Richard – particularly Under Milk Wood, and to watch his films. When I read about his background, what I learned was a real surprise.”View image in fullscreenMade in Wales … Toby Jones as Philip Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianWhen he was interviewed by Michael Parkinson in 1974, Burton spoke of his voice. “It is the deep dark answer from the valleys to everybody,” he said. “I can’t help the voice, it’s part of me, I didn’t cultivate it or anything, it was given to me.” In many ways, Mr Burton is the story that gives the lie to the actor’s own account of this voice – telling of its cultivation by the young Jenkins and its gift by Philip Burton.When Marc Evans approached Jones about the role, the development of the voice was an aspect of Burton’s story that appealed. “What spoke to me was that tradition of actors learning to lose their accent,” he says. “My father [the actor Freddie Jones] had to lose his voice from the Potteries, and he did it through learning tracts of poetry, for the sheer love, the romantic bewitching of the words.”Philip Burton developed various ways to encourage the projection and resonance of Richard’s voice – most notably by practising on Margam Mountain, near Port Talbot. For the role, Jones drew on his own experiences of working with Penny Dyer, who has been his voice coach throughout his career. “In a way, the voice coach for you is the one whose analogies you respond to in the mouth and in the body,” he says.View image in fullscreenPyjama game … Jones and Lawtey on the Cardiff set of Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe body is particularly important to Jones, who attended the Jacques Lecoq school of physical theatre in Paris. “I learned that if you can’t tell a story with your body, then words become necessary,” he says. In Mr Burton, it brings an interesting tension – a character concerned with the cultivation of a voice, played by an actor who speaks primarily with the body.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Even when I get to what would be recognised as an RP accent, that still can’t sound like me. It would have to sound detached from me, because it’s Richard. And Richard’s voice is just entirely bespoke.”Lawtey, too, worked with a voice coach, and watched hours of footage of Burton. “I started at the end of his career, and moved back to his earliest work, because I thought the earlier work would be most pertinent, and that’s where I wanted to come in to land,” he says. “I really did do a deep dive. Every now and then someone will send me a YouTube clip of Burton, as if I haven’t seen every single one.”View image in fullscreenSword play … Harry Lawtey as Richard Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBy his own account, Lawtey had become “mildly obsessed” with Burton after seeingJack Thorne’s The Motive and the Cuetowards the end of 2023. The play revolves round a 1964 production of Hamlet starring Burton and directed by John Gielgud, and Lawtey sought out footage of the original production on YouTube. “The technique is so strident but grounded,” he says. “You can tell he’s playing jazz with it. Maybe jazz meets punk.”About a month later, by sheer coincidence, Lawtey was sent a speculative script for Mr Burton. “It said it was about someone called Richard Jenkins,” he says. “And I didn’t know that was Richard Burton until about halfway through. I just thought it was this lovely madeup story about this young Welsh kid who wanted to be an actor.”When he won the part, he embarked upon what he describes as “an incredible fact-finding mission, which was pretty comprehensive on my part, and to be honest just a joy. There’s a burden of responsibility in doing something like this, which I certainly felt, but I relished it. I loved learning about him.” He describes Burton’s diaries as “my north star in terms of getting to know him and feeling familiar and close to him”.Gradually, Burton shifted in Lawtey’s imagination from a name with which he was familiar into someone with whom he felt great kinship, and an actor he found compelling and inspiring. “There were times I would watch Richard’s work in preparation for this film where I just got it,” he says. “It just feels like he’s burning on screen. Like there’s this presence or aura or light round him, and he’s so invigorating and propulsive and aggressive but also vulnerable at the same time.”View image in fullscreenBackstage pass … behind the scenes of Mr Burton.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe following morning, the film crew have relocated to St Augustine’s in Rumney, dressing the church hall to replicate Port Talbot YMCA, where Philip Burton would direct amateur productions, and where Richard first performed on stage. The room is cool and dimly lit, a respite from the day’s heat. Outside, in their heavy suits and tea dresses, the extras prowl the gardens, trying to find shade.Watching today is Kate Burton, Richard Burton’s daughter, also an actor. To see Lawtey playing her father as a young man has been “an out-of-body experience”, she says. Hitherto, she has avoided dramatisations of Burton’s life, but this production felt different. “I was intrigued about this one because the story focused on Dad as a very young man, and Grandpa” – as she refers to Philip Burton – “coming into his life,” she says. “I thought that was such an important story, and integral to Dad becoming Dad.”Beyond the green velvet curtains, the extras fall quiet, the children cease fidgeting and a stillness settles over the hall. Lawtey, in Jenkins’ role as a convict, takes to the stage wearing a ragged overcoat. He has stage-paint daubed across his face to resemble dirt, and he wields a wooden knife. “If you call out, you are a dead man!” His opening line is delivered with unexpected fervour, but slowly he finds his pitch; force becomes desperation, his words grow real and resonant. “I have a wolf inside me,” he says, “tearing at my entrails, tearing me apart …” From the wings, Jones’s Mr Burton looks on; a small man, tightly held. But as his student speaks, something in him seems to give way; across his face moves revelation, wonder, pride. He lifts his eyes, meets his student’s gaze, and gives an almost imperceptible nod.Mr Burton is in cinemas from4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsToby JonesRichard BurtonDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The agents said the state department had revoked his student visa and green card, though he had never been accused of, let alone convicted for, a crime. He was held in detention in New Jersey, then transferred to Louisiana. He has still not been accused of a crime.‘Detention Alley’: inside the Ice centres in the US south where foreign students and undocumented migrants languishRead moreNevertheless, Donald Trump’s state department, headed byMarco Rubio, seeks to deport him under a provision of federallaw that gives the US president the power to deport someone if their presence in the country is deemed to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. Khalil’s crime? He was a lead organizer of Columbia’s protests for Palestinian rights.“Who has the right to have rights? It is certainly not the humans crowded into the cells here,” Khalil, a Palestinian raised in exile in a Syrian refugee camp,wrotein a letter proclaiming his status as a “political prisoner”. He is one of themost prominent targetsof achilling federal crackdownon pro-Palestinian advocacy in the US,particularly on college campuses. And he is one of the most forceful voices in The Encampments, a new documentary on thecampus movement for Palestinethat has drawn ire from across the US political spectrum, in particular the right.A certain characterization prevails in American mainstream media of the nationwide campus protests in 2024 against Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza: that the pro-Palestinian protesters were violent, deranged, self-righteous, naive and antisemitic – that they peddled “radical, extreme ideology”, in the words of the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, and that they were “disgusting cesspools of antisemitic hate, full of pro-Hamas sympathizers, fanatics and freaks”, according to Josh Hawley, a senator from Missouri.The Encampments, directed by Kei Pritsker and Michael T Workman and distributed by the Palestinian-founded company Watermelon Pictures, puts that narrative in stark relief. Charges of terrorism, brainwashing and violence from sources as ideologically divergent as Fox News and MSNBC overlay footage of students pitching tents, sitting together, playing music, chanting in communion and holding religious observances. “The mood was so the opposite of what was being said on TV,” said Pritsker, who embedded in Columbia University’s 120-tent campus encampment in April 2024. “It was so funny to open your phone up and watch some guy in Washington DC say that there’s this den of antisemitism at Columbia’s campus, and you’re watching a Passover Seder happen like 10ft in front of you.”The Encampments focuses in particular on Columbia, the focal point of national media interest over the protests and the inspiration for similar pro-Palestinian encampments at universities around the globe. The Ivy League university has a storied history of activism, dating back through the civil rights movement of the 1960s. It also has an undisclosed portion of its nearly $14bn endowment invested in companies in business with the Israeli military, which has killed 50,000 Palestinians and displaced 140,000 more since the 7 October 2023 Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 more hostage. The students’ demand was straightforward: “We don’t want our money to go towards Palestinian death,” says organizer and negotiator Sueda Polat in the film.The Encampments, which counts the rapper Macklemore among its executive producers, begins with the occupation of the green on 17 April 2024 – an escalation, as Khalil, Polat and organizer Grant Miner explain, only after the university changed its protest bylaws and refused to acknowledge smaller-scale interruptions. The film interweaves footage of the largely mundane, calm passing of the hours at the encampment with the destruction of Gaza – bombed hospitals, maimed children, prolific and horrific death – and archival footage of the university’s own precedent for staging mass demonstrations for humanitarian causes.In particular, it shows the 1968 occupation of Hamilton Hall, in which students demanded the university sever ties to the US war in Vietnam; in late April, the Palestinian protestersoccupiedthe building with a similar demand. They renamed it Hind Hall, in honor of a seven-year-old girl killed by the IDF after watching her entire family shot (the film includes her devastating phone call to emergency workers with subtitles, shortly before she and the ambulance ferrying her were bombed).I am a Palestinian political prisoner in Louisiana. I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead more“Students have always been on the right side of history,” said Pritsker, himself a former pro-Palestinian campus organizer. “Students protested the Vietnam war. They protested Jim Crow. They protested South African apartheid and they protested the war in Iraq. Students were not wrong about any of those things. And it’s ironic, because Columbiacelebrates that history.”“Some of the biggest protests against South African apartheid happened at Columbia. Some of the biggest protests for the civil rights movement happened at Columbia,” he added. “And Columbia looks back on those moments and says: ‘Oh, look at how forward-thinking and progressive Columbia is. Look at how this happened on our campus. We’re a leader in history. Come to Columbia and you can be like these people.’ Well, that moment is now.”View image in fullscreenA still from The Encampments.Photograph: Watermelon PicturesIn 2024, as in 1968, the university resorted tocalling the policewhen negotiations failed. The Encampments includes footage seen across the news last year: officers shooting rubber bullets and teargas into demonstrations, and dragging protesters across the street. Additionally, it shows police doing nothing to stop counter-protesters who attacked encampments; at the University of California at Los Angeles, some even threw lit fireworks at protesting students.Why was Mahmoud Khalil arrested and why is it such a big deal?Read more“It was really shocking to see so many campuses in the United States turned into police states over this,” said Pritsker of Columbia calling for the New York police department to end the encampment, which precipitated police crackdowns across the country. “We started the film with a question: what was it about a bunch of students camping out on lawns that was so incomprehensible, so impermissible to the politicians, to the media, to the ruling class of this country, that they would rather arrest students, teargas them, handcuff them, than stop investing in companies that are complicit in war crimes?”Those actions now includecooperating with the Trump administrationtoinvestigatestudents who have criticized Israel, aggressively discipline students who engage in pro-Palestinian disruptions, and plan “comprehensive” reform of the school’s admissions policies, lest they lose out on $400m in federal funding. The film ends with a haunting post-script as the crackdown begins: Khalil remains in detention; five days after his arrest, Miner was expelled, along with 22 other students who were involved in the occupation of Hind Hall. Some had their degrees revoked.At Columbia today, “obviously there is fear, but I think more than fear, there’s anger”, said Pritsker. “People are furious that their administration capitulated to the Trump administration’s demands, totally throwing in the towel, basically.”Still, “a lot of the students are not going to stop”, he added. “I don’t think anyone involved in the Palestinian movement signed up for the movement because they thought it would make them more safe or comfortable. I think most of us understood that it would make us less safe. It might actually pose risks to our safety, but none of that matters because if none of us are safe – if someone out there is under the threat of being bombed or being shot at any moment on any given day – then we’re all unsafe.”The Encampments is out now in US cinemas with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsUS campus protestsMahmoud KhalilIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesProtestUS universitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she is giving Dr Crippen the same treatment – and questioning how we tell stories about murderous menSat 29 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShareIt was called “the crime of the century” and “the north London cellar murder”, and more than 100 years after it happened, the name of the murderer is still widely known. Dr Crippen has been the subject of multiple books, movies and TV shows and had a waxwork made of him at Madame Tussauds. But the story of his crimes, writesHallie Rubenholdin Story of a Murder, remains one “predominantly about women but told almost exclusively by men”. As such, Crippen’s victim is long forgotten. Her name was Belle Elmore, and in Rubenhold’s book she is brought back to life.Rubenhold and I are in a cafe in Muswell Hill, north London, a 10 minute walk from where Elmore is buried, and where the 53-year-old author lives with her barrister husband, Frank. Writing Story of a Murder was nerve-racking, says Rubenhold, partly because of the usual dizzying challenge of converting huge volumes of research into a brisk narrative and partly because of the expectations raised by the success of Rubenhold’s 2019 blockbusterThe Five, in which she told the story of five of Jack the Ripper’s victims. The Five won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction and triggered huge interest and discussion for its radical refocusing of the story away from the murderer. The book triggered a bizarre hate campaign by so-called “Ripperologists,” while effectively re-inventing true crime. “I’m pleased to say it has quietened down,” says Rubenhold of the backlash. “But they have been on my back for the better part of five to six years.”She needn’t have worried: Story of a Murder is just as compelling and revelatory.In Rubenhold’s meticulous retelling, the story begins decades earlier in turn of the century New York, where Crippen’s first wife, Charlotte Bell, arrives as an immigrant from Ireland. The young woman meets and falls in love with Hawley Harvey Crippen, a newly qualified doctor, and the pair marry and move to Salt Lake City, where Charlotte, “a healthy 33-year-old woman”, dies suddenly. After her death, Crippen moves to New York, meets and marries Belle and, after bouncing around the US for a while, the couple move to London in 1897, where they settle into a house at 39 Hilldrop Crescent, Holloway – the address where, 13 years later, Belle’s remains will be found in the cellar.“No murderer,” writes Rubenhold in the opening line of the book, “should ever be the guardian of their victim’s story, and yet this is the role that Hawley Harvey Crippen has always held.” After an extraordinary police chase across the Atlantic, Crippen was brought back to Britain, stood trial in 1910 and was ultimately hanged for his second wife’s murder. But somehow his account of Belle Elmore still stands: an overbearing, nagging harridan of a woman who drove him into the arms of his secretary and co-conspirator, Ethel Le Neve.View image in fullscreenBelle Elmore circa 1910.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesIt is, says Rubenhold, “staggering” how awful the depictions of Belle have been. “It started with Alexander Bell Young, who wrote about the trial [in 1920] and who decided early on that this was a beautiful romantic relationship between Crippen and Ethel, and that Belle was a monster who had to be slayed. If you start from that, what hope do you have?” And so it went on, she says, underpinned by this notion that, “if anyone deserved to die it was Belle Elmore”. A 1963 movie starring Donald Pleasence as Crippen also demonised Belle. As recently as2007, “there was a documentary in which they went out of their way to try to prove that the body [in the cellar] wasn’t Belle. That’s simply not true: the people behind it had bought so far into this myth of Belle being a horrific human being, it’s gotten to the point where the murderer is the victim and the victim is the murderer.”Hallie Rubenhold: ‘Jack the Ripper’s victims have just become corpses. Can’t we do better?’Read moreAfter The Five, in which Rubenhold reclaimed individual women from the conglomerate mass known as Jack the Ripper’s “prostitute victims”, this kind of correction has become her speciality. And as with The Five, which animated the slums of Victorian Whitechapel and London’s underclass, Story of a Murder is also a piece of gripping social history, in this case focusing on the Edwardian lower middle classes. When Crippen came to trial in 1910, the case “touched a nerve about social climbing” that helps explain how, despite the low body count, the story would dominate world news for weeks. The Crippens weren’t entirely respectable; Belle worked in London’s musical hall theatres and her husband was a con-artist, selling bogus medical treatments. But they were affluent and, viewed from the outside, says Rubenhold, their story was one “of the aspiring middle classes that starts with Pooter and the Diary of a Nobody and ends with [Crippen] and what’s under the surface. So much for your sherry glasses and your Christmas cards – there’s actually a body in the cellar.”One singular and cheering aspect of the story is the role played by Belle’s loyal female friends, spirited members of the Music Hall Ladies’ Guild, as she herself had been, who first raised the alarm when she went missing. Crippen insisted that Belle had run back to America, leaving behind all her clothes and personal items and failing to say goodbye or stay in touch with her friends. They didn’t buy it, and then, definitive proof, as they saw it: Ethel Le Neve turned up at a gala dinner on Crippen’s arm, wearing Belle’s jewellery. At the women’s urging, the police searched 39 Hilldrop Crescent and made a grisly discovery: parts of a body, minus a head, stuffed into jars. Belle had been poisoned and dismembered so Crippen could be with his lover.View image in fullscreenDr Crippen and Ethel Le Neve in the dock.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesPiecing together all the tiny shards of research to build up a full and novelistic portrait of these characters was particularly difficult because, when Rubenhold started the project in 2020, the world had just been shut down by Covid. (The timing was almost comically bad; her first research trip to the US, to investigate Crippen’s first marriage and the unhappy fate of Charlotte, was booked for April 2020, a month into lockdown.) She was permitted into various research archives for short periods of time and scrambled to photograph documents for later study. “Itreminded me of a combination of Supermarket Sweep and a spy film,” she says.Through family letters, Rubenhold made the bleak discovery that Crippen had been performing abortions on Charlotte; he was known to hate children, and after the couple’s son was born, whenever his wife became pregnant, he tricked her into submitting to surgery. This pattern was repeated when Belle became pregnant; Crippen performed first an abortion on her, and then, claiming she had a prolapsed uterus, what was known as an “ovariectomy”, sterilising his second wife and plunging her into menopause. Belle survived those surgeries; Charlotte did not. According to her brother, William, Charlotte had written to him shortly before her death in Salt Lake City: “My husband is about to force me to the knife again, and I feel that this will be the last time. I want my relatives to know that if I die it will be his fault.” Within a few weeks, the healthy 33-year-old died, allegedly of a stroke. Crippen buried her in a paupers grave and moved back to New York.The movement of Crippen from the US to London makes him a good subject for Rubenhold, who grew up in LA, the child of Anglo-American parents, and moved to Leeds as a graduate student of history, after studying for her primary degree at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. (In between, she did a year abroad studying creative writing and history at UEA). London always felt like home, she says: “It may have been that my grandparents were dyed in the wool cockneys – we had home movies of them doing the Lambeth Walk. And I grew up with my father talking about the Blitz, and being evacuated.” After college, Rubenhold worked as an assistant curator at the National Portrait Gallery and in 2005, published her first book, The Covent Garden Ladies, a history of Harris’s List, the famous 18th-century directory of prostitutes. Three further books of nonfiction and two historical novels followed, both set in the 18th century, before The Five was published in 2019, driven by what has become her governing ethos: “I think we approach history from the wrong end most times. When we teach history, it’s from the top down. Let’s talk about the laws and the people who made them. No, let’s talk about why this became necessary? To me, that’s where the story is. It’s about people’s experience.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Part of her research took her to the Bed-Stuy neighbourhood of Brooklyn, where Belle’s Polish-German family had settled. “I hired this amazing tour guide,” she says, “who took me on a bespoke tour of Brooklyn history from the Slavic perspective – totally niche! He was in his mid-80s, the most incredible person, and was telling me about his grandparents coming to the country in about 1899, which is when Belle’s family lived there. We went to the church that Belle attended, and to all the places the family would’ve gone.”It’s this immersive approach that makes Rubenhold’s books click along like good novels and, when she can’t find a primary resource, “that’s when you lean on the history,” she says. “There will always be an example of somebody else in exactly the same situation. So with Charlotte Bell, I didn’t know what her precise experiences were as a nurse, but there’s tons of information of women from her background in New York at exactly that time.”Part of Rubenhold’s mission, going all the way back to The Covent Garden Ladies, which inspired the TV show Harlots, is to tear up the templates that can mire true crime and crime reporting generally. “This is going to sound strange,” she says, “but often when I’m choosing a book I have to find a subject I hate.And then I try to figure out why I hate it so much. And then I become fascinated by it. I really hate true crime.”Traditional books in that genre foreground the identity of the murderer over his victims, giving rise to the personality cult of notorious killers. Jack the Ripper, whose identity has never been confirmed, is a prime example and, by coming at the story from a different angle, Rubenhold discovered that the entire story changed. “I’m not interested in straight true crime. I’m interested in the darkness in human nature as seen through historical events. And I’m fascinated by how granular you can get in terms of historical understanding; I’m looking at material that a murder throws up – all the witness statements, all the trial papers, all the unspoken human experience.”View image in fullscreenDr Crippen being escorted from the liner Montrose by Inspector Walter Dew, after being arrested at sea.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyIn The Five, this approach resulted in a completely fresh view of Dickensian London in which Polly, one of the Ripper’s victims, was discovered to have declared herself legally destitute so she could be free of her husband, who was having an affair with the woman next door. Polly ended up in the workhouse and then sleeping rough, where the Ripper found her. She was not, per common understanding, a prostitute and nor were some of the other victims, which is where Rubenhold ran into trouble.The backlash against The Five from so called “Ripperologists” – armchair fanatics with a weird and possessive attachment to the unsolved mystery of Jack the Ripper – was intense. “What I find incredible is that I’ve watched what they say about me and it’s so disconnected from The Five and what I actually said. I’m accused of hating sex workers; of depriving the women of their actual identities and sanitising their stories. I’m told I’ve done them a gross injustice. Oh, and that I should die.” She laughs. “I don’t understand the obsession. And itisan obsession.”There are, presumably, fewer Crippenologists out there than devotees of Jack the Ripper; for a murderer surely he’s small fry? But, says Rubenhold, “Oh, god; the moment I put something out about Belle or whatever, somebody will ask a question on social media: ‘Didn’t they prove it wasn’t her?’ Do we have to go through this? I’m hoping that the book will put that to rest.”The one thing that unifies the crimes behind both books “is woman hate,” she says. But what makes her work so inspiring is its success in animating real women. Belle Elmore leaps off the page, a woman who rebuilt a vibrant life for herself after her husband took away her longed-for desire to have children. Restoring her to this full-blooded status gives the book a real emotional punch, as does recalibrating Crippen himself. “I’m really glad to have shone a light on [Crippen’s] creepiness,” says Rubenhold. “Because for so long he was known as the ‘mild murderer’ and ‘a nice man’. No, he wasn’t! He was a hardened fraudster and all his friends were criminals. All of them.”After Belle’s death, the loyal members of the Music Hall Ladies’ Guild paid for her headstone in Finchley Cemetery and hired a lawyer to stop Crippen leaving Belle’s estate to Ethel Le Neve in his will. The book remains not only a tribute to Belle, but more broadly to the value of the individual life. Rubenhold’s mother died as she was writing the book and, she says, “it really made me reflect on being a historian, and documenting lives. Because there’s a start date and an end date. Life has a finite beginning and a finite end.” For a book about a murder, it is a movingly life affirming coda. “This is your time. And that’s it.”Story of a Murder: the Wives, the Mistress and Doctor Crippen by Hallie Rubenhold is published by Doubleday (£25).

Elegant, spare, pristine, the Villa Empain in south Brussels seems little changed since it was built over 90 years ago.Yet this art deco masterpiece reopened only in 2010 after falling into ruin. Illegal ravers had scrawled on its marble walls and stolen its treasures, from radiator grills to a decorative fish that was the centrepiece of a fountain in the bar.Now restored to its former opulence, the villa is one of the highlights of Brussels’ year of art deco as the Belgian capital celebrates the artistic movement of the 1920s and 30s – and seeks recognition. Many people know ofBrussels’ art nouveau heritage: the sinuous curves and floral designs of thebelle époque. But fewer see the Belgian capital as a centre for art deco, with its geometric lines, luxurious materials and exotic motifs.“Not a lot of people know that Brussels also has a lot of amazing art-deco buildings,” Ans Persoons, secretary of state for urban planning and heritage for the Brussels region, told theObserver. Now she wants the Belgian capital on the map as one of the main European cities for art deco.Throughout 2025, the city is celebrating this heritage with events, conferences, open-door days and film screenings including, perhaps inevitably,The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece ofcareless people in the jazz age. The year will showcase landmarks such as the Basilica of Koekelberg, a pharaonic brick, concrete and stone church with feted modernist stained glass; and the Centre for Fine Arts (Bozar), designed byVictor Horta, who traded the flourishes of art nouveau for a sleek and streamlined style moderne.Few of the city’s art deco buildings had the near-death experience of the Villa Empain. It was finished in 1934 for Louis Empain, the son of Belgium’s answer to JD Rockefeller. His father, Édouard Empain, born into a modest family, turned a successful quarrying business into a wide-ranging business empire, building the Paris Métro, rail lines in Turkey, China andLéopold II’s Congo Free State– a project built at enormous cost in human lives.A wealthy young man, Louis commissioned from the star architect of the day, Michel Polak – who was already known for the Résidence Palace in Brussels – glamorous apartment buildings intended as a new way of living for the wealthy. The modernist complex survives today as offices, overshadowed by the glass and steel of the EU institutions.Louis, increasingly disillusioned with the trappings of wealth, barely lived in his villa, donating it to the Belgian state to use as a museum of decorative arts. But this plan was thwarted when the sumptuous marble villa was requisitioned by Nazi officers during the second world war.It was then given to the Soviet Union for its embassy, later serving as the Belgian HQ for a Luxembourg TV station. The Boghossian Foundation, founded by Armenian philanthropists, took it over in 2006, funding the restoration and reopening it as a centre for art and dialogue between eastern and western cultures.View image in fullscreenThe University Foundation, Brussels.Photograph: Credit: University Foundation, Brussels.In the basement, the villa is hosting an exhibition on art deco, showcasing posters, stained glass, ceramics and other objects of this turbulent period. Before and after the first world war, artistic movements were flowering everywhere: constructivism, cubism, Bauhaus, surrealism. “There were so many movements at the same time, in rivalry but also inspired by one another,” said Louma Salamé, manager of the Villa Empain. Good design, she said, was also more available to everyone through “a revolution of standardisation”, as items such as radios became mass produced.Artists such as the Belgian surrealist René Magritte or abstract painter Victor Servranckx, were not confined to the galleries – they were making wallpaper and ad posters. “We are very far from the cliche of a romantic guy dressed in black alone in his studio doing things for himself,” Salamé said. “The interbellum is a wonderful moment where there is no difference between artists and craftsmen, and they all want to work for society.”Above all, art deco celebrated modernity. It was a style adopted from capitalist Chicago to Soviet Moscow and in Shanghai, Beirut and Brussels. “Art deco is the first movement of a new global world,” Paul Dujardin, curator of the art deco year, told theObserver.The movement is typically dated from l’Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925 in Paris. But Dujardin, who ran Bozar for two decades, sees the first true art deco building as the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an imposing marble mansion of asymmetric blocks, built from 1905. However, he does not see a particular Belgian style, pointing instead to his country’s “in-between hybridity”.He was speaking from the University Foundation, established in 1920 by Belgian diplomat Émile Francqui and future US Republican president Herbert Hoover, who had joined forces to provide food aid toBelgiumin the first world war. A meeting point for international scholars, with the ambience of an English private members’ club, the foundation remains a testament to US-European friendship, with star motifs on the walls as a tribute to the American flag.Persoons hopes Brussels’ art deco year will get people thinking beyond style and reflecting on the tumultuous times between the wars, when the euphoria of peace gave way to economic crisis and the rise of the extreme right. While she stressed that there is no direct message in the official programme, she said: “It can make us think about what we are going through today and how quickly we can take a wrong turn.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe ObserverBelgiumEuropeArtF Scott FitzgeraldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.”“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for makingNo Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”The Academy initially responded to the incident on Wednesday, but it did not refer to Ballal directly. The open letter signed by actors, producers and documentary film-makers criticised the initial statement.“We sincerely apologise to Mr Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the Academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,” the fresh statement, released on Friday, read.“We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances. It is indefensible for an organisation to recognise a film with an award in the first week of March, and then fail to defend its film-makers just a few weeks later.”It also condemned the “brutal assault and unlawful detention” of the Oscar winner.“The targeting of Ballal is not just an attack on one film-maker – it is an attack on all those who dare to bear witness and tell inconvenient truths.“We will continue to watch over this film team. Winning an Oscar has put their lives in increasing danger, and we will not mince words when the safety of fellow artists is at stake.”High-profile actors who signed the letter included Mark Ruffalo, Olivia Colman, Emma Thompson, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Joaquin Phoenix and Penelope Cruz.The incident shed light on the escalating violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers and soldiers against Palestinians in theWest Banksince the onset of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, amid threats by the far-right government of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to annex occupied Palestinian territory – an objective that could be put in reach by the administration of the US president, Donald Trump.Israeli settlers and state forces have killed at least 870 Palestinians, including 177 children, in attacks across the West Bank since the start of the latest Gaza war,according to the Palestinian ministry of health.From 7 October 2023 to 31 December 2024, at least 1,860 incidents of settler violence in the West Bank wererecorded– an average of four a day, according to data from theUnited Nationsoffice for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.Explore more on these topicsOscarsNo Other LandWest BankPalestinian territoriesAwards and prizesDocumentary filmsIsraelShareReuse this content"

I spent hours flicking through images of an eyeless, trombone-mouthed golden man swallowing naked bodies, and a full-page, black-and-white comic strip by legendary psychedelic artist Rick Griffin. It didn’t matter that I hadn’t yet listened to most of the songs – the surreal visual riffs felt like dispatches from an undiscovered country. Later, the Beatles became my favourite band. I chain-listened to the albums, read endless books, watched the movies and recited Beatles’ lore to anyone within earshot. “Oh dear,” said my mum one morning, as I reeled off an account of how a 40-piece orchestra improvised the rising crescendo in A Day in the Life, “you’ve become a Beatles bore.”Maybe I’m Amazed opens with John Harris’s 15-year-old son, James, ecstatically absorbed in a live performance by Paul McCartney, “so held in the moment that he is almost in an altered state”. Harris then loops back to before James’s birth, and tells the story of his son’s arrival, his preschool diagnosis of autism, and how his differences manifest as he grows up. James loves music – the Beatles chief among a rich buffet of bands and tracks he listens to, over and over – and so Harris divides the book into 10 chapters named after songs, each with a particular resonance.Harris writes about music with wit, clarity and a welcome lack of pretension. One chapter takes its cue from Funkadelic’s “weird … incongruous” track Fish, Chips and Sweat – about a carnal encounter that takes as its backdrop “the least sexy meal imaginable”. Another from Nick Drake’s Northern Sky, a song whose lyrics evoke “a sudden euphoria that leaves you silent, and still”. Harris even bravely attempts a rehabilitation of Baker Street, “a masterclass in the arts of arrangement and production”, so hackneyed from familiarity we might miss the complicated stories implied by its “sparse, carefully chosen words”.Threaded throughout this are he and his wife Ginny’s struggles and anxieties around parenthood, and James’s emerging strengths and challenges. He demonstrates absolute pitch – the ability to instantly identify individual notes – and can name the keys of random songs played to him on Spotify. “Imagine having as instinctive and vivid a connection with music as this,” muses Harris. “From time to time, James speaks to me using songs,” he writes, recounting a moment when, after refusing to go to school, James commands Alexa to play the Smiths’ The Headmaster Ritual, with its lyrics “Give up education as a bad mistake”.As a parent, I recognise the all‑consuming worry described here. Harris and his wife quickly find that support for children with special educational needs is callously absent – they spend their savings paying for early, intensive therapy for James, and preparing the legal case for the support he’ll need in school (local authorities routinely force parents to pursue them through the courts for the care they are legally obliged to offer, calculating that most will lack the resources to do so).But, as an autistic person, I sometimes found it hard reading about behaviours and tendencies I’ve exhibited all my life viewed through the lens of neurotypicality. Harris is left “flummoxed and sad” when, on a trip to Chester zoo, James ignores the penguins and plays with the wood chips covering the path, picking them up and dropping them. “I get the sense if he was left to his own devices, he might repeat the cycle indefinitely.” James is absorbed by the wrong thing – wood chips’ splendid tactile diversity, and the miracle of gravity.I don’t wish to punish Harris’s honesty. Like all parents, his journey involves plenty of learning on the job. He writes powerfully about “almost Victorian levels of cruelty” inflicted on autistic people in care, and how, through his and James’s shared love of music, his initial doomy grief gives way to a constellation of admiration, fear, humour, awe and, of course, love. I wept several times, and the book wouldn’t have that power without the author’s willingness to be real and vulnerable. As he observes, autistic traits appear throughout humankind.

Instead the venue has secured £10m in pledged donations, allowing it to be independent and artistically ambitious, he said.“I’m a huge defender of ACE, and I’m grateful for their support in helping us get to where we are,” Gilhooly said. “But in some ways it has lost its way.”In particular, the council’sLet’s Create strategy, which aims to ensure access to the arts for all, was “desperately important” but had led to the council “judging community events and the great artists of the world by the same criteria”, he said.Wigmore Hall and the musicians it hosted were committed to community outreach, said Gilhooly, highlighting itsMusic for Life programmefor people with dementia. It also runs aschools programme.But ACE was effectively “asking us to step in and fix” the decimation of arts and music education in schools, he said. “Music in the classroom is more or less gone. It’s not good enough. In the 50s, 60s and 70s, when we were much poorer, there was brilliant music provision in schools, and every child got the opportunity to build their creativity and confidence. That’s no longer there.“We can go into classrooms, we can complement, but it’s not enough. We can reach thousands of young people but what about those we’re not getting to. The only way that will be fixed is through the school system.”John Tusa, who ran the Barbican arts centre for 22 years, said ACE had stopped being an advocate for the arts and had become a regulator. “And the trouble with the regulators is that they interfere and they micromanage,” he said.Championing local and community arts projects was valuable, but “unless you have the greatest art, the best art, that people want to follow, it’s unlikely that you will get a strong community base. And [ACE] seem to have decided that they hate excellence.”The council should recognise “a wonderful continuum, that starts at the top and goes all the way down to the pleasant and the humdrum and the community at the bottom, and they are all connected”.Few people in arts institutions agreed with ACE’s strategy, but were reluctant to voice criticisms because they depended on public funding, Tusa said. “But we really need an open debate about whether ACE delivers the best possible cultural experience for society as a whole.”The government has ordereda review of ACE, which distributes more than £500m of public money and more than £250m of national lottery money annually, and employs more than 650 people. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the review would be the first step to restore “people’s connection with the arts and culture in every region of the country”.Responding to Gilhooly’s comments, Henley said: “The idea that we don’t believe in, celebrate, invest in classical music is nonsense. We are here for every art form, every geography, every type of music.“We’re [supporting] world class, internationally significant work and a network of grassroots live music venues in towns across the country. They’re all equally as important as each other.”In its 2023-2026 funding round, ACE allocated £220m to classical music and opera organisations, £92m to dance companies that work with orchestras and large ensembles, and £129m to venues and festivals that include classical music and opera in their output.The Let’s Create strategy that underpins ACE’s decision-making was intended to support the opportunity for everyone to develop their creativity and experience high quality cultural work. That included “engagement and interaction with brilliant professional performers”, said Henley.The strategy was “not about dishonouring or not valuing the traditions that we have. We cherish those, but we also want to make sure that we take that wonderful repertoire and those wonderful performers to new audiences”.But, he added, there was a finite amount of money available. If organisations such as Wigmore Hall could secure income through the generosity of its supporters, public funding could be used elsewhere, he said.Wigmore Hall’s ACE grant of £345,000 a year amounts to about 2% of its income, with the rest coming mainly from ticket sales, sponsors and donors. The 550-seat hall puts on about 600 concerts a year.Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandWigmore HallClassical musicOperaArts fundingArts in schoolsArts and humanitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

But in the films ofStranger By the Lakedirector Alain Guiraudie, the overlap between the two is so great, it almost feels as if they are one and the same thing.In this slippery French-language thriller, boyish, floppy-fringed Jérémie (Félix Kysyl) returns from Toulouse to the village of Saint-Martial for a funeral. His arrival unlocks a gnawing hunger among the villagers: Martine (Catherine Frot), the widow of the dead man, invites Jérémie to stay in her spare room for as long as he chooses, on the understanding that his personal space is hers to invade. Martine’s bullish son Vincent (Jean-Baptiste Durand) is unsettled by Jérémie’s presence, but there’s a menacing intimacy to their half-serious bouts of woodland wrestling.Then there’s the local priest (Jacques Develay), with his candid, prying gaze, who always seems to be picking mushrooms at the same time as Jérémie, and whose interest in the younger man goes well beyond his spiritual wellbeing. And what of Jérémie himself? Is there a motive behind his prowling visits to sad-sack local farmer Walter (David Ayala) beyond just reconnecting with an old friend over glasses of pastis?A sinner, a killer and a very controversial erection: has director Alain Guiraudie surpassed Stranger By the Lake?Read moreA murder raises the stakes, but even before the mystery surrounding the death of a central character, Guiraudie seedsMisericordiawith needling sexual tension and latent savagery through an ominous, skin-prickling score by Marc Verdaguerand Claire Mathon’s snaking, shifty camerawork.

This time the focus is on female artists and war – as the title suggests with its cringe-inducing pun on a slang term for makeup.It’s a perfectly valid and potentially fruitful subject, but the analysis here is often frustratingly superficial. Kinmonth puts herself front and centre as the onscreen interviewer and narrator, so one has to blame her directly for the daftness of some her questions. For instance, she asks sculptor Rachel Whiteread: “I’m wondering, is there a difference in the perception of female artists to men, and what do women see that men don’t?” Whiteread politely demurs to tackle that one. “I think that’s an incredibly difficult thing to answer,” she replies. “I don’t think you really can make that distinction.”Fortunately the film itself doesn’t seem to be reaching for a similarly essentialist formula to answer that question. Instead we get a serviceable if somewhat disjointed series of profiles of various female artists addressing war, from state-appointed ones such as Dame Laura Knight, who painted the second world war, Falkland war artist Linda Kitson, and American architect-artist Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC. Lin recounts how one official weirdly questioned whether her choice of polished black granite was perhaps “too feminine”.Art world grande dames such asMaggi Hamblingand Marcelle Hanselaar are paid due tribute, alongside celebrations of those whose work nearly slipped into obscurity. That goes for photographer Lee Miller (to a certain extent), as well as avant garde woodcarver and painter Rachel Reckitt, and prisoners of war interred in the Changi prison camp in Singapore by the Japanese, who made quilt squares to express themselves.Among the most interesting subjects are the artists currently working in active war zones, such as UkrainianZhanna Kadyrovawhose innovative installations play with surface and found objects, and Sudanese graffiti artist Assil Diab who paints murals of the many dead in the “forgotten” war. Some may feel irked that these up-and-coming artists aren’t given more airtime instead of the established names, but that probably would have lessened the doc’s export value to international broadcasters, alas.War Paint – Women at War is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPaintingSecond world warFirst world warVietnam warMaggi HamblingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Have they been cursed by an ancient idol? All will be exhaustingly revealed, over the course of a blessedly short runtime. It’s a frequent complaint that a film is boring because nothing happens, but here is an example where the problem is things are just constantly happening, creating a kind of antics-fatigue. Still, perhaps kids will like it?Parents are naturally concerned if a film contains unsuitable violence or unduly terrifying sequencesbut we should be equally interested in whether a film features the kind of readily imitatable sarcasm and weak banter that impressionable children can easily mistake for being witty. So be warned: around 50% of the dialogue here is of the “so I guess that happened” type – wave after endless wave of it. Nobody really longs for a wholesale return to earnest children’s stories about Topsy and Tim returning a misplaced badge to a jolly policeman at the seaside. But this kind of snarky kids-who-are-wise-beyond-their-years schtick is equally tiresome; this is probably a road trip to avoid.Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Road Trip is on Disney+ from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsFamily filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, a meditation on Oscar Wilde’s prison letter, and a spirited revival of Puccini’s swansongFiona MaddocksSat 29 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 29 Mar 2025 09.11 EDTShareHair streaked with blue,face bubble-gum pink, eyes highlighted in yellow, Andy Warhol paid homage to Botticelli’sBirth of Venuswith joyful freedom, creating a vivid dialogue between Italian Renaissance high art and American mass culture. His reworking loosely exemplifies a growing trend for musicians to try something similar: a Handel aria sung into a microphone, with pulsating keyboard accompaniment, turns into a yet more impassioned soul song. The same composer’s instrumental Concerto Grosso, Op 6 No 10 is reinvented as a vocal piece – with AI Handelbot-generated lyrics (Bfjjfid Ooooh eeeee aahhhh iiii ghdjjrr) for those who want to trill along.Three events last week presented versions of this kind of baroque-update experiment. Two were at Stone Nest, the ex-Welsh chapel, ex-nightclub on London’s Shaftesbury Avenue:Arias Reimagined, part of the London Handel festival, with the independent record labelnonclassical; andRhythm of the Seasons, presented by the venue’s resident group,Figure, which included an interpretation of Vivaldi’sFour Seasonson percussion.In Arias Reimagined, the mezzo-sopranoLotte Betts-Dean, a singer of rich and fearless versatility, switched freely between arias from Handel’sTheodoraand pop from the past 35 years, including Britney Spears and Cocteau Twins. The common thread was emotional intensity and the keyboard exuberance and invention of harpsichordistXiaowen Shang.A second set featured Akkordeon Baroque, a duo inspired by accordionists playing baroque counterpoint in Berlin’s U-Bahn stations. The radical singer-composerLoré Lixenbergand accordionistLore Amenabar Larrañaga, who brings dignity and melancholy to every phrase she plays, worked aural spells with Handel, JS Bach and John Cage (sound by Isa Ferri).The night ended in even more remote territory, with the multiple talents ofBianca Scout(music, movement, electronics, voice and more) and her small ensemble, performing short, spooky mini-dramas with titles such as “We are the lost ideas dancing back from death”. I admit to bafflement, but nothing new there.View image in fullscreen‘Leaping virtuosity’: James Larter in action at Stone Nest.Photograph: Valya KorabelnikovaTo say Vivaldi’sFour Seasonsplayed on percussion was straightforward in comparison would not be true. The dazzling soloist,James Larter, credited with making the arrangement with directorFrederick Waxman, has stripped the score back to its bones, variously building it again with tuned percussion – vibraphone, marimba – and an array of drums, bongos, gongs, triangles, woodblocks, castanets, chopsticks and, as a ratchety addition, a güiro.Vivaldi’s solos were redistributed between a five-strong string group, an almost ghostly harpsichord – Waxman used the lute stop, as well as, occasionally, his sleeve to dampen the sound – all crowned by the wild, leaping virtuosity of Larter himself. Every one of Vivaldi’s familiar imitations, from barking dog to birdsong to drunken dance, sounded different, newly exposed, each vertebra tapped and rattled yet lovingly authentic. Figure’s next event at Stone Nest isLamentationson 10 April: Easter music by Couperin(Leçons de ténèbres)with readings byRadio 3’s Donald Macleod.View image in fullscreenVache Baroque perform Out of the Deep: ‘an exceptional evening’.Photograph: The Photography ShedAlso in Lenten mood, Vache Baroque’sOut of the Deep, at Smith Square Hall, combined penitential music by Wilbye, Purcell, JS Bach and Zelenka with readings, astutely delivered by actor Malcolm Sinclair, from Oscar Wilde’sDe Profundis, written during his imprisonment in Reading jail. Thisshapeshifting groupof young musicians was founded during the pandemic. Their mission embraces children’s shows, opera, all kinds of outreach, working with some of the best rising star talents – here, countertenorAlexander Chanceand tenorGuy Cutting– to achieve the highest standard of historically informed performance.Brahms’s chorale prelude for organ, Herzlich tut mich verlangen, arranged for voices by Vache’s director, Jonathan Darbourne, was a reminder of music’s fluidity in honouring the past: back, in this case, to a secular song via a Lutheran hymn via JS Bach (and, eventually, forward to Paul Simon). The brief farewell, “In pace” by John Sheppard, ended an exceptional evening.View image in fullscreenSondra Radvanovsky and SeokJong Baek in Turandot.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianEasy to forget, Puccini also drew on a predominantly baroque form – that of Italian commedia dell’arte – for his last opera,Turandot. Archetype and myth are clothed in some of his most harmonically daring music, unfinished at the time of his death in 1924. The Royal Opera’s classic 1984 staging, by Andrei Șerban with designs by Sally Jacobs, has returned for its 16th revival (director Jack Furness), cranked back into life with apparent ease, strongly cast throughout, the spectacle ageless, magnificent as well as savage. Porcelain-white masks, crimson banners, suspended tableaux enthral, as does the choral and orchestral panoply so vital to this opera. There were scrappy moments, but Rafael Payare conducts this spirited revival with such impetuous enthusiasm no one should mind.Character development is hardly the point. The Arabian-Italian story tells of a murderous princess and a self-regarding hero, each trying to outdo the other with their merciless riddles. Only the tragic former slave girl Liù (Anna Princeva) has much chance for nuance. The American-Canadian sopranoSondra Radvanovsky, an international Puccini star and a world-leading Turandot, has a gritty, reedy resonance and can soar above an orchestra at full tilt. As Calaf, the South Korean tenor SeokJong Baek tends towards the generic in terms of acting, but his sustained, gleaming top notes are matchless, exciting and only slightly longer than Puccini intended. And yes, his Nessun Dorma is as good as anyone’s, over in a few minutes but worth the wait.

My family is from Uganda and also Kenya, so the food here takes me right back. The music they play is Kenyan. The aesthetic is very familiar. They serve some really good local foods, such as ugali, a maize flour staple in a lot of east African food; nyama choma, or grilled meat; and sukuma wiki, a veg dish with sauteed greens. It has the feel of a family-run business, with really nice service. My family and I go for special occasions. I love that place.2.MusicKeys the PrinceListen to Gbe Mi De Be by Keys the Prince.I came across Keys on social media. What grabbed me was the visual aspect: it wasn’t the most flashy, but it was authentic. He creates music videos in locations that are relevant to the African community in London – for example, in material shops, where you can buy materials to tailor your own clothes with – and he does it in a really stylish way. And then the music is so easy, so relaxed, and he does a good job of infusing it with Nigerian sounds and Yoruba language. I’ve recently really been into his song Gbe Mi De Be, featuring Bxujii.View image in fullscreen3.AppR DiscoveryOnce upon a time, in order to find academic papers, you had to go to Google Scholar or sift through the library, but that’s an imperfect process, especially when, like me, you’re doing a PhD part-time. R Discovery is a tool I came across through an education influencer called Dr Amina Yonis. It streamlines that whole process. You can search by theme, by author, by field. There’s also an AI feature that allows you to listen to the audio version of a paper. It’s made my PhD journey less of a panic.4.InfluencerEly WanandaView image in fullscreenQuestions and provocations: Ely Wananda.Wananda is a YouTuber who comments on different aspects of Black British life. He’s a data scientist and I appreciate anyone in a technical job who makes an effort to demystify his field. He poses questions or provocations, such as “What’s holding back Black British businesses from success?” and “Why wealth and marriage go hand in hand”. These are topics that some of us will never tire of grappling with, and Ely approaches them with a nice conversational style. I find it easy to get material online about Black America, but the focus on Black Britain, especially from an academic perspective, is often lacking.5.TVSquid Gameseason 2View image in fullscreen‘A naked analysis of capitalism’: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game season 2.Photograph: NetflixLet’s acknowledge a crowd pleaser! I lovedSquid Gameseason one. Yes, there’s a lot of shock and gore, but I value the emotional intensity of it. It’s a thriller focusing on a series of games that participants are enticed into with the promise of money, but these games turn out to be lethal. It’s quite a naked analysis of capitalism, exploring all the ways people get into debt, and also a reflection on human behaviour. I just binged season two. It’s more of the same but with new characters and some interesting developments. I enjoyed it very much.6.YouTubeKunda and FriendsView image in fullscreen‘Particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids’: Kunda and Friends.My life at the moment is dominated by a toddler and a newborn. I usually tune out when I hear kids’ programmes, but whenever Kunda comes on, I appreciate it. First of all, it’s educational and talks your child through language, behaviour and all of that good stuff. But particularly relevant for me is the focus on African kids – it’s important for my child to be able to see darker shades on TV. Songs from kids’ programmes can get annoying very quickly, but Kunda has yet to annoy me.

Traces of the region’s Celtic heritage echo in its traditions, music and mythology, giving it a distinctive identity. The northern kingdom of Asturias was the only part of what is now Spain to successfully resist the eighth-century Muslim conquest. In 1934, miners here staged an uprising that was crushed in a brutal crackdown that foreshadowed Franco’s dictatorship. Today, the region is cherished as a milder refuge on a peninsula scorched by the climate crisis:one recent pollfound that Spaniards consider Asturias the most beloved part of their country.View image in fullscreenBut the rest of the world is catching up. Last spring, a high-speed rail line opened, connecting the major cities ofOviedoand Gijón to Madrid in about three hours. Its small airport, which had no international flight routes in 2018, now has 12. The spectre of overtourism looms. While not yet as significant a problem as in other parts of Spain, Airbnb is rapidly colonising homes here. Gijón and Oviedo saw thesharpest rise in holiday rentalsanywhere in Spain from 2023 to 2024 – an 85.5% and 56.4% increase, respectively, according to the tourism associationExceltur.All the cider producers in Asturias are family-owned, some tracing their lineage back eight generationsBut another long-awaited development – the recentinscription of Asturian cider culture into Unesco’sintangible cultural heritage list – suggests a way for visitors to connect with the region that encompasses sustainability, gastronomy, landscape and culture. Asturian cider (sidra) is a far cry from ciders made elsewhere. The experience of drinkingsidrais as intense as its sharp flavour. It is poured from a bottle held high above the head, cascading into a tilted glass held at waist level. The golden stream must be consumed immediately – chugged in a swift motion before the aerated molecules lose their effervescence. Tradition dictated leaving a splash at the bottom to be flung on the floor – a rustic form of disinfection before sharing the glass.“Although we have records of cider dating back 1,000 years, the culture around it is very much alive, so practices are always adapting,” says Luis Benito García Álvarez, history professor and Asturias cider chair at the University of Oviedo.View image in fullscreenA barman in Gijon demonstrates how to pour cider, Asturias-style.Photograph: Jorge Garrido/AlamyGarcía Álvarez, who spearheaded the drive to get Asturian cider on the Unesco list, explains that, like many of the world’s great culinary traditions, it flourished out of necessity. While other apple‑producing regions of Spain also have the tipple, geography isolated Asturias from the vineyards of Rioja or Ribera del Duero, and the plains used to grow grain for beer. Beer and wine were expensive, and cider thrived in their place.“It’s a luxury product at working-class prices,” says García Álvarez. All the cider producers in Asturias are family-owned, some tracing their lineage back eight generations. TheAsturian cider labelcomes with strict requirements: only local varieties of apples and specific, mostly traditional, methods are acceptable. The product is extremely sustainable, and even the glass bottles are reused – some still used today insidrerías(traditional cider restaurants) have been in circulation for more than 50 years. The whole process is artisanal, and yet a bottle in a restaurant only costs around €3 or €4.Perhaps there is no better place to learn about Asturian cider than the area that’s been given the English name ofCider Shire, less than an hour’s drive from Oviedo or Gijón, If the name conjures Tolkienesque images of merry hobbits living simple lives amid bucolic landscapes, that is not far from the truth. Cider Shire’s six boroughs unfold across mountain peaks, lush valleys and pristine beaches.It has a population of just 28,000, but every road and trail seems to lead to a discovery, such as acave in Narzanawhere mass is held in summer, alaid-back marketbrimming with hippy expats in Santolaya, or a river dotted withcenturies-old watermills in Bimenes. In spring, you can roll down your car windows to drink in the scent of blossoms. A vast network of hiking trails allows you to explore at a slower pace.View image in fullscreenThe local cider pairs well withpote asturianostew.Photograph: Maria Galan Still/AlamyAsturias’s fishing villages are the stuff of fairytales. As a resident of Oviedo, I consider Tazones my happy place. No day compares to one spent strolling along the tranquil Villaviciosa estuary, flanked by eucalyptus trees and the wild Atlantic, before heading to the fishing village for a long seafood lunch. Its main thoroughfare is lined with exquisitesidrerías, and if I can I choose the ones with sea views.Cider pairs exquisitely with fresh seafood, including seasonal specialities such as sea urchins andpercebes(goose barnacles). It is also divine with charcuterie, includingjamón ibérico, its beef alternativececina de León, and one of Asturias’s 40 varieties of cheese, the explosive blue cabrales. Earthy stews –fabadaorpote asturiano–or the oozingcachoposchnitzel, also complement cider admirably. But be warned: consuming the immense portions that are served can leave you feeling just as hungover as the cider itself. In a welcome development, nonalcoholic cider has also hit the market. It can be found at the oddchigre(theAsturian namefor asidrería).Asturias’s fishing villages are the stuff of fairytales. No day compares to one spent strolling along the estuary, before heading to Tazones for a long seafood lunchLastres, another coastal gem farther east, is a place of steep hills and staggering views. Every turn of its medieval streets offers a fresh glimpse of the cosy bay. With restaurants such asCasa Eutimio,La Boticaand La Rula serving the freshest of fish, you may also want to try a glass of albariño – a light white wine from neighbouring Galicia. Nearby, you also have some of Cider Shire’s finest beaches, Playa la Griega and Playa de la Isla.The mountain peaks of Cider Shire offer sweeping panoramas, while its inland towns hold a quiet authenticity. Among them, Torazu stands out. This beautiful village is a place ofhórreos– elegant, elevated wooden granaries – and traditional homes painted in bright colours. But Torazu also offers a touch of luxury:a four-star hotel with a spaand, nearby, two remarkable restaurants.Los Llaurelesserves tasting menus that reimagine local flavours, whileAmada Carlota, a Japanese restaurant with mountain views, somehow feels right at home.The two largest towns, Nava and Villaviciosa, are steeped in fascinating, cider-infused history, and have some of the area’s best traditional restaurants. In Nava’s historic quarter, barrels and signs proclaiming its connection to cider are impossible to miss. It’s home to theCider MuseumandPlaza, one of the most highly recommendedchigres. It serves up the smooth Prau Monga produced byViuda de Angelón,one of many cider manufacturers offering guided tours and tastings (in English on request).View image in fullscreenLastres is well known for fresh seafood and beaches.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyCider is a social drink that should ideally be consumed within a year, so it is never hoarded and is often shared atespichas, raucous gatherings where food is abundant and barrels are tapped to celebrate anything from a wedding to simply the cider itself.“In Asturias, people are known for their hospitality and inclusiveness, and cider goes along with that,” says García Álvarez. “Maybe strangers won’t offer you a glass of wine, but they’re quick to offer aculín[a glass of cider].”Ever since he was a child playing in his family’s apple orchards in Villaviciosa, cider has been close to his heart. “I became interested in cider through my family. My father was a miner but was always passionate about rural life,” he says. “We had a lot of apple trees and his dream was always to produce cider at an industrial scale. But he died in an accident when he was 36.”The professor has weaved his love for cider into his academic life, writing a thesis on its cultural history and spending 20 years making sure his father’s drink gained the recognition it deserves.Now, thanks to Unesco, researchers will have more funding to delve deeper, exploring the drink’s probiotic potential (watch out, kombucha), tracing its history and studying how those who drink it connect with Asturian culture and the landscape that sustains it – hopefully for many more generations to come.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysEurope holidaysFood and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, the view from the vantage point is more than worth it.Only from a distance is it possible to really take in the masterwork of the red stone monastery complex, comprising churches and chapels, and to appreciate the sheer remoteness of the cinnamon-hued canyon it sits in, dotted with honeycomb caverns – “nests for bears” as a local priest later told me. And once you’ve reached the top and come back down, on the road leading to Noravank there is a small cave cafe offering respite in the form of refreshing salads, thick coolmadzoon(similar to yoghurt), fresh lavash bread and fizzy bottles of Jermuk, the famous local mineral water.View image in fullscreenIn Armenia, I came to the conclusion that no meal can compete with what is served to you after a good walk. The deep, primeval happiness and comfort when you finally sit down and eat is one of the most satisfying and pleasurable things in life. A hillside sandwich is one thing, an Armenian feast is next level.For my new book, Green Mountains: Walking the Caucasus with Recipes, I spent a couple of months exploring Armenia’s towns, valleys and hills, doing what I could on foot, usually travelling with a walking partner and using a car to reach trailheads.Before I started, I’d been given some warnings about walking in the Caucasus by a seasoned expat hiker. “Watch out for lightning storms, snakes and giant hogweed, which can give you terrible blisters and severe burns. And don’t get caught between a Caucasian shepherd dog and its flock.”View image in fullscreenThe Sevan Writers’ House, a 1930s architectural masterpiece that is now a ramshackle hotelPhotograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyKeeping all that in mind, I began my Armenian explorations not far from Noravank, towards the south of the country, gradually making my way northwards, often picking walks – long and short, urban and rural – from theHikeArmenia appor choosing sections of theTranscaucasian trail.Armenia might not boast the number of towering peaks of neighbouring Georgia – and the awesomeness of mountains such as Ushba, Tetnuldi or Kazbek up close cannot be denied – but there are fewer trekkers setting off here, and the sense of adventure is often greater. I didn’t pass another walker on several longer hikes, and that is priceless if it is peace that you seek out on the hills.Georgia’s new Caucasus trail will link Black and Caspian seasRead moreThe actual walking is only one part of the adventure in Armenia – culture is a constant companion, too. At the largest lake in the South Caucasus, Lake Sevan, I overnighted at theSevan Writers’ House, a futuristic architectural masterpiece built in stages from the 1930s, its most photogenic part shaped like a giant snowshoe balancing on a single thick concrete leg. Today, it operates as a hotel, albeit a slightly crumbling one.View image in fullscreenCaroline Eden found walking in Armenia was a constant journey of discovery.Photograph: Caroline EdenOn arrival, I took a stroll to theSevanavank monastery, located just behind, while the cook fried up a handful of plump little trout and later served them alongside bread, salads and a glass of Armenian brandy. In the morning, there wasgata(a dense slightly bread-like cake, as salty as it is sweet) and coffee on offer and I happily took those on to the balcony of the dining room, with the lake stretching out below.En route to Lake Sevan, I made a pit stop at Noratus cemetery, a field of about a thousandkhachkars(cross‑stones), some dating back to the 10th century, and lost a couple of hours walking between them over scrubby grassland where flocks of sheep grazed. Crouching down, I could see some were carved with expressive human faces, almost cartoon-like, while others were decorated with complex geometric patterns. The sun lit up the lichens that covered them, forming lacy mosaics in colours of rust, cream, lime and pistachio green.The monastery, dedicated to St Gregory, patron saint of Armenia, was almost entirely overgrown by vegetation, the forest literally eating it upMost hikers, though, make a beeline for the town of Dilijan, north of Lake Sevan, which is the springboard for its namesake national park and 125 miles (200km) or so of marked hiking trails. From Dilijan, my first chosen walk was a half-day, circular route in the neighbouring province of Lori, following ancient paths used by herdsmen for generations.It promised two highlights for my walking partner and I: the ruinedBardzrakash monastery, deep in the Tavut forest, and a 13th-century khachkar called Sirun Khach, known locally as the “beautiful cross stone”.From the starting point, the village of Dsegh, we set off along a path of slippery, ankle-twisting stones laid in the middle ages. The forest of hornbeam, maples and cornelian cherry quickly grew thicker, and the trail thinner. Khachkars standing at awkward angles suggested we were heading the right way for the monastery, and before long it appeared out of the mist. It is dedicated to St Gregory the Illuminator, patron saint of Armenia, and almost entirely overgrown by vegetation, the forest literally eating it up. With no roof, the first thing you see is a jumble of fallen masonry and memorial stelae scattered around the 13th-century Mother of God church, and the smaller one to the north side.I felt dismayed it had been left open to looters, graffiti artists and whoever felt they’d like to climb on it, but I also felt lucky to be here. To simply wander up to it, without crowds, the need for a ticket or any sort of queueing.View image in fullscreenArmenia’s bumper harvest was on display at Dsegh’s small summertime farmer’s market.Photograph: Caroline EdenWe strode on, losing our way a few times and hacking through scratchy vegetation, until the forests turned into open countryside and we reached the lonely Sirun Khach. Glistening in the damp, it had been sculpted from light brown tuff and reverently set on a triple-stepped pedestal of black basalt. This moment called for a hill snack reward, so I pulled out a packet ofgozinaki, a sweet brittle made of nuts and seeds, and we snapped pieces off. Rain opened up the smell of the surrounding meadows.Respite, again, presented itself at the end of the walk. Armenia’s bumper harvest was on display at Dsegh’s small summertime farmer’s market. First, hot revitalising coffee, and a slice ofgata, then a litre of fresh pumpkin juice to take away, a cheese turnover to pocket as well as a bag of exceptional white figs bought from the boot of a car belonging to a woman who’d picked them from her garden. There was some amiable rivalry between the stallholders over who had the biggest and best raspberries, so I bought two cups from different vendors to taste the difference.Walking in Armenia means being sidetracked and sidetracked again, in the best possible wayOne of the most difficult things about walking through such landscapes, and enjoying such a sense of discovery, is stopping. There is a persuasive urge to go beyond the next valley to see a particular mountain, that church or that village. Walking in Armenia I was sidetracked again and again, in the best possible way.During my walks, the word “constellation” kept coming to mind, as I often felt I was in a sky full of stars where I could hop from one to the next with a sense of almost otherworldly wonder. And all the while being fuelled by the hospitality and food offered by Armenians who so often go out of their way to help a stranger.Green Mountains by Caroline Eden (Quadrille Publishing Ltd, £28) is published 3 April.

It’s a long story, but the short version is that I love animals alive and vegetables on my plate.If I think about who I am and how I eat, I am built from Gujarati ingenuity and Lincolnshire produce when it comes to putting vegetables at the centre of the table. While I eat mainly plants, I do leave a little room in my diet for other things that I enjoy – a fish curry shared with my husband, Hugh, an omelette for a quick dinner, or tidying the edges of a hunk of manchego – and three of my cookbooks,Fresh India,EastandDinner, overall reflect that way of eating.I have variously followed a vegan or vegetarian diet, but the moment I fell off the wagon by eating some meat, I feared I lacked conviction. I’d question my values and feel as if I’d failed, and I’d want to throw in the towel. But, left to my own devices, I very rarely ate meat or fish, say once or twice a month, and dairy and eggs more regularly, but there was no wagon to fall off – and overall I was moving in the right direction.I’ve never labelled myself a vegan or, for that matter, a vegetarian, pescatarian or meat-eaterEven though I’ve written thevegan columnat the Guardian for eight years, I’ve never labelled myself a vegan or, for that matter, a vegetarian, pescatarian or meat-eater. So when the Guardian recently asked me to broaden my horizons to include vegetarian recipes every other week, I said yes.Back in 2017, many of the vegan recipes being written weren’t especially tempting and, having grown up eating the most beautiful home-cooked, largely vegan Indian food, I had a lot to add to the conversation. But things have changed since then. Now many of the UK’s brightest brains are creating fantastic plant-based dishes: it’s where the greatest innovation in food is. There are vegan ranges in every supermarket and every fast-food chain, and most restaurants and pubs have at least one vegan option.And so perhaps now is the right time for me to go full panda. Before I do, I’d love to share a couple of things I’ve learned along the way.Veganism is far from the restrictive diet I once thought it was. Initially, I felt it was so limited that I’d have to give up my column within two months (thanks toItamar SrulovichandDiana Henryfor talking me out of it). But the limitation forced me to think more creatively. I had to learn different ways of cooking vegetables to get to a delicious and satisfying meal quickly. It has opened up my palate and given me new skills; I’ve learned how to extract the most flavour from a celeriac. Overall, it has made me a better cook, and it has been fun along the way.It has also made me more conscious of what I eat. It’s forced me to read every label and, in doing so, I’ve become more aware of what I’m putting into my body (and what I’m recommending you put into yours). It’s led me to be much more aware of ultra-processed ingredients and foods, for example, of which there are lots when it comes to pre-packaged vegan food.Finally, the community around my column has been amazing in all sorts of ways. I’ve learned that most of my readers are Meat-Free Monday-ers or part-time vegans, and have shown enormous enthusiasm for weekly vegan options. Many are not, as I initially thought, part of a small, east London bubble, but from as far as the Outer Hebrides and of all ages. Both my father in-law and stepfather-in-law, for example, who are in their late 70s and grew up eating meat daily, now eat vegan food regularly.If we all, in our millions, eat less meat more regularly, that’s where the greatest change will happenI am conscious that I’m making this change at a time when Donald Trump has pulled out of the Paris agreement, and just after the Los Angeles fires. But I believe that one of the most empowering things we can all do in the face of the climate crisis is to choose what we put on our plates three times a day. And if we all, in our millions, choose to eat less meat more regularly, that’s where the greatest change will happen.I’ll still be writing vegan recipes every other week here and my food will still be about flavour, vegetables and pleasure. For the time being, because so much of what I do is tinkering in the kitchen, I am thrilled to have new ingredients for my weekly column – the equivalent of new paints to paint with. Sometimes I might not get it right, but I’m enthusiastic to learn and to see what I can create for you.Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkVegetarianismFoodVegan food and drinkVeganismVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I buy it in bulk and rely on it to bring a voluptuous, fragrant, dairy-free creaminess to so many of my favourite dishes, from curries and dals to soups and rice dishes. It’s also indispensable for puddings for vegan friends, and for my sweet-toothed, lactose-intolerant husband. It mellows out spices and pulls a dish together, adding a silkiness to sauces and a sweet, nutty richness to cakes, batters and vegan custards.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Ideally, coconut milk should contain two ingredients: coconut milk and water. Buying a good-quality one – as opposed to one bolstered with sweeteners, emulsifiers and stabilisers – often makes the difference between a great dish and a bad one. I try to use ones with no stabilisers or emulsifiers added, such as Biona (see below) andClearspring. I also like some of the less widely available Asian brands, such asAroy-D, which, though it contains a thickening agent, has a whopping 70% coconut content, making it one of the most coconut-forward, creamiest milks on the market.The best canned coconut milkBest all-rounderEssential Waitrose coconut milkView image in fullscreen£1.15 for 400ml at Waitrose★★★☆☆A good, distinctive, nutty flavour overall, with a creamy texture and only a slight sweetness.Best splurgeBiona organic coconut milkView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 400ml at Ocado£11.95 for 6 x 400ml at Amazon★★★★★The Ferrari of coconut milks – this has 50% organic coconut, with water being the only other ingredient.

Recently, we went round to see a friend who is an Italian chef. He cooked pasta and a tomato sauce (amatriciana); we had a salad of shaved fennel, orange and olive oil; and a piece of delicious cheese, some good crackers and a few squares of chocolate to finish. It was a sensational weekend lunch. Today’s tender and light dumplings are just so – peas and onions make the sauce, but plentiful olive oil and butter, plus some generous seasoning, take them to another level. The pudding is a tiramisu of sorts, and all the better for it: blissfully easy to pull together and indecently delicious.Ricotta dumplings with butter-braised peas and mint (pictured top)The peas melt into the fat but with enough white wine and lemon juice to pique your interest. Then the tender, light ricotta dumplings are fried golden and nestle in the vegetables. Bliss.Prep15 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4-5500g whole-milk ricotta100g finely gratedgranapadano, parmesan or maturelincolnshirepoacher, plus extra to serve1 large egg, plus 1 yolkSalt and black pepper3 tbsp flour, plus extra for dustingFor the peas45ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve4garlic cloves, peeled –2 halved, 2 crushed2 baby gemlettuce,halved70g butter400g white onions, peeled and sliced300g frozen peas100ml white wine200mlchicken stock½ lemon,juiced1 handful mint, roughly choppedFirst, dry the ricotta. Put it in a sieve, then lay four sheets of kitchen paper on top of each other on a plate. Tip the ricotta on to the paper and top with four more sheets. Press the ricotta into a ball, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Once the sheets are soaked through, discard and repeat with four more sheets, continuing until the ricotta is dry and crumbly.Put the ricotta in a food processor with the grated cheese, whole egg and egg yolk, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper, then pulse/blitz until everything just comes together. Sprinkle in the flour, pulse again to combine, then transfer the dough to a large bowl and put in the freezer to set.Put the oil and the halved garlic in a deep saute pan on a medium-high heat. Season the lettuce, then brown it in the garlic oil for a few minutes on each side, until coloured. Lift out the lettuce, then add 40g butter to the pan. Once it’s melted, add the onions, season generously and cook, stirring often, over a medium heat for about 20 minutes, until translucent and soft.Meanwhile, dust a large tray with flour. Take the ricotta mix out of the freezer and, using two tablespoons to shape them, scoop out oblong quenelles and transfer to the tray. Set aside somewhere cool.Add the crushed garlic to the onions, fry for a few minutes, then shred the sauteed lettuce and add that, too. Finally, stir in peas, wine and stock, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, until the peas are cooked but still bursting in the mouth, then add the lemon juice and mint, then taste to check the seasoning.Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the dumplings in batches for three to four minutes, until they are cooked through, firm and float to the top of the water. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate lined with kitchen towel while you cook the remaining dumplings. Melt the remaining 30g butter in a frying pan on a high heat, then saute the poached dumplings for three to four minutes on each side, until golden.Serve the dumplings nestled in the buttered peas, scattered with more grated cheese and a few glugs of oil.Rhubarb, cardamom and mascarpone trifleView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ rhubarb and cardamom trifle.Whipped cream and cardamom is my idea of heaven. Throw in sweet orange-roast rhubarb, tequila-soaked sponge fingers and hints of vanilla, and I am sunk.Prep5 minCook45 minChillovernightServes6-8500g pink rhubarb(trimmed weight)90g caster sugarZest and juice of 2 oranges45ml red vermouth45ml tequila blanco, or vodka180g sponge fingersFor the topping2 large eggs, separated75gcaster sugar250g mascarpone1 tsp ground green cardamom2 tsp vanilla extract300ml double creamTo serve40g toasted almondsDried raspberries, optionalHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Trim and clean the rhubarb, then cut it into 5cm pieces. Arrange the rhubarb in a single layer in a roasting dish, sprinkle over the sugar, orange zest and juice, and vermouth. Cover and roast for 25-30 minutes, until tender to the point of a knife. Remove from the oven, pour in the tequila and leave to cool.Meanwhile, start on the topping. Using an electric whisk, beat the egg yolks with the caster sugar until you have a thick, smooth, yellow paste, then whisk in the mascarpone, cardamon and vanilla. In a separate clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to firm peaks, then fold them into the mascarpone mixture. Using the egg white bowl, softly whip the cream, then fold that into the mascarpone, too.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Arrange the sponge fingers in a trifle bowl or deep dish.

Inspired by bothHeston Blumental’s snail porridgeand Dan Barber’s “rotation risotto”, which I developed for his WastED pop-up at Selfridges in 2017, this particular savoury porridge even gained some notoriety after it featured in Private Eye’s Pseuds Corner that same year. The latter was a fun, fine-dining dish but, at its heart, the recipe is very simple and satisfying; it works brilliantly, too.Cheesy mushroom porridgeAt its heart, porridge is, of course, the humblest of dishes. It’s usually eaten for breakfast, perhaps sweetened with honey and molasses, but it works very well as a savoury meal. Think risotto: when cooked for long enough, oats release their starch and turn very creamy, making them a great vehicle for delicious savoury flavours, especially cheese.As a plant grows, it draws vital nutrients from the soil, which need replenishing to maintain its fertility. This can be achieved through the use of compost, fertilisers and a careful annual rotation of crops. By alternating between cash crops, less profitable varieties and “green manure” – that is, plants cultivated to protect and nourish the soil – you can preserve the soil’s health and productivity for future harvests (for instance, in organic farming, spelt or wheat is commonly rotated with rye and clover to sustain nutrient levels and support soil regeneration). To demonstrate the crop rotation system on a plate, when I first made this dish for WastED, I used a mixture of rye, oats and clover; a vegan version of the dish also features in my bookEating for Pleasure, People & Planet.Here, however, I’ve used a combination of celeriac and jerusalem artichoke, not least for their rich depth of flavour, but it works just fine without – or with a different root vegetable altogether, such as parsnip, potato or turnip. The recipe calls for only a small amount of root veg, so if you have a big celeriac or bag of jerusalem artichokes to use up, consider roasting the rest in wedges or turn them into a delicious soup or mash. And remember, there’s no need to peel jerusalem artichokes or celeriac; their skins are delicious and perfectly fine to eat, so just clean them well around their knotty roots and cut out or wash off any soil.Serves4 as a main course100g butter120g celeriac and/or jerusalem artichokes, cleaned and finely diced1 large flat mushroom, finely diced50g dark leektops, washed and finely sliced1garlic clove, peeled and minced400g rolled oats and/or flaked rye or flaked spelt(a mixture is also nice, if possible)1-1½ litres vegetable stock, or chicken stock or boiling water50-100g parmesan rind, or cheddar rindCelery salt, or sea salt,and black pepper50g cheese ends(eg, cheddar, blue, brie, parmesan etc), grated, plus extra to garnish2 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, to serve (optional)Melt half the butter in a heavy-based saucepan on a low-medium heat. Add the diced celeriac and/or jerusalem artichokes, the mushroom, leek tops and garlic, and saute gently for five minutes, stirring all the while.Stir in the rolled oats, then add a litre of hot stock (or boiling water), and the cheese rind. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook, stirring regularly, for 15 minutes, or until the porridge thickens to a sticky but still loose consistency; add more stock or boiling water to loosen, if need be.Finish by stirring in the remaining butter and grated cheese ends, then season well with celery or sea salt and black pepper, to taste. Ladle into shallow, wide bowls and garnish with flat-leaf parsley sprigs, including their finely chopped stalks. Serve topped with more grated cheese, if you like.Explore more on these topicsPorridgeWaste notFoodFood wasteCheeseVegetablesMain coursefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The name means “grilled as you like it”, and I took that to heart, so today’s recipe is made using kimchi and cheddar, which is how I enjoy it. Osaka has a large Korean population, so it’s not unusual to see kimchi on menus, but I have no one but myself to blame for the cheddar. The combination is a dream, with the creamy cheese taking the edge off the sour, hot kimchi. Eat as is, with the pak choi salad and dressed with Kewpie mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce, or as you like it. You can buy Kewpie mayo in many large supermarkets and in Japanese and east Asian food shops, where you’ll also be able to pick up the optional okonomiyaki sauce.Prep10 minCook40 minServes2For the okonomiyaki300g kimchi– I likeKim Kong Kimchi4 large eggs½ tsp fine sea salt, or to taste150g plain flour½ tsp baking powder100g mature cheddar, grated100g spring onions(about 6), whites and greens separated, finely sliced and rinsedRapeseed oilFor the topping250g pak choi, quartered and finely chopped1 tbsp roasted sesame seeds2 tbsp sweetened rice-wine vinegar3 tbsp toasted sesame oil½ tsp fine sea saltKewpie mayonnaise, to finishOkonomiyaki sauce, to finish (optional)Set a sieve over a small bowl, tip in the kimchi, juice and all, and using the back of a spoon squeeze out as much juice as you can. Weigh out 180g drained kimchi, put it on a chopping board, and measure three and a half tablespoons of the strained juices into a large bowl. Put any remaining kimchi and juice back in the jar. Roughly chop the drained kimchi.Whisk the eggs, salt and 90ml water (or six tablespoons) into the kimchi juice, then add the flour and baking powder, and whisk again until you have a smooth batter. Add the chopped kimchi, grated cheddar and spring onion whites (reserve the greens for the topping), and mix again.Put two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat. When it’s very hot, ladle in a quarter of the batter and cook for four minutes. Flip over the pancake, then cook for another two and a half minutes on the other side, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat until you’ve used up all the batter, stacking the pancakes on top of each other as you go.To make the topping, tip the chopped pak choi into a medium bowl, add the chopped green parts of the spring onions, sesame seeds, vinegar, oil and salt, and mix well.To serve, place two okonomiyaki on each plate and crisscross the top with Kewpie mayonnaise. Top each one with a handful of the pak choi salad, then dig in.Thai-style fried egg saladView image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s Thai-style fried egg saladThis is one of the fastest ways to cook an egg in the east: the tops are basted using the hot oil from the pan, meaning there’s no waiting for the runny bit around the yolks to cook. As a bonus, you create fantastic texture: crisp, golden, lacy and bubbled whites, and barely cooked yolks. But the best bit about this recipe isn’t even the speed, or the texture; it’s the joy of the hot and sour Thai dressing, which mixes with the yolks and rice in the most excellent way. I’d recommendcooking some jasmine rice first, to eat alongside, because it will stay warm for up to an hour. Not all vegetarian and vegan fish sauces are equal, butThai Taste makes a great one.Prep15 minCook10 minServes22½ tbsp lime juice, from 2–3 limes2½ tbsp vegetarian fish sauce2½ tsp soft light brown or palm sugar1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 bird’s eye chilli, stalk discarded, flesh finely sliced1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced1 banana shallot, peeled, halved lengthwise and cut into long, thin stripsRapeseed or sunflower oil4 eggs1 handfulfresh coriander, leaves pickedCooked jasmine rice,to serveFirst, make the dressing. Put the lime juice, fish sauce and sugar in a small bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the garlic, chilli, spring onion, shallot and a tablespoon and a half of water, mix again and set aside.Next, line a plate with kitchen paper and get ready a fish slice or slotted spoon. Pour ½cm of oil into a medium nonstick frying pan and set it over a medium heat. When the oil is too hot to hold a hand over from 10cm away, gently break in two of the eggs – they might spit, so beware! Feel free to turn down the heat a little if it’s too intense, but the eggs should bubble up. Cook for a minute to a minute and a half, basting the yolks carefully with the hot oil so the translucent egg turns white and the edges go lacy, golden and crisp. (This timing will give you a very runny yolk; for a firmer yolk, cook for two minutes.) Transfer the eggs to the lined plate using the slotted spoon, then repeat with the remaining eggs.When you’ve fried all the eggs, use the slotted spoon to transfer them to a lipped serving plate, then pour over the dressing. Scatter over the coriander and serve immediately with freshly steamed jasmine rice.The egg salad recipe is an edited extract from Dinner: 120 Vegan and Vegetarian Recipes for the Most Important Meal of the Day, by Meera Sodha, published by Penguin at £27.
