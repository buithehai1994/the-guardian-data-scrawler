But how well is he playing his own hand? | Olga ChyzhRead moreHe added: “I travelled in the train for 12 hours, then for 11 hours I flew because the president of the US invited me. The US is one of our main partners, and for me it is a show of respect to be in the White House when the president of the US invites me.”Ukraine’s president was speaking just before flying out of the UK, to which he had travelled immediately after thedisastrous White House meetingwhere he was accused of not being grateful for US military support and was told Ukraine could not win the war.He also said he believed that an Anglo-French-led peace effort, discussed by European leaders in London on Sunday, would bear fruit “in the coming weeks” and indicated there were supportive declarations from other countries – such as Turkey, the Balts and the Nordics – to get involved.The conference in London also discussed “what security guarantees could be given to Ukraine”, Zelenskyy said, adding that there had “been a very good start” in Sunday’s discussion, and a number of countries would soon “speak for themselves”.But while he said he was aware of a proposal from France and Britain to for a one-month truce in the fighting, he would not say if he supported it. Speaking at the end of the interview he gave his only answer in English: “I am aware of everything.”Ukraine “will never” recognise any Russian annexation of territory it occupies, even if it is to try to secure a peace deal, Zelenskyy added, and he repeated that he would only accept a ceasefire if it was followed by robust security guarantees that had the confidence of his country’s people.Though Russia has said it will insist on incorporating territories that it occupies, for Ukraine it would always be “a temporary occupation”, Zelenskyy insisted, even if his country lacks the military muscle to expel Russia from all of the country at the moment.​Zelenskyy said what he wanted “from partners” – a clear reference to the US White House – was for them to remember that Russia launched the full-scale invasion of his country three years ago. He did not want politicians rewriting history, he said, to suggest “that there are two parties in this war and it is vague who the aggressor is”.The Ukrainian president appeared to provoke Trump on Friday when he had said that Putin “hates us” and “thinks we are not a nation”. Trump had spoken in Putin’s defence and appeared to blame Zelenskyy for being embroiled in the war with his larger neighbour.The Ukrainian leader refused to say what happened after the cameras stopped rolling in the Oval Office on Friday, and before he abruptly left the White House without having lunch or signing the minerals deal.It has been reported that Trump’s team asked Zelenskyy to leave, though the Ukrainian president said it was best “to leave this to history”.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer said they had agreed to increase economic pressure on Russia.Photograph: Javad Parsa/ReutersThe summit took place in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House, surrounded by a ring of pro-Ukrainian protesters.Starmer told a press conference afterwards that Britain and other European nations were willing to put “boots on the ground and planes in the air” to help provide an effective deterrent to Russia.“It’s time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace,” he told reporters. “If you want to preserve the peace, you have to be prepared to defend the peace.”Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, called the meeting “historic”. Starmer failed to secure concrete promises of extra military support from other Nato members, but Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said she would follow it up on Thursday with her own plan to “rearm Europe”.“It’s basically [about] turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders,” she added.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, later told Le Figaro that he and Starmer had suggested a one-month truce “in the air, on the seas, and on energy infrastructure” to get more time to de-escalate the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.Starmer’s diplomatic flurry puts him at centre of attempts to shape Ukraine-Russia dealRead moreThe truce would not cover ground fighting, he said, conceding it would be “very difficult” to police a complete ceasefire given the length of the frontline.Macron also spoke about the need to relax EU fiscal rules to allow countries to spend more and use “innovative” financing to fund defence spending.Starmer said that to ensure Vladimir Putin did not breach any ceasefire with further attacks on Ukraine, there would have to be security guarantees from the US, with senior British officials saying that air, logistics and intelligence support would be necessary.“To succeed, this effort must have strong US backing. We’re working with the US on this point after my meeting with President Trump last week,” Starmer said. “Let me be clear, we agree with the president on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together.”Trump has repeatedly resisted making any sort of military commitment to securing peace in Ukraine. Instead, he has suggested that an “economic backstop” of US civilians working on a multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal in the country would be sufficient.1:41Zelenskyy greeted by cheering crowds in UK after Trump clash – videoSome in the British government believe this will be enough to provide security to Ukraine. Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to Washington, told ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday: “Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow.”British officials are still hoping the minerals deal can be resurrected, with Starmer having urged Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday to return to the negotiating table.However, with little sign of the White House wanting to re-engage in talks with Zelenskyy, Downing Street has shifted its attention to building Starmer’s “coalition of the willing” instead.At the London summit, the leaders agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine, including after any ceasefire agreement, so that Kyiv would be in a strong position to deter any further attacks from Russia.Other nations are also planning to raise their own defence budgets, after Starmer announced last week that the UK would increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an ambition to hit 3% soon afterwards.“Any deal must be backed by strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,” Starmer said.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy later travelled to meet Prince Charles at Sandringham.Photograph: Joe Giddens/APThe prime minister said the leaders had also agreed to increase economic pressure on Russia.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will sign a £2.3bn loan deal to allow Kyiv to buy more weapons, to be paid back using profits generated on Russian sovereign assets that are under sanctions.Shehas also saidshe will change the remit of the £27.8bn national wealth fund so it could be spent on defence as well as infrastructure projects.Leaving the summit, von der Leyen said European leaders recognised they had to “urgently rearm” the continent, with the commission due to propose a plan on Thursday. “We need … to prepare for the worst, and [are] therefore stepping up the defences,” she said.Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, said Europe was “stepping up” to make sure Ukraine could continue to defend itself if necessary, and had discussed what security guarantees they could provide, while following the UK by increasing their own defence budgets.After the summit,Zelenskyy travelled to meet King Charlesat Sandringham, with the offer of a royal audience interpreted at Westminster as a deliberate move to give the Ukrainian president equal treatment to Trump, who was last week presented by Starmer with an invitation to a second state visit to the UK.Speaking to reporters later on, Zelenskyy said he regretted the fact the meeting with Trump on Friday had taken place in front of cameras.“I do not believe it is right when such conversations are absolutely open because the emotions or information etc, the foes can take advantage of them,” he told LBC’s Andrew Marr.“Therefore, the format of what happened, I do not think that it brought something positive or additional to us as partners.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerForeign policyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone around this table.”Among those in attendance were the French president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Canadian prime minster, Justin Trudeau; the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni; and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.Here are some key takeaways:1.Ukraine must be put in strongest position for future negotiationsStarmer added another £1.6bn in UK export finance for Ukraine to “buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles, which will be made in Belfast”, on top of the £2.2bn loan he had announced on SaturdayThis would be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now, and strengthen Ukraine in securing the peace, when it comes, he said.2.There will be a ‘coalition of the willing’Any deal must be backed by strength so Russia cannot breach it, Starmer said.“Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” the UK prime minister said.“The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,” Starmer added.3.The plan must have strong US backingWhile Europe would do the “heavy lifting”, backing from the US was needed. “We are working with the US on this point after my meeting with President Trump last week,” Starmer said.“We agree with the president on the urgent need for a durable peace, now we need to deliver together.”The US was not an “unreliable” ally, Starmer said when asked. It was a “strong and reliable ally” to the UK, adding that he had spoken with Trump on Saturday night.“The discussions we have had today, particularly on the coalition of the willing is on the basis that this is a plan that we will work on with the US. That is the purpose of the plan.”4.Leaders agreed to keep military aid to Ukraine flowingStarmer said they agreed that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security “and Ukraine must be at the table”.He added: “In the event of peace deal we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities to deter any future invasions”.5.Leaders will meet again very soonStarmer said: “We are at a crossroads in history today, this is not a moment for more talk, it’s time to act, time to step up and lead. And united around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”6.Nato chief says talks were ‘really positive’The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said that “more European countries will ramp up defence spending” but did not go into specifics.He described increased defence spending as “very good news” and reiterated the need for “more of a fair balance” with the US.He told reporters the first step was to make sure there is a peace deal before there are discussions about how to guarantee it.Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeRussiakey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,” it said in a statement. “If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.”After the announcement, Netanyahu’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, wrote in a social media post: “No trucks entered Gaza this morning, nor will they at this stage.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately”.The existence and details of a Witkoff plan had not been confirmed by Washington by Sunday morning. A statement from Hamas called the suspension of aid a “war crime” and a violation of the ceasefire agreement. It said Netanyahu’s “decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement”.Hamas said it was committed to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase, with negotiations aimed at a permanent end to the war, and it rejected the idea of a temporary extension to the 42-day truce.A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, told Al Jazeera the group would release the remaining Israeli hostages only under the terms of the already agreed-upon phased deal.During the 15 months of theIsrael-Gaza war, the Netanyahu government repeatedly denied claims from aid agencies that it was blocking humanitarian deliveries, blaming the very limited flow on other factors. Before the ceasefire, UN officials had warned that widespread famine was imminent. In the six weeks of the first phase of the truce, deliveries returned to the prewar levels of about 600 trucks a day, mostly carrying food.Aid officials said that even with the restoration of food deliveries, the lack of drinkable water, the near-complete destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and clinics, the lack of shelter in the midst of winter, and the buildup of untreated sewage among the rubble could all be lethal to the surviving population of 2.2 million people.Netanyahu made his announcement, which his office claimed had US backing, after the breakdown of talks in Cairo aimed at maintaining the ceasefire as it approached the end of its first six-week phase, over whether the truce should advance to a second phase.The prime minister’s office said earlier on Sunday that it agreed on the adoption of what it described as Witkoff’s proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, which end on 20 April, during which half of the living hostages and half of the bodies of those who have died would be released.On the conclusion of that temporary extension, the statement said: “If agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, the remaining living and deceased hostages will be released.”1:19Palestinians gather amid rubble in Rafah for first iftar of Ramadan – videoThe first phase of the ceasefire chiefly involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, an increase in aid deliveries and a retreat of Israeli troops from some positions. The second phase requires a complete Israeli withdrawal and a more enduring cessation of hostilities.The Witkoff plan as described by Netanyahu’s office appeared similar to Israel’s proposal for a six-week extension of the first phase of the ceasefire, with hostage releases, but it made no mention of the troop withdrawal that was part of theoriginal truce agreement in January.Hamas said the proposal made clear that Israel was seeking to disavow the deal it previously signed.The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as “a weapon against the Palestinian people”, comments echoed by Qatar which said it “strongly condemns” Israel’s decision. Saudi Arabia also condemned the aid block and Jordan said Israel’s action “threatens to reignite” fighting in Gaza.The European Union condemned what it called Hamas’s refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel’s subsequent aid block “risked humanitarian consequences”. Brussels called for “a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire”.Hamas has not been directly participating in the talks in Cairo, but has been coordinating with Qatari and Egyptian officials who are at the negotiating table with US and Israeli delegations. The negotiators left Cairo on Friday night, and there was no sign of them reconvening late on Saturday.An Israeli withdrawal would first involve a pullback from thePhiladelphi corridoralong Gaza’s southern border with Egypt but such a retreat could trigger the collapse of Netanyahu’s rightwing coalition, which would in turn force new elections, in which his political future would be uncertain.Israeli political analysts have suggested that Netanyahu agreed to the ceasefire under pressure from Donald Trump, confident that the agreement would never reach a second phase. Since the start of the ceasefire, he prevented Israeli negotiators from discussing a second phase.Witkoffhas, however, insisted that a second phase of the ceasefire deal should be implemented, to ensure the release of theremaining 59 hostages, only 25 of whom are thought to be still alive. Most Israelis also want the government to make a priority of freeing the hostages, but that position is opposed by the Israeli far right, without whom the coalition could not stay in power. The rightwing parties argue Israel’s priority should be the destruction of Hamas.The far-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said the decision to halt the flow of aid was “an important step in the right direction”.Referring to Trump’s earlier threat to open the “gates of hell” on Gaza, Smotrich said in a social media post: “Now we need to open these gates as quickly and deadly as possible on to the enemy, until complete victory.”There remains no agreement on who should run Gaza once an enduring end to the war can be agreed. Trump caused consternation and bewilderment early in February with the shock suggestion that theUS should “own” Gaza, which would be somehow emptied of its more than 2 million Palestinian inhabitants to make way for a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It equates to nearly a fifth of all the police spies who were sent to infiltrate political movements.Four of the police spies fathered, or are alleged to have fathered, children with women they met while using their fake identities to infiltrate campaigners.One woman, known as Jacqui, has said her life was “absolutely ruined” after she discovered by chance that the father of her son was an undercover officer, more than 20 years after his birth. The officer, Bob Lambert, abandoned them when the son was an infant, claiming falsely thathe had to go on the run abroad to escape beingarrested by police.Other women had intimate relationships lasting up to six years with men who concealed the fact they were undercover officers who had been sent to spy on them and their friends.More than 50 women are so far known to have been deceived by the undercover officers, although the total is unknown at the moment and is likely to be higher. They unknowingly shared their most intimate lives with the spies and some attended weddings and funerals with them.The women were devastated when they discovered how the men had betrayed them, leaving them profoundly traumatised and unable to form trusting intimate relationships again.The scale of the deception has been revealed as ITV starts to broadcast a major series on what has become known as the “spy cops” scandal.Starting on Thursday, the series – made in collaboration with the Guardian – shows how five women pieced together disparate clues to expose the real identities of their former boyfriends. The identities of its covert officers is one of the British state’s deepest secrets.The women scoured obscure archives and even travelled abroad to unmask the men after they abruptly vanished from their lives using what turned out to be fake claims.Do you have information about this story? Email rob.evans@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348.Their detective work over many years led to a series of revelations that have exposed the highly secret undercover operations to infiltrate political campaigns and misconduct by the spies, forcing the government to set up a public inquiry.Thelong-running inquiry– led by the retired judge John Mitting – is examining decades of undercover deployments. A key part of the inquiry is looking at how the women were deceived and who among those supervising the undercover work knew about it.David Barr, the inquiry’s chief barrister, told a hearing last year that it was not scrutinising whether sexual deception was justified. “It was not,” he said.Years of campaigning and legal action by the women have forced police chiefs to apologise and admit that the “abusive,deceitful, manipulative” relationships resulted from “a wider culture of sexism and misogyny” within the police. The police have also admitted that the managers supervising the officers – imbued with that culture – failed to prevent the abuse from happening.The deceptive relationships were a frequent part of intensely secret operations that began in 1968 and lasted more than 40 years.The relationships started in the1970s and continued until 2010. Only two of the 25 officers were women. Many of the identities of the police spies remain secret, meaning there is an unknown number of women who may be unaware that they had been deceived into sexual relationships.In total, about 139 undercover officers – employed in two covert squads – spied onmore than 1,000 political groups. Tens of thousands of mainly leftwing and progressive campaigners were put under surveillance.Who were the undercover cops who deceived women into sexual relations?Read moreMany of the spies created aliases basedon the identities of dead childrenafter searching through archives containing birth and death records to locate suitable matches.The officers typically spent four years pretending to be campaignerswhile they infiltrated political groups, befriending activists while simultaneously hoovering up information about their protests.They routinely gathered hugeamounts of information about the personal lives of political activists, such as their holiday plans, sexuality and bank accounts.As well as the 25, there are a further three spies who deny they had sexual relations under their fake identity.Explore more on these topicsUndercover police and policing'Spy cops' scandalPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burns to slow their descent over hazardous terrain.Explore more on these topicsSpaceSpaceXThe moonNasanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s such a fundamental and crucial blow to all writers and artists, it feels like the Labour party have lost the plot over the arts and creative industries. Certainly the current signs are they are worse than the Tories.”The government is said to beconsidering concessionson its proposals after abacklash. It is also due to publish an interim report on its curriculum and assessment review imminently.A key demand from critics has been the scrapping of the English baccalaureate (Ebacc), which requires children to study a suite of highly academic subjects and excludes the arts.It is also the bedrock on which a school’s progress 8 score is based. This determines its place in performance tables and therefore acts as an incentive to eschew the arts and focus on Ebacc subjects.GCSE and A-level entries for arts courses have plummeted since the Ebacc was introduced in 2011 and critics say the arts have increasingly become the preserve of the privately educated.The artistBob and Roberta Smith(real name Patrick Brill), who runs workshops for children interested in studying at London Metropolitan University, said: “Very few of the kids I have worked with are doing arts GCSE and even fewer are doing the A-level. In Tower Hamlets last year, in the whole borough there were less than 30 kids doing the A-level. Just a disgrace.“Labour must ditch the Ebacc and get rid of progress 8. Without showing leadership in this area it’s all just warm words that will betray our creative children.”The writer Michael Rosen was also sceptical about Labour’s promises. “Based on what’s happened over the last few months, I think it is reasonable to expect that this Labour government will not do what it said it would do,” he said.“When it comes to education policies, Labour governments of recent years tremble in the face of what they imagine is the giant monolith of rightwing educational theory.”As a result, he said, they have ended up producing policies that are “cunning attempts to out-Tory the Tories”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To give everyone that chance through their school life will be life-changing for so many.”Smith said: “We all pay taxes. All our voices should be seen and heard in the arts. Very few artists have an estuary accent. Viva the estuary, protect the sea gulls!”A government spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of this government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and we are committed to ensuring art, music and drama are no longer the preserve of a privileged few.“To help achieve this, our curriculum and assessment review will seek to deliver a broader curriculum. The budget also delivered on the government’s commitment to put education back at the forefront of national life, including by putting a further £2.3bn into school budgets next year.”Explore more on these topicsArts in schoolsClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityArts and humanitiesEducation policyLabourSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She lived it.McKinstry was the Sunday school secretary at the 16th Street Baptist church in Birmingham,Alabama, when the church was bombed by white supremacists on 16 September 1963, killing four Black girls – Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Roberts, all 14, and 11-year-old Cynthia Wesley.View image in fullscreenCarolyn McKinstry in Washington in 2016.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesMcKinstry, who was 14 at the time, remembers it was Youth Day at the church and the lesson of the day was “A Love That Forgives”. She spent that Sunday morning collecting attendance and financial records from classes. McKinstry answered the church phone just seconds before the bomb went off in the church basement.“I did not immediately think of it as a bomb. I didn’t know what it was,” McKinstry said. “I heard a few people scream and then I heard somebody say, ‘Hit the floor’ – and I crawled under that very first pew where I was standing.”McKinstry remembered: “I waited a few minutes and I could hear feet. I then heard shoes against the floor and I knew people were running out. So that’s when I stood up to leave. I didn’t know until I got outside that a bomb had exploded.”The death of the four girls devastated the nation. But it was not the last bombing in Birmingham. The lack of compassion was evident and signaled that those determined to keep the system of Jim Crow were not moved by the death of children.In the city and throughout the deep south, as civil rights activists worked to take down segregation, there were more deaths, more funerals, more marches and more protests. For McKinstry, 77, and other civil rights foot soldiers who fought on the frontlines for justice and equality during the civil rights movement, the re-election ofDonald Trumpis an undoing of the sacrifices and policy changes they toiled for.In the first weeks of Trump’s second term, hesigned an executive ordereliminating federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs – including initiatives for diversity in federal contracting or grants that help farmers and minority communities – and instructed that DEI staff be laid off. Shortly after, corporations such as Target, Walmart, Lowe’s and Meta followed suit in eliminating their DEI programs.Even the NFL capitulated to Trump’s DEI demands,ending its end zoneslogan “end racism” at this year’s Super Bowl and replacing it with “choose love”. The “end racism” slogan had been stenciled in the end zone at Super Bowl games since 2021.View image in fullscreen‘End racism’ and ‘choose love’ logos in the end zones.Photograph: Getty ImagesBut those who participated in the 1960s civil rights movement are not surprised by Trump’s executive orders or divisive policies. They have seen this before. As they fought against Jim Crow laws, these activists faced staunch segregationists who battled integration, including Eugene “Bull” Connor, Jim Clark and George Wallace in Alabama; Orval Faubus in Arkansas; Lester Maddox in Georgia; and Ross Barnett and other segregationists inMississippi.David Dennis Sr grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and later attended Dillard University, a historically Black college in New Orleans, on a scholarship. Dennis faced violent segregationists as a Freedom Rider and in Mississippi as a co-director of the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project. After civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were killed at the beginning ofFreedom Summer, Dennis’s fiery eulogy of Chaney expressed the exhaustion of fighting injustice.America is experiencing a “surge backwards” in terms of race, after decades of progress, Dennis said. An example of a “surge forward” was the Reconstruction era after the civil war, Dennis, 84, said. Then there was a “surge backwards” during the presidency of Rutherford B Hayes, in which troops that had protected the formerly enslaved were moved out and a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan followed. Dennis noted that Jim Crow laws were enacted and there was a conservative supreme court.View image in fullscreenDavid Dennis Sr pictured in Mississippi last year.Photograph: Rogelio V Solis/AP“If you look at that period of time, what happened then, and what’s happening now, this surge back, there’s quite a similarity of what happened politically and what the issues were then as it is right now,” Dennis said.There was another surge forward during the Eisenhower administration and with the civil rights movement, which saw the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Dennis said.That surge forward came with pain and tragedy during the height of the fight for racial equality and justice in America.Carlotta Walls LaNier experienced that pain. She still remembers the vitriol she and her classmates faced as they tried to integrate Central high school in Little Rock,Arkansas, on 23 September 1957.“I knew there would be people who did not agree with the idea that we were integrating or going to Little Rock Central high school. I knew there would be people not happy about us wanting to go to that school. I expected some upset and name-calling,” said Walls LaNier, who, at 14, was the youngest of the Little Rock Nine. “I did not expect what took place to happen.”Mayhem erupted as an angry white mob yelled racial epithets and threatened violence as the nine Black students attempted to enter the school. It was three years after the US supreme court declared that “separate but equal” schools were unconstitutional in the historic 1954 Brown v Board of Education case. But the angry mob that Walls LaNier and her classmates faced clung to the Jim Crow segregationist system in Little Rock.View image in fullscreenThe Little Rock Nine in 2005.Photograph: Danny Johnston/APWalls LaNier said President Dwight Eisenhower sent in the 101st airborne to protect the students. The Arkansas national guard remained with the students at the school for the rest of the school year. So when she saw the violence that occurred at the US Capitol on January 6, it reminded her of her experience in Little Rock more than six decades ago.“I think that if anyone who never lived through what we lived through and need to understand what it was like, they can look at January 6,” said Walls Lanier, 82. “I see the two being equal, 23 September 1957 and 6 January 2021.”For Dennis, the answer to the current chaotic political climate lies in the past. He remembers spending Sunday dinners listening to and learning from “elders”, those who were already working on civil rights.“I think that we need to go back to our roots,” Dennis said. “The movement really wasn’t about thousands of people in the streets. The thousands of people came in the street after somebody did something. We took an issue and we zeroed in on that particular issue, as a people, as a group moving,” Dennis said.“We didn’t try to solve everything at the same time. A few people would get together and they did something. People always ask me, ‘How do you get a movement started?’ I always go back to: you have to do something.”View image in fullscreenTroops from the 101st airborne escorting the Little Rock Nine to enter their school.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyThere is a current movement under way focused on boycotting companies abandoning their DEI commitments, including Target. Civil rights activists say that company made a commitment to invest $2bn in the Black community within five years following the 2020 death of George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. A video by a bystander showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly 10 minutes while he moaned in pain and called for his mother. Boycott leaders have taken a page from the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, in which Black residents didn’t ride the public bus for 385 days. The result was the dismantling of the segregated public transit system in the city.During his church service earlier this month, the Rev Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of the New Birth Missionary Baptist church, outside Atlanta, asked the “conscientious Christian community” to not shop at Target for 40 days, starting on 3 March.“What we learned from the Montgomery bus boycott is that racist America doesn’t respond to speeches. They respond to dollars,” said Bryant. “We are operating in decency and order. Do you know what it’s going to be for America when we start shifting our own economic ecosystem and start investing in ourselves? We are calling all stockholders to be held accountable to the commitment that you made to Black people.”Walls LaNier of the Little Rock Nine, who faced violent white mobs and racist taunts, said: “We’re going to have to relive this all over again.” She said that a new generation of leaders will need to strategize in a different way against what this new administration plans to do.View image in fullscreenBlack residents walk to work instead of riding the bus during the third month of the Montgomery bus boycott, in February 1956.Photograph: Don Cravens/Getty ImagesIt will take women to make the biggest change, Walls LaNier said. During the civil rights movement, the most active and vocal foot soldiers in the fight for equality and justice were women including Rosa Parks, Ella Baker, Dorothy Height, Constance Baker Motley and Fannie Lou Hamer. The Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett has become one of the strongest critics of President Trump and his administration. Republicans will have to stand up to the Trump regime, too, Walls LaNier added.“Unfortunately, there was a huge group of people of color who voted for [Trump], not understanding their history. They did not understand what their forefathers had given to this country and how things were being taken away from them. They will realize it very soon,” Walls LaNier said."

After 20 years of filming she thought she’d seen it all… Until she became a mother.Sun 2 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 07.04 ESTShareThe broadcaster Stacey Dooley gave birth to her daughter, Minnie, in January 2023. Though she has reported on women for almost two decades, she has been surprised by the transformations of motherhood. “I went into it so unprepared,” she says. “I cannot begin to tell you.” Like other soon-to-be parents, Dooley decided against attending antenatal classes and rejected manuals offered by friends. “You know, I used to see mums finding it tough and I’d think, ‘It can’t bethathard.’ I really used to think that. Which is fucking hilarious. I owe all of those women an apology.”Dooley and I are in a hotel café in Knightsbridge, west London, where she is later due to meet her accountant. She has written a book,Dear Minnie, in which she profiles women who have had different experiences of conception, pregnancy and labour. Dooley’s own pregnancy was comparatively straightforward: some sickness, a scheduled C-section, though “the sleep deprivation knocked me for six,” she says. “I’ve never in my life been that tired.” In the book, Dooley describes the first six months of Minnie’s life as an overwhelm of struggle and vulnerability. “My living room looked like a teenager’s bedroom,” she writes. Her partner, the dancerKevin Clifton, with whom Dooley was coupled during the 2018 series ofStrictly Come Dancing, was given two weeks of paternity leave before being hauled back to work. (Clifton is currently appearing in a UK tour ofChicago.) “I remember him leaving and shutting the front door and being like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?’” Dooley recalls. “And I felt envious. That he was going to be sleeping from 10pm to 8am. I remember feeling jealous of that.”Dooley describes Clifton as a “brilliant” father. “Everything he does is for her,” she says. But still, work as a performer is demanding and Dooley, though well-supported by her mother as well as Clifton’s parents, was sometimes alone, and taken aback by the cloud of worry that blew into her home. “I’m fairly level-headed,” she says. “My natural default is relatively chill. I like to think I can take things on the chin. But Minnie is my Achilles heel.” Once, when she was a baby, Minnie contracted bronchiolitis, a common lung infection in children, and Dooley took her to hospital. “I had all the nurses saying, ‘This is completely normal, it’s bronchi season, it’s fine!’” She raises her eyebrows. “It’s difficult not to catastrophise.”Dooley seems slightly surprised by what has become of her life. “I hadn’t taken into consideration how vulnerable I’d feel. And you’re madly in love with this person. And it’s a love you don’t recognise.” At one point, she reaches for her phone to share a picture of Minnie, who sits bright-eyed, with tight red curls, on Dooley’s bed. “Here’s something I didn’t think would happen,” she goes on. “She’s made me love everyone.”This is surprising. Dooley is known in the television industry to be determinedly hard working and unapologetic about what she wants. A force. “I’ve always tried to behave well,” she tells me, but prior to becoming a mother “it wasn’t the priority.” A friend of mine who once met with Dooley professionally remarked on the ferocity of her ambition and found her difficult to warm to. (“I wonder how much she is a character of herself,” my friend said.) “So much of my identity was wrapped up in what I did for a living,” Dooley says. The work, it was clear, came first.View image in fullscreenPresenting ‘Stacey Dooley: Inside The Undertakers’ in 2023.Photograph: BBC/Firecracker FilmsStill, people change. Dooley describes motherhood as providing her with “a sense of purpose you didn’t have before”. Asked whether her work offered purpose, she replies, “I feel proud. It gave people a platform. It highlighted some important points,” but “I wasn’t radically changing things.” (She adds, “What else was I doing? Nothing.”) Dooley believes that “the priority now is trying to be a really fucking good mum,” and that “work is important, but it’s work”.Throughout our conversation she is informal, friendly and earnest, though she often recoils at her newfound earnestness, as if embarrassed. I sense it has been unusual for her to discuss her own feelings so gushingly, but she cannot help but go on. When I first ask Minnie’s age, she replies, “Two,” before adding, winkingly, “and obviously she’s the brightest, cleverest, most advanced two-year-old you’ve ever met.” Later she says, “I know this is annoying, Alex. I’m not unaware of how annoying this is. But her speech is just…” She mimics the awe of proud parents everywhere. “The shit she comes out with.”InDear Minnie, Dooley describes herself as her daughter’s “mum/assistant/slave”. When I bring this up she nods and says, “I’ve spent my whole life assuring everyone that I’m a strong woman. That I’m independent. That I won’t let anyone take the piss. Apart from my own child.”I’ve always tried to behave well, but it wasn’t the priorityDooley grew up working class in Luton. For a while it was just Dooley and her mother. Her father battled alcohol abuse and was “not around,” she says. He died when she was in her 20s. Dooley’s mother held several jobs, but there was struggle. “She would get money at the start of every week and during the last few days things would become tough.” She often used spare time to clean the homes of her friends and Dooley would eat dinner alone. (She once described her childhood diet as consisting of “the three Ps: Pop Tarts, Peperami, Pot Noodle.”) Still Dooley recalls being “really very happy” and feeling “incredibly loved”. Dooley’s mother was from Liverpool. Her grandmother was a publican – people called her Crazy Haze – in the north of England and visited when she could. For two weeks after Dooley’s birth, her mother looked after her baby alone. “I think she had a friend there when I was born,” Dooley says. “But people have their own lives, they’ve got their work, they’ve got their families.” Dooley has “no idea” how she did it.”.While Dooley was growing up, her mother encouraged her to “stand up for yourself, work hard, look after people,” Dooley recalls. It is a mantra by which she stands and one she will pass on to Minnie, who is already “very bossy, very loud, very confident”. (“I would hate for her to lose that,” Dooley says, before joking, “I’m a raging narcissist. I want my child to be just like me!”) When I ask if her own experience of motherhood has changed the way she thinks about her mother, she responds, “It has, which is annoying.”“Why is it annoying?” I ask.“Well, you know what it’s like, mums can be a pain in the arse.”Dooley and her mother are extremely similar, she says. “If we spend too long together we do each other’s heads in. And Minnie is a carbon copy of me.”I ask what Clifton is like.View image in fullscreen‘Socially he can’t dance. Unless he’s got some Latin choreography’: Kevin Clifton and Stacey Dooley on Strictly Come Dancing, 2018.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA“Kev’s very reserved,” she says. “As a performer – on stage, on Strictly – he’s sort of outrageous. It’s a very camp kind of… Ta-da! But as a man he’s shy, he’s unassuming, he doesn’t talk much in social situations.” If he and Dooley were at a wedding, she says, Clifton would avoid the dancefloor. “Socially he can’t dance. Unless he’s got some Latin choreography.”Dooley and Clifton live in Liverpool, close to her mother and not far from his parents. (At once point, Dooley considered naming her daughter Cilla, “but I was like, it might be a bit on the nose, if she’s got red hair and she’s living in Liverpool”.) They are a long way from Luton now. Still, Dooley’s early life has been well documented and the stories have helped form the public impression that she is a working-class girl done good, which is not far from the truth. Dooley first appeared on TV as a contributor on the 2008 documentaryBlood, Sweat and T-shirts, in which she and several other Brits travelled to India to navigate the sweatshop experience. Dooley was 20, a bit green, but unafraid to speak her mind, which encouraged BBC Three’s incumbent controller, Danny Cohen, to finance her own series. “It was all very accidental,” she says of her career. “I’d left school at 15. I was from Luton. I didn’t have an uncle at the Beeb.” But the series,Stacey Dooley Investigates, in which she reported on current-affair issues around the world, was well received. “I did end up in some sketchy areas,” she says, “and that sort of schtick became my USP.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d left school at 15. I was from Luton. I didn’t have an uncle at the Beeb’: Dooley (far right) campaigning against sweatshops in 2009.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyTo many, Dooley’s closest contemporary in the scope of their interests is the broadcasterLouis Theroux, who is 17 years Dooley’s senior. Theroux is known for probing subjects from behind a self-deprecating front that disguises intellectual rigour. Though she left school early and without qualifications, Dooley’s intellectual brio is equivalent to Theroux’s and many of her documentaries have been similarly revelatory. (She has made more than 70 films for the BBC.) She exists in the public imagination as a kind of go-getter, but is also commonly described as too emotionally involved with her interviewees – an unfair, sexist trope – and, though in 2018 she received an MBE for services to broadcasting, her work has been deemed lesser as a result.This is unfair, of course, and it has to do with both sexism and classism. (I wonder if a male documentarian would have been encouraged to write a book on parenthood after having children?) And yet Dooley’s audience continues to want more and the BBC remains an enthusiastic employer. In an email,Nasfim Haque, the current Head of Content at BBC Three, described Dooley as “a rare and relevant voice in the documentary landscape”, and that her “authenticity resonates, especially among young audiences who crave truth”.I suspect Dooley would flinch at the use of the word “authenticity”. Throughout our conversation, she finds it hard to use professional buzzwords – “organic”, “the journey” – without a self-deprecating flourish of irony. When I ask why she struggles, she shrugs.Other people feel confident saying these words, I tell her. “Maybe I feel a bit daftsaying them.” It is agreed that although she is fluent in the language of the professional world, it is not her “mother tongue”.The way Dooleydescribes her earliest films feels to me as if the BBC were conducting an experiment: what would happen if we dropped a young, plain-speaking girl into a hostile environment and filmed the results? I ask if she ever thought her early BBC series were exploitative.View image in fullscreenDooley with Hajja Ganna, a woman looking for her son, on ‘Stacey Dooley Investigates: Nigeria’s Female Suicide Bombers’ in 2009.Photograph: BBC“I’m not saying this just to toe the party line,” she says. “But it never felt voyeuristic. It never felt like they were taking advantage.” And things have moved on. “When I started, most of my colleagues were privately educated. Most of them lived in London. Most of them were middle-aged. Most of them were men. But there are more girls on the crew now. More girls shooting. More female execs.”In the beginning, Dooley felt the need to prove herself. “When I first started doing current affairs-based issues, there was a bit of head-scratching. Like, who is this 20-year-old from Luton with no qualifications? Why has she been given two BBC commissions? So I think I was always trying to convince people that it was justified, that it was well-received, that there was an appetite for that kind of filmmaking.” She continues, “You’ve got high-brow, middle-aged, middle-class men writing opinion pieces on you. And sometimes they were considerate and generous and other times they weren’t. So, of course, when you’re in your 20s, you’re thinking, ‘Oh, there’s this one guy who works in the City who doesn’t get me.’ And that’s really important to you at that moment – which is hilarious now, because I promise you, hands on my heart, I couldn’t care less.”Dooley’s career has not been without controversy. In 2019, the Labour MP David Lammy accused her of promoting an image of “her as heroine and black child as victim” while Dooley was in Uganda to film a documentary for Comic Relief. (She was later labelled a “white saviour”.) I ask if she’s considered what it will be like when Minnie grows up and reads about her. “There will be a time when she goes back and reads things about her mum. And some people will have called her a moron, thought she was completely useless and really weren’t into her at all. Which is totally fair enough. But, hopefully, she’ll be robust enough to recognise that that’s just somebody’s opinion. And they’re entitled to that. And it doesn’t actually mean that much.”Though Dooley now considers work secondary to motherhood, she continues to work remarkably hard. Since Minnie’s birth, she has written a book, finished several BBC documentaries and performed in a West End play. During the first year of Minnie’s life, while the baby was still being breastfed, she travelled to work with her. (Once, when Minnie was young, Dooley stayed overnight in a Nevada brothel while Minnie and Clifton slept in a trailer outside.) Still, she hasn’t entered a hostile situation since becoming a mother and she finds it difficult to be away from home for more and a single night. “I need to try to be around for as long as possible,” she says. “And on a very boring, logistical level, I need to be home more. Minnie’s got football on a Saturday.”View image in fullscreen‘Having my daughter has made me love everyone’: Stacey Dooley wears jumper bymadeleine-thompson.com; jeans bymotherdenim.com; hoops byastridandmiyu.com.Photograph: Kristina Varaksina/The ObserverI wonder if she has considered what might make things easier for working mothers?“That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it,” she says. “There needs to be flexibility, obviously. People need to appreciate that mothers are mothers first and foremost. And if you trust them, they’ll continue to do a brilliant job because, wrongly, they’ll feel like they have to overcompensate, because you’ve allowed them to be a mum.” After a pause she adds, “Childcare in this country is a joke. The cost is crippling. Which means amazing women go off and have a baby and can’t come back.”“What’s the answer?” I say.“That’s for Keir Starmer to sort out. That’s for the Houses of Parliament. Don’t askme, Alex.”Towards the end of our conversation, I ask what Dooley pictures in her future.“Personally or professionally?” she asks.“Both,” I say.“I would like to have more children,” she says. “But it’s not a given, is it.”InDear Minnie, Dooley shares regret at not having a family earlier.“If I’d started sooner, I could have had more,” she says now. “I might have had two, or three or four. But you have to be realistic about these things. Like, biologically.” Dooley turns 38 this month. “I did everything I needed to in my 20s. I had an amazing decade of prioritising myself. All of that freedom. But, actually, I think I should have… I didn’t know I’d feel like this.”In the book she writes how she never felt maternal. “Other mums were always destined to be mums. They knew. It was non-negotiable for them. But I didn’t have that thought.”I ask what Clifton, who is 42, thinks about having four children.“He’s up for it,” Dooley says.“Because he’s touring,” I say.“Exactly,” she says. “He’s got those 10pm to 8am sleep shifts.”Dear Minnie by Stacey Dooley is published by BBC Books at £22 and is out on 13 March.

Starmer channelled the giants of British history (everyone we’re not embarrassed of; basically, Winston Churchill) on Sunday. He said we were at a “crossroads in history”.He used the phrase “we are gathered here today”, which I suppose was literally true, as they were, but also had a strange church-y overtone, as if he were trying to borrow the actual authority of God, and he explicitly yoked together the peace and security ofUkrainewith that of everyone – all of Europe, but also “us” – Justin Trudeau was there, so presumably Canada’s, too. Pictures of him hugging Zelenskyy ahead were almost tear-jerkingly sincere.He was then asked by journalists following Saturday afternoon’s statement – who came at the question from many directions – whether he considered the US to be inside or outside hisplan for a durable peace, and he was trenchant.“Europe and the US have to stand together and that position must be strong”; “I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally”. It was an absolute head-scratcher – because the US does not seek a sovereign Ukraine, safe in perpetuity from Russian aggression.Donald Trump and JD Vance showed the world what they think of this war on Friday, and they are in an opposite world, Zelenskyy is the one risking the lives of ordinary people, and the war is for him to end – while giving up his nation’s mineral rights to the US and thanking them for the privilege.That meeting in the White House was easily the most gruesome display of bullying and manipulation that televised geopolitics has ever put on. Soin what worlddoes the guy you just hugged get to walk away proud and sovereign, with US backing? In what conceivable world is Trump on the same team as these assembled leaders?Starmer was under considerable pressure in his short speech, which we have to hope was just because history had its eyes on him, and not because he’s overwhelmed by the weight of his own contradictions.Words were mangled into non-words, “step” became “stet”, “presume” got funked with “preserve”. And yet, his lawyerly clarity remained. He had five points, they were all different, they all made sense, he said them all in the right order.“We will keep the military aid flowing … to strengthen Ukraine now,” he said, adding that the £2.2bn loan to Zelenskyy would come from frozen Russian assets, and the £1.6bn of UK export finance would be channelled straight back into the UK economy via the air defence industry in Belfast.“Any lasting peace,” he continued, “must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be at the table”. It’s a simple and defensible point, but it also goes head to head against Trump, who has argued throughout that all it’ll take for a peace deal is him, Putin, a copy of The Art of the Deal and a box of cigars.Third, “in the event of a peace deal, we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities”, Starmer said, which, again, sounds fair enough and yet at the same time runs directly counter to any of the noises coming out of Washington.Fourth, he will assemble “acoalition of the willing, to defend a deal in Ukraine. Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back.” Here’s the kicker: “this effort must have US backing”.Well, OK, but who on earth would assume that backing? And what would it cost? Do we have to watch Zelenskyy get beaten up live on air, for the US to fall in with the crowd but still feel like it won?Peter Mandelson had told ABC News earlier that “President Zelenskyy [must give] his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine,” and seriously, all we can do in the face of that counter-messaging is hope that Mandelson’s forgotten he’s the UK’s diplomat to the US and thinks he’s just a guy on a podcast.Starmer’s fifth point was a bit muddled: “Leaders must meet again very soon. We are at a crossroads in history today. This is not a moment for more talk.” What are they going to do at the meeting, if not talk more? Never mind. Don’t pick holes. We need to believe there’s a grand plan behind all this, because the alternative is just horrendous.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

By the time 2001’s MahoganySoulmade her a star, she’d logged two decades in the game, starting out in pioneering all-girl rap trio the Sequence, before passing through went-nowhere R&B groups like Devox and Vertical Hold and writing and singing with other artists (including D’Angelo, her former lover and father of their son, Michael). Once Clive Davis’s Arista Records signed her in 1999, those years of experience set her apart from the neo-soul pack, having worn a powerful grain into her rich, agile voice, and steeping her music in soul’s deep history.Her debut for Arista, Black Diamond, retooled lush 70s soul for the new century: Green Grass Vapors – a love song to the sweet leaf with Stone “higher than the Thunder Dome” – was from the same funky swamp as D’Angelo’s Chicken Grease, its smouldering guitar like a moaning panther. A remarkable reading of Marvin Gaye’s Trouble Man, meanwhile, mastered the track’s breathless, staccato chorus without breaking a sweat, channelling Gaye’s existential agonies with every holler to an oblivious lord.But it was Mahogany Soul – her first for Davis’s new label, J Records – that announced Stone’s true arrival. It opened with Soul Insurance, backing singers bending the hook to Lady Marmalade around Stone like armour as she delivered a fearsome rap like Caught Up-era Millie Jackson, hard and wise but with a heart ready to get broken again. The 75-minute epic celebrated good men (Brotha) and spiritual forebears (If It Wasn’t), and served up gritty memories of her years of pre-fame struggle (20 Dollars); More Than a Woman was a wonderfully sinful slow-jam with Calvin Richardson. But the album soared highest when Stone skimmed the painful depths of love – What U Dyin’ For? sought to liberate good women from bad men, while her signature anthem Wish I Didn’t Miss You, repurposed O’Jays’ Backstabbers to deliver a new classic rumination on love’s eternal sting.Stone was now a contemporary of the neo-soul uprising led by friends and collaborators D’Angelo, Erykah Badu and Musiq Soulchild, but her age and experience gifted her music a superior weight and authority. Follow-up Stone Love opened with an a cappella riff on the Supremes’ titular hit and then quickly revisited the boudoir where Mahogany Soul’s charmed break-ups and make-ups occurred (on Stay for a While, a delectably slow-burn suite of longing and lust, Stone got carnal with Anthony Hamilton over molasses-sweet swing). Elsewhere, Stone’s classic sensibility negotiated the new era – Lovers’ Ghetto lifted the same Dynasty sample Camp Lo rode for their cult hit Luchini (This Is It), while the joyous I Wanna Thank Ya paired Stone with Snoop Dogg.Stone relocated to the reborn Stax Records for 2007’s The Art of Love and War, a perfect home for an artist so steeped in soul and funk’s 70s glory days. The album offered killer duets with legends Betty Wright (on Baby, a storming repudiation of a man who’s left his former lover behind now he’s hit the big time) and James Ingram (My People, a lithe update of Stevie Wonder’s Black Man). It was Stone’s highest-charting LP, but her next, 2009’s Unexpected, stumbled. If Stone sounded uncharacteristically disengaged throughout its upbeat bangers, she probably was; her father had died shortly before production began.Unexpected didn’t trouble the Billboard 100, and Angie exited Stax to find herself adrift in a disrupted industry. But while the albums that followed never matched Mahogany Soul’s triumphs, the deep cuts were golden. Forget About Me, from 2015’s Dream, evoked D’Angelo’s offset groove while taking potshots at her former lover. Full Circle in 2019 served up Dinosaur, a squelchy swamp of dark funk wondering “where did the good ones go? They’re on the verge of extinction”, and Grits, where Stone played a frank sex therapist: “You call it smashin’/ What about passion?”; “Tell that boy to stir like grits / circular motion / nice and slow”. Meanwhile 2023’s Love Language peaked with The Gym, a final, beautiful duet with longtime foil Musiq Soulchild. In these moments, you can hear the glory of Mahogany Soul echoing, the promise of further brilliance. And it’s a compounding tragedy that last night’s terrible accident has deprived us of any more of Stone’s magic.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Given that the air fryer market is so crowded, it’s worth seeking out the best style for your needs – whether that’s for the simple pleasures of homemade chips or to really shake up your meals.At a glanceBest air fryer overall:Tefal Dual Easy Fry XXL EY942BG0£149.99 at AmazonBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryer£89.99 at LakelandBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryer£179.99 at John LewisBest air fryergrill:ProCook air fryer health grill£179 at ProCookBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryer£214.21 at AmazonWhy you should trust meWhile air fryers have made the transition from novelty to must-have in recent years, there’s been one in my kitchen for well over a decade, and it’s in daily use. I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 45).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 5kg of potatoes.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 5kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips are scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The nine machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£200 at Argos£149.99 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneeringActifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-yearrepairabilitycommitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp. Onion rings emerged beautifully browned, they were the best of the lot.It’s a shame that …most buttons are icons – my pet hate – making it a challenge to program without the instructions to hand.Size:38.5 x 45.8cm x 33 (WDH)Capacity:11 litresPower draw:1.154kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, chicken, vegetables, fish, dessert, dehydration and manualThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade meals, tried and testedRead moreBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that …its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size:27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresPower draw:0.674kWh = 16p an hourDishwasher safe:no, hand-wash onlyPrograms:fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£179.99 at John Lewis£189.99 at CurrysOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well-built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that …if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size:49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity:9 litresPower draw:0.79kWh = 19p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatBest air fryer grill:ProCook Air Fryer Health GrillView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£179 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s Air Fryer Health Grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that …I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue and you will need to use it.Size:40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity:4.5 litresPower draw:0.83kWh = 20p an hourDishwasher safe:no (basket and pot)Programs:air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£249.99 at Argos£219.99 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that …its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size:28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity:9.5 litresPower draw:1.049kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe:yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms:air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the 8-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size:36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH);capacity:8 litres;power draw:0.912kWh = 22p an hour;dishwasher safe:no;programs:manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesInstant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£136 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonBest for:confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos. I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen, and it was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because …the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size:31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity:8.5 litres;power draw:1.187kWh = 29p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatRussell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£125 at Argos£67.95 at AmazonBest for:small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size:37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH);capacity:5.5 litres;power draw:0.550kWh = 13p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry,bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.The best pans for every type of cooking – chosen by chefsRead moreFor those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust non-stick coatings will make degreasing easier.How do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and non-stick coatings containing PFAS/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of non-stick (which may use PFAS as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen attemperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of non-stick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature when oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.Rachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she is much less successful at repacking.

TheAmazon pagefor Alexander C Karp and Nicholas W Zamiska’s new book,The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West, also lists: a “workbook” containing “key takeaways” from the volume; a second volume on how the Karp/Zamiska tome “can help you navigate life”; and a third offering another “workbook” comprising a “Master Plan for Navigating Digital Age and the Future of Society”. It is conceivable that these parasitical works were written by humans, but I wouldn’t bet on it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Mr Karp, the lead author of the big book, is an interesting guy. He has a BA in philosophy from an American liberal arts college, a law degree from Stanford and a PhD in neoclassical social theory from Goethe University in Frankfurt. So he’s not your average geek. And yet he’s an object of obsessive interest to people both inside and outside the tech industry. Why? Because in 2003 he – together with Peter Thiel and three others – founded a secretive tech company called Palantir. And some of the initial funding came from the investment arm of – wait for it – the CIA!The name comes frompalantíri, the “seeing stones” in the Tolkien fantasies. It makes sense because the USP of Palantir is its machine-learning technology – which is apparently very good at seeing patterns in, and extracting predictions from, oceans of data. The company was founded because at the time all theSilicon Valleytech companies either disapproved of government, or were staffed by engineers who were adamantly opposed to working for the US military. This created an opening that Karp and his colleagues astutely exploited to build a company which is simultaneously appears to be booming (current market capitalisation: $200bn), while also being regarded by critics of the industry as the spawn of the devil.Those critics will disdainfully read the book as a kind of extended tender for public sector contracts. Civil servants contemplating employing Palantir may be interested in the description of the approach its employees adopt when working in a client’s organisation. Interestingly, it’s an approach borrowed from a Toyota executive, Taiichi Ohno, as a way of getting to the root cause of a problem occurring in some part of an organisation’s operations. It’s called the “Five Whys”: ask why a problem occurred, and then ask why four more times.View image in fullscreenA still from the short newsreel film Atomic Power, in which Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard recreate the day in 1939 they drafted a letter to President Roosevelt warning him that work on the atom bomb was imperative.Photograph: Leo Szilard Papers. MSS 32. Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego Library“Why did an essential update to an enterprise software platform not ship by a Friday deadline?” the co-authors write. “Because the team had only two days to review the draft code. Why did they only have two days to review? Because it had lost six software engineers in the budget review cycle late last year. Why did its budget decrease? Because the head of the group had shifted priorities elsewhere at the request of another group lead. Why was the request made to shift priorities? Because a new compensation model had been rolled out incentivising growth in certain areas. Why were certain areas selected at the expanse of others? Because of an ongoing feud at the company between two senior executives.” You get the idea. It’s not rocket science. Or AI, come to that. Maybe Keir Starmer should try it out. And it’ll be cheaper than employing McKinsey.Silicon Valley was built on a technological foundation that was laid by the state, and yet its beneficiaries have nothing but contempt for governmentBut I digress. The argument of the book is suffused with indignation at what Karp sees as the arrogance and small-mindedness of Silicon Valley, which has collected the greatest concentration of engineering skill the world has ever seen – and then deployed it to create consumer toys and diversions that make tech founders insanely rich rather than using that talent to create technologies that would buttress the national welfare and security of the United States. What’s particularly galling to him is the fact that the wealth of Silicon Valley was built on a technological foundation that was laid – and paid for – by the state, and yet its beneficiaries appear to have nothing but contempt for government. They have prioritised consumer gratification and their own wealth-creation over everything else.“The grandiose rallying cry of generations of founders in Silicon Valley was simply to build,” write Karp and Zamiska. “Few asked what needed to be built, and why. For decades, we have taken this focus – and indeed obsession in many cases – by the technology industry on consumer culture for granted, hardly questioning the direction, and we think misdirection, of capital and talent to the trivial and ephemeral. Much of what passes for innovation today, of what attracts enormous amounts of talent and funding, will be forgotten before the decade is out.”Underpinning much of the book’s lamentations are two enduring themes. The first is a kind of nostalgic longing for the wartime and postwar collaboration between the American state and the scientists and engineers which made the US a technological colossus. For Karp, as for many other thinkers like him (including the UK’s own Dominic Cummings), the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb looks like a lost nirvana.The second theme is a chronicle of what the authors call “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”: the abandonment of belief, the agnosticism of technology, the “assumption that the correctness of one’s views from a moral or ethical perspective precludes the need to engage with the more distasteful and fundamental question of relative power with respect to a geopolitical opponent, and specifically which party has a superior ability to inflict harm on the other. The wishfulness of the current moment and many of its political leaders may in the end be their undoing.” This is the “soft belief” of the book’s subtitle, and it’s why this section of the book sometimes evokes echoes of the conservative philosopherAllan Bloomon song.View image in fullscreenPalantir co-founder and author Alex Karp.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThere’s a lot of hegemonic anxiety in Karp’s musings. For him, American primacy is the key to the survival of the civilisational values that he reveres. He’s also a disciple of the Nobel laureate economistThomas Schelling, and shares his view that “to be coercive, violence has to be anticipated… The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy – vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.”But the power to hurt is a prerogative of “hard” (ie military) power, and Karp seems particularly incensed by what he sees as the “precious” reservations of Google employees about the possibility that their technologies might be put into military hands. (It may also have been one of the motivations for the founding of Palantir.) His irritation seems unduly harsh to me. All of these employees (and their parents and grandparents) have lived through an era in which the idea that the United States might again be involved in an all-out war seemed as preposterous as the idea that their inventions might be used in battle. In that sense, the west has been on an 80-year-long holiday from history, from which Putin has rudely awoken us.The lesson that Karp and his co-author draw from all this is that “a more intimate collaboration between the state and the technology sector, and a closer alignment of vision between the two, will be required if the United States and its allies are to maintain an advantage that will constrain our adversaries over the longer term. The preconditions for a durable peace often come only from a credible threat of war.” Or, to put it more dramatically, maybe the arrival of AI makes this our “Oppenheimer moment”.For some critics, the reconceptualisation of AI as technology for national security will seem like an unmitigated disasterIn the summer of 1939, Albert Einstein and Leo Szilardsent a letterto President Roosevelt, urging him to explore the construction of an atomic bomb – and quickly. The rapid advances in the technology, the two scientists wrote, “seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the administration”, as well as as a sustained partnership with “permanent contact maintained between the administration” and physicists.In that historical context, maybe the arrival of this book is timely. For those of us who have for decades been critical of tech companies, and who thought that the future for liberal democracy required that they be brought under democratic control, it’s an unsettling moment. If the AI technology that giant corporations largely own and control becomes an essential part of the national security apparatus, what happens to our concerns about fairness, diversity, equity and justice as these technologies are also deployed in “civilian” life? For some campaigners and critics, the reconceptualisation of AI as essential technology for national security will seem like an unmitigated disaster – Big Brother on steroids, with resistance being futile, if not criminal.On the other hand, some of the west’s adversaries (Russia, China) are already using this technology against us, and we urgently need to tool up to address the threat. When these thoughts were put to Mr Karp by aNew York Timesreporter, he replied: “I think a lot of the issues come back to: ‘Are we in a dangerous world where you have to invest in these things?’ And I come down to yes. All these technologies are dangerous. The only solution to stop AI abuse is to use AI.” Hobson’s choice, in other words.The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the Westis published by The Bodley Head (£25).

She is dancing on her seat to Europe’s The Final Countdown. With her arms in the air, she is bellowing out the words and, indeed, the synth riff. It is 8pm. The woman is me.Around me, everyone is doing exactly the same. To my right, a woman in full chicken costume is flapping her wings. To the left, a beautiful dark-haired girl, with the look of an Italian Dolce & Gabbana model at her rich husband’s funeral, is up with her crew, screeching, waving a glass of something sticky and deadly. I look around. I can’t see anybody – not a single person in the room – who isn’t singing along and dancing on the benches.A man tells me he’s here as Marty McFly from Back to the Future, but in truth he’s a ringer for Alan TitchmarshJust minutes ago, this space – enormous shipping containers fitted out with bar, stage and state-of-the-art sound system – was full, but not mad. People were politely queueing to get drinks, chatting in groups, bustling to the loos in twos and threes. The women are in leopard-print jeans and black lace tops, the neatly clippered men are in head-to-toe black – not tracksuited, but almost. Tonight is an 80s night, so there are a lot of costumes. A man tells me he’s here as Marty McFly fromBack to the Future, though, in truth, he’s a ringer for Alan Titchmarsh. A young lad is sporting the full Freddie Mercury: yellow buckled Band Aid jacket, white jeans, vest, muzzy.The girls on my table have come from north Wales. Ellie, Bethany, Leanne, Kathryn and Holly; it’s Kathryn and Holly’s birthdays. Their look is aerobic: neon turquoise and neon pink. Leanne is in a leotard, Bethany has Barbie earrings.

Clubbers at Bongo’s Bingo at the Content in Liverpool.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverWelcome to Bongo’s Bingo, the biggest of big nights out. We’re in music venue Content in Liverpool’s Baltic Triangle and we’re the second sold-out, 900 people-strong Bongo shift of the day, after the afternoon show. Created 10 years ago, there are now more than 40 Bongo’s Bingo shows across the country, on every single weekend, plus regular nights in Ibiza and Dubai – and even a three-night special in Williamsburg, New York. And, yes, despite appearances, it is definitely about the bingo.Our host, Jonny Bongo (real name, Jonathan Lacey), is on stage. A 38-year-old ex-chef from east Belfast, friendly and upbeat, he’s MC and DJ for the evening as well as the actual boss of everyone employed here. He introduces the onstage dancers, Slutty Susie and Horny Heidi. As you might have guessed, both are men: Cole Fraser and Callum Law. “Hype men, rather than professional dancers,” Jonny informs me later. “You don’t want them to be too good, or everyone will be watching them rather than playing the game.” Susie and Heidi go for saucy groin-pointing, mild twerking, a bit of what we might call nipple work. Usually, Fraser wears a short princess dress as Susie. But as it’s 80s night, he and Heidi are in running shorts, legwarmers and crop tops, plus their usual blond wigs. At one point, Susie is required to do a mild striptease to I Wanna Make Love to You. Unused to his shorts, Fraser gets them all tangled up in his legwarmers. The crowd doesn’t care. They go bananas.Clubbing in the UK is dying. In December 2024, Britain had 2,264 nightclubs, late-night bars and casinos – 25.2% fewer than in March 2020. Nightclubs have borne the brunt of closures: their numbers have dropped 33.2% since Covid. I talk to one of Bongo’s bouncers, John, who’s been on doors in Liverpool since 1988 and did all the big clubs such as Cream. His theory is that the clubbing scene that he and I remember happened because, in the early 90s, “there was nothing else”, he says. “Pubs shut at 11, [old-school] clubs had door policies [no trainers], everything was done by 2am. So people set up their own nights.” Now every bar is like a club and nights out aren’t created by local people, but corporations.There are other factors, too. First, young people, including students, aren’t so bothered about drinking for the sake of it (though there’s certainly a lot of alcohol consumed tonight). They’re more health-conscious and, of course, more worried about money, so they booze less. Second, they want to be home earlier. The rise in day raves isn’t just due to oldies wanting to get back before the heating switches off; late-night transport is unreliable (or nonexistent) and people like to make the most of their next day, too. And third, they’re up for doing something proper with their night out. The biggest rise in evening entertainment is in “competitive socialising”: theme bars where you spend your night playing golf, cricket, ping pong, football – or just chuck yourself in a ball pit like a toddler. Or combination events: a brunch with drag acts plus drum’n’bass DJ; an evening mixing cocktails in an immersive (fake) new world. Escape rooms are popular, as are spins on household names such as Cluedo orThe Cube. My friends recently went on aTaskmasternight out. (It wasn’t much cop.)People want an evening that looks good on Instagram, that’s a memorable event – a big experience rather than a quiet night talking nonsense in the pub. A guaranteed good time, with an atmosphere that’s there for the taking. Somewhere where you walk in and everything’s already buzzing, rather than a club where the vibe – the actual essence of the whole night – depends on you. Like a kids’ birthday party: entertainment, food, drink, takeaway plastic presents and all over (bar the tantrums) in three hours.Before the show, I talk to sisters Sharon and Sue – the first in the queue outside – who have been there since 5pm. They come to Bongo’s Bingo every three months and they like to arrive early so they can get to their preferred seats: end of the row, near the toilets and the bar, not too close to the stage. “You don’t want the dancers’ sweat all over you,” says Sue. They’ve been to various themed versions of Bongo’s Bingo. “I like the cowboy ones,” says Sharon. “All the men are in Stetsons and the dancing is great.”Sharon and Sue also go to “proper” bingo nights with their mum at Mecca, which they enjoy. “It’s much more serious, though,” says Sharon. “We get told off for laughing.” It costs more, they say: they spend about £50 at Mecca, including a meal. But at Bongo’s Bingo, it’s just £25 for the entrance fee and the bingo book, and they buy drinks as and when they want them.View image in fullscreen‘A young lad is sporting the full Freddie Mercury’: a clubber at Bongo’s Bingo 80s music theme night in Liverpool.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“There’s bigger prizes at Mecca – I won £1,500 one time,” says Sue. “You can win money here but it’s not so much,” says Sharon. “It’s about the other prizes. I really, really want to win the unicorn!”The big fluffy pink unicorn, along with packets of Coco Pops, a disco-ball helmet and a pink Henry vacuum cleaner, is the classic Bongo’s Bingo prize. “I got my photo taken with the girl who won the unicorn last time,” says Sharon. “But tonight’s gonna be my night!” She punches the air.“Also,” she says, “I think they gas us.”What?“They pump something into the air that makes everyone get up dancing and going crazy.”To be clear, Bongo’s Bingo does not “gas” anyone. What the show does, though, is clearly provide a way of behaving. We are told what to do, and when, from start to finish. It’s like being at primary school, or a Hiit class. When to stand up, when to sit down, how to play the bingo, when to go to the bar. A friend who’s been to a Bongo’s Bingo in London says that what she likes about it is that, if you’re socially awkward, you don’t have to make small talk. You’re too busy doing things. Obviously, things get a little looser (drunker) as the night goes on, but on stage, Jonny runs a tight ship.Before the bingo starts (there are three sessions of a few games each), he tells us all how to play. Not just when to shout “bingo” (one row, two rows, full house), but also what to do when he calls out certain numbers. If No 1 is called, there’s a quick blast of Blondie’s The Tide Is High. Anything involving the No 8 means we all have to repeat it in Jonny’s Northern Irish accent (“ay-ut”). No 6 means we shout “Oi, oi, cheeky, cheeky” and do the macarena. Sixty-nine gets “a meal for two and the view is fine”, nothing more. But when 33 – “turty-tree” – is called, Jonny plays an Irish song and everyone dances. Up we get to C’est La Vie by B*Witched and the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York, during which the girls and I descend from the table, put our arms around each other and do the cancan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every winner dances about with their prize: one woman from Widnes gamely bounces on a space hopper across the stage. There’s a hen-and-stag-night vibe, obviously, but as the crowd is about 75% women, the atmosphere isn’t confrontational, but almost family-like. At one point, I see a bouncer gaze intently at a group of people and then move swiftly over. But it’s only because they’re about to lift up one of the girls in the air, like Baby inDirty Dancing. He’s there in case they drop her.Backstage, where I go to talk to Jonny, is full of young men, benign and congenial. I meet the brother of Everton and England goalie Jordan Pickford. He’s from Newcastle and, yes, Bongo Bingo is in that city too, he tells me, at the Boiler Room. He likes it better in Liverpool, though: “It’s so friendly.”Jonny came to Liverpool when he was 19, as his then girlfriend had got into the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. He loved the city, went down to London for a couple of years to manage bars there and then returned. In 2010, he set up Jonny Bongo’s pub quiz.“I loved pub quizzes but it can be a bit stale – the same people going, the same teams winning,” he says. “So I came up with my own format. Mad bonus rounds, a dance-off between the two top teams, silly questions like: ‘Which is the better flavour of Viennetta, mint or original?’”Mint, obviously.“No, it’s original,” he says. “There were some arguments about that. One bloke followed me out, going: ‘It’s mint, mate! It’s mint, mate!’”After five years, Jonny and his friend Joshua Burke thought about doing something else. They considered speed dating, but bingo was what they landed on, and Bongo’s Bingo was born. Jonny just substituted calling out quiz questions with calling out numbers and it was immediately massive: “Bingo is more accessible – anyone can play.”View image in fullscreenHost Jonny Bongo leads the revels at Bongo’s Bingo at the Content in Liverpool.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThere’s been ups and downs. The show’s popularity meant that other venues in other cities quickly came calling – Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds – and Jonny wanted to host the shows, so at one point he was doing five nights a week, up and down the country. That almost killed him, so he relinquished control and now there are 18 different Bongo show teams in the UK, with hosts and dancers, all trained.They don’t franchise the show, so everything about Bongo’s Bingo is run by Jonny and the company. Jonny came up with the show and has kept true to a lot of the original concepts. “Whatever’s put through on the door, we give away as prize money,” he says. “So tonight we’re giving away £4,000 to £5,000 worth of prizes.”The company fought a court case in 2019, when the original venue, Camp and Furnace – just down the road – claimed ownership of the concept. They won the case, left that venue and set up at Content. (Camp and Furnace has its own fun bingo now, I note, as I walk past: Bingo Lingo. There are plenty of other imitators out there.) And they kept growing. Now, they employ 120 people and the annual turnover is in the millions.Susie dresses up as the marshmallow man from Ghostbusters and does some hip-hop moves. There’s a late 80s/90s rave section, which I find quite strangeBack inside the hall, things are revving up. It’s 10.12pm. Kathryn is on the bingo books. She has five in front of her. We use small Argos-style red pens: the usual blob markers are no good at Bongo’s Bingo because, when things go mad, the ink goes everywhere.At some point we are showered in Coco Pops. At another, Susie dresses up as the marshmallow man fromGhostbustersand does some hip-hop moves. Alan Titchmarsh/Marty McFly gets on stage and throws shapes for quite some time. There’s a late 80s/90s rave section, which I find very strange: Blue Monday followed by Frankie Knuckles’s Your Love is hard for me to get my head around in this context. At Bongo’s Bingo, every track is on a cultural level: there’s no difference between the Beastie Boys’Intergalactic, Billie Joel’s Uptown Girl andDavid Guetta’s mix of Alphaville’s Forever Young. Everything is judged by whether you can bellow out the words while dancing.All at once, it’s 11pm. We’ve won nothing. We don’t care. The beautiful D&G girl has her head on the table. Her friend gets her up and out. Later, as I walk back to my hotel, I pass them on the bypass, near McDonald’s. “I don’t even know where I am!” shouts D&G. Ellie sends me a DM and some photos. She and Bethany carried on to Modo in the centre of Liverpool. “I can’t believe you did that whole night sober!” she writes. I think if I’d been drinking, I might have had a cardiac arrest.This week, on 7 March and 8 March, Bongo’s Bingo is celebrating its 10th anniversary with two huge shows – 3,500 people each night – at the Exhibition Centre in Liverpool. Simon and Lee from Blue are appearing, as are N-Trance and the Cheeky Girls. Over the past 10 years, Bongo’s Bingo has welcomed more than 5 million people and given out thousands and thousands of prizes. Honestly, I recommend it. It’s like an injection of sunshine, a dose of daftness – amiable, silly, fun. And all done and home – if you remember where you are – by midnight.Explore more on these topicsClubbingThe ObserverLiverpoolPop and rockPubsCoronavirusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Posed by modelsThe expertsHealth & wellbeingDon’t be afraid to cry – or to interrupt: doctors’ tips for making the most of your medical appointmentBe honest about your symptoms, voice your concerns, take notes, ask follow-up questions if you need to … GPs and surgeons explain how to make every minute countSarah PhillipsSun 2 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTShareWhen you go to see a doctor, it can be difficult to communicate your health concerns clearly, out of fear, embarrassment or a misunderstanding of medical jargon. How can you make the most of these appointments? From taking notes to bringing along a friend, and when to request a second opinion, doctors share their advice on how to access the best possible care.Be upfront about why you are thereIt is very common for people to go to the GP with a long list of things to talk about, says Dr Fari Ahmad, a general practitioner partner and GP trainer at Wilmslow health centre in Cheshire. If you make this clear at the start of your appointment, you can work out what the priority is together. Say: “There are three things that I want to talk to you about,” for example, and it gives you and the doctor a chance to decide which should be prioritised. “Sometimes all three could be discussed in 10 minutes, but sometimes there is only enough time to look at one in detail,” Ahmad says.Raise the most significant symptom first“Our brains have an anchoring bias, where we treat the first piece of information that is presented as the most important,” says Dr Faye Begeti, a neurology specialist at Oxford University hospitals. “So, if someone’s most important symptom is a headache, it is worth leading with that, rather than talking about a different symptom first. Obviously, all doctors are trained to recognise this, and we try to avoid it, but the thing that you mention first is the thing that they will tend to focus heavily on.”Above all, don’t leave your biggest concern until you are about to leave.The classic, Ahmad continues, “is someone saying as they are leaving: ‘Oh, by the way, I noticed blood in my poo. It’s nothing to worry about, is it?’ And I have to say, ‘Actually, come back,’ and then we go through the whole thing.”View image in fullscreenThe first symptom you mention may be the one that gets the most attention.Photograph: MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesTry not to be embarrassedAs hard as it may be, try to overcome any embarrassment you have in explaining your symptoms. “MostGPshave seen or heard everything,” says Ahmad. “I’ve been doing this job for 30 years, so I don’t find anything awkward. And actually, sometimes those embarrassing symptoms are really important to help me understand what is going on.”“Talking about sex is difficult but once you break that boundary, working out what your health needs are comes more easily,” says Prof Matt Phillips, a consultant in genitourinary medicine based in Cumbria and president of theBritish Association for Sexual Health and HIV. There is a range of treatment options for STIs, but clinics “don’t offer everything to everyone, so it is helpful if someone can tell us every detail of their sexual life, because that enables us to think about the full range of treatments”.Dress appropriatelyMake sure you wear suitable clothing to show the relevant body part, says Ahmad: “If you are coming about your knee, dress so that an examination would be easy and we’re not having to go through lots of layers of clothes.”View image in fullscreenWear suitable clothing to your appointment.Photograph: Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesUse your own language“I ask patients to use their own language,” says Begeti. “What a neurologist is really good at doing is differentiating. A patient might say they have vertigo, which is medical terminology. And I’ll say, how does that feel to you? Do you feel like you are spinning? Or do you feel lightheaded, as if you are on a boat? Sometimes people can use the same language for quite different sensations.”Slang is welcomed if it helps to overcome the reluctance to discuss certain body parts.“I don’t know any practitioners who mind people using slang words,” says Phillips. “We are very used to slang, but we are not always the same generation as the people we are looking after, so don’t worry if we look a bit puzzled and need to ask you to explain what it means.” He adds: “Don’t worry about mispronouncing things – it doesn’t matter.”Be honestDoctors aren’t here to judge you, says Ahmad. “We just want to give you the best advice. That’s why it is important to be open about things like how much alcohol you drink, whether you smoke, how active you are and what you eat. If you tell us you only drink a couple of glasses a week when it’s actually a bottle a night, or say you don’t smoke when you do, we’re working with the wrong information. The more honest you are, the better we can help you.”Make a timeline of symptomsIt can be useful to bring along notes about how long you’ve been having the problem, whether anything makes it worse and any treatments you have already tried, says Ahmad. For example: “It started a week ago; or it has been there for six months.Thismakes it better;thishasn’t worked.” Bring any relevant medical letters from other appointments, as they may not be on your records, Ahmad adds.Voice your concernsIn the age of Google, most people attend appointments with a certain amount of information about a potential condition. “If that’s you, don’t be afraid to tell us,” says Ahmad. “Your GP understands that the internet can sometimes make things seem scarier than they are. For example, if someone has a headache, they might worry it is a brain tumour. Your doctor can talk you through the typical symptoms for a brain tumour and why your situation is different. They can explain what they think is causing your symptoms and what steps to take next, whether that is trying a treatment, keeping an eye on things or doing more tests, so that you leave your appointment feeling reassured and knowing what to do next.”Share what you understand about your conditionThe most important thing for the patient and doctor to do is build a relationship of trust, says Dr Petra Jankowska, a consultant clinical oncologist working in Taunton, Somerset, and the medical director of professional practice at the Royal College of Radiologists.Her starting point for this is finding out “what the patient has understood from what they’ve been told so far about the scans, biopsies and other tests they have had, in case there are some misunderstandings that I need to clarify”.View image in fullscreenAsk questions to ensure there are no misunderstandings about your treatment.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesDon’t be afraid to interrupt or ask for further explanation“I always say to my patients, ‘If there is something during our consultation that you don’t understand, feel free to interrupt me,’” says Jankowska. “It is really important that doctors use clear and unambiguous language and avoid jargon, acronyms and euphemisms.” If you don’t understand what is being said, don’t be afraid to say so. “I was always struck by something one of my patients used to say to me at the end of a consultation: ‘Petra, is there anything else I should be asking?’”Take your time“Patients think we are really rushed because they know that theNHSis overwhelmed, and they are almost apologetic for the time that they have with us,” says Stella Vig, a consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University hospital and the national medical director for secondary care in the NHS. “But the time is yours. If that means my clinic overruns slightly, it doesn’t matter. If we can’t cover everything in the time that we have, we can make another appointment. But patients shouldn’t leave feeling that they’ve not been able to talk to us.”Don’t be afraid to bring someone with youHaving a companion can help you understand what has been said, but make sure they are primarily there to listen, says Jankowska.“If the relative or friend is intending to ask a sensitive question, like, ‘What does this mean in terms of prognosis?’ and the patient hasn’t asked that, it can be very uncomfortable. If somebody is coming with the patient to act as their support, they should chat with that person in advance and say: ‘This is what I was thinking of asking. Is it all right if I do that?’”For some concerns, such as memory loss, bringing someone who can offer an objective opinion is crucial, says Begeti. “Relatives may notice symptoms that the patient hasn’t recognised themselves. If somebody has had memory loss, or a ‘funny turn’, or loss of consciousness that they didn’t know about, we ask them to bring a witness or a relative to the consultation that we can speak to.”Make notes“There is so much information that even if patients bring somebody with them, they still probably won’t remember absolutely everything,” says Jankowska. “Some patients ask to take notes, which is absolutely fine. Some patients take a recording during their consultation, which is also perfectly permissible, although it is advisable to check first and to do this openly.”View image in fullscreenBe honest about your lifestyle so doctors can offer the most useful advice.Photograph: Tom Werner/Getty ImagesKnow that you don’t need to commit to a treatment there and then“There are patients who, perhaps from their own experience or that of a family member, are apprehensive about some of the treatments I might be recommending. It is absolutely fine for them to go away and weigh things up,” says Jankowska.It is crucial to find out about all the medication options and side-effects, explains Begeti. “First, do people want to go on medication? Sometimes they may not want to. How bad are their symptoms? When it comes to different types of medications, I talk through side-effects and which would be acceptable to the person. For example, some medications make people feel sleepy.” If you are thinking of getting pregnant, it is important to say so. Begeti says the aim is for it to be a “collaborative process” between the doctor and patient in working out the best treatment plan. “I also recommend taking along a list of all your medications, because sometimes people will say they take a blue or orange pill, rather than the name and dose, and that can be quite difficult to interpret.”Be realistic about lifestyle changes“If we can do something with no intervention, we do that first,” says Vig. “A patient may have had pain in the back of their calf for around six months. They’ve gone to see their GP and they are sent to me. I examine them, and I realise that they’ve got a problem with the blood supply in their legs. We don’t need to do anything drastic, but they will need to change their lifestyle, stop smoking, exercise more and start at least three medications that will prolong their life.”Where lifestyle changes are involved, it is important to be realistic about your circumstances, she says. “I might tell myself that I need to lose weight and exercise, but I’m doing a full-time job. I come home, I cook for the family after a really busy day, and I might eat all the snacks in the house. Then, when I’ve cooked, I might not want to eat because I’m so tired. We’ve got to consider what life is like for the patient and how we can work with them to put realistic plans in place.”Speak up if you feel uncomfortable“If there is anything in the room making you feel uncomfortable, then say so,” says Phillips. Ask for a chaperone to be present or to be examined by someone of a particular gender if you think that will help. “But say so early on, so that it doesn’t feel stressful.”Don’t hesitate to ask for a second opinionYou are well within your rights to ask for a second opinion, says Phillips: “If you’re not happy, you should always be able to ask for that.”“Some of the patients that come to our clinic have rarer cancers that we don’t see very often,” says Jankowska. “Often I will say: ‘If you are uncomfortable, or if you feel that you need more information, or if you want to have what we’ve discussed confirmed so you feel more confident about your treatment, feel free to ask for a second opinion.’”“But,” Begeti adds, “it is important to come to appointments with an open mind. Sometimes, people come to me with a condition that they’ve heard of, but the same symptom can be caused by dozens of different conditions.”Follow up afterwards for any clarificationsIf you go home and realise you have forgotten to ask something – which is very common – you are encouraged to get in touch with further questions, says Jankowska. In her department, “there are several lines of communication, through the oncology secretaries, the clinical nurse specialist or the acute oncology service if it is a side-effect-related issue”.Many patients leave GP appointment without discussing all worries, survey showsRead moreAsk about what procedures will involve and any potential complications“Eight years ago, I had a brain tumour,” says Vig. “When I had surgery, I was less anxious about the procedure and more anxious about the complications afterwards – I knew I would lose the hearing in my right ear.” Vig was told there was a 40% chance of a secondary complication of facial paralysis, and she sought a second opinion from another surgeon. They came up with an alternative procedure to avoid it, which worked. “The doctor-patient relationship is like magic,” says Vig. “Trusting the person looking after you definitely improves the outcome.”Remember that it is OK to cry“Sometimes, patients find themselves feeling teary during a consultation, with emotions bubbling up unexpectedly – and that is absolutely OK,” says Ahmad. “Your doctor won’t be surprised; in fact, it can help them better understand the impact of your concerns. Crying can be a real relief; sometimes a few tears do more good than you’d expect, and the release can feel therapeutic.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It has seen them through being parents to small daughters Rosie and Ava, – who then grew up and took over every inch of space as teens (with their friends in tow) – to becoming empty nesters when both girls went to university. Now, it is back to providing a convivial backdrop for a busy, bustling family as all four adults once again share the house.View image in fullscreen‘I’m really not into that pristine way of living, where you have to put everything away’: Lou Rota with her dog.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverWhen they first moved in, the study and bedrooms were downstairs and the kitchen and sitting room were upstairs – the couple reversed the topsy-turvy layout. Slowly they stripped the floorboards, replastered the walls and painted throughout (Lou was one of the first to embrace sealed pink plaster walls, now a hot interiors trend) and converted the loft. Ten years later they made the most of the side return by extending the back of the house, with help from architect friend Tamala Anderson, to create an open-plan, skylit kitchen, dining and living space. “I remember when we first did it, it felt as if we were on holiday all the time with so much space.”Where the colour palette was once elegantly pared back, “I’ve become much more about bright, poppy colours,” says Lou, of bookshelves painted processed blue. “I think it’s about being a middle-aged woman and not wanting to go unnoticed by wearing bright colours and painting my nails in fluoro shades.” Shades of greens now swathe the walls – from olive and chartreuse to a cheery soft apple – and the dining space has been filled with indoor plants. “It’s like living in a conservatory.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve become much more about bright poppy colours’: statement blue bookshelves.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverA subtle rejig to the house has seen Ava, who has just finished college, return to a redecorated bedroom that feels appropriately more grown-up, says Lou. Out went the kiddie wallpaper, in came the same olive hue on the walls that they used downstairs. The childhood trampoline that sat flush with the lawn has been removed – “the most expensive hole in history”, sighs Lou – and the drawing room has become a cinema room with the addition of a projector and pull-down screen. “Now the girls can have their friends in there and we can still be in the kitchen having dinner.”The couple also recently invested in fine heritage glazing “so we didn’t have to get rid of the beautiful old windows, which are the joy of this house”. It cost a fortune but “it’s our responsibility to do these things, to keep these houses going for future generations”.View image in fullscreenSoft hues and heritage windows add to the vintage vibe.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverIts vintage vibe owes much to Lou’s aversion for “new stuff”, she says. “The world has so much in it already, I’d much rather buy something antique or used. And you don’t need to re-cover the whole sofa if only one cushion needs doing. Just redo the cushion,” she says. “It’s more interesting, isn’t it? It’s deeper. It has a story.”Lou loves to imagine the stories of the people who might have once owned a chair or a kitchen storage canister before her: “There’s a book calledThe Collector Collectorby Tibor Fischer, about a bowl that collects people as opposed to people collecting the bowl. I love it when things have a bit of life to them and that nice feeling permeates your own home with warmth, tactility and memories.”In the mix are upcycled woods used for the kitchen island-cum-cocktail cabinet that glows particularly alluringly at night – “My vintage cocktail glassware collection keeps growing; we’re very into making cocktails, I make all my own syrups and make my own recipes up” – and schoolhouse chairs by Swarm, with seats and backs fashioned from collaged, sanded and sealed flea-market paintings. Panoramic wall panels by Surface View in the office and Jessica Zoob in the drawing room bring a fresh take to displaying art.View image in fullscreenThe office with its ornate wall mural by Surface View.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The ObserverThe house feels very soothing. “The atmosphere of a place is just as important to me as the visuals. I’m really not into that absolute pristine way of living where you have to be able to put everything away. We cook all the time, we play games, we watch telly, the dog jumps on the cushions all the time… I really wouldn’t want it any other way.”Lou’s passion for sustainability and predilection for all things creepy-crawly – bugs, beetles and bees regularly pop up in her designs – have also extended to the garden, which she has filled with pollinating and rough-safe plants to support the birds, butterflies and insects. At the bottom of the garden sits Lou’s light-filled working space, built by London Garden Studios, located under the canopy of an ancient hornbeam, surrounded by the constant buzz of the birds she feeds with mealworms. “I can sit for days on end in that studio drawing, painting, listening to an audiobook, the dog at my feet. It’s so peaceful, like a window on to the world.”View image in fullscreen‘A window to the world’: Rota’s work space by London Garden Studios, enclosed by nature at the bottom of the garden.Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer“I’m loving the pace of life, I can be around the kids more,” she says. “It’s a privilege to have them at home, cooking, making cocktails, talking and laughing together.

The town centre is full of imposing 19th- and 20th-century buildings that were created in a spirit of pride and optimism but have long since lain empty; local people talk about the shadow of the old iron and coal industries, and the fact that precious little ever came along to take their place. On the Monday afternoon I visited, the most forlorn sight was a huge mural of a local rugby crowd, lovingly sprayed on the exterior of a former discount store: atwo-dimensional throng, put there to “inspire people to remember what Pontypool could be like as a thriving community”.Despite appearances, asignificant watershed momenthappened here recently. Like so much of south Wales, Pontypool has long been seen as a loyal Labour redoubt – but on 13 February, Reform UK gained its first Welsh councillor in abyelection for the local borough council. The victor was a former army major who won 457 votes to Labour’s anaemic 259, and claimed, when greeting his win, that there would now be no Labour councillors, MPs or members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, who could confidently think they represented safe seats. Reform UK is set on banishing the lingering idea of south Wales as a staunch socialist heartland: Nigel Farage intends to make the 2026 devolved Welsh elections “by far our biggest priority”.In London, meanwhile, the mounting threat from Farage and his comrades and Donald Trump’s return to the White House havetriggered a striking political shift, led by Keir Starmer’s chief of staff and supposed strategic super-brain Morgan McSweeney. The government’s stance on immigration has turned sour and punitive: witness thoseawful videosof illegal migrants being deported, and the Kafkaesque new move topermanently denyUK citizenship to anyone who travelled here via a supposedly illegal and dangerous route. Amid support for a third Heathrow runway and talk of new drilling in the North Sea, the greenery that was once held up to be Starmer’s core idea is withering away. Cuts of up to£5bn in sickness and disability benefitsloom.This was the grim context for Starmer’s announcements of drastic reductions in foreign aid to open the way to an increase in defence spending. While charities andNGOs expressed alarmat what the move would mean for everything from violence against women and girls to the impacts of a heating planet, he said that making the decision had been “extremely difficult and painful”, but it was a choice that snugly fitted the reinvention project known in some circles asStarmer’s “Reformation” (think about it). Such a move, after all, has long been demanded by the rightwing press. Most damningly of all, it is of a piece with Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s summary shut-down of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), and all the chaos it has spawned (inher resignation letterlast week, the outgoing international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, pointedly said that the cut was “already being portrayed as following in President Trump’s slipstream of cuts to USAid.”)A lot of the government’s surrounding mood music fits the same picture. One of McSweeney’s sources of continuing inspiration is the Blue Labour peer Maurice Glasman: the only Labour parliamentarian invited to Trump’s inauguration, and a recent guest on the podcast hosted by the former Trump insider Steve Bannon, the man who recently denied that he had enlivened his speech at the CPAC convention in Washington DCwith one of those Hitler salutes. Glasman level-headedlyassured his hostthat “progressives” are his political enemy, “because they actually despise faith, they despise family, they despise love, and they don’t even want you to enjoy sexual intercourse with your wife”. He alsoreckonsthat “the only place to build a house now is on the left side of Maga Square”, wherever that is. Among the other intellectual freewheelers who have recently beentalking to senior Starmeraides is Munira Mirza, the former adviser to Boris Johnson, who is said to be helping with “a sort of critique of liberal multiculturalism”.While such conversations happen behind the scenes, other signs of the leadership’s new faux-populist mindset are out in the open. Josh Simons is a newly elected Labour MP and trusted ally of McSweeney who I have heard being tipped for quick promotion to the cabinet. During the second parliamentary reading of the government’s border security, asylum and immigration bill, he gave aquite remarkable speechbased on his admiration for the ancient Greeks – and specifically their categorisation of migrants as “metics”. Such people, he told the Commons, “were subject to different rules; who joined the city was controlled and the bar was set high for who could become a citizen and vote”. If metics broke Athenian laws, moreover, “they were expelled from the city, and sometimes thrust into the blazing Greek sun.”Lest anyone think he was getting a bit carried away, this was merely an object lesson in the principle whereby “people who govern themselves control who they are and who becomes a member of the demos”. He had been elected by his constituents in Greater Manchester on the basis that he would not rest “until we gripped our borders, restored control, and … brought down the number of legal migrants entering this country each year – and I meant it”. And he finished with a pithy authoritarian flourish: “We in theLabourparty believe in control and order. The opposition do not.”With or without the classical references, will this kind of talk pull back the people Labour fears it is losing? In Pontypool, it wasn’t hard to find people who were very taken with Farage and his party.One man told methat Farage “gets on with Trump, and we’ve got to stay on their side”. Another said that successive governments had “let too many people across the border … It just seems to me that they’re eating up all the work and taking everything.” What everyone said was woven through with an equally familiar theme: the constant grind of rising food bills and energy prices, and life in a place that had turned into a “ghost town”.On the road in south Wales: why is Reform UK on the rise?Read moreThere are two possible approaches to all that. In keeping with their support for Ukraine, the PM and his colleagues are now set on attacking Reform UKover its soft stances on Russia, but there is a queasy contradiction at work: in other areas of policy, the Starmer/McSweeney Reformation looks set to deepen. That will not just bend centre-left politics into impossible shapes, but comes with a profound danger: that it is already making Farage and his ilk sound not just as if they control a huge chunk of the national conversation, but are preferable to whatever semi-skimmed version of populist politics Labour comes up with. Worse still, it is sure to alienate voters who may prefer the Greens, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, or the Lib Dems: over the weekend, the UCL Policy Labpublished pollingshowing that over 40% of 2024 Labour supporters say that if safe routes for refugees were prevented or climate action slowed down, it would stop them voting Labour next time.Or there might be a plan B. Labour politicians might try their best to rebuild towns such as Pontypool, answer their call for esteem and security, and help them acquire the things whose scarcity informs all those conversations about outsiders: jobs and homes, chiefly, along with the sense that they are no less valued than people who live in more affluent places. They could do that while holding on to what is left of the party’s liberal values, and finally coming up with a convincing response to an increasingly urgent question.

But how well is he playing his own hand?Olga ChyzhThe US president has no interest in countering aggressors. His short-termist game plan will cost America dearSun 2 Mar 2025 10.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 16.23 ESTShareThe White House meetingbetween Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyywill be remembered as far more than just a diplomatic disaster. It marked the end of international politics as we know it, and was a harbinger for the sunset of Pax Americana. Zelenskyy, reeling from the meeting,arrived in London on Saturdayto attend a defence summit with other European leaders. Thanks to Trump’s performance, those leaders now have clarity on where the US government stands on the war in Ukraine – and, more broadly, on how US foreign policy may look in future.It is hard to overstate what a departure this is. Since the end of the second world war, the US has been theprimary architect and guarantorof an intricate network of global institutions anchored by Nato, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. Together, these partners crafted a security umbrella whose benefits far outweighed its expense. It produced political stability and provided US and European companies with unrivalled access to markets and resources. The US was all too happy to share the gains of this order with its allies, and, to a lesser extent, with its rivals and adversaries.True, the USreaped the greatest benefits: it set the terms of trade and projected its influence on to the globe. But the order was inclusive, since its institutions were designed to deliver benefits that everyone could enjoy, even if access was unequal. It had plenty of critics, drawing envy and ire from adversaries such as Russia and China, whose leaders regularly grumbled about unfairness and demanded their seats at the table. Over time, the US and its allies grew accustomed to the status quo, comfortable and complacent to the point of letting their military stockpilesdeplete and degrade. By contrast,RussiaandChinacultivated networks of propagandists, corrupt officials and saboteurs, who shared a common goal: to identify the west’s weak points, amplify political instability and undermine western unity.They could hardly have hoped for a more vulnerable and divided west. From the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, to rising nationalist movements acrossEuropeand, most consequentially, Trump’s ascendance to the presidency, the last decade has been marked by events that have weakened transatlantic ties and eroded security arrangements. Trump’s criticisms of Nato and other longstanding alliances have helped to convince American voters that US allies are more of a burden than a benefit.A humiliation at the White House and what does it tell us? Trump would make a colony of my country | Andrey KurkovRead moreIn this context, the meeting with Zelenskyy, when Trump told the Ukrainian leader “make a deal or we’re out”, was not entirely surprising. The president has consistently framed foreign policy in transactional terms, prioritising one-time payouts over the long-term dividends that arise from international stability and cooperation. His approach reflects a total indifference to defending democratic principles or countering authoritarian influence, whether in Russia or elsewhere. His foreign policy is defined by unpredictability, quick gains and self-interest.Trump is also uninterested in confronting aggressors. In fact, he’s not averse to trading other’s security for his own gain. As Zelenskyy pointed out, the US is shielded from Russian aggression by an ocean, a luxury that Europe does not enjoy. Trump appears content to let Europe manage its own security, ignoring the reality that European stability is intrinsically linked to US economic and strategic interests. In his willingness to work with Vladimir Putin, he is ignoring the fact that the existing international system has overwhelmingly benefited the US. Ironically, the world order that Putin advocates for – one shaped by imperial spheres of influence, rather than collective security – would come at significant costs to the US.In his exchange with Zelenskyy, Trump invoked a metaphor of a card game. Yet his own cards are spread across the table. He will probably use the fallout from the meeting to convince domestic Republican holdouts to halt sendingdecommission-ready military equipmentto Ukraine and lift sanctions against Russia. He and Putin will probably extol the dubious economic opportunitiesthat America could seize in Russia, trading secure and lucrative European markets for the higher risk, smaller Russian market, which his Maga-aligned elites may embrace.Europe can either stand back, accept this new reality, and hope that Russia’s imperial ambitions stop atUkraine. Or it can adapt to a world without US support, where it has to take a more assertive role in its own defence and strategic decision-making. Historically, cohesion across the continent has been difficult to achieve. The stakes are now higher than ever.For Ukraine, the path forward remains difficult. This meeting did not cost it US support – that was set in motion by Trump’s re-election. Zelenskyy was right not to be bullied into a ceasefire on Russia-dictated terms. Without security guarantees, such an agreement would be disastrous for Ukraine. Trump would claim an easy diplomatic victory, using it as a justification to cut military aid and lift sanctions on Russia. But as Zelenskyy noted, Putin has a history of breaking ceasefires. With sanctions eased, Russia would simply rearm and prepare for another offensive against a weakened Ukraine. By resisting Trump’s pressure, Zelenskyy may still face the same outcome, but at least Ukraine remains unshackled from a one-sided truce.Even without US support, Ukraine is in a stronger position militarily and diplomatically than it was in early 2022. As dire as things look at the moment, international politics is rarely static, and Trump himself is known for reversals. It remains possible thathe could again shift course, signing the minerals deal with Ukraine and mending relations with European allies. There is always a small chance that the meeting was just an embarrassing and emotional mishap. But with its sovereignty at stake, chance is not something Ukraine can count on.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

Do they indicate concrete plans, are they designed to provoke, or do they have no meaning, like the gurgles and gasps that can inadvertently escape from a decomposing corpse? My job here is to try to anticipate if anything Trump says or does is likely to be of any lasting significance and to satirise it accordingly, in the small window of time allowed, for money. And it isn’t getting any easier. Yes, Ukraine is suffering, but I am the real victim here.For example, last Saturday Trump opined: “We were the richest… think of this, from 1870 to 1913… because we collected tariffs… We had so much wealth. Wouldn’t it be nice today? Of course, now, we give it away to transgender this, to transgender that. Everybody gets a transgender operation. It’s wonderful. We give it away to crazy things. But in those days, it was different. It was a different world. It was a different country.”Would Trump’s notion of the damage caused to long-term American prosperity by transgender this surgery, and also to a lesser extent by transgender that surgery, gain any traction, and thus be deserving of the barbs of my quill, or would it be politely ignored as another crazy corpse bleat?I’m not a historian, though I do follow Prof Janina Ramirez on social media, but surely part of US prosperity in the period Trump describes was built on the proceeding two and a half centuries’ use of free labour in the form of enslaved people stolen in their millions from Africa, their descendants finally getting the vote in 1965, when the Beatles’ Help! was top of the UK charts; and also on the natural wealth appropriated from the country’s Indigenous people, who were systematically ethnically cleansed and robbed of land and resources for which, conveniently, they hadn’t really developed a notion of ownership as Europeans understood it. Have these beads, this whiskey and these smallpox-infected blankets. Thanks for all the pelts. Enjoy your dancing.To be fair to Trump, studies of Irish history, for instance, show that though three significant famines between 1740 and 1879 did affect the country economically, the main dent in the nation’s finances was caused by the Roman Catholic church’s liberal attitude to notions of gender, and by its demand that the Irish state fund transgender this surgery, and moreover transgender that surgery, for any Irish citizen requiring it, or for anyone who had even been just a little bit curious. I’m joking of course. Trump’s idiotic Trump Theory ofTransgenderEconomics ™ ® didn’t stick and I wisely elected to ignore it in last week’s column. But Trump continues to be a tough call.I’m checking live news updates to see if the Trump Theory of Transgender Economics has resurfaced in a more vociferous formFor 13 years, I filed these columns on Thursday mornings, hoping that I’d have anticipated any news developments that might destabilise my so-called “jokes” between the deadline and Sunday’s publication. But last year I asked if I could start filing on Tuesdays, as various special-interest, right-leaning groups kept nibbling at the grey area between actionable exaggeration and exaggeration for comic effect, and I wanted to give theObserver’slegal team time to protect me from imprisonment, having already experienced the spleen-dissolving stress of being co-targeted by Britain’s final, and failed, attempt at a blasphemy prosecution in 2005.But now I’m back to filing at the last possible moment, 10am on Thursday. It’s 9.15 now and I’m cross-checking the paragraphs that follow this sentence with live news updates to see if, perhaps, last week’s Trump Theory of Transgender Economics ™ ® has suddenly resurfaced in a more vociferous form. Trump has turbocharged the news cycle and I’m a tortoise trying to spray-paint the side of speeding trains with clever satirical caricatures, James Gillray on a folding scooter. Those long wavy lines all along the carriages were supposed to be a drawing of Trump hanging a tea towel marked Ukraine out to dry. Or something.It’s impossible. On Wednesday afternoon, the world briefly combusted when it appeared Trump’s Truth Social feed had shared an impossibly offensiveAI-generated film of his vision for Gaza’s future. An image of a soldier pointing a gun at a Palestinian kid’s head dissolves into liberated children running towards a Dubai-style resort, where Elon Musk eats hummus on a beach, bellydancers bellydance, a toddler tugs at a giant golden balloon of Trump’s head, Trump apparently dances with a semi-naked woman, Musk and some infants dance in falling money, a gaudy Trump casino full of small golden effigies of Trump emerges from the ruins, Musk eats some more hummus but indoors this time, a giant golden statue of Trump bestrides a street scene and, finally, Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu drink cocktails by a pool in just their pants as a rapper raps: “Trump Gaza number one!”Theories erupted. Was Trump trying to bait the world? Or had Israel made the film to goad Hamas into breaking the ceasefire? Had Hamas made it to goad the outraged into attacking the US? But looking closely, it seems Trump is uncomfortably overfamiliar with the woman he is dancing with and the beach bellydancers are in fact men with beards in translucent dresses, in a country where transgender this and transgender that is yet to do the economic damage it has in the US.Had someone made an all too plausible satire of Trump’s ethics and aesthetics that Trump himself had taken as an endorsement and shared online? Or did Trump know it was a parody and have so little regard for the human suffering in the region, he shared it anyway? It’s impossible to know. All that is certain is that, asSteve Bannon advised, the zone is flooded with shit. And every week, it gets harder to wade through.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTransgenderGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuElon MuskSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what I’ve learned – and what has surprised meEmma BeddingtonThere’s more leisure, less laundry and no more Nando’s on the sofa. But I’m still struggling to get to grips with this tidy, idle new lifeSun 2 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 09.15 ESTShareI come into the kitchen to find my husband staring into space, which is normally my job. Then he points. “It’s time to accept we aren’t bread-bin people,” he says.I believe, instinctively, ancestrally, in bread bins; I come from bread-bin stock. But since we acquired ours five years ago, it has been used probably five times. On one of these occasions, a loaf was left in there for so long that the buildup of mould caused the lid to warp. I assumed the problem was living with teenagers with no object permanence, who, even if they saw the bread goin, forgot it existed once it was no longer visible. However, after two years of an empty nest, bread still lives on top of the bin. It turns out that even I am not a bread-bin person.Our younger son just turned 21, meaning we are a childless household in every official sense of the term. It is and isn’t how I expected it would be. The bread bin is just one of my empty-nest surprises; here are some others.I am actually very tidy – indeed, unpleasantly uptight about tidiness. It was the eternal churn of family mess that made me a slattern.We are now a Nando’s-free household after years of peri-peri tyranny, but I find myselfpining for “macho peas”and pallid, lukewarm chips. Is it the flabby fries or the slack, companionable comfort of those four-on-the-sofa TV dinners I want? My husband suggested getting a small, elegant sofa recently, but the idea of never squashing the four of us on to ours again made me unspeakably sad.I don’t want a dog. It has been 18 months sincemy beloved dog Oscar died. Empty nesters always get dogs, but I don’t want to nurture anything more demanding than our roster of surrogate children (idiot hens, an infant tortoise and Susan, the fugitive wedding dove on our roof who arrived eight months ago, but still won’t let me touch her).If we don’t do a weekly food shop, nothing falls apart and no one perishes.Escaping the parenting trenches before most of my peers means I socialise a lot with older people – and, oof, their energy! Does your life force gradually replenish until you can bounce through pilates, Zumba and five-a-side, volunteer for multiple charities, learn the harpsichord and improve your Arabic? When does that start, please?Life feels blissfully easy day to day (less laundry, more leisure) and existentially confusing. I feel as tied to my sons as ever, but also cut off, teetering between overbearing interference and strenuously pretending to be casual, constantly second-guessing whether I should ask how the exam went, if they slept, whether the sun is shining where they are. ReadingNina Stibbe’s latest diariesI was envious at how happily enmeshed she is in her grownup children’s lives.It’s cringey how much I miss them. Sometimes, I catch myself staring jealously over my husband’s shoulder at a WhatsApp from one of them; I regularly check the weather where they live; when they Deliveroo on my account, I spy on their orders.It’s also annoying when they come home, wilfully misunderstanding the recycling system, eating at inconvenient times and using towels like oligarchs. Just as I adjust and relax, they leave again.I thought I would work harder when they left, become a single-minded art monster. Instead, I feel fallow, like my brain used itself up producing this crop of offspring and needs a year (or five) off. It’s unnerving. I read a lot about the creative power of idleness to try to reassure myself.It’s no surprise to remember how much I like my husband’s company, but it’s astonishing to realise we only cohabited for five years before careering into 22 years of full-on family life. We are as free now as when he arrived in London in 1997 (on crutches, with his grandmother’s yucca tree). Dizzyingly so: we could do anything we like. Raise ostriches! Join a cult! Move to Acapulco! But I don’t want to rip everything up. I hope that is a good sign. Life feels quiet, spacious and strange; a long, slow exhale. What will the inhale bring? No idea.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFamilyOpinionChildrenParents and parentingMarriagecommentShareReuse this content"

But it was already clear that thedeepest cut in the UK aid budget in historywould not mark the end of the matter.How do we make Europe more secure? Here are five steps we need to take nowRead morePresumably referring to debates in Germany and across the EU, where a common defence fund is under consideration, Dodds told Starmer she “expected we would collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, as other nations are doing”.Warning that defence spending may yet need to rise significantly further, Dodds added that this would be impossible through “tactical cuts to public spending”.Instead, she said, “these are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country’s security cannot be ducked.”She is correct: Starmer may have won the warm welcome he sought from Donald Trump for boosting defence spending, with his shameless raid on the development budget – a policy previously advocated by Reform and the Tory party – but if the US withdrawal from the European sphere sticks, the prime minister is likely to have to come back for more in the months and years ahead, and there are few soft spending targets left.Labour had boxed itself in tightly even before Trump began tearing up the transatlantic alliance. The narrow headroom Rachel Reeves left against her self-imposed fiscal rules, combined with a deteriorating economic outlook, meant the Treasury wasalready considering spending cutsin the 26 March statement.And the prospect of tough trade-offs in June’s spending review are already threatening Labour’s hopes of transforming threadbare public services – surely at the heart of the “change” the party promised voters.Now, with Trump’s intentions apparently clear – and little to show for Starmer’s smash-and-grab raid on the aid budget – it must be time for a radical rethink.There is no doubt whatsoever that Labour has been dealt a historically bad hand. The Conservatives left it with legacy tax and spending plans that didn’t add up without heroic assumptions about future cuts to an already crumbling public sector.The Guardian view on PM’s gamble: exploiting crisis to remake Labour was a step too far for an ally | EditorialRead moreThe national debt is nudging 100% of GDP after the cost of the banking crisis and a decade of sluggish economic growth were compounded dramatically by the Covid pandemic.Interest rates, which were at rock bottom through much of the post-global financial crisis period before rising to 16-year highs in summer 2023, are on their way down but remain high by recent historical standards, and subject to the whims of volatile financial markets. None of this can be wished away.Yet if Starmer is right that we are in “a world where everything has changed”, as he put it in his speech explaining the aid cuts, some much more creative thinking will be called for.There were early signs of the flexibility required thisweekend as Reeves announced she would expand the remit of Labour’s national wealth fund (though not its budget) to encompass defence spending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lammy’s proposal involves raiding the underlying capital, instead of leaving it intact.But surely the rethink must also extend to considering alternative ways of raising the cash. That should include revisiting the pledge not to reverse Jeremy Hunt’s ill-advised cuts to national insurance contributions (NICs), as well as other options such as reforming the UK’s out-of-kilter council tax system, and looking afresh at wealth taxes.No tax increases are likely to be popular – focus groups tell Labour strategists the public feel they’re paying quite enough already; and the vicious backlash from the farming inheritance tax changes, which raise just £500m or so, underlines how tough the politics can be.Meanwhile, Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer NICs – designed not to hit voters’ payslips directly – is continuing to cascade through the jobs market. Anyone with a child at a nursery or a relative in a care home will be getting a letter about now explaining why their fees are going up sharply.Against that backdrop, Labour will be reluctant to come back for more, and indeed Reeves hasall but promised not to.But the alternative, of four years of salami-slicing from public services and welfare budgets as the peace dividend evaporates, will have its own debilitating political impact.And the task of tooling up to join the EU in resisting Vladimir Putin coincides with another urgent generational challenge that cannot be ducked: investing to fit the economy for the transition away from fossil fuels, and protecting the poorest from the consequences.As the extraordinarygathering of European leadersin London on Sunday makes clear, Starmer is quite right that the world has changed. Tax and spending policy as conceived by Labour in opposition will not meet the moment. All options must be on the table.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointEconomic policyTax and spendingDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

Clark is not a political theorist but a historian of art. A Marxist, much of his work explores the interface of art and politics with considerable nuance and depth, illuminating artists from Bosch to Pollock, Rembrandt to Lowry.The final section of the collection includes more straightforwardly political writing. For a Left with No Future is the weakest of the essays, whether on art or politics. It is nevertheless perhaps also the most significant, for not only does it provide a new perspective to much of Clark’s other work, it also addresses a particularly keen question for our time – how should the left deal with its failure? In its pessimism and world-weariness, it seems to speak to many today.The title,Those Passions, is taken from Shelley’s sonnetOzymandias, an exploration of the inevitability of oblivion, a description of a half-buried statue of a once-great pharaoh of a once-great empire: “Round the decay / Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away.” That desolate landscape is, for Clark, a metaphor for modern civilisation, made barren by consumerism and the reduction of all to a “spectacle”. Even more, it is a poetic description of the terrain in which the left finds itself. “If the past decade or so is not proof that there are no circumstances capable of reviving the left in its 20th-century form,” he asks, “then what would proof be like?”It is a pessimism both exaggerated and understated. It is exaggerated because Clark finds the roots of the left’s defeat in human nature, in “the human propensity to violence” and an inevitable “hankering after evil” woven into our very being. He finds it also in modernity itself, which has created such atomised, unthinking, obedient individuals that they are “no longer material for a society”, a phrase borrowed from Nietzsche. These are not new ideas; but to root the left’s demise in human nature and the nature of modernity is to deny the possibility of any resurrection.Indeed, Clark urges the left to abandon utopian ideas and embrace in its stead a “tragic sense of life”. The tragic vision, which sustains a conservative view of the world, sees in the flawed and limited character of humans a warning against grand social change, insisting that faith, tradition and hierarchy are necessary guardrails against barbarism, a way of acknowledging, in the words of Leszek Kołakowski, the Polish Marxist turned Christian philosopher, “life as inevitable defeat”.Yet, for all this, Clark’s despair is also understated, because today’s political malaise is more profound than he envisions – or is commonly acknowledged. It is not just the left that has imploded. Liberal and conservative traditions, too, have become drained of much of their life-force.These three main ideologies of modernity have clearly been antagonistic to each other. Yet they have also possessed a symbiotic relationship, one most clearly seen in the link between liberalism and radicalism.What we call liberal norms – democracy, equality, freedom of speech and association, the right of nations to self-determination and so on – became social realities largely through the efforts of radical movements and working-class organisations, and often in the face of ferocious opposition from liberal elites that sought to limit the scope of these norms, denying the majority of society, indeed the majority of the world, basic democratic rights.Apart from the Quakers, none of the radical groups that throng the English revolution survived into history. But their ideas didIt was through the struggles of the dispossessed – of slaves to emancipate themselves, of colonial subjects confronting imperial rule, of the working class organising to improve their lives, of women claiming the right to vote – that liberal norms were made universal rather than remaining the exclusive property of a privileged few.The erosion of that radical universalist tradition has befuddled the left, detaching it from liberal traditions, and from class politics, and leaving the remnants more authoritarian and identitarian. It has also discombobulated liberalism.Without the buttress of radicalism, liberals themselves have become more illiberal, whether on free speech or democracy, and less willing to address issues of social inequality or working-class needs.Conservatism emerged initially as voicing hostility to modernity, and yet adapted to the new world so efficiently that it become a dominant governing force in a world painted largely in liberal tones. Over time, not liberalism but working-class and socialist movements became conservatism’s principal enemy, an antagonistic relationship that helped define what conservatives wished to conserve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conservatives today seem to understand how to rip up the existing order, but have little conception about what should replace it, or what they wish to conserve. And so, we arrive in an age in which it is not just that the left has lost but that the main political traditions of modernity have all become exhausted.The book we need to make sense of these darkening times, Clark suggests, is Christopher Hill’sThe Experience of Defeat.First published in 1984, it is an exploration by the pre-eminent historian of 17th-century radicalism of the writings of English radicals after the crushing defeat that came with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, barely a decade after the execution of Charles I.The story that Hill tells cuts against the grain, though, of Clark’s anti-utopianism. Hill depicts a generation of radicals defeated and subdued; but one that also sustained many who never abandoned their aspirations of renovating that radical tradition. John Milton was their “prophet-poet” who, in his last great epic poems,Paradise RegainedandSamson Agonistes,most eloquently expressed the possibilities of hope and redemption.Apart from the Quakers, none of the radical groups that throng the English revolution – the Levellers, the Diggers, the Ranters, the Muggletonians and others – endured. But their ideas did. The belief in equality, democracy and universal suffrage, the challenge to impoverishment and class distinctions, all became woven into new radical movements in the 18th century.And then, Hill observes, the poets of the new radicalism, from Blake to Shelley, “turned back to Milton… and the vision of the poet-prophet”.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionJohn MiltonHistory booksPoetrycommentShareReuse this content"

The Labour leader came to office thinking, as did most of those who voted for him, that he was going to be a domestically orientated prime minister with primary ambitions to improve living standards, build lots of homes and rejuvenate public services. That’s what “change”, his one-word election slogan, was supposed to be about. When he originally selected his overriding “five missions”, the defence of the realm didn’t make the cut.His central definition today is as a geopolitically focused prime minister who is promising tospend more on guns, missiles and warplanesand less on international aid. More British bullets will be purchased at the expense of succour to the impoverished and desperate of the world. This shift gives a flintier profile to his leadership, but not in a way that either supporters or opponents anticipated during last summer’s election. Most Labour people don’t quarrel with the argument that Britain has to put up its guard, but a lot of them, includingqueasy members of the Starmer cabinet, are wriggling uncomfortably about taking the hatchet to the international development budget. In the days since the decision was announced, they have taken to wondering what manner of Labour government is this?The short explanation for this transmogrification is two words and an initial: Donald J Trump. The upheaval in the international order unleashed by the US president has shattered decades-old assumptions about the western alliance. This has had a more profound impact on Sir Keir than any other event. A prime minister who used to earn his living as a human rights lawyer has had a crash course in realpolitik from the nakedly transactional practitioner of great power games who resides on Pennsylvania Avenue.Sir Keir came away fromhis encounter at the White Houseon Thursday empty-handed when it came to securing a bankable guarantee that there will be US military cover for any British and French peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine. What the prime minister did win was anapparent blessingfor the Chagos Islands deal, puncturing Nigel Farage’s repeated claims that the White House is opposed to it. There were encouraging noises that the UK may swerve US tariffs and pats on the head for Sir Keir from his host for being a “special man” and a “very tough negotiator”. The price was paid in the currency of ingratiation. This was at its most toe-curling when the prime minister delved into his jacket pocket toflourish an invite from the kingfor the US president to make an “unprecedented”, “truly historic” second state visit to the UK. Excuse me while I find something to retch into. The other tribute to the Maga King was setting a 2027 deadline forlifting British defence spendingto 2.5% of GDP with 3% as the ultimate target.Boosting defence spending is both a response to Trump’s demands that Europe pulls its weight and an insurance policy against the withdrawal of American security guarantees. Downing Street reeled at the callous and chilling monstering of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a democratically elected leader fighting for his country’s freedom against tyranny, at the White House on Friday. The shocking ugliness of the televised scene amplified Number 10’s unspoken fears that the Trump regime poses an existential challenge to European security.I’ve beenamong those anticipating this pivot. Given how menacing the world looked even before Trump’s return to the Oval Office, it was not sustainable to leave Britain’s armed forces in such a parlous condition that our own defence secretary describes them as “hollowed out”. The intelligence chiefs and the top brass have becomeincreasingly clamourousabout thegrowing scaleand intensity of threats from a spectrum of malevolent adversaries.The upheaval in the international order unleashed by Trump has shattered old assumptions about the western allianceThe issue then becomes whether the money will be spent well or wastefully. The Ministry of Defence has a rotten record when it comes to equipping the armed forces in a timely and cost-effective way. The onus is now on John Healey and the service chiefs to prove that they can get the maximum bang from the taxpayers’ extra bucks.The pain inflicted on the international aid budget will be brutal. Sir Keir was all crocodile tears when he intoned that regrettably “hard choices” had to be made, as if more money for defence could only be found by stealing it from aid programmes. There were many other options for a government that spends in excess of £1tn a year. These included being less generous towards other demands for spending, bearing down on escalating costs in areas of welfare or raising more from taxation. Though the prime minister claims he did not take this decision “lightly”, the international development budget was targeted because Downing Street and the Treasury reckoned it was the politically least painful option.This is the superficially clever and unashamedly cynical choice when it comes to electoral calculations. Polling suggests thatcutting aid is a popular optionwith around two-thirds of voters. There’s an assumption among Labour strategists that aid is particularly resented by the kind of voter who supported Labour at the election and is now flirting with Reform or has already switched to it. There’s some truth in this analysis, but it is not the whole truth. There’s danger for Labour among the significant wedge of voters who chose the party at the election partly on the basis that it was more compassionate, enlightened and internationalist than the Tories. They didn’t expect Labour to outdo the last Conservative government in slashing the development budget.The case for spending on aid is easily made. On top of the humanitarian good it does, there’s the mitigation against instability, conflict and extremism. It also helps win friends and influence people in other countries who can be useful to the UK in the projection and protection of our national interests. These arguments will be highly familiar to Sir Keir and his cabinet because it was preciselythe case they used to makethemselves when they berated the Conservatives for raiding the budget. AsLabour’s election manifestoput it, international aid helps make “the world a safer, more prosperous place”.The UK used to be able to make the claim that its record on helping the poorer parts of the planet made us a soft power superpower. As recently as 2020, the UK was one of only seven wealthy countries that met the UN target to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. The Conservatives cut that to 0.5% under Boris Johnson and it will now be slashed down to just 0.3%. Since a hefty chunk of the budget isbeing spent on asylum-seekerswithin Britain, the net amount supporting international development will be even more miserly. Programmes threatenedinclude those alleviating poverty, tackling disease, improving the education of young people and addressing the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Number 10 clearly reckoned there was a slight risk that she would resign as international development minister, or decided it wasn’t terribly bothered even if she did.She has quitwith the warning that denuding the international development budget will only encourage Russia’s aggressive effort to increase its presence worldwide. Blood must be rushing to the head of David Lammy. Justifying the cut has obliged the foreign secretary to stand on his head. It is only very recently that he waswagging a fingerat the Americans by telling them it was a “big strategic mistake” to let Elon Musk eviscerate the US development budget. He accompanied that with the warning that China would exploit the vacuum to further its influence.I am being generous when I say that it is disingenuous of Sir Keir and his loyalists to suggest that they were faced with an either/or choice between defence spending in the name of national security and non-defence spending in troubled and distressed places abroad. The UK is an affluent country that likes to think it can punch above its weight. Even when money is tight, this nation is wealthy enough to wield both hard power and soft power.The face of Britain that the Starmer government is now presenting to the world is one that aspires to be more muscular while also looking meaner. Muscular is necessary in the scary new world order. Meaner is a myopic mistake that will render Britain less safe.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsDefence policyLabourUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

By December, Ed Miliband was signingcontracts, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to “reignite our industrial heartlands” and Rachel Reeves warned that without bold action, Britain would be stuck with low growth and falling living standards. More importantly, net zero targets wouldn’t be met without removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Fast forward and the Treasury is,reportedly, preparing to scrap the £22bn plan, after economic growth failed to materialise. What a difference a few weeks make.The change of heart is not about the technology – carbon capture and storage (CCS) is still as underdeveloped as it was in October, when ministersextolledits virtues. The government’s climate advisers are unequivocal: net zero is impossible without CCS. But the economic circumstances have changed. Ms Reeves underestimated how slowly interest rates would fall, and the deep spending pressures left by Tory austerity. She also faces risingdefencecosts.Her rigid, self-imposed fiscal rules dictate that any higher-than-expected spending in one area must be offset by cuts elsewhere. Rather than such arbitrary constraints, Britain needs atransparent systemthat enables strategic investment. The good news is that the Climate Change Committee told the governmentlast weekthat the net cost of cutting UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 to 100% below 1990 levels is now 73% lower than it previously thought in 2020. The bad news is that the transition would still require a net cost of around£4bna year, a little under 0.2% of GDP.With less fiscalheadroomthan forecast, Ms Reeves could close the gap through borrowing or with a modest wealth tax – but rejects both. That leaves an unpalatable choice: cuts to welfare, public services or growth-driving investment in housing, energy and transport.Divertingfunds from capital projects to defence risks turning her growth agenda into the usual Tory mix of deregulation, austerity and national security.Greening Britain requires short-term expenditure for long-term gains. Reaching net zero requires upfront investment, but willlower consumer billsand reduce reliance on imported fuels, shielding the population against price shocks. Early, targeted spending is a cost-saving measure – delays lead to higher long-term spending due to climate-related disasters, economic disruption and energy price instability. While private investment will eventually play a dominant role, the climate committee makes it clear that public spending remains necessary in areas where market forces alone can’t drive change fast enough.Labour must recognise the state’s crucial role in the green transition. BP’sretreatfrom renewables proves private firms can’t be trusted to phase out fossil fuels. A Common Wealthreportis clear: profit-driven companies prioritise extraction over climate action. In January, it argued public ownership is the only credible way to manage the £43bn North Sea decommissioning costs while ensuring a just transition. While it must be carefully managed to avoid inefficiency, public control remains the best way to phase out fossil fuels fairly and smoothly. The UK can’t rely on foreign supply chains for green tech, or corporate goodwill to deliver net zero. Without a serious state-led green strategy, Labour’s plan risks falling short of the challenge Britain faces.Explore more on these topicsGreen economyOpinionEconomic policyClimate crisisFossil fuelsEnergyKeir StarmerRachel ReeveseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Countries pushing global tax reform at the UN will be watching as US demands for subjugation play out in plain sight. Hisday-one threatto punish nations taxing US firms is an all-out attack on global fiscal cooperation. If multilateralism in taxation was already on shaky ground, Mr Trump’s return could bury it for good.Under discussion is a new UN tax convention that may permit states to tax economic activity where it actually occurs, rather than allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) said last year that nations lose$492bn(£390bn) annually due to corporate tax abuse. The global south bears the greatest losses, which undermine public services like health and education. If enacted, the convention would create a legally binding framework requiring multinationals to pay tax where they employ staff and do real business – not where they stash profits. This would replace the outdated arm’s-length principle with unitary taxation, ensuring fair profit allocation. It would mean an end toAmazon,GoogleandAppleputting billions through lower-tax jurisdictions while extracting wealth from higher-tax ones.Before Mr Trump’s election, about half of global tax losses were facilitated by theeight nationsopposed to a UN tax convention – Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and the US. Yet opposition takes two forms: constructive and destructive. When negotiations for the UN framework convention on international tax cooperation beganlast month, all participants committed to the convention’s principles except Mr Trump’s delegate, who walked out in defiance, calling on others to follow. The expected exodus never came. Washington was left isolated. Mr Trump’s “America first” became “America alone”.But the US still has tremendous clout. As TJN’s newreport, The International Tax Consequences of President Trump, highlights, talks among 120-plus nations on taxing cross-border digital services – led by the US-dominated OECD – are grinding towards a showdown. Mr Trump’s tariff threats againstCanadaand the EU are warning shots, aimed at countries daring to raise tax rates on multinationals, especially US ones. This fight isn’t just about taxation; it’s about sovereignty. Mr Trump’s administration is trying to strong-arm nations into preserving a system that shields corporate profits from fair taxation. The difference now is that the world is pushing back.For decades, the US has had an unofficial veto over global tax rules, using its heft to shape – and thenreject– OECD-led proposals. But this approach is no longer sustainable. The growing coalition behind the UN tax convention shows that many governments prefer to chart their own course. Mr Trump’s return forces a stark choice: stick with a broken system that fuels tax abuse or push forward without the US. Any attempt to tax multinationals fairly will face American retaliation, but clinging to the OECD’s US-dominated framework is a dead end.A united front at the UN is needed to forge a global tax system not dictated by Washington’s whims. Thecluster munitions conventionsucceeded without US involvement, proving international norms can shift without it. The world doesn’t need US approval to fix global taxation. It needs the will to move forward together.Explore more on these topicsCorporate governanceOpinionUnited NationsTax avoidanceTechnology sectorDonald TrumpOECDGlobal economyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

In theory, it’s an excellent idea – a 2% tax could raise $250bn – but how would it work in practice? The entire tax system in the UK is deliberately complicated and cunningly designed to work for the wealthy.How do you tax a billionaire who spends most of the year trying out their new deck shoes on a yacht or slumming it in a tax haven? Jim Ratcliffe, who used to pay more than £100m a year in tax in the UK,decamped to Monacoreportedly to save himself £4bn.

This began breaking down when experts were no longer valued, critical thinking undermined and public discourse increasingly polarised.In this world, traditional sources of knowledge have been increasingly rejected. Books, journal articles and old media are challenged by developments in information presentation and retrieval, most notably through apps and social media. It has led to the “Tinderfication” of knowledge.Curated reading lists, for example, which academics spend time on researching, highlighting key thinkers and writings, are often overlooked by students in favour of a Google search. If a student does not like what they read, they can simply swipe left. Algorithms can then send students in unexpected directions, often diverting them away from academic rigour to non-academic resources.It is important that students have access to learning materials 24/7. But does knowledge become another convenience food? It is available at the touch of a button online, is effectively delivered to your door and there are so many outlets to choose from. There might be quantity, but not necessarily quality: AI is the ultimate convenience food.This raises fundamental questions about not just what we mean by knowledge, but also what the role of education, and academics, will be in the future. I can appreciate the benefits of AI in the sciences, economics or mathematics, where facts are often unquestionable, but what about the humanities and social sciences, where much is contestable?We are rapidly losing ground to profound societal changes that could have unimaginable consequences for universities if we do not respond quickly.Prof Andrew MoranLondon Metropolitan UniversityAs a university lecturer in the humanities, where essays remain a key means of assessment, I am not surprised to hear that there has been an explosive increase in the use of AI. It is aggressively promoted as a time-saving good by tech companies, and wider political discourse only reinforces this view without questioning AI’s limitations and ethics.While AI may be useful in several academic contexts – in writing basic reports and conducting initial research, for example – its use by students to write essays is indicative of the devaluing of humanities subjects and a misunderstanding of what original writing in disciplines such as history, literature and philosophy enables: critical thinking.“How can I tell what I think till I see what I say?” asked the great novelist EM Forster. He meant that writing is a sophisticated form of thinking, and that learning to write well, to feel one’s way through the development of an idea or argument, is at the heart of writing. When we ask AI to write an essay, we are not simply outsourcing labour, we are outsourcing our thinking and its development, which over time will only render us more confused and less intelligent.In a neoliberal technological age in which we are often obsessed with a product rather than the process by which it was made, it is hardly surprising that the true value of writing is being overlooked.Studentsare simply taking their cues from a world losing touch with the irreplaceable value of human creativity and critical thinking.Dr Ben WilkinsonSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

And I’m not naive, that’s why I’m here, at 40 years old, ­coaching Manchester United.”Rooney, working as a BBC pundit, said: “I think it’s a little naive to say they’re looking to win the Premier League because from where they are now, they’re a long way off that.”View image in fullscreenBernd Leno saves from Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee to win the penalty shootout.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBruno Fernandes’s second‑half goal levelled out Calvin Bassey’s opener just before half‑time before Victor Lindelöf and Joshua ­Zirkzee had their spot-kicks saved by Bernd Leno, sending ­Fulham through.Amorim defended André Onana who, rather than quickly start an attack to search for a ­winner in normal time, ­dawdled over a 78th‑minute goal‑kick and then did the same later. “It is also frustration for André, he is trying to read the team,” Amorim said, before referencing themidweek defeat of Ipswichwhen Patrick Dorgu was sent off before half-time.“Our team was so tired, we played the last game with one less player in the second half and he is using that time to rest a bit for us to go for the second goal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would rule out one of Newcastle’s leading players for the Wembley showpiece against Liverpool in two weeks’ time.Welbeck fires Brighton into quarter-finals as Gordon red hurts NewcastleRead moreGiven the nature of the offence the likelihood of a successful appeal seems remote but Howe said that course of action was possible following a review. “I don’t know quite what’s happened,” he said. “It’s very difficult to form an opinion. I haven’t seen a replay. But my original thought was it looked harsh.“I’m sure his intention wasn’t to harm anyone. I’ve only seen Anthony briefly and he was very disappointed. I don’t think he’s gone in with any malice or intention to do harm. I’ve got to see it properly before giving a big opinion. But that’s not a common sight with Anthony.“It’s very disappointing for Anthony and the team but the old cliche is that one person’s disappointment creates a big opportunity for someone else.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe and his players looks dejected after Newcastle’s defeat by Brighton.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersHowe was shattered by Danny Welbeck’s extra-time winner for Brighton after Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead from the penalty spot and Yankuba Minteh equalised.When Isak left the pitch accompanied by a physiotherapist three minutes from normal time, Newcastle fans feared a recurrence of the Sweden striker’s recent groin injury but Howe seemed reasonably relaxed. “I think it was cramp more than anything,” he said. “Just general tightness, not an injury. I don’t think there’s a big problem there. Fingers crossed, Alex is OK.”There was less positive news regarding Newcastle’s left-back Lewis Hall, who missed the tie with an ankle injury. That problem is sufficiently serious to have necessitated scans and their results have prompted an appointment with a specialist scheduled for this week. The sense is that Hall could well miss the Carabao Cup final while Sven Botman, who did not recover from a knee injury in time to be involved against Brighton, also appears touch and go for Wembley.“I’m desperately disappointed to have lost,” Howe said. “It was a tough contest, both teams gave everything, there were a lot of emotions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our character was impressive. We had to suffer at times but we stayed calm and always stayed together. In the end we found the right solution. I’m really pleased.”Hürzeler singled out Welbeck for special praise after the 34-year-old striker – a player two years his senior – stepped off the bench to seal the tie. “Danny’s special,” he said. “He’s a great leader, a great role model and a great player.”Brighton’s manager was certainly not about to pour cold water on suggestions that an unlikely England recall could beckon for Welbeck. “It might be possible,” he said. “But it’s not my decision, all I can say is I’m very happy to work with Danny.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupEddie HoweNewcastle UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Relegation could then be reinstated in the 2030-31 campaign, although that is not guaranteed.Geyse describes ‘lonely feeling’ amid Manchester United loan allegationsRead moreThe plans received a cautious welcome from the 23 WSL and Championship clubs at a presentation fronted by the WPLL chief executive, Nikki Doucet, at their quarterly shareholders’ meeting on Friday, which several sources who attended described as a positive meeting. The clubs are understood to have agreed to continue discussing and refining the proposals before putting the new structure to a vote at the end of the season.The removal of relegation is the most controversial element, but many clubs are equally concerned with the mechanism to be used to determine promotion from the Championship. A number of models are understood to be under consideration, with several clubs pushing for a playoff system.While any club seeking promotion will have to adhere to minimum-standards criteria, there is a strong feeling that on-field performance and league position should be the deciding factors, rather than adopting a licensing system similar to that brought in by rugby league to determine the composition of the Super League. In a less controversial change that is indicative of the desire for greater alignment in the women’s game, the Championship is set to be rebranded as WSL2 from next season.View image in fullscreenBristol City’s Amy Rodgers scores an own goal in the defeat by Manchester City that confirmed her side’s relegation from the WSL last year.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe WPLL declined to comment when contacted, but sources at the company now responsible for running the women’s game confirmed that the discussions will continue. The clubs will have the final say at their end‑of‑season meeting, but other stakeholders will also be consulted, including players, fans and the Football Association.For the proposals to go through, they will need a two-thirds majority of member clubs to vote in favour when they reconvene at the end of April.For alterations to be made to the relegation/promotion structure, at least eight clubs must vote in favour in each division, a balloting structure that gives a huge amount of influence to a handful of Championship clubs. If the clubs agree to the changes proposed by the WPLL they will then be passed to the FA board for ratification, although that will be a formality.The WPLL has had some notable successes since taking over from the FA last summer, securing in the past six months a £65m, five-year TV deal with Sky Sports and the BBC and a three-year title sponsorship for the WSLwith Barclays worth £45m, giving it confidence to pursue an expansionist agenda. The rationale behind the proposal is that removing the threat of relegation would encourage owners to invest and help to develop a more competitive WSL, which despite growing attendances is in danger of stagnating on the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlthough many clubs are fearful of losing out there is a recognition among the majority that structural changes could be beneficial.Chelsea have won the past five WSL titlesand are unbeaten this season under their new manager, Sonia Bompastor, while clubs promoted from the Championship have struggled to make an impact. Bristol City were relegated after one season in the WSL which brought just one win and six points, while Crystal Palace are on course to follow them in going straight back down this year, with a poor record of one win in their opening 14 games leading to the sacking of their manager Laura Kaminski.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace manager Laura Kaminski was sacked last week with her team, promoted to the WSL last season, looking likely to go straight back down.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEstablishing a fully professional top two divisions for the women’s game was one of the key recommendations of the government-commissioned Karen Carney review in 2023. Under the leadership of Doucet, the WPLL is determined to achieve that and is committed to an expansion of the entire pyramid.In a setback to that agenda, the Championship was reduced to 11 clubs this season when Reading voluntarily dropped down to the fifth tier after their owner, Dai Yongge, removed funding for the women’s operation as he attempts to sell the club. With an eye on future expansion the WPLL has had informal discussions with Premier League clubs whose women’s teams are outside the top two divisions, including Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth and Brentford, to establish their level of commitment.A club source who attended the meeting on Friday said: “The new leadership have shown they’re willing to do things differently and look at new ideas, which is encouraging. They have developed an interesting concept and [are] giving us all something to think about.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballWomen’s ChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

Maher, who joined the PWR to aid her bid to make the USA squad for this year’s Rugby World Cup, did not rule out a return to the English top flight: “I never say never. It was amazing I even got to come and play here for two and a half months. I hope that even when I am not playing this league continues to grow and we can get these numbers out to games even when I am not there.”Ireland and France’s battle for alpha status reminds me of Arsenal v United | Ugo MonyeRead moreMaher was visibly emotional at the defeat but it came at the hands of a Gloucester side whose form in the second half of the season has been impressive. After losing at home to Bristol in November, they won their final nine regular-season matches to top the table and secure a home semi-final.A player who left her mark on those wins is the full-back Emma Sing, whose accurate boot kept the scoreboard ticking in the semi-final. Her performance may boost her England chances with the Women’s Six Nations on the horizon as the Red Roses head coach John Mitchell was watching on alongside the 6,702 fans at the temporarily renamed Queensholm.Red smoke and fireworks, soundtracked by The Greatest Show, welcomed the teams to the pitch and the semi-final more than lived up to the song choice. The opening 28 minutes were completely dominated by Bristol and, though they scored two tries through Lark Atkin-Davies, they should have capitalised more on their momentum with multiple visits to the 22 adding nothing to the scoreboard.Bristol’s inability to twist the knife came back to haunt them as Gloucester were much more clinical when their chances came. Two visits to the 22 yielded two tries, through Ellena Perry and Sarah Beckett, and with the boot of Sing the hosts edged ahead.View image in fullscreenEmma Sing crosses the line to score a try for Gloucester.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockBristol’s afternoon got worse with a yellow card for their No 8 Evie Gallagher for a high tackle on Pip Hendy. The resulting kick to the corner saw Gloucester attempt a driving maul but, with it stalling, they whipped the ball out and fed Sing who crashed over to give Gloucester a 19-10 lead at the break.Maher’s try kicked off the second-half action but Gloucester drew next blood with their co-captain Zoe Aldcroft dotting down. The try of the match came next with the replacement wing Millie David finishing a superb effort, the score bringing her level with Saracens’ May Campbell for top try-scorer this league season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aldcroft said: “I think it would be a legacy for this group. To create history would be absolutely unbelievable so we are going to give it everything over the next two weeks to go and do that.”The post-match applause from fans was not only celebrating the hosts’ win but also commemorating head coach Sean Lynn’s time at the club. Lynn will leave Gloucester after the PWR final as he has been appointedthe Wales women head coach. That meant the semi-final was his final home game in charge. Lynn said: “I have put my heart and soul into five years with Gloucester-Hartpury. My family, they just love it. When I talk about inspiring, these girls, players and staff have inspired my three kids. That is what sport is about, these girls are unbelievable.

While Rodri has spoken optimistically of playing again this term, Guardiola has been far more cautious, suggesting it was not worth the risk even if possible.Manchester City survive early scare to beat Plymouth via O’Reilly’s doubleRead moreNow it seems, however, that Rodri’s progress has exceeded expectations and he could feature again before the end of the domestic season and play a part at the Club World Cup in the summer. Guardiola said: “The fans must know they are not the only ones who are excited. But one step at a time, we don’t have to make stupid decisions to come back weeks earlier and [suffer] steps back. It’s good but still he’s not close to coming back, I would say.“But he’s touching the ball and he was in the locker room making touches with the players. He feels confident, he feels more happy. I could not expect before [him to return] but maybe before the end of the season in the Premier League, maybe, it’s going to happen.”On the downside for City, defender Nathan Aké looks set for another layoff after being forced off at half-time in Saturday’s3-1 victory against Plymouthin the FA Cup fifth round.The Dutchman would join a casualty list that also includes fellow centre-backs John Stones and Manuel Akanji, both of whom are set to miss most of the rest of the season. Guardiola said: “We’ll do the test but he struggles sometimes with the foot, with the bone, probably. It’s been like this the whole season, unfortunately, for the central defenders. Hopefully the young ones can sustain it and help us until the end.”City moved into the FA Cup quarter-finals as they came from behind to see off Championship side Plymouth with two goals from teenager Nico O’Reilly and a strike from Kevin De Bruyne.Guardiola, however, is not happy with the characteristics of the balls being used in the cup, feeling they behave differently from those used in other elite events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Women’s Super League club are hoping to conclude a deal in the coming days before the start of the new NWSL season on 14 March.On Sunday Geyse described feeling “lonely” and being in agony after coming on as a late substitute in the 2-0 victory over Leicester in a post on social media.World’s first $1m women’s footballer Girma has Chelsea debut cut shortRead moreHer comments came on the same evening that Geyse’s agent alleged to the Telegraph that Manchester United had tried to loan Geyse to other clubs while she was at her brother’s funeral in January. A spokesperson forManchester United Womensaid: “We continue to support Geyse in her wellbeing, and are continuing to look for options which suit all parties.”Writing on Instagram, the Brazil forward did not specifically mention Manchester United but wrote: “Staying in a place where we don’t feel happy is an agonising and lonely feeling. Every day seems heavier, and the simple fact of being there becomes a burden. The environment, which should be welcoming, becomes a field of discomfort, where inner peace is difficult to find.”Geyse signed from Barcelona in 2023 and the 26-year-old has since scored two league goals for the club. In January she was granted compassionate leave by the club after her brother’s death. Manchester United are understood to have been working closely with Geyse to find the right solution for her at a difficult time, including options to move to be closer to her family.According to club sources, Manchester United would prefer not to lose Geyse at an important point in the season but the former Benfica and Corinthians forward is keen on a move to North America, so different options have been explored.On Sunday her agent Luís Filipe Silva said to the Telegraph: “As you know, her brother passed away, she is going through a very difficult time, it is a very difficult time psychologically and at Man United she is not having the best time.“The club has clearly shown that it does not count on Geyse, Man United tried to loan Geyse to a club in the USA, but the player has the right to decide about her future and the club she will play for. The best solution for all parties is to leave and, I repeat, Man United was the first to try to loan the player when she was at her brother’s funeral.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is on compassionate leave. In reality – I’ve said this and I think you know this – I don’t do [the] business side. The club is on the business side [for transfer negotiations].

London-based project gives scientists hopeExperts hope research can create greener methods of extracting the metal vital for renewable energy revolution and boom in electrical devicesRobin McKieSun 2 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTShareIt is the key ingredient of bronze, the alloy that helped create some of the world’s greatest civilisations and took humanity out of the stone age on its way to modern times. For good measure, the metal is invaluable for electrical wiring, plumbing and industrial machinery. We owe a lot to copper.But the metal now faces an uncertain future as manufacturers prepare to expand its use to make the electric cars, renewable power plants and other devices that will help the planet move towards net zero. Unrestricted extraction could causewidespread ecological devastation, scientists have warned.The issue is to be the prime focus for the new Rio Tinto Centre for Future Materials, based at Imperial College London in partnership with several international university groups. A total of $150m has been set aside for its first 10 years of operations.“The world needs to electrify its energy systems, and success will absolutely depend on copper,” materials scientist and Imperial vice-provost Prof Mary Ryan, one of the centre’s founders, told theObserverlast week. “The metal is going to be the biggest bottleneck in this process. So, in setting up the centre, we decided copper would be the first challenge that we dealt with – though we will turn our attention to other materials in future.”View image in fullscreenConveyor belt and processing plant at an open-pit copper mine in Chile.Photograph: Jose Luis Stephens/AlamyThis point was backed by Dr Sarah Gordon, the centre’s co-director. “Our first aim is to find new, responsible ways to source metals – in particular copper. Can we extract it without disturbing rocks at all? Or could we use viruses and bacteria to harvest copper? These are the first crucial questions the centre aims to answer.”Copper has become essential for powering devices ranging from smartphones to electric vehicles because it transmits electricity with minimal loss of power and is resistant to corrosion. Around 22m tonnes of copper were mined in 2023, a 30% increase from 2010, and annual demand will reach around 50m tonnes by 2050, say analysts.Such an output will have enormous environmental consequences because copper mining uses acids that poison rivers, contaminate soil and pollute the air. Producers such as Peru, Chile and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have seen natural habitats destroyed, wildlife populations wiped out and human health damaged near mines.Deep-sea mining has been proposed, but the idea horrifies marine biologists, who say such enterprises would devastate sea life.The aim of the new centre is to find ways round these problems and help provide the materials the world will need to reach net zero. It is funded by the mining group Rio Tinto and hosted by Imperial College London in partnership with the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, the University of California, Berkeley, the Australian National University and the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.One key project is seeking new ways to mine copper. “We typically extract it from minerals that have crystallised out of very saline, copper-rich brines,” said Professor Matthew Jackson, chair in geological fluid dynamics at Imperial College. “However, this process requires huge amounts of energy to break open the rocks and bring them to the surface and also generates a lot of waste as we extract copper from its source ores.”To get round this issue, Jackson, working with international partners, has been searching for underground sites where copper-rich brines are still in liquid form. These brines are created by volcanic systems which can, crucially, provide geothermal energy for extraction.“That means we can extract the copper by pumping the brines to the surface via boreholes – which is relatively easy – and also use local energy to power the mine itself and possibly provide excess energy for nearby communities,” Jackson said. “Essentially, we are seeking to build self-powered mines and have already pinpointed promising sites in New Zealand, and there is potential to explore conventionally barren areas such as Japan.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Currently, we do not have enough in circulation to meet this demand.“We therefore need to both reduce our demand for copper and work out how to extract it in the most sustainable way possible, and that is what we aim to help to achieve at the centre.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe ObserverResearch and developmentPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Just five months later few expected an announcement that could result in UK aid spending falling to its lowest level this century.Overseas development aid will fall from0.5% of the UK’s gross national income to 0.3%– a cut of about £6bn – in order to pay for increased defence spending.The cut will have dire consequences, according to the groups delivering much of that aid. Describing it as a betrayal of poorer countries, Dr Alvaro Bermejo, director general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, says: “This will cost lives.”Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister,resigned over the decisionon Friday.UK aidfunds projects offering humanitarian assistance and health services, as well as work with communities suffering the frontline effects of the climate crisis and conflict.The announcement follows the Trump administration’s sweepingcuts to US aid, which, among other crushing effects on the world’s poorest people, have resulted inabrupt haltsto life-saving HIV drug programmes in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Humanitarian work in refugee camps, hospitals and healthcare centres has stopped in many of the 177 countries helped by USAid, while funding for groups working on the frontline of the climate crisis has vanished. Human rights and independent journalism organisations also face closure.It is also part of a wider trend – a pattern of cuts to aid spending in countries that have historically been leading donors, including Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Canadalooks as if it will follow suit, if its Conservative party wins forthcoming elections.The scale and speed of the cuts now facing the sector is unprecedented, and decisions made in response will have wide-ranging implications for global health and security for generations to come. Neither philanthropy nor domestic funding within countries receiving the aid is likely to be able to fill the vast gaps left as western countries withdraw.Jean-Michel Grand, director of Action AgainstHungerUK, says the world is seeing a “radical politicisation of aid” in which it was talked about in terms of trade, prosperity and security, with “the whole ambition of addressing poverty very secondary and not even mentioned”.View image in fullscreenA displacement camp in Matarara, Mozambique, where help is being delivered by UK aid.Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty ImagesInternationally agreed norms, such as respect for humanitarian laws or agreement on important development targets, are at stake, says Grand. And the shift posed ethical questions for aid organisations, he adds. “What are the conditions that are going to be attached to getting a grant [in the future]?”Since 1970, the UN has set atargetfor countries to spend 0.7% of their gross national income on overseas development assistance. The target has since been accepted by successive British governments and, after a surge in investment during the Blair and Brown years, was achieved by the UK in 2013 for the first time, and made a statutory duty in 2015.The British public still cares, says Grand, pointing to generous donations to Disasters Emergency Committee appeals. But aid has become an “easy target”, with political rhetoric that “leads to some doubts within the public about how useful or impactful aid is.View image in fullscreenConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg delivers a petition in 2018 calling for the 0.7% GDP commitment to be scrapped.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock“Clearly, none of these decisions, whether the British, the American, the German, could have happened if there would have been a political risk for the government,” says Grand.Aid organisations must take some responsibility for failing to make the case, he says. Now the sector will need to “rethink … the aid structure that we want to have, the role of international NGOs, and what are we standing for”, he says. “What happens to the international NGOs, etc – that is not the most important thing. What is important is more the goal – how are we going to alleviate poverty, malnutrition, and how are we going to try to mitigate the risk of future conflict, because of poverty, because of hunger, because of climate change? And it’s not by disinvesting.”The volte-face by the US and others not only causes financial issues for NGOs, but damages delicate relationships built up over years, Grand says.In 2021, Boris Johnson’s Tory government reduced spending to 0.5%, with parliament voting that the 0.7% commitment could be suspendeduntil certain fiscal testswere met.An impact assessment at the timeconcededthat those cuts would mean thousands of deaths, including of malnourished or unvaccinated children, and women left without safe abortion services.One of the interesting things is that in the cold war, aid went up, because countries were seeking to influence othersIan Mitchell, the Center for Global DevelopmentIn its manifesto, and repeatedly in power, Labour had promised to restore spending to 0.7% “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”. Itinsiststhat commitment is still true.However, in recent years, UK governments have been spending about 40% of the aid budget in the UK itself to cover housing and administrative costs for refugees.“The lowest ever share of income the UK spent on international aid was in 1999, at 0.24%,” says Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. However, at that time, “we didn’t used to count refugee costs in aid”.Even if refugee costs can be brought down to £2bn, less than half the £4.3bn spent last year, Mitchell says, “the actual amount of non-refugee aid will fall to an all-time low”.There are nowcallsfor Home Office spending on refugees to be subject to a cap so that true international aid spending can be protected.Aid can be delivered bilaterally, in an arrangement directly between countries, or multilaterally, through organisations funded by several countries and donors.View image in fullscreenWork to clear landmines in South Sudan is one of the programmes supported by aid funding from the UK.Photograph: Sean Sutton/Courtesy of MAGThe cuts come at the same time as many leading multilateral aid organisations, such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, are seeking renewed funding. The impact on those efforts of the trend for lower aid spending is as yet unclear.The US under Trump is pulling back from multilateral organisations including theWorld Health OrganizationandUNAids. Mitchell said the UK did, however, seem committed to multilateral efforts – it has committed to co-host fundraising efforts for the Global Fund this year, alongside South Africa.More globally, however, “there are pressures to spend bilaterally and geopolitically”, he says. “And what I think is one of the really interesting things is that in the cold war, aid went up, precisely because countries were seeking to influence others. And so it’s interesting that in what is effectively a rerun of the cold war, exactly the opposite is happening – at least [in] the west.”China does not seem to be stepping back from aid projects, although Dr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, says: “China has been more focused on infrastructure. So if they can fill that gap, then you have to look for other partners for services like health workforce and commodities.”Starmer’s announcement will not see UK spending stop suddenly, but it will take effect over the next two years. However, the US withdrawal has been abrupt and chaotic. American spending accounts for 50% of all development assistance to Africa and will be “difficult to replace”, says Gitahi.Cuts to UK vaccine funding could lead to ‘huge numbers’ of child deaths overseasRead moreSpeaking as hundreds of notices of termination started to arrive at HIV projects funded by the US in sub-Saharan Africa, Prof Linda-Gail Bekker of the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in South Africa, said it would mean “deep trouble” for the region.“It lets the tiger out of the cage again [via an uncontrolled HIV epidemic], if you want to see it from a purely global threat point of view,” she says.And while there was the temptation to look for other funders around the world, “there’s real concern about where Europe and other countries are themselves”, she says. “We see no way out of this other than needing to see our own governments fill this gap.”That is likely to be hard for many countries struggling with debt and lower budgets. Gitahi says that even if African governments moved towards allocating 15% of their budgets to health spending – an African Uniontarget– “15% of an elephant is very different from 15% of a chicken. And here we’re talking about 15% of a chicken.”View image in fullscreenA sand sculpture in India celebrates World Aids Day. The end of aid funding is causing concerns about a resurgence of the disease.Photograph: Asit Kumar/AFP/Getty ImagesStarmer says the UK is entering an era where “hard power” needed to take precedence, choosing defence spending over aid because “the national security of our country must always come first”.Care International UK’s chief executive, Helen McEachern, is among many describing that as a false choice. “Not only does this decision do irreparable harm to his government’s reputation, it ignores the vital role aid plays in making the UK and our world safer, healthier, and more sustainable for everyone,” she says.“A true measure of our international standing is how we choose to treat those who are most vulnerable, exposed, and in danger. Make no mistake, this decision will endanger the lives of the world’s most vulnerable. At a time of increasing international instability and attacks on fundamental human rights, the UK should be standing up for compassion and partnerships, not joining a race to the bottom.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With her income now cut off, her daughter’s academic future is uncertain.“My younger brother has also lost his job. As a family, we had been pooling our resources to support our 78-year-old mother, who has been living with HIV for the past 20 years.“Her survival has depended on the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a programme largely supported by USAid funding. This disruption has not only ended our monthly contributions to her upkeep but has also raised concerns about the continued accessibility of life-sustaining medication. Thousands of lives here are at risk.”As of 2022, approximately 1.3 million people in Zambia were receiving ART, covering about 95% of the individuals living with HIV in the country (source: beintheknow.org).Among the most heartbreaking cases Mumba had heard of was a woman who killed herself after being laid off from a USAid-funded project.“A close colleague told me of their distressing final interaction. They said, ‘She actually sent me a text message in the morning, expressing how devastated she was … She wished the earth could just open wide and swallow her alive.’ Later that day, news broke that she had taken her own life, unable to cope.“Social media here has been flooded with similar reports of young people who have taken drastic actions following sudden job losses.For many, the loss of aid is more than just a policy decision. It is a matter of life and death.”Women and girls, South SudanView image in fullscreenSchoolgirls walk home after being turned away from their school due to an extreme heatwave that has caused some students to collapse in Juba, South Sudan.Photograph: Florence Miettaux/APAtong* is the manager of a safe house sheltering survivors of gender-based violence in Juba, capital ofSouth Sudan.“I’m very concerned,” she said. “Except for one social worker who is staying as a volunteer, all our five staff members have had to stop working due to funding constraints.“Since we opened in October 2022 thanks to money from USAid, we have hosted more than a hundred women and girls. A counsellor, trainers in livelihood and literacy, and two matrons have been helping women rebuild themselves and imagine a future – helping them find a job, go back to school or start a little business.“Additional US funding had been pledged at the end of 2024, but now Mr Trump’s orders jeopardises our future.“Five women and five children are currently here. One survivor whose five-year-old daughter was raped, and who was threatened by the perpetrators when she tried to seek justice, was on a list of refugees accepted for resettlement to the US. But that is also off now, so she has to start from scratch. She broke down when we told her.“I have been buying food for the house with my own money. But the pressure keeps mounting, the rent is due. Every time the landlord calls me, I get anxiety. This situation is taking a toll on my mental health. Where are these women going to go if the safe house collapses?”Hunger, BurundiView image in fullscreenDisplaced Congolese children wait to receive relief food from Burundian volunteers at Rugombo Stadium on 18 February.Photograph: Evrard Ngendakumana/ReutersOvernight, the rug was yanked out from under us, slashing the services we can provide. The most drastic impact has been on malnourished children, since most supplies were provided by USAid.We have succeeded in finding enough ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) to offer nine children a complete course of treatment, but we are down to our last container of F-75, a therapeutic milk for the sickest among the starving, too weak or little to consume the peanut-based supplements. Further stretching meagre supplies, 50,000 refugees fleeing war in Democratic Republic of the Congo streamed intoBurundilast weekend.We have no idea how to feed the multitudes. We are dismayed that the UK and other governments appear to be following America’s lead, falling dominoes nudging vulnerable families further into peril.Throughout history, hunger has been weaponised. In this epoch, when wielded by the world’s wealthiest nation, it seems especially cruel. Food grown by American farmers is languishing in ports around the globe.The hospital I support in rural Burundi sits atop a steep hill. The land – donated to our organisation Village Health Works – is a dignified setting for medical care. Still, I worry about the paths people have to travel to reach it. The road is rocky, full of turns. Since there are limited vehicles in the region, many patients climb, requiring heroic effort from the sick. The bravest trekkers are the mothers, moving their own weight up the dirt road with babies on their backs. Their determination inspires our staff to work night and day, often to the point of exhaustion.At the end of their slog, the women used to arrive knowing their little ones would receive comprehensive treatment. Now, we face them with emptier hands.Dr Jennifer Furin* Names have been changed.

They are also falling through the gaps of UK terrorism lawsLizzie DeardenSun 2 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTShareOn the morning of 13 September, 18-year-old Nicholas Prosper was arrested while walking on a residential road in Luton. Minutes before, he had murdered his mother, younger brother and sister, shooting them dead in their family home.Neighbours called police after hearing gunfire coming from the flat in Leabank tower, on Luton’s Marsh Farm estate, and officers found Prosper shortly afterwards on Bramingham Road. Later that day, searches of the area uncovered a loaded shotgun and more than 30 cartridges hidden in a nearby bush.Police now believe Prosper had only carried out the first half of his plan, and was plotting a shooting at St Joseph’s Catholic primary school, where he and his siblings were pupils years before. The location where the teenager was detained sits on the most direct walking route between his home and the school, meaning the incident could be the closest Britain has come to a school shooting since the 1996 Dunblane massacre.Police revealed the plot after Prosper pleaded guilty on Monday to murdering his mother, Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle Prosper, 13, and brother Kyle Prosper, 16.Detective Chief Inspector Sam Khanna, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire MajorCrimeUnit, said: “What was uncovered during our investigation left no doubt as to his intentions to carry out an attack at a school, but fortunately Prosper was apprehended before he could cause any further harm.”The case is one of a growing number of school-shooting plots detected in the UK, where young men and boys are being inspired by online material glorifying US massacres, including the 1999 Columbine High School shooting. In the year to March 2024, 162 referrals were made to Prevent (the government-led counter-terrorism scheme) related to interest in school massacres, up 2% on the year before. Only 19 resulted in people being adopted for intervention and mentoring under the programme.Under current laws, would-be school shooters who lack an ideological aim cannot be prosecuted for preparing acts of terrorism. Cases have therefore been dealt with using a wide range of laws, including conspiracy to murder and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.Jonathan Hall KC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, said these cases were a “worry” and that tracking the extent of the problem was difficult. “School shooting obsessions crop up in a lot of counter-terrorism casework,” he told theObserver. “The question is … is the size of the problem fully recognised, and is there something so unique about this cohort that additional ways of managing the risk needs to be found?”View image in fullscreenThe victims of Nicholas Prosper: his sister Giselle, mother Juliana and brother Kyle.Photograph: Bedfordshire Police/PAHall said that school-shooting plots that do not involve an ideological cause do not come under the legal definition of terrorism, but appear to be “very appealing to individuals with a strong sense of grievance”.“Given the young age at which people are now coming across the counter-terrorism radar, perhaps it’s not surprising that a major source of grievance is their school,” he added.Three days before Prosper lodged his guilty pleas, an unnamed 17-year-old boy admitted wanting to carry out a mass shooting at his school in Edinburgh, having “idolised” the Columbine killers and openly talked to fellow pupils of his admiration.Last January, a gun-obsessed Lidl warehouse worker was found to be building an armoury of homemade firearms and explosives for both a “hitman-style attack” on police and his work colleagues, and a separate bombing and mass shooting plot against his former school. Reed Wischhusen, then 31, again took inspiration from the Columbine massacre, as did Gloucestershire teenager Kyle Davies, whose own plans were foiled when authorities intercepted a Glock handgun and ammunition he ordered online.Weeks after Davies was arrested in 2018, two boys were jailed for plotting a mass shooting at their Yorkshire secondary school when they were just 14. Thomas Wyllie and Alex Bolland idolised the Columbine shooters and a judge found that they wanted to create “terror on the scale of the school shootings that have been seen in America”, having drawn up a hit-list including fellow pupils and teachers, collected explosives manuals and planned to steal shotguns for the task.“If this is found I have committed one of the worst atrocities in British history or I killed myself,” Wyllie wrote in his diary. “I hate my school. I will obliterate it. I will kill everyone.”While only a small number of school massacre plots have been formally confirmed and prosecuted in the UK, many more have been suspected. Police who investigated the Southport attack believe that Axel Rudakubana’s original target may have been his former secondary school, but that he changed his plans after his father prevented him taking a taxi there on the last day of term, which was a week before his attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. In 2019, he had been reported to Prevent after a teacher saw him researchingUS school shootingsduring an IT class.Prosper, meanwhile, will be sentenced later this month, and his guilty pleas mean that the details of his inspiration, planning and preparation have not yet been made public.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Videos uploaded on his YouTube channel demonstrated an obsession with a video game, with a vow to “mutilate” his sister for “making the incorrect choices” relating to a child character. Prosper called himself the character’s “chosen one”, saying he was guided by the fictional eight-year-old girl “as Christans are guided by Jesus Christ”.His online footprint also indicated a strong interest in school shootings. Email addresses linked to the teenager appeared to pay homage to Adam Lanza, who carried out the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, while his Instagram page included drawings of Lanza and the Columbine shooters.All three men are widely glorified in online communities that focus on mass killings, with TikTok videos, drawings and fanfiction regularly posted online by fans around the world. Researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue have been tracking these online movements, where they say young people are forging an “emotional connection” and “parasocial relationship” with past mass shooters.Senior analyst Cody Zoschak said the forums were driving a “combination of self-radicalisation and group-enforcing radicalisation” towards violence. “The subcultures are very closely intertwined with each other and with ideological communities, particularly the far right,” he added.“But right now, there’s no bucket for these people to be put in by the authorities, so they’re being treated like ideologically motivated individuals, or they’re slipping through the cracks because they don’t fit the criteria.”Gina Vale, a University of Southampton criminologist who co-authored a landmark report on teenage terror offenders in England and Wales, said that school shooters are “leading by example” for British children who aspire to their own attacks.“School shootings in the US perpetrated by teenagers provide a tangible example to children and young people in the UK of committing mass violence,” she said. “The massacre at Columbine High School has become prominent among violent extremist youth who seek to emulate not only the achievement of mass casualties, but also the symbolism of the attackers – down to and including the distinctive clothing worn during the massacre.”Zoschak believes the phenomenon is part of a wider trend towards “nihilistic violence” that is markedly different from the ideological terrorism that security systems in the UK were designed to tackle. “The violence is emotional and self-serving rather than political or ideological, and there’s really no desired consequence – the violence is the point,” he said.A government spokesperson said an independent inquiry into the Southport killings will be looking at the wider challenge of rising youth violence and extremism to ensure no one falls through the cracks.“We continue to work at pace to identify the nature and scale of a growing cohort fixated with violence and to improve multi-agency interventions to manage the risk they pose,” they said.Explore more on these topicsCrimeThe ObserverGun crimeUS crimeUS school shootingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Research shows that the path to getting excluded from school, then being exploited by criminals or caught up in a gang, often starts here in reception, with children who are left behind coming to feel they don’t belong in school because of their problems with language.The statistics are stark. Two-thirds of children at risk of being excluded from secondary school have problems with speech, language and communication which may be unidentified, according to the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.The same is true of 60% of those accessing youth justice services. Further up the chain, communication and language problems are far more prevalent in the prison population than the national average.The Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) was created in 2019 and modelled on a unit in Glasgow, which is credited with dramatically reducing murders by treating violence as a preventable public health issue. It brings together young people, police, health professionals, teachers and youth workers to tackle the root causes of violence. About 90% of London boroughs have now signed up to its inclusive education charter, which commits to reducing exclusions and suspensions to keep young people safe in school.Lib Peck, director of the VRU, describes helping four-year-olds to communicate as a “no brainer”. She says: “We know that kids are safer in school, and we know the ones who are most likely to be excluded, so it makes sense to flip it round and intervene right at the beginning.”Rushey Green was one of 70 primaries to receive the VRU’s pilot funding for teacher training and resources to help those who are behind on talking, across seven boroughs where youth violence is a particular problem. This morning’s group is practising talking about the things we all do in the morning when we get up.Each child is keen to take their turn pointing at a picture and describing what is happening. They are learning to talk about sequencing: doing things “first”, “next” and “last”.View image in fullscreenLisa Williams, head of Rushey Green, says it is only by talking that young children can find practical steps to resolve issues instead of becoming angry.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverHeadteacher Lisa Williams explains that this language may be missing, partly because they aren’t used to set routines at home. She says: “We have a lot of parents with two or three jobs. A mum might work in the day then have a cleaning job in the evening. The routine of bath, storytime and sleep can be impossible.”Even bathtime is not a given, as some families can’t afford hot water.The teacher prompts a boy to talk about the final picture, in which the person is getting dressed.“What does he do last?”The boy is ready with his answer, beaming: “He scratches his armpit!”More than half the children in reception here struggled with speaking when they started school. Williams says: “Many of our children can’t even tell you how they are feeling when they get here.”She explains that if a young child can’t talk properly, they will struggle throughout the day, not only in keeping up with learning, but also making friends and negotiating things such as sharing and taking turns.“As a parent you understand your child’s body language so well that you often know what they need just by looking at them,” Williams says. “But another child won’t.”Young children are powered by a constant sense of injustice, she says: “‘That’s mine.’ ‘I want to sit there.’ ‘It’s my go.’” Early on they need to learn that, instead of crying or becoming angry, they can take practical steps to resolve issues. “But the only way they can really do that is if they can talk.”Early data from the VRU on young children who completed its oracy interventions last year showed that 98% had narrowed the communication gap with their peers, with 60% now meeting expected standards in understanding and using vocabulary.However, Lily Bearfoot, the reception teacher who co-runs the programme at Rushey Green, says a key success has also been a marked reduction in children expressing their frustration by hitting or kicking.“Sometimes you see a situation that looks like it will really go wrong, but then they resolve it themselves, saying ‘I didn’t like that you took my pen’,” she says. “I always tell them I’m so proud that they’ve used their words to sort it out.”The children in her class are Covid babies, born into a world of lockdowns where normal social contact couldn’t happen. Yet the school is clear that mushrooming speech and language problems are also a product of poverty and years of cuts under the Conservatives to the public services that supported families.Speech therapists say talking to your baby or toddler is one of the single most important things a parent can do, and Williams says it is clear when this hasn’t happened enough. But she is quick to point out that these parents are struggling, not lazy. She says: “They care so much about their children, but their priority is meeting their basic needs. They are working incredibly hard just to keep them clothed and fed and safe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhen they arrive in school many children won’t have ever seen a health visitor who could have picked up that their communication wasn’t at the expected level. Bearfoot is determined to turn around these disadvantages, saying: “It’s really important to me that I give them the best start they can get. If they get left behind now the gap will only widen as they go up through school.”Fact check: has Sadiq Khan really overseen a crime surge in London?Read morePupils are sent home with word board games that many families can’t afford so parents can be involved. Some parents whose first language isn’t English often learn along with their children. These games come with lots of little letter tiles but in more than a year not a single piece has been lost. Bearfoot says: “Parents are really grateful.”The school also sets up playdates so children can practise social talking. They offer the school as a venue, lending scooters and providing cake.“If a mum is just managing to afford one meal a day, she doesn’t want to worry about feeding another child on a play date,” Williams says.They try to give the children as many new experiences as possible, from forest school to a trip to a museum, to broaden their vocabulary. Williams notes that, like many London schools, they have children from both ends of the privilege scale. A third of each class regularly go to restaurants, to the theatre and into central London with their families. But the majority have none of these experiences.“We take children to the science museum and some of them have never even been on a train before,” she says. “Trips out just don’t come anywhere near the list of basic priorities.”In the nursery the children are sitting on the mat waiting for a snack and the teaching assistant reminds them about the language they need to use first. “You say: ‘Please may I have a bagel or an orange’. I don’t want to hear ‘I want an orange’.”Dionne Phillips, the nursery teacher, says when children arrive who can’t talk, she starts with lots of gestures, getting down on their level for maximum eye contact. She is firm about not using ‘baby’ words as they learn. “We don’t say doggy or mama. We use proper words,” she says.To illustrate the point, she holds up two plastic boxes, each with a different picture book in.“What’s the word we use about these two boxes?” she asks the children.There is an immediate chorus from all the three- and four-year-olds. “Democracy!”“And what does that mean?” she asks.“It’s when you choose!”Williams saysshe wants all pupils to be able to make choices, to ask questions and have an opinion, and the oracy project empowers them to do that.“The statistics about the literacy levels of young offenders are real,” she adds. “Improving speech and language is a foundation for everything.”Explore more on these topicsExclusionsThe ObserverKnife crimeSchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to Gary Sacks, the chief executive of the tower’s developer, City & Docklands, this is now “the capital’s new development hotspot”, vindicating the group’s foray west.Old Oak Common: HS2 debacle shines light on left-behind pocket of LondonRead moreWhile the delays and escalating budget of the high-speed rail project have been well documented, HS2 is keen to show that the story so far – even before any trains run – is not justbat-shed crazy costs, but sky-high benefits from the promise of better transport connections.New research by consultancy Arcadis, commissioned byHS2Ltd, claims that the mega-station at Old Oak Common will boost the local economy by £10bn over a decade – and has also turned the area into a new development hotspot for London.Map shows Old Oak Common station on Elizabeth linePlanning applications within a 1.5-mile radius from the site have risen by 22% since the first phase of HS2 was confirmed in legislation in 2017. That is not an unusual figure for London – but the value of those applications far exceeds comparable areas such as Ealing and Wembley, coming in at a cumulative £3.4bn – more than four times higher than the preceding seven-year period.Arcadis’s analysis projects that HS2 will help bring 22,000 homes and nearly 19,000 new jobs to the Old Oak Common area, including hi-tech jobs and roles in the creative industries, boosting average pay.Map showing status of HS2 routeWhile Euston is planned to succeed Old Oak Common station as HS2’s London terminus, the new west London station, with 14 platforms and fast connections, is likely to be the more impressive hub for many years. As well as HS2, it will boast a stop on the Great Western mainline railway, Heathrow Express, and theElizabeth line.HS2’s new chief executive,Mark Wild, has promised to resetthe troubled programme, having previously managed Crossrail to a restated timeline and budget to open as the Elizabeth line in 2022.Wild will unveil Arcadis’s research with a first public speech this week, in an attempt to rekindle enthusiasm in the positive potential of Britain’s biggest infrastructure scheme, which wasagain criticised last week in a parliamentary reportas a “casebook example of how not to run a major project”. The estimated budget for even the truncated HS2 is now as high as £80bn in today’s prices, the public accounts committee said, with huge uncertainty over the fate of Euston at one end and how the railway will accommodate the service on the West Coast mainline north of Birmingham at the other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This research shows how HS2 is doing just that – boosting economic prosperity locally around HS2’s Old Oak Common station – years before the first trains leave HS2’s platforms.“It underlines the vital importance of the work I’m now undertaking to reset HS2 and ensure that this railway is efficiently delivered for the lowest reasonable cost to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer.”Around Old Oak,Imperial College has snapped up sites including the Victoria Park industrial estate for science and tech developments,while Garden Studios at Park Royal has established a high-end TV production presence since 2021. The studio’s chief executive, Thomas Hoegh, has set out high hopes for it to become the “the media tech village of Europe”, adding: “We see the contours of that today but the reality of that is going to come when HS2 is done.”Sacks, whose new tower is the tallest residential development in London outside Canary Wharf, believes he is capitalising on new transport connections in the way others already have from the Elizabeth line. While the jury will be out for a long time on the wider cost-benefits of HS2, for him at least: “The returns are going to outweigh the risks by a long way.”Explore more on these topicsHS2InfrastructureRail transportTransportRail industryTransport policyLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is much higher than a year earlier, when one HSBC employee topped out at €12m-€13m. In contrast, HSBC’s chief executive, Georges Elhedery, was paid £5.4m last year, having taken over in September 2024.There was a similar jump at Barclays, with the lender having paid €17m-€18m to a single banker in 2024. That is up from a top sum of €11m-€12m in 2023, and is higher than the£10.5m paid to boss CS Venkatakrishnan for 2024.The pay packages are the highest on record for both banks since UK lenders were forced to start releasing pay data in 2014, with the sum at Barclays last surpassed by a controversial £17m payout to ex-boss Bob Diamond in 2011.It is one of the first signs that looser regulation has started to feed through to banker pay.From 2014 to 2023, banker bonuses were limited to two times salary as part of rules introduced after the 2007-8 financial crisis. The hope was that, with less of an individual’s pay riding on performance, there would be fewer incentives for risky behaviour that led to short-term gains.Salaries ended up rising to compensate for the lower bonuses, but the rules kept a relative lid on total pay: the highest-paid bankers at HSBC and Barclays were paid between €8m-€14m until 2023.However, critics complained that the cap made it harder for UK-based banks to compete for top talent from countries such as the US, where there was no cap.The former Tory chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng eventually used post-Brexit rules to call for the banker bonus cap to be scrapped in 2022, with regulators formally repealing it a year later.Each bank is now allowed to set their own upward limits. Goldman Sachs – which lobbied for the change – has set one of the highest caps, allowing its star performers in the UKto be paid up to 25 times their annual salary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But young people with cancer and their families must wait three months before being eligible to receive disability benefits, even with a confirmed diagnosis.Once they can apply, they face an average four-month wait before receiving a decision on any financial support.The first months after a cancer diagnosis can require an immediate financial outlay and the system does not allow people to receive backdated payments.If someone is expected to live 12 months or less, they do not need to meet the three-month qualifying period to be eligible, with special rule exemptions applied.Oliver, a 16-year-old from Solihull, was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer in his leg last year. Tests revealed it was adamantinoma and he had to have his leg amputated.“They told me Oliver wasn’t ill enough to claim [benefits] – even though he had cancer and had his leg off,” his mother, Kerry, said.She applied for benefits support in April last year and was given an outcome in September, five months later.“The hospital is an hour away from us and I don’t drive. It was costing us £48 a day for us to travel in taxis there and back.”The family needed to buy new clothes to fit Oliver, and faced higher electricity costs to charge his prosthetic leg. “Ollie’s leg needs electricity as it is micro processing. If I don’t have electricity, he can’t walk.”Kerry also needed to heat the house more too to keep Oliver warm. “He had immunosuppression for six months and so the house had to be heated constantly. It’s completely financially broken me,” she said.Danielle Roberts, from north Wales, applied for disability living allowance in January 2024 after her nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, was diagnosed with cancer in October 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roberts said this, on top of food costs while in hospital and extra heating bills while her daughter was at home, all mounted up.Research by Young Lives found 96% of young people with cancer and their families incur additional travel costs after diagnosis, on average £250 a month.The charity is calling on the government to scrap the three-month qualifying period for children and young people with cancer to claim disability benefits and for the system to be simple, efficient and streamlined, utilising medical evidence to quickly determine eligibility for patients.A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring people can access financial support through personal independence payment and disability living allowance for children in a timely manner.“But we recognise waits are too high, and we have increased the number of staff to respond to the increase in claim volumes.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsCancerYoung peopleDisabilityEnglandChildren's healthChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

What will be left afterwards? With everything that is going on in the world, what will be left of the Labour programme?”Other sources said that it was all very well increasing defence spending, as Donald Trump had demanded, and as was necessary, but there needed to be “sacred areas” of policy.Unease over the aid decision is also likely to surface when Starmer makes a statement to the House of Commons early this week on hisvisit to the White House, and on his subsequent meetings with theUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyyand European leaders.Labour MPs are also expected to speak out on the aid cut during a debate on Thursday on International Women’s Day. Over recent years the debate has become an occasion for MPs to focus on violence against women and girls. This year, charities such as Care International have arranged for celebrities to focus on women’s rights around the world in response to the US aid cuts and the Trump administration’s roll-back of reproductive rights.Writing for theObserveronline todaythe Labour MP for Milton Keynes Central, Emily Darlington, a former special adviser to the late Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, breaks ranks to criticise the aid cuts, saying that as a result the world will become less safe. “National defence and international development are two sides of the same coin,” she writes. “Our long-term security requires us to invest in both.”Drawing on her experience of living in Kenya before becoming an MP at the last election, Darlington says: “Like many African countries, Kenya has huge potential but it also has a violent recent history and is plagued by the threat of international terrorism. So when the US or the UK withdraws funding for clinics offering sexual and reproductive health services, young women can’t take control of their lives. When the US or the UK withdraws funding for schemes to combat young men being fed disinformation, the risk is that they become more easily recruited by malign actors, armed groups and even terrorist networks.”View image in fullscreenSoldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment on training; the defence budget is to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.Photograph: Leon Neal/GettyOn Friday the Labour peer Lady Chapman was appointed to succeed Dodds as international development minister, a decision which also caused dismay among MPs of all parties and aid groups, who complained that as a member of the House of Lords she would not be able to answer questions in the House of Commons on aid issues.The former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, a Tory MP, said: “The decision to place a minister from the House of Lords in charge of international development is part and parcel of the Labour government’s failure to understand that international development contributes to safety, security and prosperity.”It was also wrong, Mitchell suggested, that “no MPs will be able to question her routinely” in the Commons.After Starmer made the decision to slash development aid Champion said: “Cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that will only make the world less safe. Conflict is often an outcome of desperation, climate and insecurity; our finances should be spent on preventing this, not the deadly consequences.“In 2023, Ukraine received £250m in UK aid, more than any other country. We simply cannot afford to undermine this investment by putting more into a war chest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They say: “It’s deeply disappointing that, after watching Labour MPs protest against the previous government’s cuts to UK aid in 2021, the prime minister and Treasury have taken the same path.”“Given Labour’s manifesto commitments and their promise to restore the UK’s reputation as a trusted global partner, we had hoped for a clear plan to gradually return to the 0.7% aid target.”Instead, without any apparent impact assessment or consideration of the consequences, they have once again raided an already diminished UK aid budget, leaving those facing conflict, poverty, and climate change to bear the cost of the UK’s financial choices.“This was not an inevitable decision. Labour had alternatives, such as a modest 2% wealth tax on assets over £10m – impacting just 0.04% of the population – which could generate £24bn annually. Rather than pursuing fairer funding solutions, they have chosen a path that leaves their credibility on international development in tatters and damages the UK’s standing on the global stage.”Signatories include Halima Begum, CEO of Oxfam GB, Christine Allen Executive Director, of Cafod, the Catholic development agency, Adrian Lovett, executive director, of One, the nonpartisan organisation advocating investments in economic opportunities and healthier lives in Africa, Rose Caldwell, CEO of Plan International UK, Patrick Watt, CEO for ChristianAidand Romilly Greenhill, CEO of Bond, the UK network for NGOs working on international development.On Wednesday Labour MPs and peers packed a meeting room in parliament to be briefed on the prime minister’s announcement. The defence secretary John Healey was joined by Africa minister Lord Collins to face dozens of angry questioners.MPs said several Labour grandees including Harriet Harman, Peter Hain and Paul Boateng were in attendance.A particular focus of MPs’ questions was on the amount of foreign aid still being used by the Home Office to pay for hotels housing asylum seekers. The Centre for Global Development estimates that after the cuts are implemented, around half of the aid budget will be spent in the UK as a result.In an attempt to placate Labour MPs, ministers gave assurances that there would be no cuts to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) until 2027, but this was not repeated in the written briefing sent to MPs by email the same day.The prime minister’s rushed announcement, after a cabinet meeting where ministers were informed of the decision, said aid would be cut from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income when defence spending rises to 2.5% of gross domestic product in 2027. MPs are demanding that the FCDO now conduct a rapid impact assessment before the cuts are made. Charities are mobilising their supporters to flood the email inboxes of MPs and are using social media to connect Starmer’s decision with Trump’s unpopularity. Internet memes featuring Trump as a puppet master pulling Starmer’s strings are being circulated in an echo of American charities using images of Trump being manipulated by Elon Musk.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe ObserverClimate crisisAidDefence policyAnneliese DoddsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last month, around 130 parents of children at the schools attended an emergency meeting to put their concerns to councillors, including allegations that children were suffering anxiety due to the tough discipline andshouting from teachers, that a child in the secondary school was left all day in wet clothes after being refused permission to go to the toilet, and that the schools were failing to make reasonable adjustments for children with special educational needs.The first Mossbourne academy opened in 2004, withSir Michael Wilshaw as its superhead. It has been praised for transforming attainment in one of London’s most deprived boroughs through famously strict discipline, and all its Hackney schools are currently rated outstanding by Ofsted. The academy washailed in 2011 by then education secretary Michael Govefor “exceptional” results and for getting children into top universities, including Oxbridge.View image in fullscreenAndy Leary-May who the Observer reported was demanding a safeguarding inquiry into academies in Hackney.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The ObserverAfter some parents came forward last year with complaints about the Victoria Park Academy, Hackney council recently confirmed that it has now received more than 300 separate accounts of alleged emotional harm at Mossbourne schools from parents, former students, teachers, local GPs and child psychologists.Parents in Essex have now expressed similar concerns. A mother who said she removed her son from Mossbourne Port Side Academy in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, before Christmas told theObserverabout an incident in which he was refused permission to go to the toilet during a lesson. “He wet himself in front of the class. They didn’t ring me. They left him for the rest of the day in wet clothes. He was traumatised by that.”A teacher at the federation’s other senior academy in Stanford-le-Hope, Mossbourne Fobbing Academy (MFA), speaking on condition of anonymity, said that, since the takeover, some staff “humiliate” students and shout at them. “I have witnessed the year 7s go through fear every day. It is heartbreaking.”The teacher described attending “threatening” assemblies in which students were told about a long list of rules and punishments. They said some students had panic attacks. “Since Mossbourne entered our school in September, student anxiety has gone through the roof.”Top English academy trust faces safeguarding review over ‘emotional abuse’ of pupilsRead moreThe teacher said pupils regularly came to them in tears, “begging to be sent home”.One mother told theObserverthat she saw a “dramatic change” in her son when MFA was taken over. He became withdrawn and anxious, often messaging her from the toilet at school, pleading with her to collect him. He said his maths teacher was shouting at him most days because he could not keep up.“In one lesson, he asked her for help and she shouted at him because it was easy, and he should know it. He sat with his head in his arms, sobbing, because he felt so humiliated. He got up and left the classroom, crying, and she said nothing at all,” the mother said.She said the school knew that her son was having treatment fromChildrenand Adolescent Mental Health Services and had recently had a period of absence due to anxiety.Mossbourne did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeachingThe ObserverSchoolsAcademiesDepartment for EducationEducation policyOfstedChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

Edwards’ housemate had spotted someone suspicious at the time, and later identified the burglar from the footage.The burglar was convicted after pleading guilty.Successful outcomes like this are more common in Manchester than they used to be. Under the stewardship of the chief constable, Stephen Watson, who took the helm at Greater Manchester police (GMP) in 2021, the force began to take burglary seriously and has cut offences by a third.Between December 2020 and December 2021, 16,758 residential burglaries were recorded across Greater Manchester. The figure fell to 11,256 last year, a 33% reduction, equivalent to 106 fewer burglaries a week.During the same period, the number of burglary arrests increased by more than a quarter, and the number of solved crimes almost trebled – from 4.2% to 11.5%.The force launched Operation Castle in 2021, in which officers attended every reported burglary, a move away from treating such crimes as “volume” or “low level”.“We weren’t in a good place four years ago,” said Det Supt Alicia Smith, who leads Operation Castle, but now “we are taking it seriously.Policeofficers love nothing more than to catch a burglar in the act.View image in fullscreenDet Supt Alicia Smith leads Operation Castle.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“It’s dreadful; people genuinely feel violated, and they should feel safe in their own home. Your home’s your haven, isn’t it?”The turnaround is in part due to the creation of neighbourhood crime teams, which focus on using community intelligence to target and arrest criminals carrying out burglaries, robberies and car crime.DI Natalie McDonald said: “[In] our hotspot area, we were getting burglaries every single day.”View image in fullscreenDI Natalie McDonald leads a team of detectives responsible for locating, arresting and interviewing suspects.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWith a suspected frequent burglar in custody on remand, “everyone can sleep a little bit easier in the area”, she said. “Burglaries have dropped off.”McDonald leads a team of detectives based at Longsight police station, just south of the city centre, who are responsible for locating, arresting and interviewing suspects.Her officers go out into the community, gathering CCTV footage, building profiles of suspects, and linking similar crimes – sometimes even identifying perpetrators from a tiny logo or small flash of colour on their clothing.Their evidence comes from crime scene investigators (CSIs) as well as primary accounts from response officers and call handlers.In the 999 call centre at GMP’s North Manchester headquarters, these handlers are often the first person a victim will come into contact with when reporting a burglary.View image in fullscreenElla, a call handler for Greater Manchester police.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“It can be hard because people are very emotional,” said Ella, a call handler,adding that sometimes they were on the phone while an intruder was in the house. Recalling one call, she said: “I heard the glass shatter. I heard her scream, and that was just a moment that I will never forget.“All you want to hear is the sirens pulling up outside, and that is what you listen in the background for, because that’s when you know your job is done. Somebody else is there now to protect them.”After call handlers, it is often CSIs who are next on the scene; GMP’s decision to go out to the site of every burglary means vital forensic evidence is more likely to be preserved.The team has also moved to working across the force area, rather than being tied to a particular district, which means that someone can often get there more quickly.“Not too long ago, I went to a burglary where the whole house had been ransacked,” CSI Hayley Craig said. “There was a large, vast quantity of family jewellery taken.”When she looked at a first-floor window, she said, there were “what looked like really obvious glove marks on the inside”.“Now, they shouldn’t be there,” she said. “They’re on a top-floor window, and no one’s climbing in, other than the offenders.“So I ended up getting a DNA hit from them and finding out who it was, who’d at least come in the window and broken in, and that’s brilliant,” she added. “That’s what we do it for. That’s why we do this job, so we can find those people and hopefully put them away.”Burglary in Greater Manchester is not a problem solved – the vast majority of reported offences do not lead to an offender being brought to justice. But residents can expect a better response from police than they would have had five years ago.“There’s always work to be done; we’re always seeking to improve,” Smith said. “But the work that’s been put in place has been really significant, and I think we’re all really proud.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceGreater ManchesterCrimeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Our job is to defend the 250-year tradition that we have of being the democratic leader of the world, not turn our backs on a struggling country that is trying to do the right thing.”The comments from Johnson came afterZelenskyy’s contentious meetingon Friday at the White House with Trump and JD Vance. As part of a deal with the US involving minerals in Ukraine, Zelenskyy had sought security guarantees from the US as Ukraine defended itself from Russia’s invasion. That prompted the US vice-president to accuse Zelenskyy of not being grateful enough for US aid – and for the US president to ask Zelenskyy to leave the White House without the minerals deal being signed.Trump is the not first US president during Ukraine’s war to accuse him of being ungrateful for the US military’s assistance.In October 2022, citing four sources familiar with the exchange, NBC Newsreportedthat then president Joe Biden lost his temper in a phone call with Zelenskyy in which he told Zelenskyy he had authorized another $1bn in assistance for Ukraine – to which Zelenskyy responded by listing the additional help he needed.NBC reported that Zelenskyy issued a statement praising the US for its aid after that call with Biden. And, in anTwitter/X poston Saturday, Zelenskyy thanked the US and Trump “for all the support … during these three years of full-scale invasion”.Nonetheless, on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, US secretary of state Marco Rubio accused Zelenskyy of undermining Friday’s talks by failing to “contain himself” trying to “Ukraine-splain on every issue”.“I hope this could all be reset,” Rubio said.Meanwhile,on Meet the Press on Sunday, Johnsontoldhost Kristen Welker that “something has to change” with Zelenskyy.“Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,” Johnson said.Pro-Ukraine protests erupt across US after Trump and Vance ‘ambush’ ZelenskyyRead moreJohnson claimed Zelenskyy should have shown gratitude and thanks to the US in the meeting and argued the push forUS mineral rights in Ukraineas part of a peace agreement is “a win for everyone” that will give the US minerals it needs and Ukraine a level of security.On CBS’s Face the Nation, Johnson’s fellow Republican congressman Mike Turner, the chairperson of the House intelligence committee, added: “Instead of taking that win, Zelenskyy turned it into a debate on American security guarantees [on the] peace negotiations.”Turner also said: “[Zelenskyy] needs to not have this precondition of American security guarantees, which are not coming.”The derailed meetingincitedpro-Ukraine protests around the US.

Their fight for democracy, freedom and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau wrote on X after the White House meeting. “Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.”Only 4% of Americans say they support Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, according to the results ofa CBS pollpublished on Sunday.Notably, though, only a slim majority of Americans say they support Ukraine: 52%. And a large minority – 44% – say they do not support either Russia or Ukraine.Speaking to Face the Nation on Sunday, Democratic US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona said Zelenskyy was “cornered” and “bullied” in the Oval Office on Friday during what was “a sad day for our country”.“It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy,” Kelly said.Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski was one Republican US senator who condemned the Trump administration over the way Friday’s meeting with Zelenskyy unfolded.In an X post, she called the meeting a “shocking conversation”.“I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now, I am sick to my stomach that the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embrace Putin, a threat to democracy and US values around the world.”Republican US senator James Lankford, for his part, said he disagreed with calls for Zelenskyy to resign.“I’m not interested in calling on the resignation of other world leaders,” LankfordtoldMeet the Press. “Quite frankly, I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now.”Explore more on these topicsBernie SandersUS politicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Two blocks had been set aside for people with gunshot and shrapnel injuries.Mugisho Shalukoma, 20, was recovering from a leg amputation, the result of gunshot wounds. “I felt my foot getting harder and harder,” he said. “I didn’t see the person who shot me. Those around me brought me here.”Ghislaine Ntakwinja, 41, said she was in her house when unidentified gunmen shot her in her right hand. “Guns were ringing out in the city,” she said, sitting on her bed. “I heard armed men open my house’s door. They had guns. That’s when they shot me.” Her children rushed her to hospital.As M23 closed in on Bukavu, reports emerged of people collecting weapons and military equipment left by retreating Congolese forces.Deogracias Chibambo, a human rights activist with the Ça Suffit (That’s Enough) civic engagement group, said weapons had been circulating freely, including among children, causing enormous damage. “There was general panic. Bullets were being fired in many places,” he said.Last week, the UN human rights office accused M23 rebels ofkilling three children in Bukavuwho were carrying weapons and wearing uniforms from an abandoned Congolese military camp, after they refused to surrender the weapons. M23 denied the accusation, terming it propaganda by the Congolese government.Esperance Mwamini Birindwa, a nurse with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which operates at the general hospital, said 162 people had been admitted with injuries related to the M23 takeover between 14 and 24 February. Of those with gunshot and shrapnel injuries, three had died.mapM23 has made rapid advances this year, drawing in neighbouring armies and raising fears of a regional war.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is facing supply challenges caused by the conflict, hindering its ability to treat wounded people. The organisation’s warehouse in Goma, the capital of North Kivu, was one of many looted and vandalised during fighting in the city last month, with medicine and other items stolen. The fighting has caused logistical challenges, too, disrupting some transport routes.“Despite all our efforts, evacuations sometimes take longer than expected because of access difficulties,” said ICRC project manager Emmanuel Konin. “Some patients whose lives we could have tried to save are already dead from their injuries.”Other hospitals in Bukavu have also been overwhelmed by injured people. One had received 42 patients with gunshot and shrapnel wounds within a few days of the fall of Bukavu, said Marcus Bachmann, head of programmes for South Kivu at Médecins Sans Frontières, which is supporting some hospitals in the city to treat the high number of injured people.“We are closely assessing the situation and exploring ways to scale up our emergency efforts to respond to the humanitarian needs of people in areas around Minova, Bukavu, and Uvira,” hesaid, referring to areas in South Kivu. “We urge all the parties to the conflict to ensure the protection of civilians, humanitarian workers, and medical infrastructure and personnel in all areas affected by the conflict.”M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups to operate in the mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal, meant to end the wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed byRwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say, in fact, Rwanda is using the group to extract and export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobile phones.The situation in Bukavu remains extremely volatile. On Thursday, at least 13 people were killed and dozens others injured inexplosions at a mass rallyheld by M23 in the city centre. The rebels accused the Congolese authorities of being behind the attack, while Congo’s army said Rwandan troops had fired rockets and grenades into the crowd.International sanctions, renewed investigations by the international criminal court and Africa-led peace negotiations have failed to halt the advance of the rebels, who captured Goma last month before rapidly advancing south to Bukavu.Since January, 7,000 people have been killed and almost half a million are without shelter after 90 displacement camps were destroyed in the fighting in eastern Congo, the government said.The UN refugee agency said on Friday that 60,000 people have fled into neighbouring Burundi in the past fortnight.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

Kumar, who worked at the Poplar Avenue Clinic, then billed the federal Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs for hysteroscopy biopsy services as if the treatments were medically necessary – and as if he had used new or properly sterilized equipment.A hysteroscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of the uterus, which involves inserting a thin, lighted tube through the vagina and cervix into the uterus, according toJohns Hopkins Medicine.“Kumar was consistently the top-paid provider inTennesseefor Medicare and Medicaid for hysteroscopy biopsy services, and he profited substantially from these criminal acts,” said the acting US attorney for the western district of Tennessee, Reagan Fondren. “The allegations indicate that Kumar acted as a predator in a white coat and used the cover of conducting medical examinations to put his patients at risk and enrich himself.”The special agent in charge of the FBI’s Nashville field office, Joseph E Carrico, said that there may be additional victims.“It is important to remember nothing Dr Kumar has done was, or ever will be, your fault,” Carrico said. “We see time and time again that voices matter, and those who have stepped forward have empowered others to do the same.”Explore more on these topicsTennesseeUS crimeWomen's healthUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

People are extremely despondent. It’s no longer simply about the train crash but a much broader political crisis.”Two years on, no official or state body has been held accountable for the tragedy and the glacial pace of Greek justice means a trial has yet to take place.Anger has been further fuelled by the sense of a cover-up, aggravated by Greece’s air and rail accident authority releasing a 178-page report on the eve of the protests revealing the possible presence of an unknown and highly flammable substance at the scene of the crash – increasing suspicions that the freight train was smuggling explosive illegal chemicals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sharabi was at home in Be’eri kibbutz with his British-born wife and their two teenage daughters when Hamas attacked on 7 October 2023.In the Israeli television interview , Sharabi recalled being tied up, losing consciousness and experiencing extreme hunger.“I remember not being able to fall asleep because of the pain,” he said. “The ropes are already digging into your flesh, and every movement makes you want to scream.”Sharabi’s brother said the freed hostage is flying to the US aboard a plane provided by Miriam Adelson, the Israeli-American widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a major Trump donor.“Tomorrow morning, we’re boarding the plane with Mrs Adelson’s kind help. We’ll arrive to see Trump and explain to him up close the urgency of continuing the first stage or beginning the second stage – it doesn’t really matter,” Sharon Sharabi said, referring tothe tenuous ceasefire dealbetween Israel and Hamas.Trump faces Truth Social backlash over AI video of Gaza with topless Netanyahu and bearded bellydancersRead moreDuring the 7 October attack, after the armed group kidnapped Sharabi from his home, they shot the family dog, locked his wife Lianne and their daughters in a safe room, and set it on fire, according to Lianne’s parents, who spoke to the BBC. Sharabi only learned that his wife and daughters had been killed that dayafter his release.Sharabi’s other brother, Yossi, was also taken hostage that day. He died early last year in Gaza,Israel’s military said, when the Israeli army bombed a building near where he was being held.TheTrump administrationcontinues to support Israel amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On Friday, it approved a nearly $3bn arms sale to Israel, bypassing congressional review to supply more 2,000lb bombs used in the war against Hamas.Following Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of ablockade on humanitarian aid to Gazaon Sunday, the White House said it “supports” Israel’s decision.At a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the families of Israelis still being held in Gazaurgedtheir government to stop violating the ceasefire/hostage deal that puts the lives of their loved ones at further risk.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpIsraelGazaUS politicsPalestinian territoriesShareReuse this content"

TheQueenslandcapital is particularly flood-prone and has been severely inundated three times in the past 15 years.It is unusual – though not unprecedented – for a Tropical Cyclone to threaten landfall so far south of the tropics.Ocean rower Aurimas Mockus stranded by cyclone off Australia’s east coast safely rescuedRead moreSpeaking on ABC News Breakfast on Monday, Crisafulli urged residents in the south-east – unaccustomed to the sorts of cyclone preparations that are routine in the state’s north – to prepare their homes.“[People need to] make sure they do things around their own home and make sure they’ve got canned food and bottled water and remove loose items,” Crisafulli said.“If you do all those things, you do get through these events.”The Bureau of Meteorology has warned that heavy rainfall will be concentrated to the south of wherever Alfred makes landfall, and that the system could bring 300mm to 600mm over multiple days.“It’s the rainfall that is most of concern,” Crisafulli said.“When a system like that does cross the coast, generally speaking you have huge intensities to the south of the system, and that can produce really intense rainfall in a very, very short window.“You’re already dealing with areas that are reasonably soaked already, so there are complications that come with that.”Tropical Cyclone Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane. Why is this a big deal and when could it hit?Read moreThe more immediate threat, as Alfred moves slowly to the south-east and lingers off the coast, is concern about intense winds and potential storm surge in island communities and along the coast.Waves up to 14 metres were recorded off Wide Bay on Sunday.The Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said many of the city’s residents had never experienced a cyclone before as he stressed the “very real threat” to south-eastern Queensland.It is rare – but not unheard of – for tropical cyclones to reach landfall south of the tropics.The closest a cyclone track has come to Brisbane was in 1990, whenTropical Cyclone Nancytracked erratically towards the Queensland capital, before making a southward turn just off the coastline and never reaching landfall.Tropical Cyclone Wanda – the cause of Brisbane’s historic 1974 floods – crossed the coast near K’gari and Hervey Bay. A severe tropical cyclone crossed the coast near Tweed Heads in 1954.It is far more common for a tropical cyclone to cross the coast north of the tropic of capricorn and return overland to the south-east as a destructive low storm. This occurred with Cyclone Debbie in 2017.In NSW, where the northern coastline could be affected, the State Emergency Service urged residents to prepare for damaging winds, large surf and heavy rainfall with major riverine and flash flooding expected from Wednesday.“We are asking the community to take steps now to ensure that if you are asked to evacuate you have a plan for yourselves, your families and your pets and know where you will go,” NSW SES assistant commissioner Dean Storey said.The bureau is predicting that Alfred will move slowly to the south-east until Tuesday, before shifting west back towards the coast.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandNew South WalesAustralia weatherExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

However, “given the complexity of the clinical picture, the prognosis remains guarded”, the statement said.A Vatican official said that Friday’s respiratory crisis does not appear to have caused long-term damage.Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February and was diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs.“I would like to thank you for the prayers,” Francis said in a message shared on his X account. “I feel all your affection and closeness and … I feel as if I am ‘carried’ and supported by all God’s people.”In a separate message he said he was praying “above all for peace”. “From here, war appears even more absurd,” he said. “Let us pray for martyred Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu.”On Sunday morning the Vatican said the pope had rested well overnight. He later met Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.The pope had an episode akin to an asthma attack on Friday that caused him to inhale vomit.The pope is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.Nightly prayer vigils for the pope’s health are continuing to take place at St Peter’s Basilica as well as in towns and cities across Italy and abroad.Before his hospital admission, the pope maintained an intense schedule, especially with events related to theCatholic jubilee year.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisThe papacyCatholicismReligionChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Without any firm moves from Trump to show his support for the crypto sector, nervousness looks set to continue.”Bitcoin has recovered from sharp monthly falls in the past. In June 2022, its worst month, it dropped 41% from $31,700 to $18,700, before jumping by 26% in July.Crypto prices rallied on Sunday after Trump announced the names of three cryptocurrencies that would be included in a new US strategic reserve.Trump said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano), which triggered a rise in all three. Trump added that bitcoin and ethereum would be “at the heart of the Reserve”, driving bitcoin back up to $94,000.Explore more on these topicsBitcoinCryptocurrenciesCurrenciesUS marketsGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Why should a woman be given her power by a man, she wondered. And it’s something she’s still wondering about.She’s Auspicious is a dismantling of the idea of woman being put on a pedestal, bestowed with value through someone else’s eyes. Being shaped by an outside view of womanhood – even a supposedly flattering one – is a suffocation of sorts. Prakash is an Indian-American dancer, best known in the UK for performing with Akram Khan, who has mentored her. Her brand of bharatanatyam (the traditional dance form comes from southern India) blends classical technique with a questioning sensibility and the freeform structure of contemporary theatre.View image in fullscreenMythili Prakash: She's Auspicious.Photograph: Daniel DittusPrakash is an accomplished dancer who, at first at least, doesn’t give too much away. A contained presence, her movement is economical, undemonstrative, and not clouded by the strain of visible effort (there’s great skill in that, and power over her instrument). She can balance in absolute stillness, rooted to the earth.As the piece progresses she gradually scrolls through emotional states: anxiety, relief, delight, enforced restraint, with her usually freely expressive hands suddenly clamped stiff over her mouth. She begins as a woman, plainly dressed in black and white, but is elevated to goddess status, reappearing in vivid red, in a kind of shrine made of scaffolding, with a coterie of followers. Seven women in shades of indigo bow and pray and sing and make music for her. She is deified and decorated with jewellery. But for Prakash, that’s not the aspiration. You get the sense that this goddess is also a woman, a mother, a person of flaws and conflict (and strength and compassion). When Prakash throws off all expectations, her hair swings loose, her movements become bigger and freer, feet planted wide, mouth agape with something akin to both hunger and glee.She’s Auspicious turns into a paean to girl power, an uprising. Percussionist Aswini Srinivasan especially drives the energy forward with racing rhythms, the women banging sticks against the scaffold, the shrine tumbling. It’s a piece about agency; an undoing of the myth.At Sadler’s Wells East, London, until 2 MarchExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The last thing he expected was for his band to be taken seriously. The Dolls took their lead not from the “adult-oriented” rock and earnest singer-songwriters dominating the US album charts, but from the glam rock scene making headway in the UK singles charts. British acts from theSex Pistolsto Morrissey would later repay the compliment, citing the band as a key influence.Johansen was recruited into the New York Dolls in 1971 afterJohnny Thundersstepped back as vocalist to focus on lead guitar. The lineup comprising Johansen, Thunders,Sylvain Sylvain(guitar),Arthur Kane(bass), andBilly Murcia(drums) began to pick up small-time gigs around New York City.However, their androgynous-hoodlum look was more in vogue in Britain – whereDavid Bowieand Marc Bolan had paved the way – than it was in the US, and in 1972 they were invited to support Rod Stewart and the Faces for a benefit concert at the Empire Pool, Wembley (later renamed the Wembley Arena). A young Steve Jones, future guitarist with the Sex Pistols, was in the audience, and would later say the Dolls’ shambolic set was a huge inspiration.But the tour turned into a nightmare when Murcia drowned in a bath at a party while under the influence of alcohol and methaqualone. The band cancelled the rest of their British gigs and returned to the US.View image in fullscreenDavid Johansen in 1987.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsBack in New York, Jerry Nolan replaced Murcia on drums and in 1973 the band were signed to Mercury Records. The eponymous debut album was produced by the singer and musicianTodd Rundgrenand featuredLonely Planet Boy, an atypically low-key and poignant number written by Johansen, andVietnamese Baby, in which Johansen played against his hedonistic image by attempting a sincere political statement.The album cover, however, could not have looked more decadent. Johansen later said that he wanted to look like the French actressSimone Signoret. Music critics loved the record, but sales did not match the hype. A second album, Too Much Too Soon (1974), again proved asuccès d’estime, which was not what the record company wanted, and the band was dropped, only to be taken under the wing of another Brit,Malcolm McLaren.The first meeting between Johansen and McLaren and his then partner,Vivienne Westwood, took place at a fashion fair in New York in autumn 1973, when the pair were on a visit to scout clothing for their London shop. Now McLaren was back in New York looking for opportunities in rock management.He put down the money to rent a rehearsal space on 23rd Street in Manhattan, while Westwood set about remodelling the band’s image complete with zip-festooned red leather and striking vinyl outfits. McLaren draped the band’s stage in the communist flag and put out a press release stating: “What are the politics of boredom? Better red than dead!”Johansen later claimed the inspiration came from a song he co-wrote with Sylvain,Red Patent Leather. “That wasn’t Malcolm’s idea, that was our idea,” he said.View image in fullscreenDavid Johansen, left, as the Ghost of Christmas Past with Bill Murray in the 1988 film Scrooged.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarWhoever was responsible, the stunt backfired. Audiences were not so much outraged as merely turned off. Even die-hard fans walked out of the band’sNew Yorkshows. The Dolls struggled on playing tiny venues for small fees in various permutations until fizzling out, while McLaren returned to London, putting his talent for provocation to use with the Sex Pistols.While the early adopters of the burgeoning punk scene in New York and London sang the praises of the Dolls, Johansen sought more mainstream acceptance. His first, eponymous solo album was voted 10th best album of 1978 – sandwiched between the Cars andWarren Zevon– by the Village Voice. A follow-up, In Style (1979), featured synthesizers and horns, further distancing the singer from his punk audience.His self-produced albumThe David Johansen Group Livewas recorded in 1978 as a promotional exercise and given a wider release in CD format in 1993.Johansen achieved his only significant solo chart success in 1988, when a cover version of Hot Hot Hot, performed in his lounge singer persona,Buster Poindexter, reached No 11 on the Billboard chart. It made little impact in the UK, where the original Arrow version remains the most recognised, but in true contrarian style, Johansen said the success of the track was the bane of his life.In 2000, he turned to a blues-influenced sound withThe Harry Smiths, named in tribute to the compiler of the Anthology of American Folk Music.In 2004, Morrissey, who had, as a teenager, organised the British arm of the New York Dolls fan club, invited the three surviving band members – Johansen, Sylvain and Kane – to London to perform at the Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre. The show was well received but Kane died from leukemia weeks later. Johansen and Sylvain, augmented by a rotating lineup of guest musicians, went on to play live dates internationally over the next seven years.The Dolls released three further albums –One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This (2006), Cause I Sez So (2009), and Dancing Backwards in High Heels (2011) – to much critical acclaim, and played their final gig at the Clyde Auditorium in Glasgow, supporting Alice Cooper, in 2011.Born in Staten Island, New York, David was the son of Helen (nee Cullen), a librarian, and Gunvold Johansen, an insurance salesman, and attended Port Richmond high school. His singing career began in two local bands, the Vagabond Missionaries and the Electric Japs, before being recruited by the Dolls.Alongside his musical career, Johansen had a number of acting roles, including an appearance as theGhost of Christmas Pastopposite Bill Murray in Scrooged (1988) and alongside Hulk Hogan in Mr Nanny (1993).Personality Crisis: One Night Only(2023), a documentary featuring his performance as Buster Poindexter at the Cafe Carlyle in Manhattan, was directed by Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi.Johansen’s first two marriages, to the actor Cyrinda Foxe in 1977, then to the photographer and writer Kate Simon in 1983, ended in divorce. In 2013 he married Mara Hennessey.He had been living with cancer and been confined to bed since breaking his back last November. He is survived by Mara and her daughter, Leah.David Roger Johansen, singer, musician and actor, born 9 January 1950; died 28 February 2025Explore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockNew YorkSex PistolsobituariesShareReuse this content"

But its approach to nature is so cosy it’s the eco equivalent of wearing blinkers and sticking your fingers in your earsRebecca NicholsonSun 2 Mar 2025 14.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 14.33 ESTShareIt does seem a little spoiled to be critical of a documentary as gorgeous as The Americas, a vast, grandiose Tom Hanks-narrated nature series which explores territory from New England to the tip of Patagonia. But we are living through an extraordinary glut of nature television, and the pool of previously unfilmed and unfilmable natural world scenes must surely be getting smaller. This 10-parter talks up its credentials as something new and different: five years in the making, gathered over 180 separate expeditions, capturing discoveries which have never been on camera before, the most expensive unscripted project ever made by NBC (via BBC Studios). Why, then, does it feel so familiar, and occasionally even tepid?This is nature television that is best enjoyed with your brain closed off. Much like Apple TV+’s recent The Secret Lives of Animals, it favours cutesy anthropomorphism and spectacular visuals over any honest assessment of nature and the environment as a whole. There is little brutality, barely any peril – a red-tailed hawk hovers near some adorable racoon babies, but that’s about it – and an almost offensive unwillingness to even consider the impact humanity has had, and continues to have, on species and their habitats.Clearly that is not what it’s here to do. Choosing Hanks as narrator positions it in a cosy corner, and he delivers on that. It would be churlish not to be awed by the footage, which is amazing in the truest sense of the word. Anyone with a passing interest in animals or the great outdoors will find plenty of surface entertainment here. On the Outer Banks of North Carolina, wild stallions fight for dominance, manes flying in the wind in slow-motion, as if an 80s soft rock band is performing their chart-topping ballad. In Chesapeake Bay, a bald eagle, surprisingly bad at getting fish out of water, instead pinches them from osprey, who are much better adapted. In the Graveyard of the Atlantic, there are sand tigers, which have formed a mutually beneficial relationship with a much smaller fish, protecting it from predators while, presumably, it hides the shark and allows it to eat that predator.In some vaguely defined suburbia, periodical cicadas emerge after 17 years underground. Watching them assume their adult form, as they shed their old skin, is gruesome and mesmerising. We see fireflies putting on a spectacular performance in the Appalachian woods, and of course, that old nature show standard emerges in the Smoky Mountains, as a protective mother bear is shown to watch over and fight for her cubs. Its most fascinating footage, to my eye, is of an oak tree in Massachusetts, dropping its leaves for autumn. It sounds ordinary, but to watch that long process of the leaves losing their green, turning red and brown then falling from the tree, all sped up into a few moments of television, is remarkable.Why, then, does this feel so shallow? In part, because for all of its promises of new discoveries, it falls back on well-worn anthropomorphism. The eagle, brought back from near-extinction by a conservation programme (the only mention of conservation here), thrives due to its “attitude”. The raccoons, hustling for existence in New York City, have an anxious mother protecting her young from the hawk, but also an eldest son, who must leave the family home and make his own way in life. The bears of the Smoky Mountains – America’s most visited National Park – are bringing “magic to millions”, as if their sole purpose is to be characters in some real-world Disney attraction.The danger of this approach is that it makes it sound as if everything is fine, that sufficient moxie will allow endangered species to thrive, that the natural world is the same as it ever was, only now we can watch it from our sofas and are encouraged to go “ahh”. There is nothing wrong with a cute nature documentary, in ordinary times, and this is lovely to look at and impressively filmed.But these are not ordinary times. Climate denial is thoroughly mainstream. The US administration is erasingmentionsof the climate crisis across government websites. BP is increasing oil and gas pollution and reducing its investments in renewable energy. Humanity has buried its head in the sand and is allowing it to become entombed there. I suppose you could argue that is not the job of a sweet nature documentary narrated by Tom Hanks to bang the drum about the scale of the climate crisis. But it is becoming less and less easy to sit back and enjoy the show when that show is wearing blinkers and sticking its fingers in its ears. Even if it is humming a pretty tune.The Americas aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTom HanksreviewsShareReuse this content"

We asked nine prominent writersPeter ConradSun 2 Mar 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 09.42 ESTShareEarly in 2020, as society shut down, I retreated behind closed doors withCharles Dickens, who kept me company and cheered me up throughout the pandemic. Carried along by narratives that Dickens thought of as speedy locomotives and warmed by a combustible imagination that he compared to an industrial forge, I soon felt no need for tame timed circuits of the local park, and I even stopped fretting about the imminent end of the world. But although Dickens saved from me one disease, he infected me with another: escaping Covid-19, I contracted an incurable monomania instead.Emerging after the last lockdown, I buttonholed any friend who would listen and began to claim that Dickens contained the whole of literature. His novels made everyone else’s seem puny. Larger even than the newly metropolitan London he described, their scale is planetary: looking down from on high inA Tale of Two Cities, he ponders “the feeble shining of this earth of ours” and marvels at the “greatnesses and littlenesses” crammed on to it. Those swarming creatures are not exclusively human. At a country estate inBleak House, Dickens overhears “motions of fancy” in the barnyard, where stabled horses conspire to corrupt a pony, a dim-witted mastiff dozing in the sun is puzzled by the moving shadows, and a turkey frets about the coming of Christmas. Inanimate objects also qualify as characters, andSketches by Bozfloats a theory about the physiognomy of brass door-knockers, which mould themselves into portraits of the house-owners.Dickens’s achievements as a novelist were, for me, just the beginning. He was also a poet, whose metaphors make prosaic objects strange: seen by him, umbrellas become bony skeletons or impertinent phallic symbols or tropical foliage or whatever else he pleases. And in addition he was a dramatist, who not only invented characters but brought them to life at his public readings, when he astonished his audiences by transforming himself into sickly little Paul fromDombey and Sonorthe gin-sodden nurse Mrs Gamp fromMartin Chuzzlewit. In a violently self-contradictory double act, he played both the streetwalker Nancy and her brutish pimp Bill Sikes when he acted out the murder scene fromOliver Twist. Shakespeare, Dickens noted, had two simultaneous careers as “author and stage-player”: why shouldn’t he be equally versatile?View image in fullscreenOlivia Colman as Miss Havisham in the BBC’s 2023 version of Great Expectations.Photograph: BBCProtesting too much, Dickens said that he trailed “a few millions of leagues behind” Shakespeare. The truth is that he was fiercely competitive and regarded Shakespeare as his only rival. He knew the plays inside out and was always casually quoting them, yet what he borrowed he customarily altered or edged into unfamiliar contexts, making the words his own. In need of a name for a new periodical, he remembered Othello telling Desdemona “the story of my life, / From year to year”; he therefore called the magazineAll the Year Roundand adapted the quotation on the title page to read “The story of our lives, from year to year”. Othello’s digest of military triumphs glorifies only himself, but Dickens rebukes this conceit and transcends Shakespeare as well, opening the phrase out into a democratic statement of his editorial mission. Journalism is a synonym for daily life, and he intended to produce a communal diary.Jibes from some disrespectful characters in his novels help Dickens to narrow that gap of a few million leagues. David Copperfield’s child-bride Dora, for instance, thinks Shakespeare “a terrible fellow” and grimaces when David reads the plays to her to improve her mind; a hack charged with plagiarism inNicholas Nicklebypoints out that Shakespeare also purloined his plots and grudgingly adds “very well he adapted too – considering”. At a time when Shakespeare had been deified – Coleridge likened his “omnipresent creativeness” to the biological bounty of God – such potshots were almost blasphemous, and that, I think, is what Dickens intended.While Shakespeare is enshrined as a hallowed icon, Dickens, like Banksy, writes blackly prophetic graffiti on the wallInMartin Chuzzlewita viscountwho goes to the theatre to ogle the women on stage grumbles that Shakespeare’s heroines have “no legs at all”. Although the fatuous fellow would be better off watching the can-can at the Folies Bergère, his bizarre critique makes sense: Shakespeare’s scripts endow his characters with minds and voices, but otherwise they are bodiless, needing actors to supply them with faces and physiques. Dickens made up for that by anatomising his quirky people from top to toe, making sure that each of them is unrepeatably idiosyncratic. Often they have prosthetic limbs, glass eyes and detachable heads; many of them appear to be fabricated from wood, wax, flannel or rubber, not just flesh and blood. Rather than describing men and women like those who already exist, Dickens manufactured a whole new species, which is why he often alludes to the myth of Prometheus, who roughly sculpted the first human beings from the mud of a river bed and enlivened them with fire stolen from the hearth of Zeus.Spurring my hobby-horse to a gallop, I took to saying that Dickens was better than Shakespeare – at once more uproariously funny and more violently scary, more freakish and fantastical, an originator who created his own universe and had every right to nickname himself “The Inimitable”. But this went too far, and my most tolerant friends blinked in disbelief or froze in disapproval. Shakespeare, I gathered, is sacrosanct – but why? The reasons for his supremacy have as much to do with national self-esteem as with literary merit. “Triumph, my Britain,” crowed Ben Jonson in a poem that ordered “all scenes of Europe” to bow down before the country in which Shakespeare deigned to be born. Such patriotic puffery still continues: in the Amazon listing for a book about him that Boris Johnson has so far neglected to write, Shakespeare is called “the true British icon”. Is he the last remnant of the country’s vanished sense of global supremacy?View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch as Hamlet and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Laertes at the Barbican in London.Photograph: National Theatre/Amazon Prime VideoThe dying John of Gaunt inRichard IIrhapsodises about “this dear, dear land”, which he calls a “precious stone set in a silver sea”. Dickens briefly glances at “the one great garden of the whole cultivated island” during harvest inTheMystery of Edwin Drood, but his map of England is murkier, spotted with towns called Dullborough, Mudfog and Eatanswill. He detested jingoistic hype, and when surveying London in its pall of rheumy fog inBleak Househe demolishes an imperial slogan. “[B]etter for the national glory,” he says, “even that the sun should sometimes set upon the British dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder” as the city’s slums. “Dickensian” is a term of censure, still applied to insanitary social conditions or grimly oppressive institutions that he would have denounced. While Shakespeare is enshrined as a hallowed icon, Dickens, like Banksy or thedisembodied handatBelshazzar’s feast, writes blackly prophetic graffiti on the wall.Shakespeare’s Gaunt goes on to grieve that England, rather than conquering the world, now “makes a shameful conquest of itself”. Dickens derives an anarchic comedy from the same collapse. When David Copperfield gets a job as a parliamentary reporter, he practises shorthand at home, scribbling as his family and friends improvise abusive political debates. Dotty Mr Dick, a deputy for his namesake Dickens, forgets that the rowdy repartee is a game, and feels personally responsible for “the annihilation of the British constitution, and the ruin of the country”. That might have been the covert ambition of Dickens himself. He raged against the chilly complacency of the ruling class, and goaded the elements to join his rhetorical vendetta. InBleak House, Sir Leicester Dedlock’s seasick qualms while crossing the English Channel rehearse a political uprising: Dickens calls the turbulent waters “the Radical of Nature”, and reports that they provoke a nauseous “revolution” in the old fogey’s aristocratic stomach.No such authorial commentary can be expected from Shakespeare, who owes his bardic status to the fact that we know so little about his life and nothing at all about his political convictions. Dickens envied this anonymity, adding that he “tremble[d] every day lest something should come out” about Shakespeare. It was a typically waspish comment: he would surely have relished any tittle-tattle that humanised “the sweet swan of Avon”, as Jonson called him. Like Hamlet, Shakespeare is a connoisseur of ambiguities and uncertainties, which makes him see all sides of every question. Before the Brexit referendum,a columnin theTimeshailed him as a patron of the leave campaign, pointing out that he rallied us to cheer Henry V’s victory over the effete French at Agincourt.Replyingin theGuardian, Chris Bryant enrolled Shakespeare as a remainer for the rather feeble reason that his plays are often set abroad. Shakespeare might have dramatised the debate, as he does when Brutus and Antony wrangle in the marketplace inJulius Caesar, but without exercising a casting vote.Dickens could make monsters of the people he described, and he was both elated and alarmed by the sorcery he practisedDickens, on the contrary, was always partisan, and in the novels he uses his privileged position as a narrator to address or accuse the nation. When smallpox kills the pathetic street sweeper Jo inBleak House, he blames the monarchy, the legislature and the church for the boy’s sad end. “Dead, your Majesty,” Dickens announces. “Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, right reverends and wrong reverends of every order.” As he saw it, kings were pampered wastrels squabbling over a crown which he compared to “a stewpan without a handle”; likewise all politicians were gasbags and all clerics sanctimonious hypocrites, while the antiquated rites at St James’s Palace, Westminster and the Inns of Court resembled what he thought of as African mumbo-jumbo. We are a long way from Shakespeare’s “sceptred isle”.Nadhim Zahawi once baselesslybraggedthat Shakespeare “in his soul and actions was a natural Tory”, and Dickens’s contempt for the state and its ceremonial masquerades has not deterred Conservatives from trying to co-opt him as another true-blue icon. In 2012 Jeremy Hunt, as culture secretary in David Cameron’s government, marked Dickens’s bicentenary by distributing copies of his novels to the cabinet. Presumably the books went unread, which saved Hunt’s cronies from having to confront acid-etched replicas of themselves. Cameron, who nonchalantlywhistledon his way back into Downing Street after resigning, was as slickly aloof as David Copperfield’s false friend Steerforth. George Osborne, Cameron’s chancellor, resembled the parliamentarian Bowley in the Christmas storyThe Chimes, who replaces our supposed maker with a financial potentate when he refers to “a matter of deep moment between a man and his – and his banker”. Theresa May, then in censorious mode as home secretary, had an emasculating role-model in Miss Murdstone fromDavid Copperfield, a “metallic lady” who keeps her purse “in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite”.View image in fullscreenTheo Wake in Oliver! at Leeds Playhouse.Photograph: Alastair MuirThat description reveals how dangerous Dickens is: he could make monsters of the people he described, and he was both elated and alarmed by the sorcery he practised. On one of his night walks through London, he paused outside an asylum in Southwark and reflected on the internees. How different were they from those of us who pass for sane, since in our dreams we all behave like lunatics? Writing about this reverie, he defers to Shakespeare as “the great master who knew everything”, then immediately enunciates something that his rival didn’t know. Macbeth, tormented by insomnia, “called Sleep the death of each day’s life”, which prompts Dickens to ask why he “did not call Dreams the insanity of each day’s sanity”.The alternative line is a triumph of oneupmanship: Shakespeare’s solemn truism is obliterated by a flash of Freudian insight which at the same time neatly defines the hallucinatory vividness of certain traumatic episodes in Dickens’s own novels – Affery inLittle Dorritwatching her husband Flintwinch batter a duplicate of himself with a candle snuffer, or Quilp, the malign dwarf inThe Old Curiosity Shop, terrorising his wife like “a dismounted nightmare”. These are waking dreams, unbelievable but terrifyingly real despite their surrealism, creepier than the histrionic antics of Hamlet when he pretends to be deranged or Lear crazily cavorting on the heath.One Shakespearean motto lodged in Dickens’s mind, almost as an irritant. This was Prospero’s boast inThe Tempestabout his “so potent art”, by which he means the magic that whips up storms and even resurrects the dead. Dickens was also a magician, who performed conjuring tricks at parties and thought of his poetic metaphors as verbal spells; he frequently quoted Prospero’s phrase, as if quietly asking whose art was the more potent. At the end of the play, Shakespeare’s magus wearily discards his book of charms and resigns himself to impotent mortality: he cannot match the creative energy of Dickens, who said that when writing he often felt that his head was about to explode “like a fired shell”.Dickens never gave up his ambition to overtake Shakespeare, and in real estate he managed to do so. As a child on rural rambles with his father he admired a house at Gad’s Hill outside Rochester; eventually he bought the property, which is where he died. It appealed because of its Shakespearean associations: Falstaff inHenry IVrobs some travellers there, then runs off in a foolish panic when accosted by Prince Hal. In his hall Dickens hung a heraldic scroll which announced that “This house, Gad’s Hill Place, stands on the summit of Shakespeare’s Gadshill, ever memorable for its association in his noble fancy with Sir John Falstaff”. The inscription courteously ennobles Shakespeare, although the episode exposes Falstaff at his most ignoble; a reverentialsonnetby Matthew Arnold placed Shakespeare on “the loftiest hill”, but Dickens reminded visitors that this particular summit belonged to him.Even so, there is no need for a squabble about prior rights to the Kentish Parnassus. Moderating my more fervent claims, I’d suggest a compromise: Shakespeare might perhaps move over a little and allow Dickens to share the throne.Peter Conrad’sDickens the Enchanter: Inside the Explosive Imagination of the Great Storytelleris published by Bloomsbury Continuum (£22).

They came from the 500ft tall Borough Hill transmitter – truly revolutionary technology in 1925 – which opened with a new work, Daventry Calling, by the poet Alfred Noyes.“Sitting around your hearth/Ye are at one with all on earth,” the poem concluded, giving a utopian flavour that recurs often through Beaty Rubens’s meticulously detailed, engaging book. Exploring how radio transformed the lives of Britons between the two world wars, it’s a striking read in our smartphone-dominated world, as we witness another radical invention quickly becoming part of everyday life. A portal into other places from your own house was also an easy concept to sell. Take the cover of the first Christmas issue ofRadio Timesfrom 1923, one of many fascinating images in the book, showing a rapt family gathering around their small set.Rubens, a BBC producer for more than 35 years, is keen for her book to show how radio affected people’s lives – “the shift in household habits, the awakenings of new tastes, the alterations and adaptations of attitudes”. Evidence for this was minimal before she discovered the work of two pioneering audience researchers,Hilda Jennings and Winifred Gill, whose 1938 explorations into radio’s effects on working-class people in Barton Hill, near Bristol, was published, and quickly overlooked, in the week Britain declared war on Germany.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These included radio’s effects on a man who was once drunk and abusive (“his wife used to tremble when he came home at night, but now he never goes out on Saturday nights even… he used to keep pigeons, now he breeds canaries”), a Welsh grocer obsessed with the news (“I’ve even neglected the bacon machine”) and a husband who tunes the radio to foreign-language stations when he leaves for work, so his wife can’t understand it, then disconnects it completely when he goes away for a conference. “She’s left him now,” trills the interviewee on this subject.Rubens’s findings may have been the book’s impetus, but other stories around the development of radio put flesh on these bones. We learn about a forerunner, the 19th-century Electrophone, which played performances and shows over phone lines (in a gorgeous piece for theStrandmagazine, children’s writer Arthur Mee calls it the “pleasure telephone”). We’re also told about wireless communications more broadly: they may have saved some lives on the Titanic via an SOS call, but they also hampered them (richer passengers on board were invited to send wireless communications back to shore, which jammed the channels, meaning several ice warnings were missed).View image in fullscreenThe first Christmas issue of the Radio Times in 1923.Illustration: John Frost Newspapers/AlamyFabulous characters crop up too, such as Nellie Melba, the Australian opera singer who gave the first live broadcast performance in 1920. She initially declined the invitation in a diva-like fashion (“my voice is not a subject for experimentation”) before, Rubens notes, she was offered “£1,000 (about £45,000 today) which, even by her standards, must have seemed easy money for a 20-minute recital”.The book’s most moving moments offer radio as a lifeline. A Mrs Ettery reported that there was now “much more to talk about… there are so many interesting things on the wireless”. What a joy, too, to read about director general Lord Reith’s first director of talks,Hilda Matheson, who informed the BBC’s style (“she was passionately committed to the novel idea that broadcaster should not speakatlisteners but make them feel that they were in the room together”). She also launched weekly discussions with female MPs and a show calledQuestions for Women Votersin 1928. A year later, 10 more women MPs were elected, raising the number to 14.The finest testimony, however, comes from a 1928 letter to the BBC from a “clerk in a provincial city”. His life is “a tram-ride to the office, lunch in a tea-shop or saloon bar, a tram-ride home” and he can’t spend much money, “because you’ve got your holidays to think of”. But, he adds: “Please don’t think I’m complaining. I’m only writing to say how much wireless means to me and thousands of the same sort. It’s a real magic carpet.” Almost 100 years later, despite our world being so very different to his, radio, at its best, continues to be.Listen In: How Radio Changed the Homeby Beaty Rubens is published by Bodleian (£30).

As the collections played out against a particularly tumultuous political backdrop this season, his parting sentiment seemed more significant than ever.“I wanted to imagine new harmony because I believe that is what we all need,” said the 90-year-old designer on Sunday afternoon.View image in fullscreen‘Each collection stems from the desire to explore new perspectives and offer fresh interpretations of a style,’ Armani said.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APArmani famously does not do provocation. While many other designers are pressured to cut through the noise of a saturated and struggling luxury industry with shock tactics, Armani remains one of the most successful purveyors of a consistent style serenity. It might account for the fact that after five decades building the Armani group into a global powerhouse and amassing a fortune estimated by Forbes at $13bn (£10bn), Armani seems to still really enjoy his day job.“For me, each collection stems from the desire to explore new perspectives and offer fresh interpretations of a style with clear, well-defined contours,” he said. This season he “reflected on roots, envisioning clothes that take on the colours of the earth, minerals and sun-scorched landscapes”.It materialised in signature silk trouser suits in Armani’s sand-and-stone palette known as “greige” and bead-embroidered waistcoats, blazers, and bustiers that looked like a cracked-open blue quartz crystal – incidentally famed for its calming properties.A Giorgio Armani show can always be relied upon for its red-carpet segment at the end adored by Hollywood power players including Cate Blanchett, Viola Davis and Nicole Kidman. This season it was especially weightless and ethereal with wafer-thin silk gowns appliqued all over with micro sequins, delivering a dreamlike antidote to the weight of reality.View image in fullscreenModels during the Armani show.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APOn Saturday, the Dolce & Gabbana show eschewed its usual glitz with a utilitarian collection called Cool Girls. Inspired by “girls on the street”, the designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana opened the doors to their central Milan HQ and instructed their 78 models to walk off the catwalk and on to the street to pose on a scaffolded platform for the waiting crowds.This collection, they said, was less about one item and more focused on real life and self-styling. The reality check did not make this any less glam than expected from the brand that celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Its signature jewel-embellished denim, leopard-print coats, and satin corsetry were all on display.View image in fullscreenModels at the Dolce & Gabbana show stepped outside on to a scaffolded platform on the street.Photograph: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty ImagesLast summer, its chief executive, Alfonso Dolce, said the brand’s revenue for the 2023-24 fiscal year was up 17% to €1.871bn alongside plans to open 12 new stores in the US.Explore more on these topicsArmaniMilan fashion weekDolce & GabbanaFashion weeksItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rowley Farm’s holiday cottages are block-booked for the 2025spring lambing season, which traditionally peaks around Easter.“For farmers like me it’s a bit strange to treat sheep like pets,” John said. Self-catering guests arrive at Rowley Farm from February to May to feed hay to her pregnant ewes, and to bottle-feed orphan lambs who have been abandoned by their mothers or are the thirds in triplets (which ewes can struggle to feed).“Mostly the guests want to touch and cuddle the lambs rather than do the mucking out,” she said.View image in fullscreenLambing duties on Penhein Farm, in Monmouthshire.Photograph: HandoutLambs are an unlikely holiday attraction that is becoming increasingly popular. Farm Stay UK, a co-operative for farmers in hospitality, said that 90 of its 400 members now offer“lamb watch” holidays. A number of farms are expanding their lambing offerings for 2025 to include yoga sessions in lambing sheds andadults-only night-time lamb watches. Church Farm in Lancing, West Sussex, offers evenings with the “shepherdess team” where visitors can feed lambs and watch out for live births.Some put this popularity down to the effect of TV shows such asClarkson’s Farmand BBC Two’sLambing Live, which is back for its fourth series in April; others to social media and literary sensation the Yorkshire Shepherdess (Swaledale farmer Amanda Owen); or the growth of live-stream lambing cams such aslambwatch.co.ukand Walby Farm Park’s Lamb Cam Live.Farmer Helen Hearn introduced lambing-shed slots for visitors in 2023 after demand began to outstrip capacity at 450-acre Penhein Farm in Monmouthshire. Guests accompany Hearn – checking the sheds for births, ensuring lambs in the field are paired up with their mothers and bottle feeding the lambs – at a charge of £45 for up to eight people a shed. “We charge for lambing as it takes four times as long to do our farming rounds when the public is involved,” she said, “even if they are willing to muck in.”Hearn allows some of the families who stay over in her farm glamping pods to manage a sheep shed themselves for the duration of their stay, feeding the lambs and ewes and watching for new births and ewes in distress. She thinks lambing breaks answer a human need for connection to nature. “In previous generations most British people would have an aunt or cousin who worked on a farm and would be around farm animals that way,” she said. “That’s all gone now.”Hearn said she wouldn’t install a lamb cam for the public to witness live births, however. “Often I’ll get a delivery that’s tricky: there’s ring womb [when the cervix doesn’t fully dilate], say, and the vet needs to come for a caesarean or the lamb comes out dead,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The graphic designer has volunteered for lambing season at her local farm, Readstock in Bagber, Dorset, since 2022. With no prior farming experience, Arnold has now delivered and raised more than 90 lambs, including bottle-fed orphans Jimmy Chew and Wonky, who Arnold christened and who both still live on the farm.“I discovered lambing when I was going through a tricky period in my life and it’s total escapism for me,” she said. However, she points out the hobby isn’t all gambolling newborns. “It’s an everyday soap opera in the lambing shed. Lambs and ewes die regularly, and you have to learn to handle that.”In Hampshire, farmers Fran and John Drake have had to take on additional staff, including veterinary students, to cope with surging demand for lambing stays at Michelmersh Manor Farm, a family-run mixed arable, dairy and sheep farm where 140 lambs are expected this April. “We have one London family coming back for their fourth lambing season,” Fran Drake said. In the farmers’ view, the lambing craze is down to Britons’ thirst for optimism at the end of the long winter months. “We’ve always had it a bit, haven’t we?” Fran said. “Spring flowers in bloom, new life, and all that?”At a busy time of the year for farmers, offering lambing stays undoubtedly adds an administrative burden. Pregnant women, for example, are not advised to handle lambs and sheep due to the risks of infections such as toxoplasmosis and listerialisteriosis. “You have to pay for insurance and do the health and safety assessments and make sure guests know the risks,” Hearn said. “So it’s not for bigger sheep farmers, who have upwards of 400 ewes and 700 lambs a season and don’t have time to look after tourists.”Michael Gibbs, who has farmed at Mill Farm in Middle Tysoe, Warwickshire, for 50 years, welcomes local schoolchildren into his lambing sheds but is unconvinced about turning it into a spectator sport.Farmingis a business, after all. “The French have a taste for British lamb at the moment and prices are up 30% on 2022,” the 73-year-old said, passing a trailer of hoggets (sheep between one and two years old) off to market. “That’s what the job is at the end of the day. It’s not all cuddles.”Explore more on these topicsFarm animalsUK eco-escapesFarmingLambfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Broadsands – not to be confused with the beach of the same name in south Devon – is a hidden gem, lying 239 steps down from theSouth West Coast Path, between Watermouth and Combe Martin. It’s also accessible by kayak from Combe Martin, but for those who do walk, the lovely outdoor terrace at the nearby Sawmills Freehouse is the perfect recovery spot after the climb back up.sawmillsfreehouse.co.ukHike Dunkery BeaconView image in fullscreenA walker approaching the summit cairn of Dunkery Beacon.Photograph: Christopher Nicholson/AlamyRising 1,700ft above Exmoor’s wooded valleys and rolling hills, Dunkery Beacon is the highest point in the national park, and at its loveliest in spring when wild flowers carpet the valley woodland. A circular walking trail runs from the car park at the Webber’s Post lookout spot, with Bronze Age barrows dotted around the landscape and the chance of spotting red deer between the trees.

Just in case? Should we all perhaps, have a little stash of mifepristone in our makeup bags, a secret number in our phone? Something is happening in the US that requires our attention. Hard-earned rights are being erased and the speed at which history is being rewritten there does not bode well for our freedoms here. We are already seeing dark reflections in the glass. This month theObserverreportedhow British anti-abortion campaigners are echoing US vice-president JD Vance. He claimed our new buffer zone laws, preventing protests outside abortion clinics, were an attack on the “liberties of religious Britons”, shifting focus away from the reason they were implemented to a debate about freedom of speech.Buffer zones (intended to protect staff and women using the clinics) are being targeted in a careful campaign by conservative Christian groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a group that wants to ban abortion, opposes same-sex marriage and, in the US, has helped at least23 statespass legislation barring trans athletes from girls’ and women’s events as well as drafting legislation restricting gender-affirming treatment for minors. With only 1.4% of adolescents in the US identifying as transgender, LGBTQ+ rights groups accused the ADF of “whipping up a panic” over decisions better left to doctors, teachers and parents.Then, on Thursday afternoon two weeks ago, the word “transgender” and the letter T in LGBTQ+ wasremovedfrom the National Park Service’s Stonewall National Monument website. This was particularly shocking for those familiar with the Stonewall Riots in 1969, a time when being gay was classified as a mental illness in the US – it had been a crime in the UK until only two years earlier.Integral to this uprising against anti-queer police harassment were trans women, including Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. The deletion of the word from a website dedicated to one of the most important areas of gay activism works immediately to delegitimise trans people and clear the way for conservative groups to frame them as sick, or the result of a brand new contagion.Google removed Black History Month, Women’s History Month and LGBTQ+ holidays from its online calendarsBy that Thursday evening, “queer” and the letter Q had also been disappeared from the site, along with words deemed too “woke” on thousands of other government websites. Elsewhere,Googleremoved Black History Month, Women’s History Month and LGBTQ+ holidays from its online calendars. It was as if a van had quietly driven across America vandalising shrines with white paint.It’s clear that the past is being erased in order to direct the future. But – a key part of our history of oppression is resistance. In the US, where abortion is again banned in 20 states (and a government website outlining reproductive rights was removed within hours of President Donald Trump taking office), young women are getting sterilised. A recentstudyfound that tubal sterilisation visits increased 70% after May 2022 (when the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade leaked) in states likely to ban abortion. Perhaps it’s ironic that one effect of “pro-life” legislation will be fewer babies born.That news led me to dip back into the story of the Jane Collective, a group of activists who, in the 1960s when abortion was illegal in the US, put up posters: “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Call Jane.” First they referred women to doctors known to perform safe abortions, then they learned how to do it themselves.Womenpaid what they could afford and many said (in a lifetime of being dismissed or misunderstood) it was the best medical experience they’d had. Between 1969 and 1973, it’s estimated that the Jane Collective provided safe abortions for more than 11,000 people. Looking out across the anxious suburbs today, I can absolutely imagine school-gate mums organising similar.It’s no coincidence that the same tactics used to restrict abortion access are used to restrict gender-affirming care, nor that they’re lobbied for by the same conservative groups, who litigate loudly against trans, gay and abortion rights. It is bewildering, though, to see feminists who engage in anti-trans rhetoric offering up their own reproductive rights as a sweetener. Authoritarian movements require solidarity to resist, otherwise we’re all toast.And, with these rollbacks in the US, it feels urgent. At a rightwing conference two weeks ago, Kemi Badenoch said that “pronouns, diversity policies and climate activism” are a “poison”.Abortionis under attack here, too. In the decade leading to 2022, police in England and Wales recorded at least 67 cases of procuring an illegal abortion, with some women facing prosecution. Even if charges weren’t brought, the impact of the investigation can cause life-changing harm to the women and their families, with children being removed from their mothers or access restricted. In January, medical leaders spoke out after an “unprecedented” rise in women and girls being prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies – it’s still a criminal offence to have an abortion without approval from two doctors, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In 2025. In 2025!The more pregnancies I’ve had, the more noisy I get about the fact no person should be forced to continue a pregnancy against their will, or lose their autonomy and have their body policed. It feels as if it might be time to get our hands dirty, and form alliances to fight every deleted letter. Because when the words start disappearing, our rights are surely not far behind.Email Eva ate.wiseman@observer.co.ukExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Eva Wiseman columnAbortionLGBTQ+ rightsRoe v WadeWomencommentShareReuse this content"

But politicians are starting to pretend the pandemic never happenedKathryn BromwichSun 2 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTShareOn 20 March 2020, Rowan Brown started to feel a tickle at the back of her throat. Over the next few days, new symptoms began to emerge: difficulty breathing, some tiredness. By the following week, the UK had been put under lockdown in a last-minute attempt to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, or Covid-19. No one else she knew had yet been infected, so she posted updates on Facebook to keep people informed: “Oh, guys, it feels like a mild flu. Tonsillitis was definitely worse.”Brown didn’t know then she was at the beginning of a condition that did not yet have a name, but which has since become known as long Covid. After two weeks, she had a Zoom with a friend, and at the end of the conversation it was as if all life force had drained out of her body. Her doctor advised her to stay in bed for two weeks. Those two weeks turned into three and a half months of extended Covid symptoms: nausea, fevers, night sweats, intense muscle and joint pain, allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to pain), hallucinations, visual disturbances. By the end of the three months, she had noted 32 different symptoms. “I didn’t recognise the way my body felt at all: my skin, my hair,” she remembers now. “It was like being taken over by a weird alien virus, which I guess is what happened.”A busy secondary-school art teacher in Oxfordshire and mother of two, she was convinced she could defeat the virus by sheer force of will. At the time of infection, she had been doing Olympic-style weightlifting four times a week, deadlifting more than 100kg and doing CrossFit competitions. Every time she felt a little better, she tried to get up and be active. Every time, she would crash. For 18 months, she was confined to her bed with the curtains drawn. “It disrupted my autonomic system so severely, there were times when my body would forget to take a breath, and I would have to lie there and manually breathe.”Your job, being a parent, being creative, being fit, being a friend – gone. All of it. I was an empty shellRowan BrownBrown never went back to work. She lost the feeling in her hands and was unable to grip a pencil or a paintbrush, losing all muscle memory. “I had to relearn how to draw again. So while you’re dealing with these physical symptoms, you’re dealing with the compounding trauma that you have lost your entire identity: your job, being a parent, being creative, being fit, being a friend – gone. All of it. I was an empty shell.”Brown, 48, is one of2 millionpeople in the UK thought to be experiencing long Covid symptoms; according toa studypublished last summer, roughly 400 million people worldwide have been affected. Often, long Covid patients experience mild primary infections, are never admitted to hospital and only realise there is a problem later, when the symptoms persist well beyond the usual two weeks. Some make a full recovery, some see improvements over time; others, like Brown, have seen little progress since being infected five years ago.View image in fullscreenRowan Brown at her home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverOne of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating long Covid is its unpredictability: research studies have linked it tomore than 200 symptomsaffecting every part of the body. Many patients go on to develop complications such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder;59% of patientsshow signs of organ damage. Doctors are still searching for the root cause of the illness: is itmicroclots,cytokine storms,histamine intolerance,gut microbiomes,lingering spike protein in the brain,dysautonomia? There is still no biomarker test that confirms whether someone has long Covid or not. In the absence of concrete answers, clinics around the country are focusing on helping patients manage the condition. “There aren’t simple medicines that deal with the whole problem, but some medicines can help different parts of it,” says Dr Melissa Heightman, who leads the University College London Hospitals specialist long Covid clinic.My own experience of long Covid began on the first day of lockdown, 26 March, when I felt the virus moving from limb to limb like a malevolent force. The air I breathed felt like it would not reach my lungs, as though I were being suffocated from the inside. The days turned into weeks; the weeks turned into months. I first wrote about the effects of the illness on my body and mindin these pagesin November 2020; a month later, just as the symptoms were starting to show signs of improvement, my partner and I were reinfected following a walk in the park.For more than three years, I struggled to breathe, work, socialise or do almost anything at all. I compiled a list of activities that flared up my symptoms: loading the dishwasher, playingTetris, strong emotions of any kind, spicy food, watching a film, drinking alcohol, doing a crossword. The only things that helped were rest, sleep and spending a lot of time horizontal on the sofa. I found temporary relief invagus nerve exercises, and ameditation coursekept me connected to sanity by a thin, delicate thread. In something approaching a fugue state, I wrote ashort, strange novelabout a woman losing her mind in the Italian Alps, as I painstakingly attempted to regain mine in the 10-minute radius around our flat. Then slowly, in stops and starts, the setbacks became shorter, less intense. By summer 2023 I had started to feel something like my former self again rather than a husk. Life became a succession of firsts: the first face-to-face meeting with friends, the first meal out, the first time back in the office, the first music festival (last year’s bucolic, life-affirming Green Man).My average patient is previously very fit, very successful, and desperate to get back to normal lifeDr Ben Sinclair, GPIn many ways, I was one of the lucky ones.Olympic athletes,dancers,circus performers,actors,RAF officersand more have had their lives turned upside down by the illness; many have been left unable to work. While there are certain factors that make long Covid more likely – it appears to bemore prevalentin women, those with pre-existing health conditions and people facing socioeconomic deprivation – it can affect people from any background, irrespective of age or prior fitness levels. “Long Covid can happen to anyone,” says Heightman. “Often the people we see in clinic were completely well before, and now they’re really poorly. It is more common in women, but 30-40% of our patients are men.”The sentiment is echoed by Dr Ben Sinclair, a GP who started running aprivate long Covid clinicafter becoming seriously ill with the condition himself. “My average patient is previously very fit, very successful, and desperate to get back to normal life,” he says. “The people I’m looking at are actually incredibly motivated, the movers and shakers of society, and we lose them to our detriment.” The figure of 2 million patients, he says, is likely an underestimate. “People under-report this – probably 10% of people will go on to develop some form of post-Covid syndrome. I think we probably have a higher incidence, particularly among children, than is being currently reported.” According to the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics,110,000 childrenin the UK are living with long Covid; in the US, the figure is thought to be5.8 million.Avalyn Godfrey, from Cheshire, was 12 when she contracted Covid on a family holiday in October 2021. Two weeks later she went back to school after testing negative, but within a few hours she was falling asleep in class and had to call her mum Donna to pick her up. She was tested for diabetes, asthma, Addison’s disease; there were ECGs, blood tests, X-rays, ultrasounds of her heart. Everything came back clear. “It is a bit disheartening, because you know something’s wrong, but there’s no evidence,” she recalls. It took a year and a half to get a diagnosis; her dad, who also developed long Covid, was diagnosed in two weeks. “It isn’t just grownups who get it,” she says. “Kids definitely get it as well. But I didn’t even know it existed until I had it.”View image in fullscreenAvalyn Godfrey, 15, at home in Cheshire. Her long Covid diagnosis took a year and a half.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverHer then best friend caught Covid at the same time as her; her friend got better, she did not. When Godfrey eventually went back to school, her friend asked why she hadn’t been around. “I said I had long Covid. And she asked me if Iactuallystill had it, which was a bit weird, because it is in the name, ‘long’ Covid. It’s hard, if you get better from Covid, to see that it could have gone so wrong for you. We’re not really friends any more – after I got ill I moved school so I could have a fresh start.” After a few years mostly spent at home, Godfrey started officially being home-schooled last year, doing some GCSEs early to space them out. “I wouldn’t have been able to do nine of them in school at once. Home-schooling is definitely better for my health, and I can take things at my own pace. But it does get a bit lonely.”Now 15, Godfrey reserves the bulk of her energy for Saturdays, when she goes to a theatre club. “At the moment, we’re doingBeauty and the Beastand I’m Cogsworth, which is lucky, because he’s a clock so he doesn’t have to dance much.” While the others practise the dance routines, she looks after the younger children; one day, she hopes to be a primary school teacher. She is also a children’s author: she wrote and illustrated a book,Star Dizzy Lizzy, about a bird who wants to fly to the stars, “but when she tries she gets really dizzy, so she has to find new ways to do it”.One of the groups that was especially badly hit by long Covid was healthcare workers. Owing tohigh viral loads, poor PPE provisions, and a lack of immunity from prior infection or vaccines,hundredsof doctors and nursesdied of Covid, and a significant proportion went on to develop long Covid. Many have had to take early retirement on ill health grounds;a 2023 studyreported that one in five doctors were left unable to work, with less than a third working full time. Nearly 300 doctors and nurses, some of whom have been left living in poverty or homeless, arein the process of suingthe NHS and other employers for compensation. (The lawsuit is unlikely to go to the high courtbefore 2026because of the public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.)Layla Moran, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon and chair of thehealth and social care committee, is pushing for affected workers – doctors, nurses, social workers, transport workers, teachers – to be compensated. “Images rush to mind of people standing on their front porches hitting pans and saucepans for those frontline workers who put others before themselves and decided to go into work, whatever the consequences. Now, I’m in touch with nurses and doctors who are at their wits’ end.” One solution, she says, would be to classify long Covid as an occupational disease, asmore than 50 countriesworldwide do. “That would mean they’d be able to get benefits specifically for that. It’s the very least we owe those workers.”The fact there are so many nurses and doctors sat at home, not able to work, feels like a tragedySarah MatthewsPaediatric nurse Sarah Matthews, 34, had only qualified in 2018, but she felt like she had found her calling. “I felt good at it and felt confident, and I loved working for children,” she says. “It had its challenges – the shift work was the biggest – but I loved it.” She was working on a busy ward at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, and was due to run a half marathon the following week, when she got infected with Covid in July 2021. For the first six months, she didn’t panic. “I thought, ‘Give me another month, then I’ll feel better.’ But once it has been two years, it becomes harder to deal with mentally. I just never got better, the energy never came back.”Twice she tried to go back to work, on short shifts, but both times her health crashed. “Nursing is very physical,” she says. She was temporarily redeployed as a part-time receptionist, but after moving to Wales last year to get married, she struggled to find employment. “It’s hard to find a job where you don’t really need to do anything, and you’re sitting down and it’s only a few hours a week.” She now receives personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit, which took a while to get her head around. “The interviews you have to have are difficult, and after three years I have to go through it all again, so I’m not looking forward to that.” Supporting medical professionals affected by the condition, she says, should be a priority. “Hospitals are already in such a dire state, and the fact there are so many nurses and doctors sat at home, not able to work, feels like a tragedy.”It isn’t just medical professionals whose livelihoods have been affected. The estimated cost of long Covid to the global economy is$1tn, with millions of people out of work or on reduced hours. Many workers who had to take long-term sick leave were made redundant, and lawsuits are starting to appear in the courts, with long Covid tribunalssurgingby 86% in two years. (Last September, a tube driverwas awarded £42,000for unfair dismissal.)The numbers of sick people leaving the UK workforce areat record highs, and there are endlessarticlesbashing the unemployed, with titles such as “Who are the millions of Britons not working, and why?”. But these often makeno mentionof the words “long Covid”, and barely refer to the recent global pandemic. In 2022, Wes Streetingwas reassuring peopleabout how seriously Labour took long Covid, but now he is health secretary it seems to have dropped off the agenda. In theGet Britain Working white paperset out last November by the Department for Work and Pensions, long Covid is not mentioned. “It feels to me like the government isn’t putting two and two together: the shortage of nurses, all the people out of work since Covid,” says Matthews. “No one seems to say, ‘Oh, it’s probably because loads of people have long Covid.’”View image in fullscreenSarah Matthews at her home in Bridgend, Wales.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The ObserverThis is one of the strangest, and most worrying, obstacles to long Covid research and support. After the profound trauma of the pandemic, we appear to have developed acollective amnesiaabout what has happened. It’s an understandable survival mechanism; collective amnesia after war is awell-documented phenomenon. But it means that, politically, long Covid has become something no one wants to engage with. “There is definitely a political preference to put this behind us as a society,” says Heightman. “It’s a horrible thing, and everybody wants to move forward and feel positive about the future. But whenever anyone has done analysis of fit notes and post-viral illness, it has shown absolutely that long Covid is a big driver of absence from work. It’s just not reported in those high-level summary documents, which doesn’t make sense to me.”The unwillingness to discuss chronic illness in these conversations is especially concerning when combined with the scepticism faced by long Covid patients, who have to advocate for themselves so that medical professionals, employers and loved ones understand the gravity of their illness. Many report beingdisbelieved; shockingly, the then prime minister Boris Johnsonscrawled“bollocks… this is Gulf War Syndrome” next to an October 2020 memo discussing long Covid and its symptoms. Anyone posting about their experience online is likely to beaccusedof lying, or being lazy, or in the pocket of big pharma. “I certainly think being disbelieved is one of the biggest traumas for Covid patients,” says Sinclair. (This distrust will be familiar to patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, who have had their symptomsignored or dismissedfor decades. There is definitely overlap between long Covid and ME/CFS, says Sinclair, but they need to be differentiated.)All of this conspires to make long Covid patients feel invisible, voiceless and forgotten. On top of the chronic pain and unpredictable recovery they face, the effect can be devastating to individuals’ mental health.Worrying numbersof long Covid patients report depression, anxiety and insomnia; in a2022 survey, 45% of the nearly 200 patients who responded said they had contemplated suicide. “It’s a really awful illness,” says Heightman. “It’s not uncommon for us to have an appointment with someone, and them to share that they feel suicidal. It’s a particularly difficult illness to cope with, especially in people who were previously well, and the shock of losing their health and the uncertainty about the future is intolerable.” (Heightman recommends that patients struggling with these issues speak urgently to a GP or NHS 111; further support can be foundonline.)Roughly one in 10 long Covid patients go on to bediagnosed with PTSD; Brown is one of them. “I’ve never really understood when people talked about being triggered,” she says. “But now that I’ve experienced this level of trauma, I do.” During the worst stages of her illness, she spoke to her school’s psychotherapist once a week. “I don’t know how I would have survived mentally without her. She was a way of holding on to a piece of me, so that I could remember who I was as I went through this.” On top of being bed-bound, once it became clear that classroom teaching was out of the question, she found the lack of direction difficult to deal with. “There have been moments where you think: is this a life I want to have? I was lucky enough to have the resolve and that fabulous psychotherapist to hang on to, but I do find the assisted suicide debate triggering, because I can imagine a lot of people in that situation thinking: this is not a life for me.”There are, however, reasons to be hopeful. Since 2021, Heightman and her team have been running a clinical trial at UCLH calledStimulate-ICP, looking at three different medicines for long Covid, including an anticoagulant. The trial has completed successfully, with results expected towards late April or early May. “We’re going to come up with some really good treatments soon,” she says. “Research always feels like a really important part of hope.”Sinclair agrees: “There’s always something you can do. So if someone says to you, ‘I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do’, in that case, what we can do is care, we can research, we can campaign. I’ve never lost hope that we will conquer this.”Nobody knows what to do with us. I’m waiting for some big breakthrough, but I don’t know if it’s ever going to happenSarah MatthewsOf course, there are still challenges to come. Over in the US, Trump’s withdrawal from the WorldHealthOrganization and the appointment of vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as health secretary are unsettling developments. (Heightman explains that, although vaccines can flare up symptoms in some patients, they are for the most part “a good thing”, reducing both the risk and severity of long Covid.) Future pandemics are a concern. “Five years from the last pandemic just makes it five years closer to the next one,” says Moran. “We know it’s coming, and we don’t have to bury our heads in the sand this time.”Even though we are seeing fewer headlines about long Covid, previously healthy people are still contracting it, with each successive infectionincreasing the risk. “We sometimes will see someone who’s had Covid one, two or three times without problems, and then on the fourth time, suddenly they’ve got long Covid, and that makes them ill for a long time,” says Heightman. More disturbing still are the risks associated withchronic inflammationfor long Covid patients, even if they have outwardly recovered. “It’s likely to age you,” says Sinclair, “so it’s going toshorten your telomeres, and therefore increase your risk of early death. It’s also going to increase your risk of any inflammatory condition: cancer is a high risk; we may get heart disease, diabetes, dementia. There’s a huge knock-on in every body system from long Covid.”View image in fullscreenA protester demanding research into long Covid, London, March 2022.Photograph: Martin Pope/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockThe pandemic, we are told, is over: in May 2023, the WHOdeclaredthat the global health emergency had ended; phrases such as “post-Covid” and “post-pandemic” are now commonplace. For some people, however, things are slightly more complex. “When you’re stuck with long Covid, you do feel a bit left behind now,” says Brown. “Everyone says, ‘Oh, lockdown seems like ages ago.’ And you’re like, yeah, which means we’ve been ill for a really long time. We’re watching the world move on while still facing the unknown of what our futures are going to hold. It’s been five years. It’s going to be another five years. We’re losing decades of our life to this illness.”How long Covid forced me to confront my past and my identityRead moreFive years on from infection, I have seen improvements in my health. But I am still not quite the same as I was before March 2020. The illness has left its mark on me, something profound and indelible. I am on daily medication to regulate my heart rate, and have replaced running with gentler forms of exercise such as yoga; when tired or stressed, I feel a dull, metallic pain in my chest. One of the consequences of being ill for so long is that my husband and I have decided, for now at least, to focus on our own recovery rather than starting a family. I try not to think about what will happen with my next reinfection, or what the health implications of prolonged inflammation might mean in the longer term.No one is keener to move on from the trauma of the pandemic than those who continue to feel its effect in their body on a daily basis. It may be tempting to try to put that time behind us, to pretend it never happened. But for the sake of those who didn’t get better, we need to keep talking about long Covid, calling for the government and employers to give those who are suffering the support they desperately need. Only then will we all be able to truly move on. “I’ve given up a bit,” says Matthews. “Nobody knows what to do with us, so it feels hopeless. I don’t know if it’s ever going to happen, but I’m waiting for some big breakthrough.” If she was magically cured tomorrow, what would be the first thing she would do? “I’d go for a swim in the sea, go for a run, and then go on holiday. And maybe climb up a mountain.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, oremail jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

And what particular person or event kicked it off? Were there any D-list celebrities to venerate in the ancient world, for instance?RobertosMitch, via emailSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyThe Romans were no strangers to the D list. The Colosseum regularly played host to the hugely popular spectacle of Celebritas Sum... Exi Me Hinc!.EddieChorepostWe know the names ofhundreds of the ancient Olympic championsfrom 776BC to AD385. That’s quite an achievement based solely on being the fastest runner, or throwing furthest, on a particular day about 2,000 years ago.leadballoonI think “as we know it” requires the advent of radio and celluloid film – the advent of the affordable kinematograph ticket and, a bit later, the radio receiver in most homes. From about 1910 wouldn’t be far off, I would suggest. However, in general those who became world renowned had to possess extraordinary talents.Therefore, to be absolutely accurate, pop culture as we know it is a very recent phenomenon – a decade or two – relying on volume level (noise), access to decision-makers with vast amounts of cash and persistence in pushing to the front, rather than a seldom and peculiar ability.bricklayersoptionSinatra and the phenomenon ofthe bobby-soxersis often cited as an inflection point in popular culture.harpedonaptaeIf they mean when the term “popular culture” was coined, the earliest known use was in a speech by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in 1818; the shortening to “pop” dates from the 1950s. But humanity has probably always been broadly self-aware of a “popular culture”, since classes became stratified, yet aspects of culture remained broadly appealing across classes. There are hence two definitions of “pop culture”, both of which are unsatisfying. One is the notion of everything that’s left once you remove “high culture”; the other is anything that is so broadly appealing as to transcend class. It is debatable whether or not the first has ever existed, given that popularity isn’t just defined by whocanpartake in something, but also how many wouldlike topartake if they could – and there has never been an example of “high culture” that didn’t also have (theoretical) mass appeal.We know from history that people of all classes would readily visit the theatre, read “high” literature, watch sports and eat in restaurants, the only limit being the ability of many people to be able to afford to do so regularly. The same jokes would be told in the highest courts as would be told in the streets; the same songs regularly sung. As the industrial age created a new kind of upper class – the members of which became wealthy through commerce and investment as opposed to hereditary nobility – those lines became even more blurred. When the broadcasting age meant music and film could be disseminated even more democratically, the boundaries became lost entirely.We’ve also done such a good job of tearing down our nobility in the past century that the notion of “high-class values” has become basically non-existent; if anything, it’s more of a punchline. I’m sure they would like to pretend there is still a difference; I can’t imagine, for instance, that the queen was aRed Hot Chili Peppersfan. But the idea that there is a subset of culture that appeals only to “the masses” and another subset that appeals only to “the elite” is a fiction – and maybe always has been.thisisanicknamelolStages of pop culture:1. The emergence of urban working and middle classes in the 19th century.2. The discipline and stress of the new industrial economy that encouraged people to find escape. New entertainments and sports evolved to meet these needs.3. The growth of the press and improving rates of literacy.4. The arrival of film, radio and photo magazines at the turn of the 20th century.5. Jazz and other popular music styles from the 1920s to the 1940s. Radio broadcasts of sporting events.

Within just a few months of receiving orders, the couple moved with their three young children to the secluded outpost near Joshua Tree national park, joining the thousands of other active-duty service members and their families who live there.But in Twentynine Palms, almost everything feels far away. The closest Walmart is 30 miles (48km) down the highway. Palm Springs is an hour’s drive and Los Angeles is three. The isolated base, spread across roughly 1,000 sq miles (2,590 sq km) of open desert, is flanked on several sides by nothing more than rolling hills of sand and a string of unpopulated, low-slung mountains. The landscape isn’t the only otherworldly part of Twentynine Palms; every summer, temperatures in the triple digits descend on the community.“There’s just nothing out here,” Chapman said.In a setting that removed from the urban world, finding work can seem next to impossible. Despite having a college degree in sociology and economics, Chapman was laid off from her remote job in August, and then struggled to find an in-person role in human resources – a position she’s held at previous bases. Chapman and her family have moved to three states in six years.“Being a mom of three, I was like: ‘I have to do something or I’m going to go crazy,’” she said. “You know, we have groceries and bills and things that we have to do.”View image in fullscreenThe Twentynine Palms US military base in California, February 2025.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/GuardianSo Chapman started her own small business instead: C&O Gifts, a one-woman operationwhere she assembles themed gift baskets for holidays, birthdays, baby showers or any day of the year that might warrant a pick-me-up. Her business is a welcome financial boost for her family, but it also serves as an emotional boost to other spouses in Twentynine Palms. “It just makes it a little less lonely,” she said. Chapman is one of many spouses on the base with a burgeoning business; others sell handmade earrings and bracelets, pillowy loaves of sourdough and even mini photoshoot sessions for couples and families.Even on far less remote military bases, a glaring unemployment crisis has persisted for decades. Across the country, military spouses, who are predominantly women, have one of the highest rates of unemployment of any demographic:an estimated 22%. In 2021, amid the pandemic, that figure was reported to havesoared to 38%. Althoughthe vast majority of active-duty spouseshave some college education or higher,90% of spouses agreedin one study that military service negatively affected their careers.Many factors make finding a job difficult: frequent moves from base to base, the challenge of finding reliable childcare, the difficulty of transferring professional licenses among states and countries, and the lack of accessible remote jobs beyond customer-service roles. And many military families say that relying on only one income is less feasible than in generations past, especially as the cost of living goes up nationwide.View image in fullscreenWhen Madie Chapman (pictured) first moved to the California desert, she struggled to find work. Eventually she started her own business.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/GuardianIn that employment vacuum, many women have turned to entrepreneurship.On the Twentynine Palms base, Chapman and a tight-knit network of other spouses host “small-business expos” each month, where they showcase their businesses and sell their most recent creations, often to other wives and families from the base.Being a business owner also offers military spouses something much more valuable than just a job, said Stephanie Brown, the CEO and co-founder of non-profit the Military Spouse Chamber of Commerce.“Don’t get me wrong, we’re very proud to support the mission of our service members. But you do tend to lose some of that sense of self-identity,” Brown said. “So if we can help military spouses find that sense of purpose – as a small-business owner, as an independent contractor, as someone who is self-employed – then that’s a gift.”In the hours before Twentynine Palms’s most recent business expo – a Valentine’s Day-themed event staged in one common room on the base – more than a dozen business owners buzzed around their homes, preparing for the day ahead.I was denied access to the base for this story (Twentynine Palms stated that they didn’t have enough staff to escort me, as a member of the media, to the expo), so a handful of spouses met me just outside the barbed-wire confines of the combat center instead. Their cars were loaded down with supplies for the expo, and their children waited restlessly in the back seats. Half a mile away, armed guards stood watch at one entrance to the base. The muffled sound of artillery echoed regularly in the distance.Chapman rifled through stacks of plastic bins piled high in her trunk, putting together a sample Valentine’s basket, complete with a stuffed animal, body scrub, a heart-shaped pillow, chocolate candy and other small items. The first basket she ever made was for a spouse celebrating her 18th birthday while her husband was deployed, she said. Since then, Chapman has made similar gifts for military spouses who have given birth while their husbands were gone, or have been forced to celebrate wedding anniversaries alone.View image in fullscreenEmma Salazar now sells handmade jewelry, including beaded bracelets and earrings, from her home on the base.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/Guardian“You just see on Facebook the young wives that are out here, who are newly 18 and whose spouses are gone for months at a time, and you’re in this remote location by yourself,” she said. “I’ve been through my fair share of deployments with my spouse, and I know what it’s like to be alone at those special times.”Another Twentynine Palms spouse-turned-business-owner, Emma Salazar, showed off the jewelry she planned to sell at the expo that day: tiny rings made of twisted metal, earrings studded with small shells and quartz, and stacks of colorful, beaded bracelets.Salazar started her business, Lil Sumthin’ Jewelry,a few years ago as a “side hustle”, after learning from her grandmother how to forage for natural materials and then transform them into handmade jewelry. But when she moved to the desert with her husband in 2023, it was tough to find a regular job to supplement that passion project. It was also Salazar’s first time living on a military base – and she had just given birth to her first child.“I ended up just doing my business full-time, since I can’t work anywhere else,” she said.Salazar now crafts jewelry from her home on the Twentynine Palms base, in whatever room “baby wants to be” at that moment. The ultimate goal for her business, she said, would be tosell her pieces in local boutiques.“People automatically just view you as a dependent,” she said of her role within the military. “But it is nice having your own outlet, and your own identity, because you can get so lost in just being a wife, and a military wife.”View image in fullscreenA guarded entrance to the Twentynine Palms military base.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/GuardianGroups like the Military Spouse Chamber of Commerce are working to bolster that community of entrepreneurs, said Brown, the co-founder, who is a military spouse herself. The non-profit awards free certification to spouse-owned businesses, offers guidance and resources, and helps to connect them with nationally recognized companies in the private and public sectors.“All we’re trying to do is legitimize them,” Brown said, “and give them a seat at the table.”Still, both the isolation and the highly controlled nature of any military base can affect almost every part of daily life.After our meet-up in the desert, the Twentynine Palms spouses eventually left to set up for the expo, driving back inside the base.As I stood outside the barbed wire, taking a few photos of a welcome sign for the combat center, a guard approached. I would need to delete those photos in front of him, he said, as he quickly called for backup. After a small squadron of security officers and other guards assembled at the gate to investigate, they finally admitted that, no,I was not required to delete the photosand was not being detained.I drove back into the desert, the base in my rearview mirror. Somewhere behind me, the spouses prepared their booths, artfully arranging their merchandise and readying for customers.Twentynine Palms, as Chapman had described it, can often feel like “a step back in time”; spouses have to figure out how to make their own luck. This month, Chapman even started working a second job: a new role in human resources, which had just opened up on the base.“You really have to learn,” she said, “how to stand on two feet, on your own.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryWomenSmall businessCaliforniaWest CoastGenderEntrepreneursfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it employs 637,000 people and 91% of Americans view it favorably, according to aPew Research surveytaken when USPS was perhaps the most visible federal agency during the Covid pandemic and came close to running out of cash entirely.A red bar chart with bars plunging farther down and to the right as time goes onIn 2020, Trump acknowledged that he was starving the service of money in order to make it harder to process mail-in ballots, which he worried could cost him the election. In December 2024, Trump was reported to have expressed a “keen interest” in privatizing the service.But until the administration lays out its plan for the institution, resistance to any proposals remains speculative.“In a moment when public servants are under severe attack, postal workers and the people we serve in every state and every congressional district, are prepared to defend our critical public service,” said the American postal workers union president, Mark Dimondstein,in a statement last week.DeJoy announced he was stepping down after five years as postmaster general in a letter to the board of governors, saying “there remains much critical work to be done to ensure that the postal service can be financially viable as we continue to serve the nation in our essential public service mission”. He praised postal workers for their perseverance and embrace of change “despite being victimized by a legislative and regulatory business model”.The service is midway through a 10-yearDelivering for Americareform plan and has yet to break-even after years of losses, including a $6.9bn in 2025, down from $9.5bn a year earlier.DeJoy said a $144m profit, excluding expenses on pension and health care payments, in the first quarter of the year was a “strong indicator” that the service is on a path to self-supporting but warned there is an “almost unceasing resistance to change from stakeholders motivated by both parochial and political purposes”.The US Postal Service was founded on 26 July 1775 by the Second Continental Congress, with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general. Later that century, postal services were made a permanent part of the federal government as the Post Office Department, and in 1971 was reorganized to become an independent agency of the executive branch, but it must operate like a business.The pandemic, along with competition from FedEx and UPS, as well as a decline in the overall letter business, has made the USPS a political football and put it in its current precarious financial predicament.A study by the Economic Policy Institutein 2020 said that “anti-government ideologues and special interests have long sought to privatize, shrink, or hobble” the service.The report credited the postal service as an integral public service, part of the nation’s critical infrastructure and a good employer – especially for Black workers and military veterans.“The social value of the postal service extends beyond the economic benefits provided by its delivery operations,” the report said, by connecting family and friends and fostering democracy, and is a key part of emergency and national security infrastructure.The report recommended that the service be allowed to adapt to meet unmet needs, including the revival of postal banking.In a letter last month, the postal service’s regulator warned the next phase of the 10-year cost-cutting and modernization plan would slow mail delivery for a “significant portion of the nation” but wouldn’t do much to help regain its financial footing. The communities most likely to affected would be in rural areas where, demographics show, Trump voters are often in the majority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re watching what’s happening, waiting for Elon Musk to come in and tear things up, and he didn’t want to be a part of that.”The Washington Post reported that the board of governors had held an emergency meeting and retained outside counsel if the White House moves ahead with the measures. Democrats also called on Trump to abandon his plans.“Your reported efforts to dismantle the Postal Service as an independent agency would directly undermine the affordability and reliability of the US postal system,” said the House oversight committee member Gerry Connolly of Virginia last week.“We urge you to abandon immediately any plans that would either privatize the Postal Service or undermine the independence of the Postal Service.”There’s a fundamental difference in how Republicans and Democrats look at the issue.“I see the post office as part of the national infrastructure, like the highway system, and a network that has the ability to go to everyone’s house,” says Jamison.What Musk and Doge are in fact doing, he ventures, is treating the federal government as a private equity firm would a company after a hostile takeover. “You fire everybody, then figure out what works afterwards – and Wall Street loves it.”Explore more on these topicsUS Postal ServiceDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

After this Monday’s parade,c’est fini,” said Neguinho, with his constant smile and impeccably groomed afro – not a single grey strand in sight – just before heading into the studio for his final rehearsal.He announced his retirement in November, a decision that surprised Rio’s samba world, which follows the carnival parade with the same passion that other Brazilians have for football.The reason for his retirement? Exhaustion. “Being a samba-school singer requires the stamina of a marathon runner,” he said.View image in fullscreenMembers of the samba school Beija-Flor de Nilópolis during a rehearsal in Nilópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 13 February 2025.Photograph: Ian Cheibub/GuardianDuring the 70–80 minutes of a school’s parade, it is the singer’s job to maintain the energy of the massive audience – which can be almost twice the size of the crowd at Maracanã soccer stadium – repeatedly chanting the year’ssamba-enredotheme song in an endless loop. “It’s a massive effort that has only become harder with age,” Neguinho said.Born Luiz Antônio Feliciano in Nova Iguaçu, a poverty-stricken city in the greater Rio area, he started singing for a local sambablocoat age 22 when he was a member of the air force.As a diminutive ofnegro(black), “Neguinho” is often used in Brazil in a derogatory manner to refer to a Black boy or man generically. But among Afro-Brazilians, it can also carry an affectionate meaning, which is what he had in mind when he adopted the nickname.“I’ve suffered a lot of racism in my life and career, and I’ve fought a lot, but I also think we need to live. If I had spent my entire life fighting, I wouldn’t have had time to dedicate myself to my music and family,” said Neguinho.View image in fullscreenMembers of Beija-Flor de Nilópolis in Nilópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 13 February 2025.Photograph: Ian Cheibub/GuardianHis big break came in 1976 when he had to step in to replace a lead singer who died suddenly before carnival. The school won the championship – its first – and he became Neguinho from Beija-Flor.Since then, the school has won 14 titles, all under Neguinho’s raspy voice and his trademark battle cry: “Olha a Beija-Flor aí, gente!” (“Here comes Beija-Flor, folks!”)Along with the artistry of the singers, musicians, dancers and designers, a key factor in the school’s success was the financial support of a local gambling boss.Jogo dobicho– or animal lottery – is an illegal gambling game ubiquitous across Brazil, and long been tied to various criminal activities, including police corruption and murders.In the 1970s, gambling bosses saw samba schools as a means to clean their images and increase control over territories. At least half of the elite samba schools are still linked tobicheiros, as the bosses are known, but Neguinho does not see this as a problem: “If it weren’t for thejogo dobicho, maybe today Rio’s carnival wouldn’t be the spectacle it is.”Throughout his half-century career, Neguinho has only ever sung for one school, a consistency nearly unthinkable in today’s increasingly professionalised carnival, where artists switch groups as quickly as football players change clubs.“Neguinho is the biggest star of Rio’s carnival today, and his farewell marks the end of a romantic era,” said Leonardo Bruno, theauthor of several books on samba and carnival. “Beija-Flor has had the face and, more importantly, the voice of Neguinho for the last 50 years, and that’s why there was such an outpouring of emotion when he announced his retirement.”Samba-school carnival parade depicts troubled Brazil as ‘monster’Read moreNeguinho says that he has never received a salary from the school, explaining that his livelihood comes from his work as a “mid-year”sambista, as artists with work outside carnival are called.He has also writtena string ofnon-carnivalhit sambasand plans to continue his career through a new album and upcoming shows.Despite his calm attitude toward his retirement decision, the singerchoked up with tears as he spoke about itthree weeks ago during the final rehearsal at Sapucaí.For this Monday, however, he has a plan.“I’ve been talking to my therapist, and she suggested that I bring a banner that says: ‘Thank you very much.’ She told me to just open the banner and say nothing. Otherwise, I won’t be able to sing,” he said.“So that’s what I’ll do. I’ll show the banner and sing. After the parade, a car will be waiting for me – and I’ll leave.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilRio de JaneiroAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think they think these people will be future Democratic voters.“But we don’t even have to get there, Tucker,” added Homan, saying that Biden’s census rules allowed “all these illegal aliens to be counted in sanctuary cities, which is going to result in more seats in the house for the Dems”.While the idea that anelite was conspiringto orchestrate mass immigration for political gain at the ballot box was mostly confined to the white supremacist racist far right for decades, in recent years “great replacement”-style conspiracy theories such as this haveincreasingly been voicedby mainstream conservatives and Republicans.Later in their conversation, Homan and Carlson sought to extend the purported conspiracy theory well beyond the Biden administration. Carlson suggested a wide-ranging plot involving international bodies such as the UN and NGOs and Homan responded by calling for an investigation.Homan said: “I think under the Trump administration there needs to be an investigation.”He revealed that “I’ve had numerous conversations with Mark Green, who is the head of homeland oversight.” Green is a Tennessee Republican whochairsthe House’s homeland security committee and is an ex-officio member of the oversight, investigations and accountability committee, which has oversight over the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.The United Nations were south of our border, working on this global illegal immigration to the United StatesTom HomanHoman said Green “plans on having some oversight hearings on this when it comes to the NGOs. I think they were complicit.”He then asserted without evidence that “certainly the United Nations were south of our border, working on this global illegal immigration to the United States”.Homan rounded out the conspiracy theory, saying: “This was by design. Do I think Joe Biden had the expertise to do it? No, I think someone’s pulling his strings.“This is something that needs to be investigated, people need to be held accountable,” he added.Cartels ‘have operational control of the south-west border’The two returned obsessively throughout their conversation to the issue of drug cartels, which they claimed had deprived the US of sovereignty over parts of perhaps five US states and the entire south-west border.Early in the conversation, Homan stated his basic position on the cartels: they should be “designated terrorist organizations and wiped off the face of the earth”.Later, Carlson asked Homan about what he said “informed people” had told him: “In parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California, even Florida, Texas, there is real control, in the way they control Mexico.”In those locations, purportedly, “they’re basically a state within a state, they have their own armored personnel carriers, tanks, you know”. He then asked Homan: “Do you think that’s real, do you think they have that kind of beachhead here?”“Absolutely,” Homan answered, continuing that “I’ve seen the intelligence reports, they have military-grade weapons. It’s not just my opinion, they have control, operational control of the south-west border.”‘They worship death’Later in the conversation, Homan and Carlson attributed the cartels’ motivations in part to their worship of “satanic” ideas or “death”, seeking to tie that to their “cultures” which “practice human sacrifice”.Carlson began by claiming to “know that in El Salvador when MS-13 ran the country, before Bukele, there was a religious component of voodoo witchcraft to MS-13 where they were worshipping the devil openly.”Nayib Bukele is the authoritarian, populist president of El Salvador, whose promotion of cryptocurrency and brutal crackdown on gangs in the country havewon him fanson the “new right” in the US and beyond.Earlier this month,Marco Rubio met with Bukelein El Salvador, and the latter offered to hold deportees and US citizens alike in its vast network of prisons. That network includes thelargest prison in the Americas, built to accommodate 40,000 people, which is around half the number Bukele has locked up since his war on the gangs commenced.Later in the podcast conversation, Carlson claimed that devil worship was a “component of the cartels, you see it in Mexico as well”, and asked Homan: “Have you come across that?”“Yeah,” Homan answered. “They worship death.”“Formally worship it?” Carlson shot back.“Yeah,” Homan answered. “I won’t call it religious, but even Texas [department of public safety] have found some of these places where the cartels are operating, they got statues there and memorabilia worshipping death as a consequence of not letting them do their business.”Homan may have been referring to Santa Muerte, a Mexican “folk saint” whose currency among cartel members has been an intermittent focus of US conservative media coverage of crime at the border, and enforcement actions in Mexico, where “the Mexican army, under orders from the Mexican state, has obliterated thousands of shrines dedicated to the folk saint across the country”.Researchers havefound, however, that Santa Muerte devotion is not confined to criminals, and is also found “increasingly [among] police and others involved in law enforcement”.I got a video on my phone showing a member of the cartel skinning a man aliveTom HomanCarlson appeared to assert that there was a connection between cartels and the historical practice of human sacrifice in some pre-colonial Meso-American cultures, saying: “And these are from cultures that have practiced human sacrifice for thousands of years.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, Homan warned that the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may “be in trouble” over a webinar about Ice that was hosted by her office.The congresswoman on Wednesday aired a “Know Your Rights With ICE” webinar on her Facebook page which advised attendees of “trends” of arrests by Ice in New York and explained what rights they have. Ocasio-Cortez did not attend it.But Homan told Fox News: “So maybe AOC’s gonna be in trouble now, but I need the [office of the attorney general] to opine on that … Impediment is impediment, in my opinion.”On Friday, Homan and the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, appeared in a joint interview on Fox News, where Adams endorsed a Trump executive order which would allow Ice agents to operate at the city’s Rikers Island jail.In the Fox and Friends studio, Homan said of Adams and his promises of cooperation: “If he doesn’t come through … I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, Where the hell is the agreement we came to?”Adams is at the center of a political firestorm after top justice department attorneys inNew York and Washington DCresigned in the face of orders to drop their prosecution of the New York mayor over corruption allegations.Financial entanglementsLike every senior administration appointee to date, Homan is an unstinting supporter of Trump, and a full-throated 2020 election denialist. This, and his espousal of anti-immigrant rhetoric, have led to controversy but also to associations with far-right extremists, and sprawling business relationships that some say present conflicts of interest.Between his departure from the first Trump administration and his appointment as border czar, a White House role, Homan had stints as aFox News contributor, was a visiting fellow at theHeritage Foundation, and was credited as a contributor in “Mandate for Leadership”, the central document of Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for the second Trump administration.Apart from these blue ribbon conservative appointments, Homan has involved himself in several interrelated non-profit organizations.The Border911 Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, was founded in 2023 in Virginia, Homan’s state of residence. At the same time, he also founded Border911 Inc, a 501(c)(4) organization. (501(c)(4)s differ from 501(c)(3)s in that donations to them are not tax-deductible, but they are permitted to engage in electoral advocacy.)Both the Border911 Foundation and Border911 Inc were spin-offs from the America Project (TAP), a Michael Flynn-founded election-denial non-profit that was reportedly funded to the tune of $27m by rightwingoverstock.comCEO Patrick Byrne.Homan was reportedly TAP CEO for part of 2023. His appointment to that role occasioned a fundraising gala at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort that year.From early 2024, Homan was out at TAP and focused on the Border911 Foundation and Border Inc, as well as a Trump-endorsed for-profit consultancy Homeland Strategic Consulting LLC, which, Homan boasted, secured “tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts” for his clients.Homan appears to be using division, fear and chaos in a way to pad his friends’ pocketsTony Clark of Accountable.USThroughout the campaign season, the Border911 Foundation was a virtual speaker’s agency for a stable of rightwing anti-immigration activists, many of them former law enforcement officials who appeared at rallies organized by the non-profit or by political candidates, such as Arizona’s Kari Lake, throughout south-western border states.Previous reporting hashighlightedseeming irregularities in tax filings by the non-profits. Coda reported that in 2023, “both of Homan’s Border911 organizations reported almost the same expenses – about $87,000 – but the 501(c)(4) claimed zero revenue”. Non-profit compliance experts expressed concerns to the outlet that “the tax-exempt charity money may have been passed through” the 501(c)(4).Steve Lentz, an attorney acting as a spokesperson for both Border911 organizations, told Coda that this was due to errors in the filings, “There was an entry in the [501](c)(4) [filing] that shouldn’t have been there,” he said, and said it would be amended.The Guardian’s review of the filings indicates that amendments were subsequently made.The Transparency non-profit Accountable.US, however, has raised concerns about what it says is a potential for conflicts of interest arising from the 501(c)(3) non-profit and its board in newly published research.Partly the worries arise from ambiguities in Homan’s public statements about his relationship with the foundation while he is in office.Accountable.US says that while Homan has said that he will take a “leave of absence” from Border911, he has also appeared to claim that the non-profit will continue to act as “data-mining site” that will provide “real up-to-date data on anything related to the border”, including “apprehensions”, “ICE arrests” and other information.And some of the foundation’s board members work for federal government contractors.Charles Sowell is chair of the Border911 Foundation’s board. He is also the founder and CEO of SE&M Solutions, a security and IT consulting firm that touts its “access to senior leaders in government” and “hopes to secure local and federal contracts using the best experts in the government consulting industry”.The Border911 Foundation’s director, Mark Hall, meanwhile, is currently the US security lead and chief security officer for Dragados USA, a construction contracting firm, where he claims to lead security for “a $6bn international border crossing construction project” whose cost indicates that it is likely the Gordie Howe international bridge between the US and Canada, which is budgeted for that figure.While there is no evidence of wrongdoing from these board members, a mass deportation effort on the scale promised by Trump, Homan and other administration immigration hawks such as Stephen Miller could be a bonanza for US government contractors.Accountable.US fears the worst. Its executive director, Tony Clark, said in a statement: “Homan appears to be using division, fear and chaos in a way to pad his friends’ pockets. Why should anyone believe Homan won’t steer lucrative government contracts to members of his ‘non-profit’ board?”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationFar right (US)Donald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While some have agreed to be transported onward to their home countries, others have refused, including 128 of the 299 immigrants that arrived in Panama.These immigrants have fallen into a legal limbo with an uncertain future, epitomized by a viral photo of a young Iranian migrant who scrawled “help” on the window of a Panama City hotel where she and family members were temporarily held before being transported to a remote shelter in the Darién Gap – far from the cameras.Police search for woman who escaped Panama hotel where US deportees are being heldRead moreVersions of these bridge agreements, which often include increased border security, have also been agreed upon with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – with the third country facilitating thetransfer of 177 Venezuelan migrantswho had been held at Guantánamo military base and were immediately boarded on a plane back home upon arriving at a joint Honduras-US air force base outside Tegucigalpa.The United States has agreed to cover the cost of sheltering the immigrants abroad, but it is unclear for how long – and if this is only the beginning of a much larger movement yet to come.“We don’t know what the plans are, whether it’s to see what happens with this, whether it’s to be able to receive others, whether this is an example to replicate in other countries,” said Martino.The presidents of Panama and Costa Rica have portrayed the arrival of the deportees as only temporary. But if the numbers grow and the stays become prolonged, they and other leaders who implement the bridge agreements could be forced to make a difficult calculation between staying in the good graces of Trump while avoiding domestic backlash.“It’s difficult to understand to what extent governments are willing to accept these types of conditions and how this will impact domestic narratives,” said Martino.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationPanamaUS politicsAmericasMexicoanalysisShareReuse this content"

But a lifetime ago, as a zoology undergraduate at Glasgow University, I spent hours underwater, swimming through kelp forests, corals and shipwrecks, looking out for the tiny, colourful creatures.Diving on the west coast ofScotlandis spectacular for all the reasons you might expect: the drama of the islands, bays and meandering sea lochs against the mountains, the rugged rocky shores, the awe-inspiring wildness.I still remember the excitement of diving trips, in a van full of air tanks and weight belts. From the bustle of Great Western Road, past Dumbarton, up the A82 as it hugs the side of Loch Lomond and on, to Gareloch or Loch Long or further afield, left at Arrochar , through the Rest and Be Thankful, to Loch Fyne. Underwater, the lochs are full of beauty, with bright corals, dead-man’s fingers, sea pens and queen scallops dancing along the sea floor, spiny lobsters and spider crabs.In atrocious weather, however, a common occurrence, a choppy loch presents a visibility challenge. Dark skies flatten the colours of the corals and kelp to various shades of brown.So when, tutored in what to look for by a fellow diver and marine biologist, I spotted my first nudibranch, or sea slug, I was delighted – charmed, even. It was tiny, barely 2cm long, but presented a gorgeous splash of white and orange against a brown seascape, a frondy-gilled thing with almost fluorescent spots, grazing on seaweed. So far removed from its slimy, creepy, land-based cousin and so pretty, like a sea jewel.The biologist was writing a PhD on nudibranchs and, for a summer, we divers were his willing pupils, happily embracing his project, which felt like searching for brightly coloured, underwater butterflies or flowers. They are shell-less molluscs, their name means “naked gills”, referring to the breathing apparatus outside their bodies.Mostly carnivores, they feed on seaweed, sponges, jellyfish, anemones and other nudibranchs. Most are minuscule, between 1cm and 6cm long, but many are vibrantly hued, from bright purple and blues to orange, and really stand out. My favourites were almost translucent, with elongated cerata, tentacle-like growths tipped with bright orange. When a nudibranch eats the tentacles of a jellyfish or other stinging animal, the venom-filled stinging cells pass through the cerata, or growths, which it then uses against predators.That summer, we would fling ourselves backwards off small inflatables into the deep water below to reach inaccessible reefs, or kit up in wetsuits in rain-lashed shores on dives in search of them. We found nine species in all and were rewarded by being named in a study published by the zoology department: A Divers’ Guide to the Marine Fauna of the Clyde Region.I don’t know how their populations are faring amid the climate and biodiversity crisis, but for me, they conjure up the joy of the subsea world.Invertebrate of the year 2025The Guardian is asking readers to nominate species for the second annual invertebrate of the year competition.Read more about it and make your suggestions hereor via the form below.Share your experienceSend us your nominated speciesYou can tell us which species you would like to nominate by filling in the form below.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

On the contrary, when we came back, we felt we belonged to this house.”Located in the old Iraqi city of Mosul, right behind the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, their home is part of the local cultural heritage. It washeavily damagedduring the occupation by Islamic State (IS) and the battle to reclaim the city by Iraqi armed forces, backed by US coalition airstrikes. Sara and her family were forcibly displaced during the fighting in 2017 and for many years feared they would never see their home intact again.“It was amazing when we could step in,” Sara says. “The neighbourhood has changed a lot, but it’s still very beautiful and we’re optimistic that more and more neighbours will resettle in their home town.”Most of these old houses have been restored, thanks to a Unesco-led project called Revive the Spirit of Mosul, which includes the renovation of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri and other sites. “Most of our family members are employed here in the reconstruction of the city,” Sara says. “Life is still precarious, but we hope that 10 years after Daesh [IS] occupied our beloved city, it will only improve.”View image in fullscreenArchitect Layla Saleh, head of the reconstruction team of Al-Tahera Church.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverThe mosque’s leaning minaret, named Al-Habda or the hunchback, has been restored under Unesco’s supervision and reopened last month. Built in 1172, it is 45m tall and decorated with ornamental brickwork along its cylindrical shaft and square base. The self-proclaimed caliph of the IS,Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, inaugurated the “caliphate” from the pulpit inside the mosque in 2014.The renovation of the Great Mosque will be completed during Ramadan, which began on Friday, and 11 years after IS madeMosulits capital. The prayer hall will already be open for Ramadan prayers – for the first time since IS’s defeat. “The citizens of Mosul are very happy. The last finishing touches need to be completed, but we can open the mosque for Ramadan prayers,” says engineer Omar Taqa, responsible of the restoration project under Unesco.“We are proud to have worked on this project, which is the largest Unesco project in the world, with $50m implemented. For the official opening and inauguration of the Great Mosque, arrangements are being made to hold a ceremony with the Iraqi prime minister.” Last June, during their work, five large IS bombs were found hidden in the site, which postponedefforts for some days.View image in fullscreenThe Baytuna (‘Our House’) association in the Old City of Mosul.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverHuda, who lives next to the mosque, is originally from Baghdad and moved to Mosul with her husband after being displaced in a Christian neighbourhood in Erbil. “I’m a Christian, the only one living in the old houses for now,” she says. “Before the Daesh occupation, many more Christians were inhabiting the old city. I have two children and my husband is working on the al-Nuri mosque renovation. I feel at home here.”Father Raed, a local priest, told theObserverthat, even though the large majority of Christians haven’t resettled in Mosul, they come to the city daily from Erbil or nearby Christian-majority cities such as Qaraqosh for employment or to attend the church.Yamama Saleh, a civil engineer employed by the UN agency, has also been involved in the reconstruction of the mosque. “It’s the landmark of Mosul. I used to see the minaret from my rooftop, so when it got destroyed, it was really sad. But after being involved in the rebuilding of the shaft, it has another meaning for me. Now we’re done, I will go back to the rooftop to take a picture from there.”Her colleague, Mustafa al-Zeewany, supervisor of the minaret works, is standing on top of the minaret. “The minaret is iconic,” he says. “All our workers here are feeling proud. We felt devastated when the minaret was blown up by IS in June 2017, and now we have the abilities and capabilities to redo it, using international and new techniques.”View image in fullscreenThe restoration of the Mosque of Prophet Younis.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverAl-Zeewany explains that new techniques were implemented because they allowed work to be done in a similar way to the time of the construction of the mosque and minaret in the 12th century. “It’s a great experience for all of us to know how our ancestors worked, especially in this kind of construction.”The colourful neighbourhood in front of the old houses and the Great Mosque is called al-Manqusha. It’s where young people gather because of the cultural associations and cafes in the area.Saker Ma’an, founder of Baytuna (“Our house”) association, based in an old, imposing two-storey house, says: “In 2017, after the battle against Daesh, being here felt like living in the desert. We cleaned the neighbourhood of the rubble with our bare hands, we found corpses and unexploded bombs, then we finally managed to restore this traditional house and make it a cafe and office for our activities.”Ma’an recalls that some locals told him “you will not last”. In the beginning, the cafe hosted no more than two people a week. “We now have dozens coming every day,” he says. “Especially the new generation: they came back to a destroyed city, not having any sense of belonging to the old city. But our association is working together with youth, to make them aware of their cultural heritage. Mosul really needed this place.”View image in fullscreenRestoration work at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverMa’an remarks that the new generation doesn’t know the archaeological sites of the Nineveh province of Mosul, such as the old Assyrian city of Nimrod, 30km south of Mosul, badly damaged by the terrorist group, like many others.Layla Salih, an archaeologist responsible for the Bashiqa district and head of the reconstruction team of Al-Tahera church (Upper Monastery) project, is an expert on the archaeological sites of Nineveh, the Mosul province. “Many projects initiated after the liberation of the city were distributed between reconstruction, rescue or excavation work, and there are projects of documentation, archaeological and heritage survey, as well as the restoration of archaeological objects,” she says.Salih has become very well-known in the city after her discovery back in 2017 of a new archaeological site, the Assyrian Essarhadon’s Palace, in a tunnel under the al-Nabi Yunes shrine, dug by IS militants who were searching for antiquities to plunder and sell. “I expect that the renovation of Mosul will continue for years … and it is remarkable that the international community is so interested in the city for its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.”When IS was first driven out of Nineveh province in November 2016, Salih and a colleague, Faisal Jaber, reported on the destruction of Christian sites in the province. “We hope for more cultural projects that contribute to building peace, promoting stability and coexistence.”Explore more on these topicsIraqThe ObserverMosulIslamic StateHeritageMiddle East and north AfricaIslamUnesconewsShareReuse this content"

She stood on Thames Street in Windsor, outside the castle, to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday and Harry and Megan’s wedding. Will she come out for President Trump?“I can’t stand the man,” she said. “It’s difficult to even believe it’s happening – that somebody like that can be president of the United States. He’s dangerous.”“Having said that, we can’t afford to fall out with America, so there’s that balance between what we believe and what’s the most expedient thing to do to protect the interests of the country. Will I come out to watch him? No.”Keir Starmer’s offer of aroyal invitation for a second state visitis as unprecedented as Trump’s10-minute tiradeat Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House. But even before the Oval Office meltdown, Britons were both sceptical and resigned about the presidential visit.There were calls from the SNP and the Scottish Greens to cancel the trip. In the letter that Starmer gave to Trump, King Charles invited the president to Balmoral or Dumfries House as an aperitif to a grander occasion, probably involving Windsor. On Saturday afternoon it was revealed that Zelenskyy would see the king first, however – later on Sunday while he is in London for Starmer’s European defence summit.Trump’s first state visit in June 2019, hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, ended two days before Theresa May stepped down as prime minister. How did Starmer’s White House performance go down with people in Windsor on Friday?View image in fullscreenTony and Pat Simpson in Windsor. Pat says: ‘[Keir Starmer] didn’t have any choice.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The ObserverSimon Pitt, a Starmer fan, said it “all seemed to go very well – he didn’t fall into any traps or look stupid, and you never know how it’s going to go in the lion’s den.”Below the castle, Pat Simpson thought the prime minister “didn’t have any choice”. “He’s got a lot on his plate and he’s got to do things you don’t agree with,” she said.Tony, her husband, a lifelong Labour supporter, said: “He’s got to; whether you like him [Trump] or not, America plays a large part in Britain’s economicand political life.”But Chin, not a natural Labour supporter, said she felt Starmer “came across as incredibly wet, sucking up to Trump”.Foreign policy is often a respite for prime ministers struggling domestically, and even solid supporters such as Pitt have been disappointed with the Labour government so far.Spooked by Reform UK’s 26% opinion poll figures, Labour figures have spoken of becoming a more insurgent government, and last monthStarmer told his cabinet“We can either be the disrupters or the disrupted”.There are whiffs of how this approach might potentially appeal, with some in Windsor holding their noses to admit they felt that Trump had “got an awful lot done in three weeks”.But a Trumpist approach would not work, according toresearch by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab. It found that, although about half the public had expected to see things get better within a year of Labour taking office, only 27% believe Starmer should be more like Trump. There is no appetite for “disruptive populism”, the researchers said.“Too often, commentators assume the future belongs to the populist right,” said Marc Stears, UCL Policy Lab director. “Our research demonstrates that is far from obvious. There is an electorally significant constituency in Britain that wants change, not chaos; radicalism, not recklessness. The centre ground remains the crucial space in British politics, and despite all the noise and energy created by Trumpism, it is vital that we all remember that.”Many of those 27% voted Reform UK last year, and they are at odds with the rest of public on many issues, including Ukraine. Nigel Farage said during the election campaign that Putin was given a reason to invade by Nato’s “ever-eastward expansion”.It’s a vein of opinion popular among those of his supporterswho want Russia to defeat Ukraineand agree with JD Vance’s suggestion in 2023 that US money was paying for Ukrainian yachts, and that he “didn’t care” what happened to Ukraine.Most of the British public believe instead that Zelensky and Ukraine are fighting against invasion andwar crimes, and Starmer accused Farage of “fawning over Putin” last week.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s first state visit to the UK on 13 July 2018.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesFor some Americans in the UK, however, the Trump White House is uncomfortable viewing. Ella Barron, an American who was moving to Windsor from Brighton last week, said she hoped people would remember that “America is a big country with a lot of different political views”.“I don’t thinkKeir Starmershould try to cosy up to Trump because, from what we’ve seen in the past, it wouldn’t be a politically beneficial thing to do,” she said.Trump’s actions towards Canada show the UK should look for closer ties with the Commonwealth and Europe, she said. Will she watch if Trump comes to Windsor?“I might, just because it will be very impressive,” she said.“But I would like Trump not to destroy the US presidency as an institution. I’d like the institution of the presidency to still be respected outside of the US – not that I think he, as a person, deserves the pomp and circumstance.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe ObserverKeir StarmerKing Charles IIIVolodymyr ZelenskyyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two blocks had been set aside for people with gunshot and shrapnel injuries.Mugisho Shalukoma, 20, was recovering from a leg amputation, the result of gunshot wounds. “I felt my foot getting harder and harder,” he said. “I didn’t see the person who shot me. Those around me brought me here.”Ghislaine Ntakwinja, 41, said she was in her house when unidentified gunmen shot her in her right hand. “Guns were ringing out in the city,” she said, sitting on her bed. “I heard armed men open my house’s door. They had guns. That’s when they shot me.” Her children rushed her to hospital.As M23 closed in on Bukavu, reports emerged of people collecting weapons and military equipment left by retreating Congolese forces.Deogracias Chibambo, a human rights activist with the Ça Suffit (That’s Enough) civic engagement group, said weapons had been circulating freely, including among children, causing enormous damage. “There was general panic. Bullets were being fired in many places,” he said.Last week, the UN human rights office accused M23 rebels ofkilling three children in Bukavuwho were carrying weapons and wearing uniforms from an abandoned Congolese military camp, after they refused to surrender the weapons. M23 denied the accusation, terming it propaganda by the Congolese government.Esperance Mwamini Birindwa, a nurse with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which operates at the general hospital, said 162 people had been admitted with injuries related to the M23 takeover between 14 and 24 February. Of those with gunshot and shrapnel injuries, three had died.mapM23 has made rapid advances this year, drawing in neighbouring armies and raising fears of a regional war.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is facing supply challenges caused by the conflict, hindering its ability to treat wounded people. The organisation’s warehouse in Goma, the capital of North Kivu, was one of many looted and vandalised during fighting in the city last month, with medicine and other items stolen. The fighting has caused logistical challenges, too, disrupting some transport routes.“Despite all our efforts, evacuations sometimes take longer than expected because of access difficulties,” said ICRC project manager Emmanuel Konin. “Some patients whose lives we could have tried to save are already dead from their injuries.”Other hospitals in Bukavu have also been overwhelmed by injured people. One had received 42 patients with gunshot and shrapnel wounds within a few days of the fall of Bukavu, said Marcus Bachmann, head of programmes for South Kivu at Médecins Sans Frontières, which is supporting some hospitals in the city to treat the high number of injured people.“We are closely assessing the situation and exploring ways to scale up our emergency efforts to respond to the humanitarian needs of people in areas around Minova, Bukavu, and Uvira,” hesaid, referring to areas in South Kivu. “We urge all the parties to the conflict to ensure the protection of civilians, humanitarian workers, and medical infrastructure and personnel in all areas affected by the conflict.”M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups to operate in the mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal, meant to end the wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed byRwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say, in fact, Rwanda is using the group to extract and export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobile phones.The situation in Bukavu remains extremely volatile. On Thursday, at least 13 people were killed and dozens others injured inexplosions at a mass rallyheld by M23 in the city centre. The rebels accused the Congolese authorities of being behind the attack, while Congo’s army said Rwandan troops had fired rockets and grenades into the crowd.International sanctions, renewed investigations by the international criminal court and Africa-led peace negotiations have failed to halt the advance of the rebels, who captured Goma last month before rapidly advancing south to Bukavu.Since January, 7,000 people have been killed and almost half a million are without shelter after 90 displacement camps were destroyed in the fighting in eastern Congo, the government said.The UN refugee agency said on Friday that 60,000 people have fled into neighbouring Burundi in the past fortnight.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

Exactly what they are, we’re going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate.”Lutnick’s comments were the first indication from Trump’s administration that it may not impose the full threatened 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and non-energy imports fromCanada.He said the two countries have “done a reasonable job” securing their borders with the United States, though he maintained the deadly drug fentanyl continues to flow into the country.Trump sowed confusion last week when he mentioned a possible 2 April deadline in connection with tariffs on Canada and Mexico. But he later reaffirmed the Tuesday deadline and said he would addanother 10% tariffon Chinese goods that day, effectively doubling 10% duties imposed on 4 February.Lutnick said Trump was expected to raise tariffs on China on Tuesday unless the country ends fentanyl trafficking into the US.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

While some have agreed to be transported onward to their home countries, others have refused, including 128 of the 299 immigrants that arrived in Panama.These immigrants have fallen into a legal limbo with an uncertain future, epitomized by a viral photo of a young Iranian migrant who scrawled “help” on the window of a Panama City hotel where she and family members were temporarily held before being transported to a remote shelter in the Darién Gap – far from the cameras.Police search for woman who escaped Panama hotel where US deportees are being heldRead moreVersions of these bridge agreements, which often include increased border security, have also been agreed upon with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – with the third country facilitating thetransfer of 177 Venezuelan migrantswho had been held at Guantánamo military base and were immediately boarded on a plane back home upon arriving at a joint Honduras-US air force base outside Tegucigalpa.The United States has agreed to cover the cost of sheltering the immigrants abroad, but it is unclear for how long – and if this is only the beginning of a much larger movement yet to come.“We don’t know what the plans are, whether it’s to see what happens with this, whether it’s to be able to receive others, whether this is an example to replicate in other countries,” said Martino.The presidents of Panama and Costa Rica have portrayed the arrival of the deportees as only temporary. But if the numbers grow and the stays become prolonged, they and other leaders who implement the bridge agreements could be forced to make a difficult calculation between staying in the good graces of Trump while avoiding domestic backlash.“It’s difficult to understand to what extent governments are willing to accept these types of conditions and how this will impact domestic narratives,” said Martino.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationPanamaUS politicsAmericasMexicoanalysisShareReuse this content"

The people ofTaiwan“know that America is going down”, which “might affect their mentality” with regards to China.In 2024, Trump said Taiwanshould pay the USfor help to defend itself, despite the fact that the self-governing island already spends billions of dollars on arms from the US. Taiwan isreportedly consideringpurchasing a further $7-10bn worth of weapons this year, as the Taiwanese government explores a range of options for currying favour with the Trump administration.“How confident would the Taiwanese be with the United States, especially with the Trump administration?” Zhou said. “Maybe the Taiwanese will one day consider, ‘Well, we cannot move away anyway. We will have to stay here. Maybe it’s not bad for us to be a member of the strongest nation on earth.”Tariffs, tech and Taiwan: how China hopes to Trump-proof its economyRead moreZhou retired as a senior colonel in 2020, having served more than 40 years in the PLA and in the ministry of defence. Now a senior fellow at the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, he is afrequent commentatoron China’s foreign affairs. “Should the World Fear China?”, published on 27 March, is a collection of Zhou’s essays written between 2013 and 2024, addressing themes such as managingUS-China relationsandChina’s viewon safeguarding its own interests.One of the most pressing issues in the US-China relationship is the question of Taiwan. Beijing regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and has vowed to unify it with China, refusing to rule out the use of force. In 2024, Taiwan elected the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party into power for the third consecutive term. Nearly 70% of people in Taiwan identify as being Taiwanese rather than Chinese, with the share rising to 85% among under-35s,according to Pew Research.The US does not formally recognise Taiwan but is its largest security backer. Trump’s position on Taiwan has been unclear. Despite suggesting that the US’s support of Taiwan may have a price, he is surrounded by China hawks who are strongly opposed to China’s claims on Taiwan. Earlier this month the state departmentremoved a linefrom its fact sheet on Taiwan that stated: “We do not support Taiwan independence”, a move which was condemned by Beijing.Zhou said the fate of Taiwan was not just up to the Taiwanese people. China’s population of 1.4 billion dwarfs Taiwan’s 23 million. “We can just not only think about what the Taiwanese think about it. We have to think about what mainlanders think about it.”‘China is definitely indispensable’Despite tensions over Taiwan, Zhou sees Trump as overall being “rather friendly” towards China, noting that the tariffs on Chinese imports announced in Trump’s first days in office were much lower than the 60% he had threatened.In recent weeks, Trump’s comments on China have been relatively muted, in part because the US has been preoccupied withUkraine – an issue which exploded in spectacular fashion when Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenksyyclashed in the Oval Office on Friday. .In the early days of the war in Ukraine, western leaders leaned on China’s president,Xi Jinping, to use his influence in Russia to help end the conflict. But China has been an economic lifeline to Russia, enabling the continuation of the war. On 24 February – the third anniversary of the Ukraine invasion – Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke on a video call with Xi. The Chinese leader described China-Russia relations as “strong” and “unique” and “not affected by any third party”, according to a Chinese readout.“The US really holds the key to resolving this issue,” Zhou said, rejecting the suggestion that China was becoming irrelevant in the peace talks. “China is definitely indispensable … China’s role will be there when it comes to the time of a ceasefire or armistice.”Zhou said China might decide to send peacekeepers to Ukraine, along with other non-Nato European countries and countries from the global south, as peacekeepers from Nato countries would be viewed by Russia as “wolves in sheep’s clothing”. China is the second-largest contributor to the UN’s peacekeeping budget, after the US.A widely held view in China’s academic and policy circles is that China has received too much criticism for its relationship with Russia. The two countries share a 4,200km border that was only fully agreed by both sides in 2003. Beijing is the more powerful partner in the relationship, but it has to balance Moscow’s interests too, the argument goes. The China-Russia relationship “is strong, but short of an alliance”, Zhou said. “I describe it as two lines in parallel. That means no matter how close they are, they won’t overlap.”Explore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanDonald TrumpXi JinpingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

TheQueenslandcapital is particularly flood-prone and has been severely inundated three times in the past 15 years.It is unusual – though not unprecedented – for a Tropical Cyclone to threaten landfall so far south of the tropics.Ocean rower Aurimas Mockus stranded by cyclone off Australia’s east coast safely rescuedRead moreSpeaking on ABC News Breakfast on Monday, Crisafulli urged residents in the south-east – unaccustomed to the sorts of cyclone preparations that are routine in the state’s north – to prepare their homes.“[People need to] make sure they do things around their own home and make sure they’ve got canned food and bottled water and remove loose items,” Crisafulli said.“If you do all those things, you do get through these events.”The Bureau of Meteorology has warned that heavy rainfall will be concentrated to the south of wherever Alfred makes landfall, and that the system could bring 300mm to 600mm over multiple days.“It’s the rainfall that is most of concern,” Crisafulli said.“When a system like that does cross the coast, generally speaking you have huge intensities to the south of the system, and that can produce really intense rainfall in a very, very short window.“You’re already dealing with areas that are reasonably soaked already, so there are complications that come with that.”Tropical Cyclone Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane. Why is this a big deal and when could it hit?Read moreThe more immediate threat, as Alfred moves slowly to the south-east and lingers off the coast, is concern about intense winds and potential storm surge in island communities and along the coast.Waves up to 14 metres were recorded off Wide Bay on Sunday.The Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said many of the city’s residents had never experienced a cyclone before as he stressed the “very real threat” to south-eastern Queensland.It is rare – but not unheard of – for tropical cyclones to reach landfall south of the tropics.The closest a cyclone track has come to Brisbane was in 1990, whenTropical Cyclone Nancytracked erratically towards the Queensland capital, before making a southward turn just off the coastline and never reaching landfall.Tropical Cyclone Wanda – the cause of Brisbane’s historic 1974 floods – crossed the coast near K’gari and Hervey Bay. A severe tropical cyclone crossed the coast near Tweed Heads in 1954.It is far more common for a tropical cyclone to cross the coast north of the tropic of capricorn and return overland to the south-east as a destructive low storm. This occurred with Cyclone Debbie in 2017.In NSW, where the northern coastline could be affected, the State Emergency Service urged residents to prepare for damaging winds, large surf and heavy rainfall with major riverine and flash flooding expected from Wednesday.“We are asking the community to take steps now to ensure that if you are asked to evacuate you have a plan for yourselves, your families and your pets and know where you will go,” NSW SES assistant commissioner Dean Storey said.The bureau is predicting that Alfred will move slowly to the south-east until Tuesday, before shifting west back towards the coast.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandNew South WalesAustralia weatherExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It said there were “few new wind developments” advanced enough to be added to the grid before the promised closure of a coal power station in 2027.The advice, seen by Guardian Australia, was written late last year, before a state election campaign that will be decided on Saturday.WA nearly became a one-party state in 2021. Will Labor’s grip on power weaken at next week’s election?Read moreIt reinforces independent data suggesting the amount of electricity from large-scale wind and solar developments haseffectively flatlinedat about 18% of total generation in the grid, known as the South West Interconnected System, or Swis, since 2021.WA organisation SustainableEnergyNow found no major wind or solar developments were added to the grid in the first three years of the last term of parliament, between 2021 and 2023.One wind project, the 76 megawatt Flat Rocks farm at Kojonup, was connected last year and a solar farm, the 128MW Cunderdin plant, came online in January. The organisation said only two further windfarms had been confirmed by 2028.The clean energy slowdown does not apply to electricity from rooftop solar panels, which last year provided 19.8% of Perth’s electricity – for the first time more than the total from solar and windfarms – or utility-scale batteries. Several large batteries are in development and the government haspromised a rebate scheme for household batteriesif re-elected.The premier, Roger Cook, last week told Guardian Australia that Labor wanted WA to be a “renewable energy powerhouse, utilising the extraordinary solar and wind assets that we have”, and that zero-emissions generation in the grid had more than doubled since it came to power 2017.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut the Liberal energy spokesman, Steve Thomas, said it was “the worst-kept secret in energy discussions in Western Australia” that the government was “years behind any sort of schedule that would keep the lights on while an energy transition plan was in place”.“They will not be able to shut the coal-fired stations on the timeframe they have predicted,” he said.Greens MP Brad Pettitt said there were no large renewable energy developments currently under construction in the state’s main power grid.He accused the government of “putting its foot on the hose” in developing major renewable energy projects despite promising to close the state’s coal-fired power plants by the end of the decade. “This should be a point in time when we are seeing renewable projects expanding thick and fast.”Pettitt said WA Labor had been more focused on supporting new and expanded fossil fuel developments – particularlya 50-year life extension for Woodside’s North-West Shelf gas exporting facilityand new gas basins to feed it – than on ensuring a rapid expansion of renewable energy in the south.Part of the delay in connecting new large-scale renewable energy has been blamed on a lack of new transmission links to join them to the grid.The confidential document shows officials backed a government proposal to release $500m funding to develop the Clean Energy Link north of Perth, which they say will need to be finished by December 2027. It shows the estimated cost of that link had increased by more than 50% from $655m to $1bn.The document stated the state-owned energy generator Synergy was operating in a “challenging financial position” and required new subsidies. The government has committed $3.7bn for new state-owned windfarms and battery storage but 89% – about $3.25bn – had been allocated and there more than 900 megawatts of wind and storage capacity was yet to be funded.In a statement, the Labor energy, environment and climate action minister, Reece Whitby, said the Cook government was “already delivering on its clean energy plan”, with the total share of renewable energy increasing from 14% to 38% since 2017.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said getting there would require a “huge amount of extra wind” – 4,800MW – but the state government was aiming to build only 810MW.The chair of Sustainable Energy Now, Fraser Maywood, said there were several major proposals “in the pipeline” but investors were not making financial decisions as it was difficult and expensive to get connected to the grid.The election could be called any day – but Peter Dutton still hasn’t explained how his nuclear proposal will work | Adam MortonRead more“It is dire. There is little sign of life in that pipeline,” he said.Maywood said 1.2 gigawatts of large renewables had been added to the grid over 20 years and government forecasts suggested another 50GW would be needed in the next two decades to replace retiring plants and meet rising electricity demand.He said if the lack of construction was not addressed, it would lead to a greater reliance on gas, which currently provides about 30% of electricity, and higher greenhouse gas emissions.The Liberal party has proposed extending fossil fuel generation by building a 300MW gas-fired power plant and keeping coal plants open for longer than Labor.Thomas said he expected Labor would announce it would extend the life of generators, including the Collie power station that is scheduled to shut in 2027, if it won re-election. He said all parties agreed it was inevitable the state would get out of coal but the Liberals believed it would be needed until about 2036.Labor won 53 of 59 lower house seats at the last WA election in 2021 and isan overwhelming favourite to win another term.Explore more on these topicsWestern Australia election 2025Western AustraliaLabor partyAustralian politicsSolar powerEnergy (Australia news)Renewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

They address pornography and content related to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and violence.Jennifer Duxbury, the director of policy and regulatory affairs at Digi, an industry association for the digital sector, said the proposed safeguards would allow children to “navigate online spaces in a secure and supportive way”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has also raised concern about several “bottlenecks” and “blindspots” that have prevented it from quickly detecting if players, coaches and staff are betting on games or sharing sensitive information.These concerns, which have not been spoken about publicly, have been used by the AFL to justify a campaign to seize an even bigger share of the money Australians gamble on its games. This is despitesustained criticism for its close association with the wagering sectorand its gambling advertising beingviewed by impressionable children.5:54Does community sport and free-to-air TV in Australia need gambling ads to survive? – videoThe AFL’s proposed solution is to completely overhaul its integrity framework and force more than 80 bookmakers to provide gambling data to a new centralised database, managed by an external AI company, which would allow it to detect suspicious transactions in near real time.It’s an expensive fix, and the AFL wants bookmakers to pay for it.An email outlining this plan, sent by the AFL’s legal team at the height of summer, has triggered a bitter fight over gambling revenue, a flurry of legal letters, hard-ball negotiation tactics, threats to call in the regulator, exasperation from public health officials, and a broader questioning of the AFL’s social licence.‘Increase in integrity threats’A December 2024 internal document seen by Guardian Australia reveals the AFL has raised concern about “mounting integrity threats” posed by the gambling sector that are “evolving at an unprecedented rate”.The league has cited three examples that demonstrate “shortcomings in the AFL’s current integrity monitoring framework”. The first involves the case of an AFL umpire allegedly providing advance notice of outcomes to people who place bets.“The AFL relied on one bookmaker to identify the betting of interest and the connection with a specific umpire, with bets of interest only flagged due to a significant loss being made on the market,” the document said.AFL plan to extract more money from gambling faces potential legal challengeRead more“The AFL then had to request further information from all wage service providers, substantially delaying investigation and mitigating steps.”According to the AFL, bookmakers have been too slow to provide transaction data when requested to do so. The information supplied over email must be cleaned and collated before it can be analysed by integrity teams, creating further delays.The AFL also referred to a player allegedly providing inside information about games to someone who placed five bets with different bookmakers.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe player had been told to start his next game in a different position from his usual one. This information was not public and the betting markets did not reflect it. The gambler placed bets on him kicking the first goal of the game.Another example cited involved a health professional at an AFLW team, who is not allowed to gamble on matches. The document describes them betting from their partner’s account, based on non-public information about injuries. The bets were small.“Within existing integrity monitoring framework, the wage service provider does not report the activity due to the size of the bets, and their own checks into the partner do not identify any links between her and any AFL player/official,” the document said.The AFL’s solution to these problems is to create a centralised database that ingests every gambling transaction from bookmakers. This would include gambler names. AI software would then identify suspicious transactions.The new system is described as a way for the AFL to “keep up with the increase in digital betting”, which it is partly responsible for, having promoted betting ads at its stadiums and on social media, while listing odds on its app.The AFL did not respond to a request for comment.‘Unprecedented and unnecessary’Many large bookmakers are strongly opposed to the AFL’s proposed database and have declined to sign up. They describe it as an overreach and raise concerns about personal information being misused or compromised.One wagering source, who declined to be named so they could speak freely, said the new monitoring system would be “an unprecedented and unnecessary intervention” that would cause “more problems” than it solved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTransaction data sent to the new system would include a gambler’s full name, date of birth, full address, email address, home and mobile phone numbers, and the volume of their bets.Internal AFL documents acknowledged the database would contain “sensitive” personal information, but stressed “additional security measures would be implemented over and above normal data security controls”.Others in the wagering industry have noted that no similar database exists for financial crime agencies to wade through non-suspicious transactions in the search for money laundering, corruption or terrorism financing.Multiple sources have told Guardian Australia that the AFL has decided to postpone the introduction of the new system, in the face of strong opposition from bookmakers.‘This agreement must be kept confidential’While unknown to most fans, the AFL has a financial stake in its fans’ gambling habits.It receives a cut of each bet placed on its games, or a percentage of a gambling company’s turnover.This arrangement, along with broadcast revenue and ticket sales, has become the engine that powers the AFL’s revenue stream. It was introduced by the league’s former CEO Andrew Demetriou, who watched gambling companies cash in on the sport. This money has supported the AFL’s integrity efforts ever since.Less than two months before round one, the AFL wrote to gambling companies outlining its plan to receive a minimum $20,000 share of revenue each year. It had already extended consultation in December and demanded an answer by the end of February.This minimum fee would apply to all bookmakers, regardless of how much money they generated.A proposed agreement sent to bookmakers required them “keep confidential and not allow, make or cause any disclosure” related to “the terms of this agreement” without the written consent of the AFL.More than 30 smaller bookmakers concerned by the increase in fees engaged the law firm Pat Brown Legal to seek a better deal.Last week, after negotiations, the AFL offered a revised offer. Instead of the annual $20,000 minimum payment, smaller bookmakers would be charged at least $3,000 in 2025, $5,000 in 2026 and $7,000 in 2027. But some believed this was still too high.While all parties believe the impasse can be resolved, Pat Brown Legal has flagged the potential for Victoria’s gambling regulator to act as an independent arbiter. Court challenges and an appeal for ministerial intervention are also possible options.The AFL Players Association, which has warnedplayers are being treated as gambling productsthat cause community harm, is also following the negotiations. It continues to push for players to get a bigger share of profits made on their performance.Public health experts, including the Australian Medical Association, believe the AFL’s push for a bigger share of wagering revenue shows it relationship with the gambling industry is firmly entrenched.The former AFL commissioner Colin Carter says that must change. “Surveys show that football fans resent the massive levels of gambling advertising and some AFL clubs have even exited their very profitable pokies businesses because they don’t fit their values,” he told Guardian Australia.“But the AFL is silent on this one and even seems opposed to restricting the level of advertising, which is terribly disappointing.”The AFL season begins on Thursday. The stakes have been raised.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

People are extremely despondent. It’s no longer simply about the train crash but a much broader political crisis.”Two years on, no official or state body has been held accountable for the tragedy and the glacial pace of Greek justice means a trial has yet to take place.Anger has been further fuelled by the sense of a cover-up, aggravated by Greece’s air and rail accident authority releasing a 178-page report on the eve of the protests revealing the possible presence of an unknown and highly flammable substance at the scene of the crash – increasing suspicions that the freight train was smuggling explosive illegal chemicals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keir Starmer said they had agreed to increase economic pressure on Russia.Photograph: Javad Parsa/ReutersThe summit took place in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House, surrounded by a ring of pro-Ukrainian protesters.Starmer told a press conference afterwards that Britain and other European nations were willing to put “boots on the ground and planes in the air” to help provide an effective deterrent to Russia.“It’s time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace,” he told reporters. “If you want to preserve the peace, you have to be prepared to defend the peace.”Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, called the meeting “historic”. Starmer failed to secure concrete promises of extra military support from other Nato members, but Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said she would follow it up on Thursday with her own plan to “rearm Europe”.“It’s basically [about] turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders,” she added.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, later told Le Figaro that he and Starmer had suggested a one-month truce “in the air, on the seas, and on energy infrastructure” to get more time to de-escalate the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.Starmer’s diplomatic flurry puts him at centre of attempts to shape Ukraine-Russia dealRead moreThe truce would not cover ground fighting, he said, conceding it would be “very difficult” to police a complete ceasefire given the length of the frontline.Macron also spoke about the need to relax EU fiscal rules to allow countries to spend more and use “innovative” financing to fund defence spending.Starmer said that to ensure Vladimir Putin did not breach any ceasefire with further attacks on Ukraine, there would have to be security guarantees from the US, with senior British officials saying that air, logistics and intelligence support would be necessary.“To succeed, this effort must have strong US backing. We’re working with the US on this point after my meeting with President Trump last week,” Starmer said. “Let me be clear, we agree with the president on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together.”Trump has repeatedly resisted making any sort of military commitment to securing peace in Ukraine. Instead, he has suggested that an “economic backstop” of US civilians working on a multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal in the country would be sufficient.1:41Zelenskyy greeted by cheering crowds in UK after Trump clash – videoSome in the British government believe this will be enough to provide security to Ukraine. Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to Washington, told ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday: “Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow.”British officials are still hoping the minerals deal can be resurrected, with Starmer having urged Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday to return to the negotiating table.However, with little sign of the White House wanting to re-engage in talks with Zelenskyy, Downing Street has shifted its attention to building Starmer’s “coalition of the willing” instead.At the London summit, the leaders agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine, including after any ceasefire agreement, so that Kyiv would be in a strong position to deter any further attacks from Russia.Other nations are also planning to raise their own defence budgets, after Starmer announced last week that the UK would increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an ambition to hit 3% soon afterwards.“Any deal must be backed by strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,” Starmer said.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy later travelled to meet Prince Charles at Sandringham.Photograph: Joe Giddens/APThe prime minister said the leaders had also agreed to increase economic pressure on Russia.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will sign a £2.3bn loan deal to allow Kyiv to buy more weapons, to be paid back using profits generated on Russian sovereign assets that are under sanctions.Shehas also saidshe will change the remit of the £27.8bn national wealth fund so it could be spent on defence as well as infrastructure projects.Leaving the summit, von der Leyen said European leaders recognised they had to “urgently rearm” the continent, with the commission due to propose a plan on Thursday. “We need … to prepare for the worst, and [are] therefore stepping up the defences,” she said.Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, said Europe was “stepping up” to make sure Ukraine could continue to defend itself if necessary, and had discussed what security guarantees they could provide, while following the UK by increasing their own defence budgets.After the summit,Zelenskyy travelled to meet King Charlesat Sandringham, with the offer of a royal audience interpreted at Westminster as a deliberate move to give the Ukrainian president equal treatment to Trump, who was last week presented by Starmer with an invitation to a second state visit to the UK.Speaking to reporters later on, Zelenskyy said he regretted the fact the meeting with Trump on Friday had taken place in front of cameras.“I do not believe it is right when such conversations are absolutely open because the emotions or information etc, the foes can take advantage of them,” he told LBC’s Andrew Marr.“Therefore, the format of what happened, I do not think that it brought something positive or additional to us as partners.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerForeign policyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But how well is he playing his own hand? | Olga ChyzhRead moreHe added: “I travelled in the train for 12 hours, then for 11 hours I flew because the president of the US invited me. The US is one of our main partners, and for me it is a show of respect to be in the White House when the president of the US invites me.”Ukraine’s president was speaking just before flying out of the UK, to which he had travelled immediately after thedisastrous White House meetingwhere he was accused of not being grateful for US military support and was told Ukraine could not win the war.He also said he believed that an Anglo-French-led peace effort, discussed by European leaders in London on Sunday, would bear fruit “in the coming weeks” and indicated there were supportive declarations from other countries – such as Turkey, the Balts and the Nordics – to get involved.The conference in London also discussed “what security guarantees could be given to Ukraine”, Zelenskyy said, adding that there had “been a very good start” in Sunday’s discussion, and a number of countries would soon “speak for themselves”.But while he said he was aware of a proposal from France and Britain to for a one-month truce in the fighting, he would not say if he supported it. Speaking at the end of the interview he gave his only answer in English: “I am aware of everything.”Ukraine “will never” recognise any Russian annexation of territory it occupies, even if it is to try to secure a peace deal, Zelenskyy added, and he repeated that he would only accept a ceasefire if it was followed by robust security guarantees that had the confidence of his country’s people.Though Russia has said it will insist on incorporating territories that it occupies, for Ukraine it would always be “a temporary occupation”, Zelenskyy insisted, even if his country lacks the military muscle to expel Russia from all of the country at the moment.​Zelenskyy said what he wanted “from partners” – a clear reference to the US White House – was for them to remember that Russia launched the full-scale invasion of his country three years ago. He did not want politicians rewriting history, he said, to suggest “that there are two parties in this war and it is vague who the aggressor is”.The Ukrainian president appeared to provoke Trump on Friday when he had said that Putin “hates us” and “thinks we are not a nation”. Trump had spoken in Putin’s defence and appeared to blame Zelenskyy for being embroiled in the war with his larger neighbour.The Ukrainian leader refused to say what happened after the cameras stopped rolling in the Oval Office on Friday, and before he abruptly left the White House without having lunch or signing the minerals deal.It has been reported that Trump’s team asked Zelenskyy to leave, though the Ukrainian president said it was best “to leave this to history”.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The test on Trump’s intentions, if he is presented with a credible European plan, will be if he rejects all US involvement. “Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent, and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing,” Starmer said.But Europe’s fear is that Trump has left them behind. Asked whether Trump wanted Zelenskyy to resign, his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said: “We need a leader who can deal with us, and ultimately deal with the Russians and end this war.”He added: “If it becomes clear that President Zelenskyy’s personal motivations or political motivations are making it more difficult to end the conflict in his country, then I think we have a real problem on our hands.”But Starmer also threw down a challenge to Europe to move beyond its endless promises to spend more on defence and to act. An EU summit later this week will be the test of whether the bloc is willing to take defence investment outside the rules limiting fiscal debts, so releasing extra defence spending.Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president, has promised a comprehensive plan this week, and the signs are that the nascent governing coalition in Germany between Friedrich Merz’s CDU and the SPD will move to act urgently.The Polish president, Donald Tusk, said the upcoming EU summit should send a clear message to Putin “that the west has no intention of capitulating before his blackmail and aggression”.Starmer believes he has convinced Zelenskyy that the offer of US access to Ukrainian rare minerals, an agreement that fell apart in the Oval House, has to be reactivated. Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington, described it as the only game in town since it is the only way to convince the US it has a stake in Ukraine that warrants the US providing the required security guarantees.Explore more on these topicsEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUkraineKeir StarmerRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer, it seems, is the person now forced to say: hang on, it is a bit more complicated than that.The hastily arranged gathering of leaders at London’s Lancaster House on Sunday was undeniably dramatic, with the UK prime minister at its centre – including in the group photo, where he stood between Emmanuel Macron andVolodymyr Zelenskyy.Keir Starmer says Europe ‘at crossroads in history’ and must support UkraineRead moreThere was also a very real sense of Europe reshaping its defence and diplomatic priorities on the hoof afterDonald Trumpand JD Vance’s public dressing-down of the Ukrainian president, with Starmer talking of a continent “at a crossroads in history”.Other countries had signalled a willingness to join the Anglo-French “coalition of the willing” to try to devise their own peace plan forUkraine, he added.Yes, Starmer agreed, this wasEuropestepping up. But it was not because Trump’s US was now absent. “I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally,” he told the press conference.There are easier political paths to tread. Most British voices – including rightwing papers previously hostile to Starmer – appear to agree that Trump and Vance treated their guest abominably and MPs from all sides of the political divide, not to mention voters, would quite enjoy Starmer pointing this out.1:28Keir Starmer announces £1.6bn package for Ukraine – videoHis approach has instead been to try to very personally mend the fissure, speaking to both Trump and Zelenskyy after their meeting ended prematurely, and treating the US president as a rational and predictable ally despite the evidence.“I’ve seen people ramping up the rhetoric and taking to Twitter and saying what they would do,” Starmer told the BBC earlier on Sunday when asked why Trump had beeninvited to the UK for a second state visit. “Good for them. I’m not that interested in that.”That is not to say that Starmer has been diplomatically silent. Hishug with the Ukrainian presidentoutside Downing Street on Saturday was hugely eloquent.Perhaps more telling still was the fact that Zelenskyy went from the Lancaster House summit for a chat with King Charles not at a royal palace but at Sandringham, a family residence.Trump is very delighted with his own invitation, but will also be aware that Zelenskyy received a more personal, intimate and revealing gesture.It is a tricky balancing act, all the more so given how things with Trump can head south at speed, as demonstrated by the 24-hour gap between Starmer’scosy Oval Office chaton Thursday and the ambushing of Zelenskyy.Starmer is once again fated to pretend that such chaos is not endemic in the current White House, largely in the hope that saying it could make it true and that Trump may continue to offer the US’s military and diplomatic might towards the cause of peace in Ukraine.To a great extent there is little choice. As has been repeatedly noted since Friday, the EU’s combined population and GDP should make it able to protect Ukraine alone. But it would take years or even decades to untangle the mutual US-Europe reliance of Nato. A peace deal with no US security guarantee would probably unravel at speed.For Starmer personally, there is more to it. As the Labour leader in opposition, he made a virtue of what some complained was uninspiring pragmatism, contrasting it with what he derisively called “the politics of protest”.There are a lot of people who would have liked Starmer to have protested loudly about Trump. But whether or not his Ukraine plan works, that is not, and was never going to be, the politician he is.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerForeign policyUkraineDefence policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, the announcement led to an immediate jump in prices of basic necessities in Gaza, with residents saying they had doubled.Aid agencies say the population ofGazaremains highly vulnerable and that the blockade of humanitarian supplies to a civilian population is unacceptable in any circumstances.Oxfam said: “Israel’s decision, to block aid to over 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Ramadan begins, is a reckless act of collective punishment, explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law. The government of Israel, as occupying power, has the responsibility to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach the population in Gaza.”Gaza ceasefire talks stall, as Egypt proposes long-term reconstruction planRead moreThe international court of justice, weighing an allegation of genocide brought against Israel, has instructed Israel to facilitate aid deliveries to Gaza and its remaining population of 2.2 million. The international criminal court said when it issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last year that there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare”.Israel has consistently denied allegations by aid organisations during the 15-month military campaign in Gaza that it was using food as a weapon of war, insisting that blockages in supplies were a result of other factors. Sunday’s announcement by Netanyahu’s office made no attempt to disguise the government’s actions or thegoal behind them, which is to gain advantage at the negotiating table.For the duration of the ceasefire, about 600 trucks a day have crossed into Gaza, carrying a total of 57,000 tons of food. This is a similar level to prewar aid deliveries, but aid agencies say that was for a population in a much better physical condition than the undernourished inhabitants now, and that also had the capacity to produce some of its own food.The situation in Gaza now is far more precarious. Nearly 70% of the buildings across the coastal strip have been destroyed or damaged. In those circumstances, Oxfam called the aid that reached Gaza during the six-week ceasefire “a drop in the ocean”.In itslatest report, in late February, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 876,000 Palestinians in Gaza still suffered from emergency levels of food insecurity, and 345,000 were facing catastrophic food insecurity.Even in the six weeks of the ceasefire, Israel kept tight control of what was allowed in humanitarian shipments.Aidagencies complained that a lot of medical equipment was blocked on the grounds it was “dual use” and that water tankers were also blocked, leaving people dependent on wells, which in the wake of conflict are insufficient for the population’s needs.There are about 1,500 water access points operating across Gaza, and the UN says water production and supply are at about a quarter of prewar levels.Health issues remain a primary concern, with an estimated 80% of Gaza’s health infrastructure destroyed by the war and 1,000 medical workers killed. The World Health Organization has estimated there areup to 14,000 Palestiniansin Gaza in need of medical evacuation, including 4,500 children.“The health situation in the Gaza Strip is a catastrophe,” said Amjad al-Shawa, the director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organisations Network. He said that in Gaza City alone there was 180,000 tons of solid waste that Israeli authorities had blocked from being removed, with the result that sewage was overflowing. “That has severe health implications in the conditions now in Gaza,” Shawa said.Kathleen Spencer Chapman, the external affairs director at Plan International UK, said: “Without the influx of humanitarian aid promised by the ceasefire agreement, thousands more could die from hunger and related diseases alone.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAidanalysisShareReuse this content"

Film of controversial play about Israel gets London premiereDirector says Seven Jewish Children by Caryl Churchill, which provoked fury  at its first production in 2009, is a ‘family story’ at heartVanessa ThorpeArts and media correspondentSun 2 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTShareThe premiere of Caryl Churchill’s short playSeven Jewish Childrenat the Royal Court theatre 16 years ago proved to be one of British theatre’s most controversial opening nights.Audiences were immediately divided by the British playwright’s deliberately stripped-back treatment of Jewish generational fear and Israel’s history of conflict.The public attacks it prompted have echoed on. In 2022,Churchill was deprived of the lifetime European Drama awardshe had received earlier in the year, due to criticism of the play and her pro-Palestinian campaigning.Now the playhas been filmedand is to open officially in London at the end of this month, at a time when the Middle East has been rocked by devastating violence and, in Britain, allegiances are more contested than ever.Behind the film is London-based Omri Dayan, a 23-year-old US-Israeli director, who said this weekend that he was “braced” for all the contention to come, but was drawn to make his version “not because of its politics, but because of its humanity – for me it is a family story.”Like the play,Seven Jewish Children: A Film for Gazatells its story through glimpsed moments of Jewish family life. It starts with the Russian pogroms of 1903 and finishes with the 2008-09 Israeli action in Gaza, Operation Cast Lead. With a repeated refrain, each family questions in turn what they should tell a young daughter – setting up taboos that, it is implied, will have serious consequences.View image in fullscreenA scene from the original production of Seven Jewish Children at the Royal Court theatre in 2009.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The ObserverMaking his film, Dayan said, was the first time he had embraced his heritage in his work. “This play made me realise that I am Jewish, I am the son of Israeli parents, and this is a story I need to tell,” he said. And it was a family project. The director’s father, Ami Dayan, and his grandmother – the Israeli actress Rivka Michaeli – are in his cast. “Because the film is rooted in family, them being right beside me really helped,” said Dayan. Churchill, 86, has given the film her approval.Made by a crew of 50 which worked for nothing and included Israelis and Palestinians, it will be shown free on Monday 31 March in London, at the Prince Charles Cinema off Leicester Square, to raise money for Medical Aid for Palestinians. It will then be released on YouTube. When Churchill wrote the play she stipulated it could be read or performed anywhere as long as no admission fee was charged and a collection was taken for this charity. The director hopes the film will go on to be shown to invited groups in universities, schools, community groups and synagogues.“The script is so clear, even though the issue is so complex,” said Dayan. “The play did an incredible job of showing what different positions have been taken, as well as looking at the times we are in. I hope that the film helps in the same way.”Before the film starts, a note on the screen spells out it was made before the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. However, Dayan and his team were editing the film that day. “We took a break for a while,” he said, “because I didn’t want what we did to be a reaction. We had all known, of course, that there was going to be another chapter one day. It is incredibly sad.”While he anticipates protest, as well as support, Dayan said he hopes that audiences from all sides will listen. “We hope that [we] can guide people to a place where they are not putting up their usual defences,” he said. “Everyone has a view, but we are asking them to put those aside for 15 minutes, to let the characters speak. Then afterwards, if they want to, they can pick up set attitudes again afterwards.”View image in fullscreenOmri DayanSome critics at the time argued the play was antisemitic. TheTimes’s2009 review said it was evidence of “straitjacketed political orthodoxy”, while novelist Howard Jacobson described it as a “hate-fuelled little chamber piece”in theIndependent, warning it was part of “a gradual habituation of a language of loathing”.Jacobson added: “Caryl Churchill will argue that her play is about Israelis not Jews, but once you venture on to ‘chosen people’ territory – feeding all the ancient prejudice against that miscomprehended phrase – once you repeat in another form the med­ieval blood-libel of Jews rejoicing in the murder of little children, you have crossed over. This is the old stuff.”In contrast, theGuardian’sMichael Billingtonpraised Churchillfor capturing “the transition that has overtaken Israel, to the point where security has become the pretext for indiscriminate slaughter”, adding: “Avoiding overt didacticism, her play becomes a heartfelt lamentation for the future generations who will themselves become victims of the attempted military suppression of Hamas.” In the aftermath of the row,theGuardianalso ran a full transcriptof the play.Dayan believes many attacks on the play “had no true merit” because the people criticising it had not seen it. “There is a real fear that goes down generation to generation that Churchill shows. This play should be seen as something that can help explain it,” he said. “Instead, there was a real jump to delegitimise it.”Last week the BBC’s board apologised for“significant and damaging” mistakesin the production of a documentary on Gaza which featured the son of a Hamas official. It has now been taken down. Dayan said he had not seen the programme,Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, but believed it should still be available to watch. “I don’t yet know the details,” he said, “but it should be shown as long as there is full disclosure. It is very difficult to tell these stories now, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. My instinct is that it should be seen. Discussion is the most important thing.”Such divisions in culture and over media coverage must be fought if they lead to censorship and “cancellation”, he argues. “We have already been disinvited from showing our film at festival for the Jewish community at a centre in New York.”Influenced by Lars von Trier’s filmDogville, Dayan set his film on a basic sound stage, with different domestic spaces marked out on the floor: “My first thought had been to set each scene in its location, but it didn’t work,” he said. Dominic Cooke, the original director of the play, has saluted his choices, calling the film “a terrific achievement”. “Caryl’s vision of an Israel trapped in cycles of trauma is sadly more pertinent now than ever,” Cooke added.Dayan said he hoped reaction to his film would take the form of conversation, not argument: “I’ll be pleased if people see it, even if they go on to disagree about it. That was part of the intention of making it; that, and the fundraising.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelThe ObserverIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaTheatreCaryl ChurchillAntisemitismJudaismnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,” it said in a statement. “If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.”After the announcement, Netanyahu’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, wrote in a social media post: “No trucks entered Gaza this morning, nor will they at this stage.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately”.The existence and details of a Witkoff plan had not been confirmed by Washington by Sunday morning. A statement from Hamas called the suspension of aid a “war crime” and a violation of the ceasefire agreement. It said Netanyahu’s “decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement”.Hamas said it was committed to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase, with negotiations aimed at a permanent end to the war, and it rejected the idea of a temporary extension to the 42-day truce.A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, told Al Jazeera the group would release the remaining Israeli hostages only under the terms of the already agreed-upon phased deal.During the 15 months of theIsrael-Gaza war, the Netanyahu government repeatedly denied claims from aid agencies that it was blocking humanitarian deliveries, blaming the very limited flow on other factors. Before the ceasefire, UN officials had warned that widespread famine was imminent. In the six weeks of the first phase of the truce, deliveries returned to the prewar levels of about 600 trucks a day, mostly carrying food.Aid officials said that even with the restoration of food deliveries, the lack of drinkable water, the near-complete destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and clinics, the lack of shelter in the midst of winter, and the buildup of untreated sewage among the rubble could all be lethal to the surviving population of 2.2 million people.Netanyahu made his announcement, which his office claimed had US backing, after the breakdown of talks in Cairo aimed at maintaining the ceasefire as it approached the end of its first six-week phase, over whether the truce should advance to a second phase.The prime minister’s office said earlier on Sunday that it agreed on the adoption of what it described as Witkoff’s proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, which end on 20 April, during which half of the living hostages and half of the bodies of those who have died would be released.On the conclusion of that temporary extension, the statement said: “If agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, the remaining living and deceased hostages will be released.”1:19Palestinians gather amid rubble in Rafah for first iftar of Ramadan – videoThe first phase of the ceasefire chiefly involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, an increase in aid deliveries and a retreat of Israeli troops from some positions. The second phase requires a complete Israeli withdrawal and a more enduring cessation of hostilities.The Witkoff plan as described by Netanyahu’s office appeared similar to Israel’s proposal for a six-week extension of the first phase of the ceasefire, with hostage releases, but it made no mention of the troop withdrawal that was part of theoriginal truce agreement in January.Hamas said the proposal made clear that Israel was seeking to disavow the deal it previously signed.The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as “a weapon against the Palestinian people”, comments echoed by Qatar which said it “strongly condemns” Israel’s decision. Saudi Arabia also condemned the aid block and Jordan said Israel’s action “threatens to reignite” fighting in Gaza.The European Union condemned what it called Hamas’s refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel’s subsequent aid block “risked humanitarian consequences”. Brussels called for “a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire”.Hamas has not been directly participating in the talks in Cairo, but has been coordinating with Qatari and Egyptian officials who are at the negotiating table with US and Israeli delegations. The negotiators left Cairo on Friday night, and there was no sign of them reconvening late on Saturday.An Israeli withdrawal would first involve a pullback from thePhiladelphi corridoralong Gaza’s southern border with Egypt but such a retreat could trigger the collapse of Netanyahu’s rightwing coalition, which would in turn force new elections, in which his political future would be uncertain.Israeli political analysts have suggested that Netanyahu agreed to the ceasefire under pressure from Donald Trump, confident that the agreement would never reach a second phase. Since the start of the ceasefire, he prevented Israeli negotiators from discussing a second phase.Witkoffhas, however, insisted that a second phase of the ceasefire deal should be implemented, to ensure the release of theremaining 59 hostages, only 25 of whom are thought to be still alive. Most Israelis also want the government to make a priority of freeing the hostages, but that position is opposed by the Israeli far right, without whom the coalition could not stay in power. The rightwing parties argue Israel’s priority should be the destruction of Hamas.The far-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said the decision to halt the flow of aid was “an important step in the right direction”.Referring to Trump’s earlier threat to open the “gates of hell” on Gaza, Smotrich said in a social media post: “Now we need to open these gates as quickly and deadly as possible on to the enemy, until complete victory.”There remains no agreement on who should run Gaza once an enduring end to the war can be agreed. Trump caused consternation and bewilderment early in February with the shock suggestion that theUS should “own” Gaza, which would be somehow emptied of its more than 2 million Palestinian inhabitants to make way for a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

On the contrary, when we came back, we felt we belonged to this house.”Located in the old Iraqi city of Mosul, right behind the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, their home is part of the local cultural heritage. It washeavily damagedduring the occupation by Islamic State (IS) and the battle to reclaim the city by Iraqi armed forces, backed by US coalition airstrikes. Sara and her family were forcibly displaced during the fighting in 2017 and for many years feared they would never see their home intact again.“It was amazing when we could step in,” Sara says. “The neighbourhood has changed a lot, but it’s still very beautiful and we’re optimistic that more and more neighbours will resettle in their home town.”Most of these old houses have been restored, thanks to a Unesco-led project called Revive the Spirit of Mosul, which includes the renovation of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri and other sites. “Most of our family members are employed here in the reconstruction of the city,” Sara says. “Life is still precarious, but we hope that 10 years after Daesh [IS] occupied our beloved city, it will only improve.”View image in fullscreenArchitect Layla Saleh, head of the reconstruction team of Al-Tahera Church.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverThe mosque’s leaning minaret, named Al-Habda or the hunchback, has been restored under Unesco’s supervision and reopened last month. Built in 1172, it is 45m tall and decorated with ornamental brickwork along its cylindrical shaft and square base. The self-proclaimed caliph of the IS,Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, inaugurated the “caliphate” from the pulpit inside the mosque in 2014.The renovation of the Great Mosque will be completed during Ramadan, which began on Friday, and 11 years after IS madeMosulits capital. The prayer hall will already be open for Ramadan prayers – for the first time since IS’s defeat. “The citizens of Mosul are very happy. The last finishing touches need to be completed, but we can open the mosque for Ramadan prayers,” says engineer Omar Taqa, responsible of the restoration project under Unesco.“We are proud to have worked on this project, which is the largest Unesco project in the world, with $50m implemented. For the official opening and inauguration of the Great Mosque, arrangements are being made to hold a ceremony with the Iraqi prime minister.” Last June, during their work, five large IS bombs were found hidden in the site, which postponedefforts for some days.View image in fullscreenThe Baytuna (‘Our House’) association in the Old City of Mosul.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverHuda, who lives next to the mosque, is originally from Baghdad and moved to Mosul with her husband after being displaced in a Christian neighbourhood in Erbil. “I’m a Christian, the only one living in the old houses for now,” she says. “Before the Daesh occupation, many more Christians were inhabiting the old city. I have two children and my husband is working on the al-Nuri mosque renovation. I feel at home here.”Father Raed, a local priest, told theObserverthat, even though the large majority of Christians haven’t resettled in Mosul, they come to the city daily from Erbil or nearby Christian-majority cities such as Qaraqosh for employment or to attend the church.Yamama Saleh, a civil engineer employed by the UN agency, has also been involved in the reconstruction of the mosque. “It’s the landmark of Mosul. I used to see the minaret from my rooftop, so when it got destroyed, it was really sad. But after being involved in the rebuilding of the shaft, it has another meaning for me. Now we’re done, I will go back to the rooftop to take a picture from there.”Her colleague, Mustafa al-Zeewany, supervisor of the minaret works, is standing on top of the minaret. “The minaret is iconic,” he says. “All our workers here are feeling proud. We felt devastated when the minaret was blown up by IS in June 2017, and now we have the abilities and capabilities to redo it, using international and new techniques.”View image in fullscreenThe restoration of the Mosque of Prophet Younis.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverAl-Zeewany explains that new techniques were implemented because they allowed work to be done in a similar way to the time of the construction of the mosque and minaret in the 12th century. “It’s a great experience for all of us to know how our ancestors worked, especially in this kind of construction.”The colourful neighbourhood in front of the old houses and the Great Mosque is called al-Manqusha. It’s where young people gather because of the cultural associations and cafes in the area.Saker Ma’an, founder of Baytuna (“Our house”) association, based in an old, imposing two-storey house, says: “In 2017, after the battle against Daesh, being here felt like living in the desert. We cleaned the neighbourhood of the rubble with our bare hands, we found corpses and unexploded bombs, then we finally managed to restore this traditional house and make it a cafe and office for our activities.”Ma’an recalls that some locals told him “you will not last”. In the beginning, the cafe hosted no more than two people a week. “We now have dozens coming every day,” he says. “Especially the new generation: they came back to a destroyed city, not having any sense of belonging to the old city. But our association is working together with youth, to make them aware of their cultural heritage. Mosul really needed this place.”View image in fullscreenRestoration work at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverMa’an remarks that the new generation doesn’t know the archaeological sites of the Nineveh province of Mosul, such as the old Assyrian city of Nimrod, 30km south of Mosul, badly damaged by the terrorist group, like many others.Layla Salih, an archaeologist responsible for the Bashiqa district and head of the reconstruction team of Al-Tahera church (Upper Monastery) project, is an expert on the archaeological sites of Nineveh, the Mosul province. “Many projects initiated after the liberation of the city were distributed between reconstruction, rescue or excavation work, and there are projects of documentation, archaeological and heritage survey, as well as the restoration of archaeological objects,” she says.Salih has become very well-known in the city after her discovery back in 2017 of a new archaeological site, the Assyrian Essarhadon’s Palace, in a tunnel under the al-Nabi Yunes shrine, dug by IS militants who were searching for antiquities to plunder and sell. “I expect that the renovation of Mosul will continue for years … and it is remarkable that the international community is so interested in the city for its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.”When IS was first driven out of Nineveh province in November 2016, Salih and a colleague, Faisal Jaber, reported on the destruction of Christian sites in the province. “We hope for more cultural projects that contribute to building peace, promoting stability and coexistence.”Explore more on these topicsIraqThe ObserverMosulIslamic StateHeritageMiddle East and north AfricaIslamUnesconewsShareReuse this content"

The largest, about 300 acres (162 hectares), was at Uwharrie national forest, about 50 miles (80km) east of Charlotte.In Polk county, North Carolina, officialsset upan emergency shelter as a brush fire encompassing 400 to 500 acres swept an areabetweenthe communities of Tryon and Saluda, about 40 miles south of Asheville.Asocial mediapost from Saluda’s fire department said a downed powerline on US highway 176 caused a brush fire that “rapidly spread up the mountain, threatening multiple structures”. Tryon’s and Saluda’s fire departments both led efforts to fight the blaze, with personnel from the North Carolina forest service as well as Polk, Henderson, Rutherford, Buncombe and Spartanburg counties providing assistance, the post said.The fire had zero containment as of Saturday night.In South Carolina, a brush fire was reported just west of Myrtle Beach in Carolina Forest.

Taxpayers and their accountants will need to be patient. I can already foresee my profession’s future frustration as they wait for guidance on a myriad of tax changes that will affect their clients. After barely recovering from all the disruptions caused by the pandemic, these layoffs are sure to set things back.But let’s not pretend this isn’t part of a wider trend.We all know the technology already exists to do much of the work that many IRS employees do now. My clients already use tech platforms to automate their accounts payment and payments. These systems – which leverage AI and optical character recognition – can very accurately (and affordably) scan, read and extract data from any document and ensure that the information is integrated into their accounting systems, where payments are automatically scheduled for review and disbursement. Considering that most of the tax returns filed are done in a similar fashion – and are mostly routine – it seems obvious that similar systems could be doing the same functions, which would probably eliminate a much greater percentage of workers who have already been chopped by the current administration.Look what technology is doing elsewhere. The financing platform Klarnaannounced last summerit was laying off about 2,000 workers – half of its workforce – as a result of its new AI customer service system that did their work instead.Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and other Wall Street firmsare building AI-based systems that are eliminating the need for investment analysts, wealth managers and other human workers. Google, Ikea, Salesforce and a number of other firms arerapidly replacingtheir workers with AI systems. Mark Zuckerberg haspublicly saidthat AI applications will be doing the work of mid-level engineers at Meta this year.About $80bn was allocated to the IRS under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to “modernize” tax collection. Government being the government, I’m sure that progress has so far been slower than it should be. But if you’re working at the IRS, or any federal agency, do you not see the writing on the wall? And if you’re working in customer service, marketing, accounting orany of these jobsin the private sector do you also not see what’s happening?The firing of federal workers is a preview of what’s about to happen in the corporate world. CEOs at numerous companies have already demonstrated that technology can do the work of people and replace them. And they’re just getting started. The tech companies like to say that AI will “work alongside” humans or “increase employees’ productivity” but that’s nonsense. Like the federal workers, many in the private sector are about to be replaced too.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessTrump administrationTax and spendingUS taxationArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

And I’m not naive, that’s why I’m here, at 40 years old, ­coaching Manchester United.”Rooney, working as a BBC pundit, said: “I think it’s a little naive to say they’re looking to win the Premier League because from where they are now, they’re a long way off that.”View image in fullscreenBernd Leno saves from Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee to win the penalty shootout.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersBruno Fernandes’s second‑half goal levelled out Calvin Bassey’s opener just before half‑time before Victor Lindelöf and Joshua ­Zirkzee had their spot-kicks saved by Bernd Leno, sending ­Fulham through.Amorim defended André Onana who, rather than quickly start an attack to search for a ­winner in normal time, ­dawdled over a 78th‑minute goal‑kick and then did the same later. “It is also frustration for André, he is trying to read the team,” Amorim said, before referencing themidweek defeat of Ipswichwhen Patrick Dorgu was sent off before half-time.“Our team was so tired, we played the last game with one less player in the second half and he is using that time to rest a bit for us to go for the second goal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He blamed his losing track of which round it was on the absence of ring girls. Most of all, he blamed himself for the flattest performance of a 13-year professional career.Gervonta Davis barely keeps title after disputed draw with Lamont Roach JrRead more“That was on me,” admitted Davis, when he finally arrived at 2.36am to field questions from a bleary-eyed room of reporters. “I ain’t pick it up when I was supposed to pick it up. I could’ve definitely done more. That’s my fault.”The result – a stalemate that some viewed as a fair outcome and others as a robbery – didn’t sit well with either fighter. Davis, whose 93.3% knockout percentage entering Saturday’s fight was the highest of any current world champion, was left frustrated by a bout where Roach refused to wilt.“Nobody likes a draw,” Davis said flatly. “From a guy that gets knockouts and things like that, but it’s cool. I feel like if we fight again, I could do more – and I should have done more.”Roach, a 9-1 underdog making his lightweight debut, was even less pleased.“I thought I won,” Roach said bluntly. “I thought I did enough to get the victory over a spectacular fighter. I told y’all from the beginning, man, that I got the skills to pay the motherfucking bills. And I’m just glad I got to show it.”For Roach, the fight was an opportunity to prove himself on the biggest stage of his career. He knew what he was up against and refused to back down.“People were talking like I was gonna be intimidated,” Roach said. “But I was ready to boogie. I knew I had a chin. I spar guys that are junior middleweights, middleweights, current champions. I knew I could take a punch.”View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis reacts to the judges’ decision.Photograph: Esther Lin/Premier Boxing ChampionsAnd Davis, one of the sport’s most feared punchers with concussive power in both hands, landed plenty of them. Roach took some of Davis’ best shots and remained upright, something few opponents can claim.“He got decent power,” Roach acknowledged. “I ain’t gonna say it’s exaggerated. I told you, I got a chin – I ain’t going like that. But I see why he knocks people out. Once I took his best shot, I was like, ‘Oh yeah, it’s time to roll.’”Davis, on the other hand, was taken aback by Roach’s durability.“He caught me with a good shot,” Davis admitted. “But there were times in there I was thinking, ‘Damn, this guy is super slow.’ Well, not super slow, but slow. And I could have taken advantage of those moments. I think I was boxing too much in the beginning instead of pressing the issue.”The most controversial moment of the night came in the ninth roundwhen Davis took a kneeimmediately after absorbing a left jab to the head. Roach and many observers felt it should have been ruled a knockdown.pic.twitter.com/XSXYxiXnpg— Clips (@MMACLIPS4U2)March 2, 2025“I ain’t the ref,” Roach said. “But the rules do state if he voluntarily takes a knee, that’s an automatic count. I wasn’t relying on that, though. I thought I was winning anyway. But if they counted it, I would have won a majority decision.”Davis claimed his vision was impaired due to the chemicals in his freshly braided hair. His co-trainer, Barry Hunter, described the substance as “ho juice”.“I ran water over it today, but I must not have done it enough,” Davis said. “My eyes were burning. I didn’t want to get caught while my eyes were burning – you can get knocked out like that. So I took the knee. I ain’t really know you could get the count for all that.”View image in fullscreenLamont Roach Jr, right, lands a punch on Gervonta Davis during Saturday’s title fight.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesDavis’s was also nearly done in by another critical mistake: he lost track of the rounds.“He thought it was round eight when it was round 12,” Hunter revealed. “He thought he still had time to pick it up, but there was no time left. We needed three rounds. I was calling out, ‘I need three, I need two,’ and he got those, but he forgot where he was at.”Davis went on to attribute the lapse in awareness to the absence of ring girls, the women who enter the ropes during breaks in the action carrying signs that display the number of the next round. He also hinted at some behind-the-scenes turmoil that compromised his preparations: “I don’t want to give it out but I need to work on myself for the most part.”For Roach, this was a coming-out party. For Davis, it was a wake-up call.“I definitely could’ve stopped him,” Davis said. “It’s on me. I let it go to the judges, and you can’t do that in boxing. I got to get back in the gym. It just put fuel to the fire. But it’s cool, it’s cool. The draw is OK. You live and you learn.”While Davis was loath to give Roach credit for pushing him to the brink, Hunter took a more magnanimous approach, pointing to the familiarity between the fighters from their shared history in the amateur ranks.“Lamont is a very skillful fighter,” Hunter said. “He’s from the area. In that DMV area, there’s a lot of talent and nobody wants to lose. So I knew it was going to be a hard fight. This been going on forever. We all help each other. They know our strengths, they know our secrets. We know theirs and vice versa. That is what made for a good fight. I thought it was a great, spirited fight, and I’d like to see it run back again.”He’s not alone there. Davis also said he’s intent on a rematch, albeit not immediately. But as far as Roach is concerned, the sooner the better.“I can’t wait to do it again,” he said. “I can’t wait to dance again.”Explore more on these topicsGervonta DavisBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Varas delivered his statement in both Spanish and English.“The chant that was heard tonight is unacceptable,” Varas said. “It’s outside of our value system. It doesn’t represent the players, myself or the club, and it certainly doesn’t represent San Diego or Baja California. It’s not a reflection of who we are. We’re a community full of love, of support, and we believe in the power of diversity.”Varas emphasized that the chant wasn’t made by San Diego FC’s main supporter section, the group known as La Frontera.MLS Year 30: A league at a philosophical crossroads as World Cups loomRead more“This came from more the general population in the seats, and it wasn’t everybody,” Varas said. “I understand that, but it was enough people, and I just want to make very clear that it has no place here. If they’re going to continue to come to the game and make that chant, it’s better that they don’t come here.”The one-word slur is typically made by fans while an opposing goalkeeper takes a goal kick, and it regularly occurs in both club soccer and national team soccer in Mexico. It’s also become a regrettable staple in the Mexican national team’s matches in the US.The Mexican national team has been fined repeatedly by Fifa for its fans’ behavior regarding the chant, which has forced both stoppages in play and the shortening of a match between El Tri and the U.S. national team in recent years. The chant nevertheless persists, and it seems likely to be an issue at North America’s 2026 World Cup, which will feature 13 matches in Mexico.“It’s totally against our values as a club, but also who we are as people,” Heaps said. “One of our core values is to be a good person, and I think that’s what we’ll continue to stand behind. It’s totally unacceptable, and obviously us as a club, we’ll make sure it does not continue into the future.”Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsShareReuse this content"

This is what I do,” Peake said on the New Zealand Open website. “I want to be here and just play golf. The story is what it is, but I’m just out here playing golf.”Peake had played amateur golf in his youth and, during his time in prison, was contacted by the coach Ritchie Smith to ask if he wanted to play competitively. “I always knew I could do it. It was just a matter of time when I was going to do it,” Peake added.Explore more on these topicsGolfAustralia sportThe OpennewsShareReuse this content"

It would rule out one of Newcastle’s leading players for the Wembley showpiece against Liverpool in two weeks’ time.Welbeck fires Brighton into quarter-finals as Gordon red hurts NewcastleRead moreGiven the nature of the offence the likelihood of a successful appeal seems remote but Howe said that course of action was possible following a review. “I don’t know quite what’s happened,” he said. “It’s very difficult to form an opinion. I haven’t seen a replay. But my original thought was it looked harsh.“I’m sure his intention wasn’t to harm anyone. I’ve only seen Anthony briefly and he was very disappointed. I don’t think he’s gone in with any malice or intention to do harm. I’ve got to see it properly before giving a big opinion. But that’s not a common sight with Anthony.“It’s very disappointing for Anthony and the team but the old cliche is that one person’s disappointment creates a big opportunity for someone else.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe and his players looks dejected after Newcastle’s defeat by Brighton.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersHowe was shattered by Danny Welbeck’s extra-time winner for Brighton after Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead from the penalty spot and Yankuba Minteh equalised.When Isak left the pitch accompanied by a physiotherapist three minutes from normal time, Newcastle fans feared a recurrence of the Sweden striker’s recent groin injury but Howe seemed reasonably relaxed. “I think it was cramp more than anything,” he said. “Just general tightness, not an injury. I don’t think there’s a big problem there. Fingers crossed, Alex is OK.”There was less positive news regarding Newcastle’s left-back Lewis Hall, who missed the tie with an ankle injury. That problem is sufficiently serious to have necessitated scans and their results have prompted an appointment with a specialist scheduled for this week. The sense is that Hall could well miss the Carabao Cup final while Sven Botman, who did not recover from a knee injury in time to be involved against Brighton, also appears touch and go for Wembley.“I’m desperately disappointed to have lost,” Howe said. “It was a tough contest, both teams gave everything, there were a lot of emotions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our character was impressive. We had to suffer at times but we stayed calm and always stayed together. In the end we found the right solution. I’m really pleased.”Hürzeler singled out Welbeck for special praise after the 34-year-old striker – a player two years his senior – stepped off the bench to seal the tie. “Danny’s special,” he said. “He’s a great leader, a great role model and a great player.”Brighton’s manager was certainly not about to pour cold water on suggestions that an unlikely England recall could beckon for Welbeck. “It might be possible,” he said. “But it’s not my decision, all I can say is I’m very happy to work with Danny.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupEddie HoweNewcastle UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

While Rodri has spoken optimistically of playing again this term, Guardiola has been far more cautious, suggesting it was not worth the risk even if possible.Manchester City survive early scare to beat Plymouth via O’Reilly’s doubleRead moreNow it seems, however, that Rodri’s progress has exceeded expectations and he could feature again before the end of the domestic season and play a part at the Club World Cup in the summer. Guardiola said: “The fans must know they are not the only ones who are excited. But one step at a time, we don’t have to make stupid decisions to come back weeks earlier and [suffer] steps back. It’s good but still he’s not close to coming back, I would say.“But he’s touching the ball and he was in the locker room making touches with the players. He feels confident, he feels more happy. I could not expect before [him to return] but maybe before the end of the season in the Premier League, maybe, it’s going to happen.”On the downside for City, defender Nathan Aké looks set for another layoff after being forced off at half-time in Saturday’s3-1 victory against Plymouthin the FA Cup fifth round.The Dutchman would join a casualty list that also includes fellow centre-backs John Stones and Manuel Akanji, both of whom are set to miss most of the rest of the season. Guardiola said: “We’ll do the test but he struggles sometimes with the foot, with the bone, probably. It’s been like this the whole season, unfortunately, for the central defenders. Hopefully the young ones can sustain it and help us until the end.”City moved into the FA Cup quarter-finals as they came from behind to see off Championship side Plymouth with two goals from teenager Nico O’Reilly and a strike from Kevin De Bruyne.Guardiola, however, is not happy with the characteristics of the balls being used in the cup, feeling they behave differently from those used in other elite events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Relegation could then be reinstated in the 2030-31 campaign, although that is not guaranteed.Geyse describes ‘lonely feeling’ amid Manchester United loan allegationsRead moreThe plans received a cautious welcome from the 23 WSL and Championship clubs at a presentation fronted by the WPLL chief executive, Nikki Doucet, at their quarterly shareholders’ meeting on Friday, which several sources who attended described as a positive meeting. The clubs are understood to have agreed to continue discussing and refining the proposals before putting the new structure to a vote at the end of the season.The removal of relegation is the most controversial element, but many clubs are equally concerned with the mechanism to be used to determine promotion from the Championship. A number of models are understood to be under consideration, with several clubs pushing for a playoff system.While any club seeking promotion will have to adhere to minimum-standards criteria, there is a strong feeling that on-field performance and league position should be the deciding factors, rather than adopting a licensing system similar to that brought in by rugby league to determine the composition of the Super League. In a less controversial change that is indicative of the desire for greater alignment in the women’s game, the Championship is set to be rebranded as WSL2 from next season.View image in fullscreenBristol City’s Amy Rodgers scores an own goal in the defeat by Manchester City that confirmed her side’s relegation from the WSL last year.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe WPLL declined to comment when contacted, but sources at the company now responsible for running the women’s game confirmed that the discussions will continue. The clubs will have the final say at their end‑of‑season meeting, but other stakeholders will also be consulted, including players, fans and the Football Association.For the proposals to go through, they will need a two-thirds majority of member clubs to vote in favour when they reconvene at the end of April.For alterations to be made to the relegation/promotion structure, at least eight clubs must vote in favour in each division, a balloting structure that gives a huge amount of influence to a handful of Championship clubs. If the clubs agree to the changes proposed by the WPLL they will then be passed to the FA board for ratification, although that will be a formality.The WPLL has had some notable successes since taking over from the FA last summer, securing in the past six months a £65m, five-year TV deal with Sky Sports and the BBC and a three-year title sponsorship for the WSLwith Barclays worth £45m, giving it confidence to pursue an expansionist agenda. The rationale behind the proposal is that removing the threat of relegation would encourage owners to invest and help to develop a more competitive WSL, which despite growing attendances is in danger of stagnating on the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlthough many clubs are fearful of losing out there is a recognition among the majority that structural changes could be beneficial.Chelsea have won the past five WSL titlesand are unbeaten this season under their new manager, Sonia Bompastor, while clubs promoted from the Championship have struggled to make an impact. Bristol City were relegated after one season in the WSL which brought just one win and six points, while Crystal Palace are on course to follow them in going straight back down this year, with a poor record of one win in their opening 14 games leading to the sacking of their manager Laura Kaminski.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace manager Laura Kaminski was sacked last week with her team, promoted to the WSL last season, looking likely to go straight back down.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEstablishing a fully professional top two divisions for the women’s game was one of the key recommendations of the government-commissioned Karen Carney review in 2023. Under the leadership of Doucet, the WPLL is determined to achieve that and is committed to an expansion of the entire pyramid.In a setback to that agenda, the Championship was reduced to 11 clubs this season when Reading voluntarily dropped down to the fifth tier after their owner, Dai Yongge, removed funding for the women’s operation as he attempts to sell the club. With an eye on future expansion the WPLL has had informal discussions with Premier League clubs whose women’s teams are outside the top two divisions, including Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth and Brentford, to establish their level of commitment.A club source who attended the meeting on Friday said: “The new leadership have shown they’re willing to do things differently and look at new ideas, which is encouraging. They have developed an interesting concept and [are] giving us all something to think about.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballWomen’s ChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

It was an absorbing contest in which a hard‑working Brighton side gave Chelsea more than just a scare.The result maintained Chelsea’s unbeaten season so far in all competitions under Sonia Bompastor, but they dropped points in the league for only the second time. Chelsea went early on, thanks to an emphatic volley from France’s Sandy Baltimore, but the Netherlands left wing-back Marisa Olislagers drew Brighton level in the 22nd minute from a tight angle.Women’s Super League: Brighton 2-2 Chelsea and more – as it happenedRead moreChelsea fell behind before half‑time when Vicky Losada scored for the hosts, but Lauren James scored from close range on the rebound with 29 minutes remaining to move Chelsea within just seven games of completing an entire Women’s Super League campaign unbeaten.Their lead at the top was cut to five points, however, because ­earlier on SundayManchester Unitedrecorded a seventh consecutive league win to keep the ­pressure on Chelsea. Marc Skinner’s ­second‑placed side were 2-0 winners at home against ­Leicesterafter scoring from their only shots on target.The France forward Melvine Malard raced on to Ella Toone’s precisely placed ball to run through one‑on-one and open the scoring in the 19th minute. Malard then turned provider for the left-winger Leah ­Galton to tuck in the second goal with her right foot in first-half stoppage time. Malard was making her second WSL start of the season, as the central striker in the absence of the in-form Norway forward Elisabeth Terland, who missed out with a wrist injury.The division’s bottom side,Crystal Palace, made a losing start to life under their new manager, Leif Smerud, asLiverpoolwere 1-0 winners in south London in their own first game under their interim mana­ger, Amber Whiteley.Jasmine Matthews’s 10th-minute effort was enough to give the Merseyside club all three points three days after Matt Beard’s departure was announced. Both clubs had lost their managers in the space of a remarkable 30 hours, with Palace sacking Laura Kaminski 14 league games after she had guided them to promotion. The former Norway interim manager Smerud was appointed as her replacement on Satur­day but his new side remain four points adrift at the foot of the table.Palace’s survival hopes will, though, have been boosted ever so slightly by another defeat for second-bottomAston Villa, who have lost three league games out of three since the arrival of their head coach, Natalia Arroyo. The Spaniard, who has tasted victory with Villa in the Women’s FA Cup, saw her side lose 2-0 at home againstEverton, who are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone and looking very likely to be playing WSL football next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Women’s Super League club are hoping to conclude a deal in the coming days before the start of the new NWSL season on 14 March.On Sunday Geyse described feeling “lonely” and being in agony after coming on as a late substitute in the 2-0 victory over Leicester in a post on social media.World’s first $1m women’s footballer Girma has Chelsea debut cut shortRead moreHer comments came on the same evening that Geyse’s agent alleged to the Telegraph that Manchester United had tried to loan Geyse to other clubs while she was at her brother’s funeral in January. A spokesperson forManchester United Womensaid: “We continue to support Geyse in her wellbeing, and are continuing to look for options which suit all parties.”Writing on Instagram, the Brazil forward did not specifically mention Manchester United but wrote: “Staying in a place where we don’t feel happy is an agonising and lonely feeling. Every day seems heavier, and the simple fact of being there becomes a burden. The environment, which should be welcoming, becomes a field of discomfort, where inner peace is difficult to find.”Geyse signed from Barcelona in 2023 and the 26-year-old has since scored two league goals for the club. In January she was granted compassionate leave by the club after her brother’s death. Manchester United are understood to have been working closely with Geyse to find the right solution for her at a difficult time, including options to move to be closer to her family.According to club sources, Manchester United would prefer not to lose Geyse at an important point in the season but the former Benfica and Corinthians forward is keen on a move to North America, so different options have been explored.On Sunday her agent Luís Filipe Silva said to the Telegraph: “As you know, her brother passed away, she is going through a very difficult time, it is a very difficult time psychologically and at Man United she is not having the best time.“The club has clearly shown that it does not count on Geyse, Man United tried to loan Geyse to a club in the USA, but the player has the right to decide about her future and the club she will play for.

She is on compassionate leave. In reality – I’ve said this and I think you know this – I don’t do [the] business side. The club is on the business side [for transfer negotiations].

But despite this achievement, the board feels the club has gone backwards and that a new manager is necessary to improve results.Proposed sale of Reading to Robert Platek faces conflict of interest concernsRead more“It cannot be overlooked that the currentLeague Onecampaign has clearly not progressed as anticipated,” said a club statement. “Home results and performances, in particular, have been disappointing and below the standard at which our supporters expect. For this reason, the board felt that it was time for a change.”Maloney was a popular former player for Wigan, spending four seasons at the club between 2011 and 2015, and managed Hibernian before he joined the Latics.Wigan’s assistant manager, Max Rogers, has also departed. Glenn Whelan will take interim charge supported by Graham Barrow and Frankie Bunn.

One ringside judge scored the bout 115-113 for Davis, while the other two had it level at 114-114, ensuring the three-weight champion from Baltimore remained without a loss. (The Guardianhad it 117-111 to Roach.)Gervonta Davis blames shock draw on hair product and missing ring girlsRead moreThe key talking point came in the ninth, when Davisvoluntarily took a kneenear his corner before leaning over the ropes, seemingly in search of assistance to clear an issue with his eye. Under the unified rules of boxing, a fighter touching the canvas with anything other than their feet is considered a knockdown, which would have cost Davis a point, if not an outright disqualification for the corner’s interference in the middle of a round. But referee Steve Willis simply allowed Davis to continue after a stern warning, a choice that almost certainly altered the outcome.A sold-out crowd of 19,250 at the Barclays Center made their feelings known when Davis later claimed his vision was impaired by grease from his hair.“It should have been a knockdown,” Roach said. “If that was knockdown, I win the fight. He’s saying grease got in his eye, but if he takes a knee and the ref starts counting, it should be a knockdown. It is what it is. I’m not banking on that knockdown to win. I just thought I pulled it out.”Granted special permission to retain his WBA title at 130lb while taking on Davis at 135, Roach came up just short in his bid to claim a world championship in a second weight class against an opponent who went off as a vertiginous 1-20 favorite.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis takes a knee in the middle of round nine during Saturday’s fight with Lamont Roach Jr.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images“I think I pulled it out in the last three rounds for sure,” Davis said. “I was catching him with some clean shots. I feel I was breaking him down as the rounds were going on, but he kept coming so I didn’t want to make mistakes and I kept it cautious.”From the opening bell Roach (25-1-2, 10 KO) showed no fear of the heavily favored champion. The 29-year-old from Washington DC remained composed in the opening stages, using his movement and counterpunching to keep his opponent from settling into a rhythm.Davis (30-0-1, 28 KO), a notoriously slow starter, spent the first few rounds probing, but his usual patience bordered on inactivity. Roach took advantage, landing sharp right hands and winning most of the early exchanges.Gervonta Davis retains WBA lightweight title on majority draw with Lamont Roach Jr – as it happenedRead moreThe familiarity between the old amateur rivals seemed to benefit Roach, who appeared more poised and comfortable even as Davis began to turn up the pressure in the middle rounds. A concussive right hand in the sixth signaled the champion’s awakening, but Roach took it well and stood his ground. In the seventh, he stunned Davis with a straight right, forcing the champion to tie up. The challenger, operating with supreme confidence, began dictating the pace and throwing more punches in combination, turning what many expected to be a one-sided fight into a tooth-and-nail scrap.The eighth round saw Roach land a massive counter right uppercut that briefly wobbled Davis, proving he could take the champ’s best shots and fire back. Then came the ninth when controversy struck. After absorbing a left hand from Roach that didn’t seem to land with full impact, Davis took a knee. Whether from fatigue, misplacement of his mouthpiece, or something else, it was a moment that should have been ruled a knockdown. Instead, the third man Willis issued only a warning, giving Davis a chance to recover. Fueled by frustration, Davis came out swinging, unleashing bombs, but Roach absorbed them and kept pressing forward.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis lands a left hand on the beltline of Lamont Roach Jr during Saturday’s fight.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesBy the championship rounds, Davis was lunging, throwing wild shots that Roach expertly countered. In the 11th, Roach sealed the round with a crisp counter right, outworking a visibly frustrated Davis. With three minutes left, Davis, known for his late-fight heroics, tried once more to bait Roach into a mistake. But Roach wouldn’t bite. He stuck to his game plan, making Davis miss and landing just enough to keep control.Both men called for a rematch in the immediate aftermath.“I want to run it back for sure,” said Roach, who landed 112 of 400 shots (28%) according to Compubox’s punch statistics, compared to 103 of 279 for Davis (36.9%). “I’ll be back on the grand stage again, where I belong.”Davis said that it was his own substandard performance that made the fight close rather than anything Roach brought to the table.“To be honest, I really made it competitive,” Davis said. “For sure, Lamont is a great fighter. He’s got the skills, he’s got punching power. It was a learned lesson. Shout-out to Lamont Roach and his whole team. Hopefully we can run it back.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingGervonta DavisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He quickly paid $100 to get on the waitlist. Filipos described himself as a “true Tesla fanboy”, and the Cybertruck would be the third vehicle he’d buy from the company.“When the Cybertruck came out, I watched the live event that night, and my wife was sitting there going, ‘No. No. No,’” said Filipos, who lives in a suburb of Philadelphia and whose last name is being withheld for fear of online retribution. Despite his wife’s disapproval, Filipos loved the bulky trapezoidal truck. “I was truly geeking out on it,” he said.Now things have changed. Filipos bought a Ford F-150 Lightning instead of the Cybertruck. And even though his other car, a Model 3 Performance Tesla, had just 30,000 miles on it, he traded it in for an Acura in February. Frustration had been building for Filipos over the last few months, but the turning point was whenMusk did back-to-back Nazi-style salutesduring an inauguration day celebration forDonald Trumpin January.“I didn’t want to be saddled with a vehicle that was associated with something so awful,” Filipos said. “When you own a vehicle like that, you are advertising for that company.”0:19Elon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – videoFilipos is part of agrowing movement of Tesla enthusiastswho are nowturning their backs on the company– selling their cars, dropping their leases and getting rid of Tesla stock. Many say that, while they still love the cars, they can’t square the CEO’s politics and behavior with their own. Musk is synonymous with Tesla; his vehicles, the Cybertruck in particular, are his calling cards.The Guardian spoke with three people who offloaded their Teslas in protest of Musk over the last month alone. All said they did so explicitly because of Musk’s salutes during the inauguration. Another person who spoke with the Guardian on the condition of anonymity started the process of dropping her lease on the day of the salute with an email toTeslareading: “Your boss is a Nazi.”Across Reddit, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, dozens of posts are popping up with people saying they are also getting rid of their Teslas. Some have added photos of themselves flipping the bird as a goodbye gesture to their cars. Still more have posted receipts to prove they sold their Tesla stock, saying they didn’t want to be associated with the Maga-happy CEO.When you own a vehicle like that, you are advertising for that companyOne celebrity Tesla owner has even taken part. Singer Sheryl Crowposted a videoof herselfto Instagramwaving goodbye to her vehicle as it was hauled off in a flatbed truck on Valentine’s Day. Her caption read: “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla.” She said she was donating the sale proceeds to National Public Radio because it was under threat by “President Musk”.Musk, the world’s richest man, has wholeheartedly thrown his weight behind Trump. Hedonated $288mto his presidential campaign and uses X, the social media platform he owns,as a megaphoneto tout the new administration’s policies and goad anyone who disagrees. This support has earned Musk a coveted position heading the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), which is tasked with cutting federal spending. His government overhaul has been so sweeping that Democrats such as Senate minority leaderChuck Schumerhavecalled Dogean “unelected shadow government”.Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment. The CEO responded to backlash over his fascist-style salutewith jokes and memeson X.‘No Swastikars’: protesters across the US lambast MuskThe Tesla selloffs come amidnationwide US protests against Muskand his actions.

She was initially thrilled with her Tesla, but like Filipos, things started to sour as she watched the Musk-Trump alliance grow. Then came Musk’s two-time inauguration day salute.“I was dead set on selling the car after that,” Rebekkah said, adding that her grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. Rebekkah said she called her mom and told her: “I’m selling the Nazi mobile.”The car was gone within days. “We haven’t looked back since,” Rebekkah said. She put down a deposit for a Rivian.Tesla owners sell at a loss: ‘I happily paid $4,000 to get rid of that car’Ron likewise decided to sell his Tesla after Musk’s salute, even though he knew he would lose money. He bought his first Tesla in 2020, a gray Model 3 Performance, and loved it from the minute he test drove it. In 2023, he upgraded to a Model Y. Ron said he hadn’t really followed Musk at the time, but last summer, he began to pay attention to the billionaire’s increasing involvement in politics.“I started looking back at some of the things he said, and I started to feel guilty that I didn’t do more research beforehand,” said Ron, who lives in Los Angeles and is only going by his first name for fear of retribution. “I always just assumed he was a quirky, nerdy, you know, space-first exploration technology type of guy.”As time progressed and Musk became more outspoken, Ron said he grew increasingly embarrassed to drive the Tesla. “I felt like I was driving a billboard that supported his endeavors and his thoughts and ideologies,” he said.In the beginning of February, Ron swapped out his Model Y, which only had 15,000 miles, for another electric vehicle, a Hyundai Ioniq. He still owed thousands of dollars on his Tesla. Online trading sites and dealerships were driving hard bargains and ultimately he lost $4,000.I felt like I was driving a billboard that supported his endeavors and his thoughts and ideologies“I guess you could say I happily paid $4,000 to get rid of that car,” Ron said. “That’s how much I disagree with his politics.”Tesla sales have plummeted over the last year. In California, the biggest US market for electric vehicles, they fell by 12%. And registrations for new Tesla vehicles fell by 11.6%, according to theCalifornia New Car Dealers Association, even as overall registrations for electric vehicles have grown in the state. Nationwide, the slump in Tesla sales marked the company’sfirst decline in how many cars it delivered to buyers annually. It’s unclear if the decrease can be fully attributed to Musk, since the electric vehicle market has seen increased competition over the past couple of years, especially out of China.In Europe, Tesla has taken aneven more severe hit. In January, sales fell by 12% in Britain, 38% in Norway and 63% in France,according to the New York Times. Sales in Germanyfell by 59%that month, coinciding with Musk’s outspokensupport forthe far-right alternative party AfD and with scolding Germans for focusing too much on “past guilt” for the Holocaust.Tesla stock flies, then plummetsIn spite of its poor sales and weak earnings reports, Tesla’s stock price soared in 2024 – likely boosted by Musk’s proximity to Trump and a regulatory outlook that’s friendlier than ever to the car maker. The day after the election alone, shares jumped 14%. But, as Musk has become increasingly involved in the day-to-day of the newadministration, that has changed, too. Since mid-December, Tesla’s stock has plunged 25%.Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’Read moreOn social media, people are encouraging others to sell their Tesla stock. Reddit has threads of people posting their share sales with headlines like, “Never normalize Nazis” and “This is my way of fighting Nazis and I’m damn proud.” Since inauguration day, there’s been a21% selloff of Tesla stock, according to ABC. Musk has lost more than $100bn from his personal fortune and the company’s valuation has now dipped below $1tn.Filipos is one of the people who sold his stock. He first bought 40 shares in 2020, not long after he joined the Cybertruck waitlist. Over the years, that number grew to 717 shares. He planned to keep holding, but when Musk endorsed Trump last summer, Filipos changed his mind.“I had to come to a reckoning,” he said. Filipos didn’t see Trump as standing up for the environment, and Musk’s endorsement “was against what I perceived as the original vision for Tesla”.In late July, Filipos sold all of his shares – even though he knew he probably would have made more money if he held. Now, he and his wife have gotten rid of their Model 3 too and are free of all things Tesla.“We feel lighter not being saddled with a symbol of hate,” he said."

Without any firm moves from Trump to show his support for the crypto sector, nervousness looks set to continue.”Bitcoin has recovered from sharp monthly falls in the past. In June 2022, its worst month, it dropped 41% from $31,700 to $18,700, before jumping by 26% in July.Crypto prices rallied on Sunday after Trump announced the names of three cryptocurrencies that would be included in a new US strategic reserve.Trump said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano), which triggered a rise in all three. Trump added that bitcoin and ethereum would be “at the heart of the Reserve”, driving bitcoin back up to $94,000.Explore more on these topicsBitcoinCryptocurrenciesCurrenciesUS marketsGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheAmazon pagefor Alexander C Karp and Nicholas W Zamiska’s new book,The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West, also lists: a “workbook” containing “key takeaways” from the volume; a second volume on how the Karp/Zamiska tome “can help you navigate life”; and a third offering another “workbook” comprising a “Master Plan for Navigating Digital Age and the Future of Society”. It is conceivable that these parasitical works were written by humans, but I wouldn’t bet on it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Mr Karp, the lead author of the big book, is an interesting guy. He has a BA in philosophy from an American liberal arts college, a law degree from Stanford and a PhD in neoclassical social theory from Goethe University in Frankfurt. So he’s not your average geek. And yet he’s an object of obsessive interest to people both inside and outside the tech industry. Why? Because in 2003 he – together with Peter Thiel and three others – founded a secretive tech company called Palantir. And some of the initial funding came from the investment arm of – wait for it – the CIA!The name comes frompalantíri, the “seeing stones” in the Tolkien fantasies. It makes sense because the USP of Palantir is its machine-learning technology – which is apparently very good at seeing patterns in, and extracting predictions from, oceans of data. The company was founded because at the time all theSilicon Valleytech companies either disapproved of government, or were staffed by engineers who were adamantly opposed to working for the US military. This created an opening that Karp and his colleagues astutely exploited to build a company which is simultaneously appears to be booming (current market capitalisation: $200bn), while also being regarded by critics of the industry as the spawn of the devil.Those critics will disdainfully read the book as a kind of extended tender for public sector contracts. Civil servants contemplating employing Palantir may be interested in the description of the approach its employees adopt when working in a client’s organisation. Interestingly, it’s an approach borrowed from a Toyota executive, Taiichi Ohno, as a way of getting to the root cause of a problem occurring in some part of an organisation’s operations. It’s called the “Five Whys”: ask why a problem occurred, and then ask why four more times.View image in fullscreenA still from the short newsreel film Atomic Power, in which Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard recreate the day in 1939 they drafted a letter to President Roosevelt warning him that work on the atom bomb was imperative.Photograph: Leo Szilard Papers. MSS 32. Special Collections & Archives, UC San Diego Library“Why did an essential update to an enterprise software platform not ship by a Friday deadline?” the co-authors write. “Because the team had only two days to review the draft code. Why did they only have two days to review? Because it had lost six software engineers in the budget review cycle late last year. Why did its budget decrease? Because the head of the group had shifted priorities elsewhere at the request of another group lead. Why was the request made to shift priorities? Because a new compensation model had been rolled out incentivising growth in certain areas. Why were certain areas selected at the expanse of others? Because of an ongoing feud at the company between two senior executives.” You get the idea. It’s not rocket science. Or AI, come to that. Maybe Keir Starmer should try it out. And it’ll be cheaper than employing McKinsey.Silicon Valley was built on a technological foundation that was laid by the state, and yet its beneficiaries have nothing but contempt for governmentBut I digress. The argument of the book is suffused with indignation at what Karp sees as the arrogance and small-mindedness of Silicon Valley, which has collected the greatest concentration of engineering skill the world has ever seen – and then deployed it to create consumer toys and diversions that make tech founders insanely rich rather than using that talent to create technologies that would buttress the national welfare and security of the United States. What’s particularly galling to him is the fact that the wealth of Silicon Valley was built on a technological foundation that was laid – and paid for – by the state, and yet its beneficiaries appear to have nothing but contempt for government. They have prioritised consumer gratification and their own wealth-creation over everything else.“The grandiose rallying cry of generations of founders in Silicon Valley was simply to build,” write Karp and Zamiska. “Few asked what needed to be built, and why. For decades, we have taken this focus – and indeed obsession in many cases – by the technology industry on consumer culture for granted, hardly questioning the direction, and we think misdirection, of capital and talent to the trivial and ephemeral. Much of what passes for innovation today, of what attracts enormous amounts of talent and funding, will be forgotten before the decade is out.”Underpinning much of the book’s lamentations are two enduring themes. The first is a kind of nostalgic longing for the wartime and postwar collaboration between the American state and the scientists and engineers which made the US a technological colossus. For Karp, as for many other thinkers like him (including the UK’s own Dominic Cummings), the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb looks like a lost nirvana.The second theme is a chronicle of what the authors call “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”: the abandonment of belief, the agnosticism of technology, the “assumption that the correctness of one’s views from a moral or ethical perspective precludes the need to engage with the more distasteful and fundamental question of relative power with respect to a geopolitical opponent, and specifically which party has a superior ability to inflict harm on the other. The wishfulness of the current moment and many of its political leaders may in the end be their undoing.” This is the “soft belief” of the book’s subtitle, and it’s why this section of the book sometimes evokes echoes of the conservative philosopherAllan Bloomon song.View image in fullscreenPalantir co-founder and author Alex Karp.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThere’s a lot of hegemonic anxiety in Karp’s musings. For him, American primacy is the key to the survival of the civilisational values that he reveres. He’s also a disciple of the Nobel laureate economistThomas Schelling, and shares his view that “to be coercive, violence has to be anticipated… The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy – vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.”But the power to hurt is a prerogative of “hard” (ie military) power, and Karp seems particularly incensed by what he sees as the “precious” reservations of Google employees about the possibility that their technologies might be put into military hands. (It may also have been one of the motivations for the founding of Palantir.) His irritation seems unduly harsh to me. All of these employees (and their parents and grandparents) have lived through an era in which the idea that the United States might again be involved in an all-out war seemed as preposterous as the idea that their inventions might be used in battle. In that sense, the west has been on an 80-year-long holiday from history, from which Putin has rudely awoken us.The lesson that Karp and his co-author draw from all this is that “a more intimate collaboration between the state and the technology sector, and a closer alignment of vision between the two, will be required if the United States and its allies are to maintain an advantage that will constrain our adversaries over the longer term. The preconditions for a durable peace often come only from a credible threat of war.” Or, to put it more dramatically, maybe the arrival of AI makes this our “Oppenheimer moment”.For some critics, the reconceptualisation of AI as technology for national security will seem like an unmitigated disasterIn the summer of 1939, Albert Einstein and Leo Szilardsent a letterto President Roosevelt, urging him to explore the construction of an atomic bomb – and quickly. The rapid advances in the technology, the two scientists wrote, “seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the administration”, as well as as a sustained partnership with “permanent contact maintained between the administration” and physicists.In that historical context, maybe the arrival of this book is timely. For those of us who have for decades been critical of tech companies, and who thought that the future for liberal democracy required that they be brought under democratic control, it’s an unsettling moment. If the AI technology that giant corporations largely own and control becomes an essential part of the national security apparatus, what happens to our concerns about fairness, diversity, equity and justice as these technologies are also deployed in “civilian” life? For some campaigners and critics, the reconceptualisation of AI as essential technology for national security will seem like an unmitigated disaster – Big Brother on steroids, with resistance being futile, if not criminal.On the other hand, some of the west’s adversaries (Russia, China) are already using this technology against us, and we urgently need to tool up to address the threat. When these thoughts were put to Mr Karp by aNew York Timesreporter, he replied: “I think a lot of the issues come back to: ‘Are we in a dangerous world where you have to invest in these things?’ And I come down to yes. All these technologies are dangerous. The only solution to stop AI abuse is to use AI.” Hobson’s choice, in other words.The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the Westis published by The Bodley Head (£25).

Tens of thousands of federal employees at other agencies are also losing their jobs.The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April. Millions of returns will need to be processed. Refunds will be due. Questions will need to be answered. But that’s not all.In just a few short months, Congress will be debating – and probably passing – new rules that will significantly change our tax laws. Republicans are pushing to either extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most of which expire at the end of this year. There are proposals to eliminate taxes on tips, social security income and overtime wages. The Democrats will be fighting some of these provisions, arguing their effect on future deficits. Regardless, there will be an enormous amount of change to rules, forms and guidance that will need to be made by the IRS.Consumers don’t have a debt problem. The US government does | Gene MarksRead moreThe remaining employees at the agency, already demoralized and now seriously short-staffed, will now be asked to handle this looming workload. Taxpayers and their accountants will need to be patient. I can already foresee my profession’s future frustration as they wait for guidance on a myriad of tax changes that will affect their clients. After barely recovering from all the disruptions caused by the pandemic, these layoffs are sure to set things back.But let’s not pretend this isn’t part of a wider trend.We all know the technology already exists to do much of the work that many IRS employees do now. My clients already use tech platforms to automate their accounts payment and payments. These systems – which leverage AI and optical character recognition – can very accurately (and affordably) scan, read and extract data from any document and ensure that the information is integrated into their accounting systems, where payments are automatically scheduled for review and disbursement. Considering that most of the tax returns filed are done in a similar fashion – and are mostly routine – it seems obvious that similar systems could be doing the same functions, which would probably eliminate a much greater percentage of workers who have already been chopped by the current administration.Look what technology is doing elsewhere. The financing platform Klarnaannounced last summerit was laying off about 2,000 workers – half of its workforce – as a result of its new AI customer service system that did their work instead.Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and other Wall Street firmsare building AI-based systems that are eliminating the need for investment analysts, wealth managers and other human workers. Google, Ikea, Salesforce and a number of other firms arerapidly replacingtheir workers with AI systems. Mark Zuckerberg haspublicly saidthat AI applications will be doing the work of mid-level engineers at Meta this year.About $80bn was allocated to the IRS under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to “modernize” tax collection. Government being the government, I’m sure that progress has so far been slower than it should be. But if you’re working at the IRS, or any federal agency, do you not see the writing on the wall? And if you’re working in customer service, marketing, accounting orany of these jobsin the private sector do you also not see what’s happening?The firing of federal workers is a preview of what’s about to happen in the corporate world. CEOs at numerous companies have already demonstrated that technology can do the work of people and replace them. And they’re just getting started. The tech companies like to say that AI will “work alongside” humans or “increase employees’ productivity” but that’s nonsense. Like the federal workers, many in the private sector are about to be replaced too.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessTrump administrationTax and spendingUS taxationArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Given that the air fryer market is so crowded, it’s worth seeking out the best style for your needs – whether that’s for the simple pleasures of homemade chips or to really shake up your meals.At a glanceBest air fryer overall:Tefal Dual Easy Fry XXL EY942BG0£149.99 at AmazonBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryer£89.99 at LakelandBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryer£179.99 at John LewisBest air fryergrill:ProCook air fryer health grill£179 at ProCookBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryer£214.21 at AmazonWhy you should trust meWhile air fryers have made the transition from novelty to must-have in recent years, there’s been one in my kitchen for well over a decade, and it’s in daily use. I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 45).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 5kg of potatoes.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 5kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips are scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The nine machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£200 at Argos£149.99 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneeringActifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-yearrepairabilitycommitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp. Onion rings emerged beautifully browned, they were the best of the lot.It’s a shame that …most buttons are icons – my pet hate – making it a challenge to program without the instructions to hand.Size:38.5 x 45.8cm x 33 (WDH)Capacity:11 litresPower draw:1.154kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, chicken, vegetables, fish, dessert, dehydration and manualThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade meals, tried and testedRead moreBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that …its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size:27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresPower draw:0.674kWh = 16p an hourDishwasher safe:no, hand-wash onlyPrograms:fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£179.99 at John Lewis£189.99 at CurrysOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well-built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that …if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size:49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity:9 litresPower draw:0.79kWh = 19p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatBest air fryer grill:ProCook Air Fryer Health GrillView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£179 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s Air Fryer Health Grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that …I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue and you will need to use it.Size:40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity:4.5 litresPower draw:0.83kWh = 20p an hourDishwasher safe:no (basket and pot)Programs:air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£249.99 at Argos£219.99 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that …its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size:28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity:9.5 litresPower draw:1.049kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe:yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms:air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The temperature range – 80-200C – should cover most tasks and the presets include bacon for a lower-fat fry-up.On test, chips were good overall – mostly crispy, with a few pale/soft pieces that escaped the heat – while onion rings were brown and crunchy in a mere 12 minutes.

Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the 8-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size:36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH);capacity:8 litres;power draw:0.912kWh = 22p an hour;dishwasher safe:no;programs:manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesInstant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£136 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonBest for:confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos. I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen, and it was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because …the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size:31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity:8.5 litres;power draw:1.187kWh = 29p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatRussell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£125 at Argos£67.95 at AmazonBest for:small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size:37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH);capacity:5.5 litres;power draw:0.550kWh = 13p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry,bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.The best pans for every type of cooking – chosen by chefsRead moreFor those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust non-stick coatings will make degreasing easier.How do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and non-stick coatings containing PFAS/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of non-stick (which may use PFAS as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen attemperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of non-stick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature when oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.Rachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she is much less successful at repacking.

Starmer channelled the giants of British history (everyone we’re not embarrassed of; basically, Winston Churchill) on Sunday. He said we were at a “crossroads in history”.He used the phrase “we are gathered here today”, which I suppose was literally true, as they were, but also had a strange church-y overtone, as if he were trying to borrow the actual authority of God, and he explicitly yoked together the peace and security ofUkrainewith that of everyone – all of Europe, but also “us” – Justin Trudeau was there, so presumably Canada’s, too. Pictures of him hugging Zelenskyy ahead were almost tear-jerkingly sincere.He was then asked by journalists following Saturday afternoon’s statement – who came at the question from many directions – whether he considered the US to be inside or outside hisplan for a durable peace, and he was trenchant.“Europe and the US have to stand together and that position must be strong”; “I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally”. It was an absolute head-scratcher – because the US does not seek a sovereign Ukraine, safe in perpetuity from Russian aggression.Donald Trump and JD Vance showed the world what they think of this war on Friday, and they are in an opposite world, Zelenskyy is the one risking the lives of ordinary people, and the war is for him to end – while giving up his nation’s mineral rights to the US and thanking them for the privilege.That meeting in the White House was easily the most gruesome display of bullying and manipulation that televised geopolitics has ever put on. Soin what worlddoes the guy you just hugged get to walk away proud and sovereign, with US backing? In what conceivable world is Trump on the same team as these assembled leaders?Starmer was under considerable pressure in his short speech, which we have to hope was just because history had its eyes on him, and not because he’s overwhelmed by the weight of his own contradictions.Words were mangled into non-words, “step” became “stet”, “presume” got funked with “preserve”. And yet, his lawyerly clarity remained. He had five points, they were all different, they all made sense, he said them all in the right order.“We will keep the military aid flowing … to strengthen Ukraine now,” he said, adding that the £2.2bn loan to Zelenskyy would come from frozen Russian assets, and the £1.6bn of UK export finance would be channelled straight back into the UK economy via the air defence industry in Belfast.“Any lasting peace,” he continued, “must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be at the table”. It’s a simple and defensible point, but it also goes head to head against Trump, who has argued throughout that all it’ll take for a peace deal is him, Putin, a copy of The Art of the Deal and a box of cigars.Third, “in the event of a peace deal, we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities”, Starmer said, which, again, sounds fair enough and yet at the same time runs directly counter to any of the noises coming out of Washington.Fourth, he will assemble “acoalition of the willing, to defend a deal in Ukraine. Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back.” Here’s the kicker: “this effort must have US backing”.Well, OK, but who on earth would assume that backing? And what would it cost? Do we have to watch Zelenskyy get beaten up live on air, for the US to fall in with the crowd but still feel like it won?Peter Mandelson had told ABC News earlier that “President Zelenskyy [must give] his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine,” and seriously, all we can do in the face of that counter-messaging is hope that Mandelson’s forgotten he’s the UK’s diplomat to the US and thinks he’s just a guy on a podcast.Starmer’s fifth point was a bit muddled: “Leaders must meet again very soon. We are at a crossroads in history today. This is not a moment for more talk.” What are they going to do at the meeting, if not talk more? Never mind. Don’t pick holes. We need to believe there’s a grand plan behind all this, because the alternative is just horrendous.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

Countries pushing global tax reform at the UN will be watching as US demands for subjugation play out in plain sight. Hisday-one threatto punish nations taxing US firms is an all-out attack on global fiscal cooperation. If multilateralism in taxation was already on shaky ground, Mr Trump’s return could bury it for good.Under discussion is a new UN tax convention that may permit states to tax economic activity where it actually occurs, rather than allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) said last year that nations lose$492bn(£390bn) annually due to corporate tax abuse. The global south bears the greatest losses, which undermine public services like health and education. If enacted, the convention would create a legally binding framework requiring multinationals to pay tax where they employ staff and do real business – not where they stash profits. This would replace the outdated arm’s-length principle with unitary taxation, ensuring fair profit allocation. It would mean an end toAmazon,GoogleandAppleputting billions through lower-tax jurisdictions while extracting wealth from higher-tax ones.Before Mr Trump’s election, about half of global tax losses were facilitated by theeight nationsopposed to a UN tax convention – Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and the US. Yet opposition takes two forms: constructive and destructive. When negotiations for the UN framework convention on international tax cooperation beganlast month, all participants committed to the convention’s principles except Mr Trump’s delegate, who walked out in defiance, calling on others to follow. The expected exodus never came. Washington was left isolated. Mr Trump’s “America first” became “America alone”.But the US still has tremendous clout. As TJN’s newreport, The International Tax Consequences of President Trump, highlights, talks among 120-plus nations on taxing cross-border digital services – led by the US-dominated OECD – are grinding towards a showdown. Mr Trump’s tariff threats againstCanadaand the EU are warning shots, aimed at countries daring to raise tax rates on multinationals, especially US ones. This fight isn’t just about taxation; it’s about sovereignty. Mr Trump’s administration is trying to strong-arm nations into preserving a system that shields corporate profits from fair taxation. The difference now is that the world is pushing back.For decades, the US has had an unofficial veto over global tax rules, using its heft to shape – and thenreject– OECD-led proposals. But this approach is no longer sustainable. The growing coalition behind the UN tax convention shows that many governments prefer to chart their own course. Mr Trump’s return forces a stark choice: stick with a broken system that fuels tax abuse or push forward without the US. Any attempt to tax multinationals fairly will face American retaliation, but clinging to the OECD’s US-dominated framework is a dead end.A united front at the UN is needed to forge a global tax system not dictated by Washington’s whims. Thecluster munitions conventionsucceeded without US involvement, proving international norms can shift without it. The world doesn’t need US approval to fix global taxation. It needs the will to move forward together.Explore more on these topicsCorporate governanceOpinionUnited NationsTax avoidanceTechnology sectorDonald TrumpOECDGlobal economyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

His short-termist game plan will cost America dearSun 2 Mar 2025 10.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 16.23 ESTShareThe White House meetingbetween Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyywill be remembered as far more than just a diplomatic disaster. It marked the end of international politics as we know it, and was a harbinger for the sunset of Pax Americana. Zelenskyy, reeling from the meeting,arrived in London on Saturdayto attend a defence summit with other European leaders. Thanks to Trump’s performance, those leaders now have clarity on where the US government stands on the war in Ukraine – and, more broadly, on how US foreign policy may look in future.It is hard to overstate what a departure this is. Since the end of the second world war, the US has been theprimary architect and guarantorof an intricate network of global institutions anchored by Nato, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. Together, these partners crafted a security umbrella whose benefits far outweighed its expense. It produced political stability and provided US and European companies with unrivalled access to markets and resources. The US was all too happy to share the gains of this order with its allies, and, to a lesser extent, with its rivals and adversaries.True, the USreaped the greatest benefits: it set the terms of trade and projected its influence on to the globe. But the order was inclusive, since its institutions were designed to deliver benefits that everyone could enjoy, even if access was unequal. It had plenty of critics, drawing envy and ire from adversaries such as Russia and China, whose leaders regularly grumbled about unfairness and demanded their seats at the table. Over time, the US and its allies grew accustomed to the status quo, comfortable and complacent to the point of letting their military stockpilesdeplete and degrade. By contrast,RussiaandChinacultivated networks of propagandists, corrupt officials and saboteurs, who shared a common goal: to identify the west’s weak points, amplify political instability and undermine western unity.They could hardly have hoped for a more vulnerable and divided west. From the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, to rising nationalist movements acrossEuropeand, most consequentially, Trump’s ascendance to the presidency, the last decade has been marked by events that have weakened transatlantic ties and eroded security arrangements. Trump’s criticisms of Nato and other longstanding alliances have helped to convince American voters that US allies are more of a burden than a benefit.A humiliation at the White House and what does it tell us? Trump would make a colony of my country | Andrey KurkovRead moreIn this context, the meeting with Zelenskyy, when Trump told the Ukrainian leader “make a deal or we’re out”, was not entirely surprising. The president has consistently framed foreign policy in transactional terms, prioritising one-time payouts over the long-term dividends that arise from international stability and cooperation. His approach reflects a total indifference to defending democratic principles or countering authoritarian influence, whether in Russia or elsewhere. His foreign policy is defined by unpredictability, quick gains and self-interest.Trump is also uninterested in confronting aggressors. In fact, he’s not averse to trading other’s security for his own gain. As Zelenskyy pointed out, the US is shielded from Russian aggression by an ocean, a luxury that Europe does not enjoy. Trump appears content to let Europe manage its own security, ignoring the reality that European stability is intrinsically linked to US economic and strategic interests. In his willingness to work with Vladimir Putin, he is ignoring the fact that the existing international system has overwhelmingly benefited the US. Ironically, the world order that Putin advocates for – one shaped by imperial spheres of influence, rather than collective security – would come at significant costs to the US.In his exchange with Zelenskyy, Trump invoked a metaphor of a card game. Yet his own cards are spread across the table. He will probably use the fallout from the meeting to convince domestic Republican holdouts to halt sendingdecommission-ready military equipmentto Ukraine and lift sanctions against Russia. He and Putin will probably extol the dubious economic opportunitiesthat America could seize in Russia, trading secure and lucrative European markets for the higher risk, smaller Russian market, which his Maga-aligned elites may embrace.Europe can either stand back, accept this new reality, and hope that Russia’s imperial ambitions stop atUkraine. Or it can adapt to a world without US support, where it has to take a more assertive role in its own defence and strategic decision-making. Historically, cohesion across the continent has been difficult to achieve. The stakes are now higher than ever.For Ukraine, the path forward remains difficult. This meeting did not cost it US support – that was set in motion by Trump’s re-election. Zelenskyy was right not to be bullied into a ceasefire on Russia-dictated terms. Without security guarantees, such an agreement would be disastrous for Ukraine. Trump would claim an easy diplomatic victory, using it as a justification to cut military aid and lift sanctions on Russia. But as Zelenskyy noted, Putin has a history of breaking ceasefires. With sanctions eased, Russia would simply rearm and prepare for another offensive against a weakened Ukraine. By resisting Trump’s pressure, Zelenskyy may still face the same outcome, but at least Ukraine remains unshackled from a one-sided truce.Even without US support, Ukraine is in a stronger position militarily and diplomatically than it was in early 2022. As dire as things look at the moment, international politics is rarely static, and Trump himself is known for reversals. It remains possible thathe could again shift course, signing the minerals deal with Ukraine and mending relations with European allies. There is always a small chance that the meeting was just an embarrassing and emotional mishap. But with its sovereignty at stake, chance is not something Ukraine can count on.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

But our body clocks are all different – and ignoring them takes a tollSun 2 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTShareIn a week, we will spring forward to daylight saving time. Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy all recently shared their desires to end the biannual flip-flopping of our clocks. The Republican senator Rick Scott recently reintroduced theSunshine Protection Act, which would lock our clocks on daylight saving time. Scientists, meanwhile, urge us to adopt the opposite:permanent standard time.The DST debate is heating back up. But all this chatter is, once again, largely missing the point–an omission particularly glaring for an administration that claims to be seeking greater efficiency.The time displayed on our walls and wrists carries only the meaning we attach. If we want to rein in our nation’s spending, if we want to make America healthy again, then we should turn attention to our inner clocks. For starters, we should nudge companies and schools to relax or revise rigid schedules – rather than, for example, reverting to pre-pandemic in-office requirements.We are all born with inner clocks, better known as our circadian rhythms. These biological drumbeats sync with our planet’s patterns to drive our bodies to do the right things at the right times: fall asleep, digest food, and fight pathogens, to name a few vital functions. But our internal timekeepers don’t all tick the same. Your 7am might be my 2pm.A lot of money could be saved, and illness avoided, if we dropped the traditional one-schedule-fits-allThe upshot: a lot of money could be saved, and illness avoided, if we dropped the traditional one-schedule-fits-all that gives the clock-on-the-wall so much sway.More circadian-friendly schedules mean more people can wake, work, and learn in closer alignment with their inner clocks. They get more sleep. They take fewer sick days. This is especially true for night owls, whose circadian rhythms are most incongruous with the long-established early bird-biased schedules. Sleep loss alone is estimated to cost the US economy upwards of$400bn a yeardue to absenteeism, accidents, and reduced productivity. That’s around 1.5% of the country’s GDP – and far more than the approximately 1% of the GDP that pays the salaries of all federal civilian employees, whose jobs have been under attack.Impacts on sleep and sickness aside, it also pays to allow people to work or study during their peak hours of productivity and performance. Alertness, cognition, and learning fluctuate across the day. So does our ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and act morally. Risks of costly lapses of attention and reaction ride these waves, too. And, again, the ebbs and flows are unique for every person.A business’s market value is now about90 percent intangible– tied to assets like IP, relationships and reputation. In other words, companies are investing primarily in employees’ brainpower. A few have begun optimizing those investments by taking advantage of our biological diversity.Magne Skram Hegerberg, secretary general for the Norwegian Association of Lawyers, told me he uses a curious tool to utilize peak brainpower: an army of plush frogs. During their personal power hours, employees will place one of these brightly colored plush animals on their desk or the door to their office. This signals others to “frog off”. Starting times among his workers also now range from 6.30am to 2.30pm. Meetings are held midday, when early birds and night owls overlap. After making these changes, he said, productivity in some areas doubled and, more broadly, innovation, creativity, and problem-solving improved.View image in fullscreen‘More circadian-friendly schedules mean more people can wake, work, and learn in closer alignment with their inner clocks.’Photograph: Juice Images/AlamyCamilla Kring, founder of the Copenhagen-based B-Society, has advised Hegerberg and other companies including medical giants Medtronic and AbbVie. She has watched job satisfaction rise and sick days plummet. Her end goal, she said, is to create a “new time architecture” that helps everyone better live by their inner clocks. And that includes B-persons, her term for night owls, an often-stigmatized club to which Trump and Musk belong. “You are born with this rhythm,” said Kring. “It’s not something you choose.”Among the few good things to come out of the Covid pandemic was a glimpse into a more sun-synced life. Some studies found that people, especially night owls,tended to get more sleepand maintain healthier circadian rhythms as school and work schedules were relaxed. But much of that greater flexibility is now being reversed. The Trump administration has issued an executive order toend remote workfor federal workers, a mandate pushed by Musk, who enforces strict in-office policies at Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Amazon, too, made the move in January. JP Morgan and Dell plan to do the same in March. Emerging policies that restrictwherean employee works also tend to definewhen. And that can result in wasted resources.Hours of fun: what’s the point of daylight savings?Read moreSure, there are benefits to having employees in the office. It can reduce loneliness, encourage teamwork, and inspire creativity. But workplaces can still foster flexibility. Business leaders can spread out work hours and schedule meetings, lunches, and other events for the middle of the day. Those gatherings would probably be more pleasant and productive, anyway, with fewer sleep-deprived and circadian-disrupted participants. And who wouldn’t also appreciate a means to stem therecent rebound in traffic congestion?Some secondary schools in Europe similarly offer students the choice of earlier or later electives while concentrating core subjects to midday periods. And a growing number of middle and high schools in the US have delayed their first bell, acknowledging that traditionally early start times are biologically backwards. Rhythms don’t just vary between us; they also change within us, drifting significantly later during adolescence. But overall progress remains slow.The consequences of permanent DST would disproportionately impact teens and other night owls. When required to arrive at a strict time for work or school, DST effectively forces them up an hour earlier than their already-late preference. The later sunrise also means they get less of the morning light that their rhythms rely on to avoid drifting even later. Some early birds, on the other hand, might appreciate the additional evening light with DST. It can nudge their bodies to postpone pumping out melatonin and let them enjoy a night out with friends.But rather than arguing over whether or how to lock the clock, a more efficient use of regulatory resources is to steer society away from strict schedules, as well as non-essential shift work and illogically drawn time zones. (For the record, there is still one wrong answer: Permanent DST would steal an hour of morning light and tack it onto the evening, further blurring the day-night contrast our inner clocks crave.)Neither Trump nor Musk appear conscious of the value and vulnerability of their inner clocks. Trump regularly posts on social media in the early hours of the morning; Musk wore sunglasses throughout last week’s CPAC conference. Still, it is in their power to help themselves and the American people better live and work with–rather than against–their inner clocks, regardless of whether the clock on the wall reads DST or standard time. It is a matter of efficiency that they would be foolish not to embrace.Lynne Peeples is a science journalist and author of the new bookThe Inner Clock: Living in Sync with Our Circadian RhythmsExplore more on these topicsSleepOpinionHealthTrump administrationHealth & wellbeingUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Tens of thousands of federal employees at other agencies are also losing their jobs.The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April. Millions of returns will need to be processed. Refunds will be due. Questions will need to be answered. But that’s not all.In just a few short months, Congress will be debating – and probably passing – new rules that will significantly change our tax laws. Republicans are pushing to either extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most of which expire at the end of this year. There are proposals to eliminate taxes on tips, social security income and overtime wages. The Democrats will be fighting some of these provisions, arguing their effect on future deficits. Regardless, there will be an enormous amount of change to rules, forms and guidance that will need to be made by the IRS.Consumers don’t have a debt problem. The US government does | Gene MarksRead moreThe remaining employees at the agency, already demoralized and now seriously short-staffed, will now be asked to handle this looming workload. Taxpayers and their accountants will need to be patient. I can already foresee my profession’s future frustration as they wait for guidance on a myriad of tax changes that will affect their clients. After barely recovering from all the disruptions caused by the pandemic, these layoffs are sure to set things back.But let’s not pretend this isn’t part of a wider trend.We all know the technology already exists to do much of the work that many IRS employees do now. My clients already use tech platforms to automate their accounts payment and payments. These systems – which leverage AI and optical character recognition – can very accurately (and affordably) scan, read and extract data from any document and ensure that the information is integrated into their accounting systems, where payments are automatically scheduled for review and disbursement. Considering that most of the tax returns filed are done in a similar fashion – and are mostly routine – it seems obvious that similar systems could be doing the same functions, which would probably eliminate a much greater percentage of workers who have already been chopped by the current administration.Look what technology is doing elsewhere. The financing platform Klarnaannounced last summerit was laying off about 2,000 workers – half of its workforce – as a result of its new AI customer service system that did their work instead.Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and other Wall Street firmsare building AI-based systems that are eliminating the need for investment analysts, wealth managers and other human workers. Google, Ikea, Salesforce and a number of other firms arerapidly replacingtheir workers with AI systems. Mark Zuckerberg haspublicly saidthat AI applications will be doing the work of mid-level engineers at Meta this year.About $80bn was allocated to the IRS under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to “modernize” tax collection. Government being the government, I’m sure that progress has so far been slower than it should be. But if you’re working at the IRS, or any federal agency, do you not see the writing on the wall? And if you’re working in customer service, marketing, accounting orany of these jobsin the private sector do you also not see what’s happening?The firing of federal workers is a preview of what’s about to happen in the corporate world. CEOs at numerous companies have already demonstrated that technology can do the work of people and replace them. And they’re just getting started. The tech companies like to say that AI will “work alongside” humans or “increase employees’ productivity” but that’s nonsense. Like the federal workers, many in the private sector are about to be replaced too.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessTrump administrationTax and spendingUS taxationArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Do they indicate concrete plans, are they designed to provoke, or do they have no meaning, like the gurgles and gasps that can inadvertently escape from a decomposing corpse? My job here is to try to anticipate if anything Trump says or does is likely to be of any lasting significance and to satirise it accordingly, in the small window of time allowed, for money. And it isn’t getting any easier. Yes, Ukraine is suffering, but I am the real victim here.For example, last Saturday Trump opined: “We were the richest… think of this, from 1870 to 1913… because we collected tariffs… We had so much wealth. Wouldn’t it be nice today? Of course, now, we give it away to transgender this, to transgender that. Everybody gets a transgender operation. It’s wonderful. We give it away to crazy things. But in those days, it was different. It was a different world. It was a different country.”Would Trump’s notion of the damage caused to long-term American prosperity by transgender this surgery, and also to a lesser extent by transgender that surgery, gain any traction, and thus be deserving of the barbs of my quill, or would it be politely ignored as another crazy corpse bleat?I’m not a historian, though I do follow Prof Janina Ramirez on social media, but surely part of US prosperity in the period Trump describes was built on the proceeding two and a half centuries’ use of free labour in the form of enslaved people stolen in their millions from Africa, their descendants finally getting the vote in 1965, when the Beatles’ Help! was top of the UK charts; and also on the natural wealth appropriated from the country’s Indigenous people, who were systematically ethnically cleansed and robbed of land and resources for which, conveniently, they hadn’t really developed a notion of ownership as Europeans understood it. Have these beads, this whiskey and these smallpox-infected blankets. Thanks for all the pelts. Enjoy your dancing.To be fair to Trump, studies of Irish history, for instance, show that though three significant famines between 1740 and 1879 did affect the country economically, the main dent in the nation’s finances was caused by the Roman Catholic church’s liberal attitude to notions of gender, and by its demand that the Irish state fund transgender this surgery, and moreover transgender that surgery, for any Irish citizen requiring it, or for anyone who had even been just a little bit curious. I’m joking of course. Trump’s idiotic Trump Theory ofTransgenderEconomics ™ ® didn’t stick and I wisely elected to ignore it in last week’s column. But Trump continues to be a tough call.I’m checking live news updates to see if the Trump Theory of Transgender Economics has resurfaced in a more vociferous formFor 13 years, I filed these columns on Thursday mornings, hoping that I’d have anticipated any news developments that might destabilise my so-called “jokes” between the deadline and Sunday’s publication. But last year I asked if I could start filing on Tuesdays, as various special-interest, right-leaning groups kept nibbling at the grey area between actionable exaggeration and exaggeration for comic effect, and I wanted to give theObserver’slegal team time to protect me from imprisonment, having already experienced the spleen-dissolving stress of being co-targeted by Britain’s final, and failed, attempt at a blasphemy prosecution in 2005.But now I’m back to filing at the last possible moment, 10am on Thursday. It’s 9.15 now and I’m cross-checking the paragraphs that follow this sentence with live news updates to see if, perhaps, last week’s Trump Theory of Transgender Economics ™ ® has suddenly resurfaced in a more vociferous form. Trump has turbocharged the news cycle and I’m a tortoise trying to spray-paint the side of speeding trains with clever satirical caricatures, James Gillray on a folding scooter. Those long wavy lines all along the carriages were supposed to be a drawing of Trump hanging a tea towel marked Ukraine out to dry. Or something.It’s impossible. On Wednesday afternoon, the world briefly combusted when it appeared Trump’s Truth Social feed had shared an impossibly offensiveAI-generated film of his vision for Gaza’s future. An image of a soldier pointing a gun at a Palestinian kid’s head dissolves into liberated children running towards a Dubai-style resort, where Elon Musk eats hummus on a beach, bellydancers bellydance, a toddler tugs at a giant golden balloon of Trump’s head, Trump apparently dances with a semi-naked woman, Musk and some infants dance in falling money, a gaudy Trump casino full of small golden effigies of Trump emerges from the ruins, Musk eats some more hummus but indoors this time, a giant golden statue of Trump bestrides a street scene and, finally, Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu drink cocktails by a pool in just their pants as a rapper raps: “Trump Gaza number one!”Theories erupted. Was Trump trying to bait the world? Or had Israel made the film to goad Hamas into breaking the ceasefire? Had Hamas made it to goad the outraged into attacking the US? But looking closely, it seems Trump is uncomfortably overfamiliar with the woman he is dancing with and the beach bellydancers are in fact men with beards in translucent dresses, in a country where transgender this and transgender that is yet to do the economic damage it has in the US.Had someone made an all too plausible satire of Trump’s ethics and aesthetics that Trump himself had taken as an endorsement and shared online? Or did Trump know it was a parody and have so little regard for the human suffering in the region, he shared it anyway? It’s impossible to know. All that is certain is that, asSteve Bannon advised, the zone is flooded with shit. And every week, it gets harder to wade through.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTransgenderGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuElon MuskSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

However, those Republicans who elected him should have been mindful of the old Chinese proverb: be careful what you wish for.A classic example has been provided recently in the columns of theNew York Times. On 17 December, the rightwing columnist Bret Stephenswrote: “Here’s a thought for Trump’s perennial critics, including us on the right. Let’s enter the new year … by dropping the lurid comparisons to past dictators, by not sounding paranoid about … the ever-looming end of democracy.”However, by 20 February, with Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk already giving full vent to their planned revolution,Mr Stephens was quoting what Joseph Goebbelswrote in April 1928, about five years before Hitler’s ascent to power: “We enter the Reichstag to arm ourselves with democracy’s weapons … If democracy is foolish … enough … that is its problem. It does not concern us. Any way of bringing about the revolution is fine by us.”There is plenty to be concerned about, on far too many fronts. The US has to live with the monster it elected; but, unfortunately, so do the rest of us, not least the millions in less fortunate countries who have been dependent on US foreign aid, and the more developed economies that are rightly concerned about the potential impact of Trump’s devotion to tariff wars.Obviously, it was fear of what Trump was up to, or not,in Ukraineand over the future of Nato that dominated the reporting onKeir Starmer’s much-trumpeted visit to the White Houselast week. But Starmer had another important concern: the hope that all that stuff about the “special relationship”, Trump’s putative respect for the British monarchy – and, I kid you not, Trump reportedly likes it that Starmer is a “Sir” – would qualify the UK to stay “on the bench” with regard to tariff wars.It is difficult to believe that Starmer’s hasty announcement of a long-overdue increase in the defence budget was not motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with Trump; similarly, it was no doubt assumed that financing this via a dramatic reduction in the UK’s foreign aid budget would impress a president who was in the process of doing the same with US aid.I fear there was another motive too, aimed more at the UK electorate. This disappointing government, which came in expecting to enjoy two terms, is running scared of the Reform party, so many of whose supporters do not like foreign aid or immigration.Yet, with the economy struggling, and so many employers experiencing a Brexit-induced dearth of EU workers – not necessarily permanent immigrants, but those who used to in effect commute across the Channel to do construction work – the chancellor’s growth programme is in trouble.So are her fiscal rules. It is on account of an absurd desire to adhere to this self-inflicted burden that the prime minister and chancellor decided to finance an increase in thedefence budget by raiding the aid budget. We are told they are afraid of the reaction of the bond markets, but I am prepared to bet that participants in the bond markets would understand the need for a bond issue designated to defence at this time of Putin-induced crisis.The EU’s existence is, among other things, now justified in order not to be screwed by a bizarre alliance of Trump and PutinWhich brings us to the joint achievement of Putin and Trump in bringing European nations closer together. One hoped that this would be the final nail in the Brexit coffin, but Trump is still trying to divide and rule. With due respect – difficult! – to Trump and his accomplices, Vance and Musk, the EU was not “formed to screw the United States”: its existence, once championed by US politicians of a different class to Trump, is now justified in order not to be screwed by a bizarre alliance of Trump and Putin.But despite the obvious need for the UK to acknowledge its need for membership of the EU, Trump is still trying to put a spanner in the works. He talked on Friday about a special trade deal with the UK, but this idea has been examined before and such a deal would not be to the UK’s advantage.Trump, like his dubious friend Putin, was in favour of Brexit, and the game he is playing is not in the UK’s best interests. Unfortunately, in Starmer’s desperation to avoid the25% tariffswith which Trump is threatening the EU, Starmer is playing into Trump’s hands.Meanwhile, I have lost count of the number of people I meet who had great hopes of this Labour government but who are now thoroughly disillusioned. Red lines over the EU; cuts in winter fuel payments; the refusal to raise the two-child limit on benefits; and now mean-minded and damaging cuts to overseas aid.O tempora,o mores…Explore more on these topicsEconomicsWilliam Keegan's in my viewKeir StarmerDonald TrumpDefence policyVladimir PutinBrexitEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

The town centre is full of imposing 19th- and 20th-century buildings that were created in a spirit of pride and optimism but have long since lain empty; local people talk about the shadow of the old iron and coal industries, and the fact that precious little ever came along to take their place. On the Monday afternoon I visited, the most forlorn sight was a huge mural of a local rugby crowd, lovingly sprayed on the exterior of a former discount store: atwo-dimensional throng, put there to “inspire people to remember what Pontypool could be like as a thriving community”.Despite appearances, asignificant watershed momenthappened here recently. Like so much of south Wales, Pontypool has long been seen as a loyal Labour redoubt – but on 13 February, Reform UK gained its first Welsh councillor in abyelection for the local borough council. The victor was a former army major who won 457 votes to Labour’s anaemic 259, and claimed, when greeting his win, that there would now be no Labour councillors, MPs or members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, who could confidently think they represented safe seats. Reform UK is set on banishing the lingering idea of south Wales as a staunch socialist heartland: Nigel Farage intends to make the 2026 devolved Welsh elections “by far our biggest priority”.In London, meanwhile, the mounting threat from Farage and his comrades and Donald Trump’s return to the White House havetriggered a striking political shift, led by Keir Starmer’s chief of staff and supposed strategic super-brain Morgan McSweeney. The government’s stance on immigration has turned sour and punitive: witness thoseawful videosof illegal migrants being deported, and the Kafkaesque new move topermanently denyUK citizenship to anyone who travelled here via a supposedly illegal and dangerous route. Amid support for a third Heathrow runway and talk of new drilling in the North Sea, the greenery that was once held up to be Starmer’s core idea is withering away. Cuts of up to£5bn in sickness and disability benefitsloom.This was the grim context for Starmer’s announcements of drastic reductions in foreign aid to open the way to an increase in defence spending. While charities andNGOs expressed alarmat what the move would mean for everything from violence against women and girls to the impacts of a heating planet, he said that making the decision had been “extremely difficult and painful”, but it was a choice that snugly fitted the reinvention project known in some circles asStarmer’s “Reformation” (think about it). Such a move, after all, has long been demanded by the rightwing press. Most damningly of all, it is of a piece with Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s summary shut-down of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), and all the chaos it has spawned (inher resignation letterlast week, the outgoing international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, pointedly said that the cut was “already being portrayed as following in President Trump’s slipstream of cuts to USAid.”)A lot of the government’s surrounding mood music fits the same picture. One of McSweeney’s sources of continuing inspiration is the Blue Labour peer Maurice Glasman: the only Labour parliamentarian invited to Trump’s inauguration, and a recent guest on the podcast hosted by the former Trump insider Steve Bannon, the man who recently denied that he had enlivened his speech at the CPAC convention in Washington DCwith one of those Hitler salutes. Glasman level-headedlyassured his hostthat “progressives” are his political enemy, “because they actually despise faith, they despise family, they despise love, and they don’t even want you to enjoy sexual intercourse with your wife”. He alsoreckonsthat “the only place to build a house now is on the left side of Maga Square”, wherever that is. Among the other intellectual freewheelers who have recently beentalking to senior Starmeraides is Munira Mirza, the former adviser to Boris Johnson, who is said to be helping with “a sort of critique of liberal multiculturalism”.While such conversations happen behind the scenes, other signs of the leadership’s new faux-populist mindset are out in the open. Josh Simons is a newly elected Labour MP and trusted ally of McSweeney who I have heard being tipped for quick promotion to the cabinet. During the second parliamentary reading of the government’s border security, asylum and immigration bill, he gave aquite remarkable speechbased on his admiration for the ancient Greeks – and specifically their categorisation of migrants as “metics”. Such people, he told the Commons, “were subject to different rules; who joined the city was controlled and the bar was set high for who could become a citizen and vote”. If metics broke Athenian laws, moreover, “they were expelled from the city, and sometimes thrust into the blazing Greek sun.”Lest anyone think he was getting a bit carried away, this was merely an object lesson in the principle whereby “people who govern themselves control who they are and who becomes a member of the demos”. He had been elected by his constituents in Greater Manchester on the basis that he would not rest “until we gripped our borders, restored control, and … brought down the number of legal migrants entering this country each year – and I meant it”. And he finished with a pithy authoritarian flourish: “We in theLabourparty believe in control and order. The opposition do not.”With or without the classical references, will this kind of talk pull back the people Labour fears it is losing? In Pontypool, it wasn’t hard to find people who were very taken with Farage and his party.One man told methat Farage “gets on with Trump, and we’ve got to stay on their side”. Another said that successive governments had “let too many people across the border … It just seems to me that they’re eating up all the work and taking everything.” What everyone said was woven through with an equally familiar theme: the constant grind of rising food bills and energy prices, and life in a place that had turned into a “ghost town”.On the road in south Wales: why is Reform UK on the rise?Read moreThere are two possible approaches to all that. In keeping with their support for Ukraine, the PM and his colleagues are now set on attacking Reform UKover its soft stances on Russia, but there is a queasy contradiction at work: in other areas of policy, the Starmer/McSweeney Reformation looks set to deepen. That will not just bend centre-left politics into impossible shapes, but comes with a profound danger: that it is already making Farage and his ilk sound not just as if they control a huge chunk of the national conversation, but are preferable to whatever semi-skimmed version of populist politics Labour comes up with. Worse still, it is sure to alienate voters who may prefer the Greens, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, or the Lib Dems: over the weekend, the UCL Policy Labpublished pollingshowing that over 40% of 2024 Labour supporters say that if safe routes for refugees were prevented or climate action slowed down, it would stop them voting Labour next time.Or there might be a plan B. Labour politicians might try their best to rebuild towns such as Pontypool, answer their call for esteem and security, and help them acquire the things whose scarcity informs all those conversations about outsiders: jobs and homes, chiefly, along with the sense that they are no less valued than people who live in more affluent places. They could do that while holding on to what is left of the party’s liberal values, and finally coming up with a convincing response to an increasingly urgent question. If the world is being wrecked by bigoted, climate-denying authoritarians, is leaning into their politics really any kind of answer?John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourWalesKeir StarmerWelsh politicsReform UKNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

People usually seek therapy because they wish to alter some aspect of their lives. Yet, at its core, therapeutic change often begins with reaching an acceptance that suffering, distress and imperfections are an inherent part of the human experience.While this tension is at the heart of all therapies, there are two forms of therapy that explicitly target this interplay.Dialectical behaviour therapy teaches patients to radically accept themselves and their circumstances while simultaneously striving for meaningful change.James thought he was just stressed – then the panic attacks started | Diane YoungRead moreIn acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), clients are encouraged to embrace their thoughts and emotions rather than trying to ignore, change or eliminate them. ACT, which has resonance with Stoic philosophy and Buddhism, focuses on the paradox that it is through accepting our inner experiences that we gain the freedom to commit to actions that are aligned with our values and goals.Patients are sometimes alarmed by the notion of radical acceptance, fearing it means they are “giving up” or signalling approval of difficult situations and feelings. However, acknowledging reality does not imply passivity or resignation – we must actively move towards acceptance of our circumstances and ourselves, letting go of judgment and resistance.Often our attempts at transformation have been hampered by an inability to recognise our reality and our inevitable limits, and it is only once we have truly accepted these that we are able to strive for feasible changes. Thus, acceptance and change are not opposites, but rather complementary forces.Stress is a primary cause of procrastination, which is essentially a problem of self-regulationToo often in life we throw our energy and focus at what we cannot change (eg the behaviour of others) and don’t commit fully enough to what is in our control (eg our own choices and responses). Sometimes it takes time, discussion and reflection to reach this point of wisdom. Therapists too must hold this wisdom in mind, finding a delicate balance between validating their patients’ distress, empathically helping them to move towards acceptance, and finally shifting to a focus on what change might be within their control.In an age of self-help literature, productivity culture and self-optimisation, there is often a relentless pressure to improve. While striving for improvement can be valuable, the danger lies in being wracked with shame and self-criticism when we fail to achieve some unattainable standard that is misaligned with our reality.Self-compassion is an important antidote to this.Accepting reality as it is, including distressing situations and uncomfortable feelings, is an inevitable struggle. This suffering is exacerbated when we berate and judge ourselves for our struggles. This self-critical narrative is also counterproductive, making it less likely that that things will improve than if we respond to ourselves with kindness and understanding.An example of this can be found in the case of Anna*, a 27-year-old primary school teacher who came to see me because she was battling with procrastination in the context of havingattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD). As I got to know Anna, it became clear she was a gifted teacher but that she became easily overwhelmed by the administrative burden of her job. She was behind on her marking and was constantly missing deadlines for report writing.As the end of each term approached, and the administrative deadlines loomed more potently, Anna would find herself caught in a cycle of good intentions, well-made plans, paralysing procrastination, a failure to stick to her plan, and a lot of shame and self-recrimination for her “laziness” and “inefficiency”.Anna’s anxiety would skyrocket, and her mood would drop as she increasingly perceived herself as an incompetent failure. When I encouraged Anna to take a more compassionate approach to her struggles, she would argue this would only encourage more “laziness” and she needed to be hard on herself to change her behaviour.I was able to challenge Anna’s beliefs in this regard by pointing her in the direction ofresearchindicating that self-compassion reduces procrastination rather than encouraging it. Stress is a primary cause of procrastination, which is essentially a problem of self-regulation, and self-critical narratives increase stress and induce further procrastination. By contrast, self-compassion has been found to decrease stress and boost motivation, optimism and self-worth, resulting in more positive outcomes.‘A diagnosis can sweep away guilt’: the delicate art of treating ADHDRead moreOver time, Anna was able to more readily accept the impact of ADHD without labelling this as a character flaw and to treat herself with more self-compassion when she found herself in the grip of procrastination. This allowed her to soothe and regulate her emotions, which in turn enabled her to recommit to the tasks she was struggling to complete.She also allowed herself to ask for help and support when she was feeling overwhelmed and this in turn made the tasks feel more manageable and approachable. Through her commitment to therapy Anna was increasingly able to find a synergy between acceptance and change that both reduced her personal suffering and increased her capacity to cope with her job.* Anna is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar caseswe see. The therapist is a fictional amalgam of both authors.Prof Gill Straker and Dr Jacqui Winship are co-authors ofThe Talking Cure.

But big emitters seemingly haven’t had the memoSun 2 Mar 2025 03.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 09.14 ESTShareThat I fully expect to be dead by the time the UK achieves net zero is, of course, no reason to dodge interim advice from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the UK’s official climate authority. Its latestreport to governmentis of particular interest to the public, in arguing that a third of the emissions cuts required to achieve net zero by 2050 will have to come from consumers themselves.Unless we – individual households – accept heat pumps and electric cars and deterrents to flying and less meat (skipping two kebabs per week), the CCC explains, the target cannot be met. And assuming the introduction of a selective news blackout that reduces public awareness of UK plutocrats, celebrities and influencers with colossal carbon footprints, such a behavioural transformation may not be impossible.In the more likely event of continued media indulgence for the UK’s highest-status emitters, sustained general cooperation may be more optimistic.For as long as, say, Carrie Johnson sees no reason not to disseminateimages of her family’s strenuous holidaymakingin distant places – last month Saudi Arabia – the much less frequent flyers being urged by the CCC to adapt to net zero will be exposed to powerfully contradictory, even compliance-crushing, messages. Including, in this case, that a “dream” stay in Saudi’s St Regis Red Sea resort – accessible only by seaplane or speedboat – is compatible with a reputation as an environmentalist. Just a few years ago, Mrs Johnson was extremely exercised by single-use straws. Saudi Arabia’s actions to combat climate change, to which it is exceptionally exposed, wererecently rated as “critically insufficient”.View image in fullscreenCarrie Johnson, once the scourge of plastic straws, boasts of ‘dream’ holidays in distant lands.Photograph: Michaela Rehle/ReutersTo be fair, as Mrs Johnson pointed out, her husband was already in Saudi Arabia for what the couple call “work”. As in, he wastelling an audiencethat Saudi Arabia is “a global leader in women’s empowerment and innovation”.The CCC sets great store in its new report on comments from a small citizens’ panel that heard from experts before itappraised different household interventionsand their funding. According to its chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, these 26 people “were often ahead of even our advice on some of the things they were willing to consider”. Without seeing the presentation, we can’t know if it featured fairness, the carbon footprint from transport by the richest 0.1% that is22 times that of a low earner, or if funding options featured the proposal of many prominent campaigners,notably Oxfam, that disproportionate emissions be reflected in policy or taxes. After a different panel, the UK-based Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change, convened a few years ago, Prof Peter Newell of Sussex University said: “We have got to cut overconsumption and the best place to start is overconsumption among the polluting elites who contribute by far more than their share of carbon emissions.”The CCC records the panel’s interest in subsidies to help poorer consumers survive the transition to heat pumps, but there is no sign that the 26 people considered ways of making the wealthiest emitters pay, let alone of making them, too, adapt. Aside from noting the panel’s support for a frequent flyer levy (as an alternative to generally increased fares), the resulting CCC advice seems to perpetuate the latitude long extended to the drivers of SUVs and the owners of multiple homes, in suggesting that the behaviour of a polluting elite is situated somewhere beyond targeted penalties.Even so, as public understanding develops, more flamboyant polluters in this group may want to think harder about showing off their car collections, yachts, multiple homes, commutes to Dubai. As generous as it is of the Beckhams, for instance, to share photos of their family’s scattered houses, travels and£16m yacht, success in educating the public (on which the CCC proposals depend) on carbon emissions could raise the chances of this gifted family being perceived, above all, as creators of carbon emissions. Already, although it has yet to trouble his career in underpants, David Beckham has been identified asone of the highest-emission environmentalistson the planet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The majority of respondents in a four-country studyoverestimated the carbon footprint of the poorest 50%, and underestimated those of the richest 10% and 1%. One of its authors, Dr Ramit Debnath, commented: “These countries are very different, but we found the rich are pretty similar no matter where you go, and their concerns are different to the rest of society. There’s a huge contrast between billionaires travelling by private jet while the rest of us drink with soggy paper straws: one of those activities has a big impact on an individual carbon footprint, and one doesn’t.”Considering how little it attempts to challenge this agreeable state of affairs, the CCC’s report surely deserved a warmer reception than it received from the high net worth community and its allies. At theTelegraph, for example, we find that, far from exulting that the advisers did not get it into their heads to extract funding from the worst polluting households,its correspondents are incensedby “everything Labour’s net zero advisers want you to give up” and the prospect of state subsidies for low-income families switching to low-carbon technologies.Still less has there been recognition that for affluent high-emitters the early adoption of new low-carbon technology would put them among the first to benefit from reduced running costs that form part of the CCC’s plan. The panel, we learn, “viewed it as inevitable and acceptable thathigher-income households often make bigger savings overall”.Meanwhile, their SUVs are safe, they don’t eat kebabs or use trains, and carbon emissions remain, for the foreseeable, the most negligible of deterrents to a “dream” family trip to Saudi Arabia.

Clark is not a political theorist but a historian of art. A Marxist, much of his work explores the interface of art and politics with considerable nuance and depth, illuminating artists from Bosch to Pollock, Rembrandt to Lowry.The final section of the collection includes more straightforwardly political writing. For a Left with No Future is the weakest of the essays, whether on art or politics. It is nevertheless perhaps also the most significant, for not only does it provide a new perspective to much of Clark’s other work, it also addresses a particularly keen question for our time – how should the left deal with its failure? In its pessimism and world-weariness, it seems to speak to many today.The title,Those Passions, is taken from Shelley’s sonnetOzymandias, an exploration of the inevitability of oblivion, a description of a half-buried statue of a once-great pharaoh of a once-great empire: “Round the decay / Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away.” That desolate landscape is, for Clark, a metaphor for modern civilisation, made barren by consumerism and the reduction of all to a “spectacle”. Even more, it is a poetic description of the terrain in which the left finds itself. “If the past decade or so is not proof that there are no circumstances capable of reviving the left in its 20th-century form,” he asks, “then what would proof be like?”It is a pessimism both exaggerated and understated. It is exaggerated because Clark finds the roots of the left’s defeat in human nature, in “the human propensity to violence” and an inevitable “hankering after evil” woven into our very being. He finds it also in modernity itself, which has created such atomised, unthinking, obedient individuals that they are “no longer material for a society”, a phrase borrowed from Nietzsche. These are not new ideas; but to root the left’s demise in human nature and the nature of modernity is to deny the possibility of any resurrection.Indeed, Clark urges the left to abandon utopian ideas and embrace in its stead a “tragic sense of life”. The tragic vision, which sustains a conservative view of the world, sees in the flawed and limited character of humans a warning against grand social change, insisting that faith, tradition and hierarchy are necessary guardrails against barbarism, a way of acknowledging, in the words of Leszek Kołakowski, the Polish Marxist turned Christian philosopher, “life as inevitable defeat”.Yet, for all this, Clark’s despair is also understated, because today’s political malaise is more profound than he envisions – or is commonly acknowledged. It is not just the left that has imploded. Liberal and conservative traditions, too, have become drained of much of their life-force.These three main ideologies of modernity have clearly been antagonistic to each other. Yet they have also possessed a symbiotic relationship, one most clearly seen in the link between liberalism and radicalism.What we call liberal norms – democracy, equality, freedom of speech and association, the right of nations to self-determination and so on – became social realities largely through the efforts of radical movements and working-class organisations, and often in the face of ferocious opposition from liberal elites that sought to limit the scope of these norms, denying the majority of society, indeed the majority of the world, basic democratic rights.Apart from the Quakers, none of the radical groups that throng the English revolution survived into history. But their ideas didIt was through the struggles of the dispossessed – of slaves to emancipate themselves, of colonial subjects confronting imperial rule, of the working class organising to improve their lives, of women claiming the right to vote – that liberal norms were made universal rather than remaining the exclusive property of a privileged few.The erosion of that radical universalist tradition has befuddled the left, detaching it from liberal traditions, and from class politics, and leaving the remnants more authoritarian and identitarian. It has also discombobulated liberalism.Without the buttress of radicalism, liberals themselves have become more illiberal, whether on free speech or democracy, and less willing to address issues of social inequality or working-class needs.Conservatism emerged initially as voicing hostility to modernity, and yet adapted to the new world so efficiently that it become a dominant governing force in a world painted largely in liberal tones. Over time, not liberalism but working-class and socialist movements became conservatism’s principal enemy, an antagonistic relationship that helped define what conservatives wished to conserve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe erosion of the radical tradition has brought confusion to conservatism, too. Conservatives today seem to understand how to rip up the existing order, but have little conception about what should replace it, or what they wish to conserve. And so, we arrive in an age in which it is not just that the left has lost but that the main political traditions of modernity have all become exhausted.The book we need to make sense of these darkening times, Clark suggests, is Christopher Hill’sThe Experience of Defeat.First published in 1984, it is an exploration by the pre-eminent historian of 17th-century radicalism of the writings of English radicals after the crushing defeat that came with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, barely a decade after the execution of Charles I.The story that Hill tells cuts against the grain, though, of Clark’s anti-utopianism. Hill depicts a generation of radicals defeated and subdued; but one that also sustained many who never abandoned their aspirations of renovating that radical tradition. John Milton was their “prophet-poet” who, in his last great epic poems,Paradise RegainedandSamson Agonistes,most eloquently expressed the possibilities of hope and redemption.Apart from the Quakers, none of the radical groups that throng the English revolution – the Levellers, the Diggers, the Ranters, the Muggletonians and others – endured. But their ideas did. The belief in equality, democracy and universal suffrage, the challenge to impoverishment and class distinctions, all became woven into new radical movements in the 18th century.And then, Hill observes, the poets of the new radicalism, from Blake to Shelley, “turned back to Milton… and the vision of the poet-prophet”.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionJohn MiltonHistory booksPoetrycommentShareReuse this content"

The Labour leader came to office thinking, as did most of those who voted for him, that he was going to be a domestically orientated prime minister with primary ambitions to improve living standards, build lots of homes and rejuvenate public services. That’s what “change”, his one-word election slogan, was supposed to be about. When he originally selected his overriding “five missions”, the defence of the realm didn’t make the cut.His central definition today is as a geopolitically focused prime minister who is promising tospend more on guns, missiles and warplanesand less on international aid. More British bullets will be purchased at the expense of succour to the impoverished and desperate of the world. This shift gives a flintier profile to his leadership, but not in a way that either supporters or opponents anticipated during last summer’s election. Most Labour people don’t quarrel with the argument that Britain has to put up its guard, but a lot of them, includingqueasy members of the Starmer cabinet, are wriggling uncomfortably about taking the hatchet to the international development budget. In the days since the decision was announced, they have taken to wondering what manner of Labour government is this?The short explanation for this transmogrification is two words and an initial: Donald J Trump. The upheaval in the international order unleashed by the US president has shattered decades-old assumptions about the western alliance. This has had a more profound impact on Sir Keir than any other event. A prime minister who used to earn his living as a human rights lawyer has had a crash course in realpolitik from the nakedly transactional practitioner of great power games who resides on Pennsylvania Avenue.Sir Keir came away fromhis encounter at the White Houseon Thursday empty-handed when it came to securing a bankable guarantee that there will be US military cover for any British and French peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine. What the prime minister did win was anapparent blessingfor the Chagos Islands deal, puncturing Nigel Farage’s repeated claims that the White House is opposed to it. There were encouraging noises that the UK may swerve US tariffs and pats on the head for Sir Keir from his host for being a “special man” and a “very tough negotiator”. The price was paid in the currency of ingratiation. This was at its most toe-curling when the prime minister delved into his jacket pocket toflourish an invite from the kingfor the US president to make an “unprecedented”, “truly historic” second state visit to the UK. Excuse me while I find something to retch into. The other tribute to the Maga King was setting a 2027 deadline forlifting British defence spendingto 2.5% of GDP with 3% as the ultimate target.Boosting defence spending is both a response to Trump’s demands that Europe pulls its weight and an insurance policy against the withdrawal of American security guarantees. Downing Street reeled at the callous and chilling monstering of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a democratically elected leader fighting for his country’s freedom against tyranny, at the White House on Friday. The shocking ugliness of the televised scene amplified Number 10’s unspoken fears that the Trump regime poses an existential challenge to European security.I’ve beenamong those anticipating this pivot. Given how menacing the world looked even before Trump’s return to the Oval Office, it was not sustainable to leave Britain’s armed forces in such a parlous condition that our own defence secretary describes them as “hollowed out”. The intelligence chiefs and the top brass have becomeincreasingly clamourousabout thegrowing scaleand intensity of threats from a spectrum of malevolent adversaries.The upheaval in the international order unleashed by Trump has shattered old assumptions about the western allianceThe issue then becomes whether the money will be spent well or wastefully. The Ministry of Defence has a rotten record when it comes to equipping the armed forces in a timely and cost-effective way. The onus is now on John Healey and the service chiefs to prove that they can get the maximum bang from the taxpayers’ extra bucks.The pain inflicted on the international aid budget will be brutal. Sir Keir was all crocodile tears when he intoned that regrettably “hard choices” had to be made, as if more money for defence could only be found by stealing it from aid programmes. There were many other options for a government that spends in excess of £1tn a year. These included being less generous towards other demands for spending, bearing down on escalating costs in areas of welfare or raising more from taxation. Though the prime minister claims he did not take this decision “lightly”, the international development budget was targeted because Downing Street and the Treasury reckoned it was the politically least painful option.This is the superficially clever and unashamedly cynical choice when it comes to electoral calculations. Polling suggests thatcutting aid is a popular optionwith around two-thirds of voters. There’s an assumption among Labour strategists that aid is particularly resented by the kind of voter who supported Labour at the election and is now flirting with Reform or has already switched to it. There’s some truth in this analysis, but it is not the whole truth. There’s danger for Labour among the significant wedge of voters who chose the party at the election partly on the basis that it was more compassionate, enlightened and internationalist than the Tories. They didn’t expect Labour to outdo the last Conservative government in slashing the development budget.The case for spending on aid is easily made. On top of the humanitarian good it does, there’s the mitigation against instability, conflict and extremism. It also helps win friends and influence people in other countries who can be useful to the UK in the projection and protection of our national interests. These arguments will be highly familiar to Sir Keir and his cabinet because it was preciselythe case they used to makethemselves when they berated the Conservatives for raiding the budget. AsLabour’s election manifestoput it, international aid helps make “the world a safer, more prosperous place”.The UK used to be able to make the claim that its record on helping the poorer parts of the planet made us a soft power superpower. As recently as 2020, the UK was one of only seven wealthy countries that met the UN target to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. The Conservatives cut that to 0.5% under Boris Johnson and it will now be slashed down to just 0.3%. Since a hefty chunk of the budget isbeing spent on asylum-seekerswithin Britain, the net amount supporting international development will be even more miserly. Programmes threatenedinclude those alleviating poverty, tackling disease, improving the education of young people and addressing the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Number 10 clearly reckoned there was a slight risk that she would resign as international development minister, or decided it wasn’t terribly bothered even if she did.She has quitwith the warning that denuding the international development budget will only encourage Russia’s aggressive effort to increase its presence worldwide. Blood must be rushing to the head of David Lammy. Justifying the cut has obliged the foreign secretary to stand on his head. It is only very recently that he waswagging a fingerat the Americans by telling them it was a “big strategic mistake” to let Elon Musk eviscerate the US development budget. He accompanied that with the warning that China would exploit the vacuum to further its influence.I am being generous when I say that it is disingenuous of Sir Keir and his loyalists to suggest that they were faced with an either/or choice between defence spending in the name of national security and non-defence spending in troubled and distressed places abroad. The UK is an affluent country that likes to think it can punch above its weight. Even when money is tight, this nation is wealthy enough to wield both hard power and soft power.The face of Britain that the Starmer government is now presenting to the world is one that aspires to be more muscular while also looking meaner. Muscular is necessary in the scary new world order. Meaner is a myopic mistake that will render Britain less safe.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsDefence policyLabourUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

European nations need to fill anyvacuum left by America’s new administrationas we ensure there can be no victory for Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and Donald Trump’s decision toshut down USAid.Before being elected as an MP, I lived inKenyaand saw the vital work done by local charities that help families of children growing up in informal settlements on the outskirts of Nairobi. I met teenagers working on social media projects to tackle disinformation and prevent post-election violence. And I talked to women about the ever-present threat of rape and sexual violence.Like many African countries Kenya has huge potential, but it also has a violent recent history and is plagued by the threat of international terrorism. So when the US or theUK withdraws fundingfor clinics offering sexual and reproductive health services, young women can’t take control of their lives. When the US or the UK withdraws funding for schemes to combat young men being fed disinformation, the risk is that they become more easily recruited by malign actors, armed groups and even terrorist networks.China and Russia have their own agendas around the world. They are pushing vulnerable countries into debt, offering investment opportunities that ignore violations to human rights. They seek influence as part of their global agenda to destabilise the international rules-based system. They undermine copyright and intellectual property. They seek to exploit, rather than to support. As the experience of the BBC World Service shows, when the UK or the US gives up bandwidth, China and Russia move in with their disinformation campaigns.When we fail to make the case to support fledgling and imperfect democracies to promote good governance, we fail to explain that the resulting corruption and exploitation undermines societies and can lead to wars, more UK asylum claimants and destabilisation that ultimately puts the UK’s security at risk.Since becoming an MP, I have had the huge privilege of joining theArmed Forces Parliamentary Scheme. This has allowed me to better understand the experience of the veterans who helped elect me. It has also allowed me to hear first-hand the security analysis and threat assessment ofBritain’s brightest military brains. It is clear that the UK is under significant and immediate threat from Russia and other oligarchies that do not believe in human rights, international law and humanity.Investment overseas can help turn war-torn countries from humanitarian crises to vibrant democraciesThe cuts that the Conservative government made to the defence budget were negligent and bolstered the ego of Putin and other enemies. We need to get defence spending back to the 2.5% it was under the last Labour government and we need to go further to at least 3% as quickly as possible. Where diplomacy and development fail, we need a defence deterrent that other countries fear and that can win wars.The military have been some of the most passionate advocates of the fact that defence and development are closely related. They have been witness to what happens when we fail in our military, our diplomacy or our aid activity to bring stability to a vulnerable country. It is not just the lives lost and ruined; it creates a real threat to the UK itself.The world is beset by conflicts and huge numbers of displaced people. This has happened at a time when the UK has behaved as a small island worrying only about itself, and cut its military and international aid. If a fragile peace can take hold in Gaza andUkraine, the rebuilding efforts and vital humanitarian support will need to go hand-in-hand with peacekeeping efforts. Our investment overseas can help turn these war-torn countries from humanitarian crises to vibrant democracies and trading partners.With climate change already a reality, overseas partnerships are needed to help people adapt to extreme weather events. And for all our efforts in the UK to reach net zero, we can’t save the planet on our own. We need to support the participation of countries that did the least to cause climate change but are already experiencing its worst impacts. That’s in our national interest and fundamental to our security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the UK and our allies have failed to make the case that a balance between Britain’s national defence and our spending overseas is necessary for the UK’s security and success.

Beavers are nature’s answer to our broken riversHelena HortonThe cute rodent helps combat drought and boosts biodiversity. Its rewilding is welcome and long overdueSun 2 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 13.36 ESTShareThe first time I laid eyes on a beaver was a couple of years ago on the Devon farm ofDerek Gow, the farmer turned rewilder,who brought the furry rodents back to the UK 30 years ago.It was magical. Sitting in the June dusk, the pink-and-purple sky was reflected in the still ponds of the beaver habitat. Suddenly, ripples emerged from the lodge and the head of a kit – a baby beaver – popped up from underwater.Watching this fascinating, and very cute, creature collect willow branches in its mouth was a heart-stopping moment; it felt like peeking into a secret world.This scene will, I hope, now become common across England, after the government announced on Friday that beavers can be legally released into the wild for the first time. The rodents were a common feature of our rivers until about 400 years ago, when they were hunted to extinction for their pelts and an oil they secrete.So this is a return of a creature that belongs here, and that we cruelly extinguished from our landscape. But it’s a much more important moment than that. We have royally screwed up our rivers over the centuries, straightening them, divorcing them from flood plains and destroying the surrounding habitats. This causes increased flooding and makes it more difficult for nature to thrive. Beavers can heal this; they are known as “keystone species”, which means their presence creates habitats for myriad other creatures,including fish,amphibians and insects.The habitats I’ve visited have been thronging with life, with clouds of dragonflies in the air and tiny froglets hopping around my feet. Why? Because beavers dig ponds and create complex wetland habitats around rivers. Studies have found that fish in beaver habitats are larger and more numerous and that the presence of beavers rapidly increases biodiversity.The UK is one of the most nature depleted places in the world and beavers can help fix this – for free. There has been a fierce debate about the reintroduction of beavers in England; it has even become astory line onThe Archers. While some Ambridge residents have been lobbying for the return of the rodents, David Archer fears they will bring harm to his farm.It is true that there are those that don’t want them back in the landscape. Fair enough in some cases, as the rodents can fell trees. You can spot the telltale signs that you’re entering the world of the beaver by the nibbled boughs and discarded, half-munched willow branches. But farmers I have spoken to have managed to avert this with a cheap and easy solution of wrapping chicken wire around tree trunks at beaver height. The creatures don’t like getting the metal caught between their teeth. Others fear the rodents will cause their land to flood, which is also a legitimate concern. In other European countries where they roam free, governments provide services where troublesome beavers are removed and placed somewhere more appropriate. This is likely to be the case here, too.So concerns about beavers in our nature-denuded landscape are understandable. We have wiped out so many of our native species that most of us have not encountered a wild mammal larger than a squirrel. But I believe the worries are largely unfounded, particularly if beaver releases are monitored and managed properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their dams are leaky, which means rivers flow much more steadily, and rainwater isn’t dumped all at once into towns and villages. It moves at a much slower pace through a beaver system than an artificially straightened river.The beavers on theRiver Otterin Devon – one of our free-living populations – have managed to stop the village downstream from flooding. As changes in climate brings heavier rainfall, their flood reduction services will prove invaluable. In theCzech Republic, the government planned a flood prevention scheme involving a dam. But the beavers got there first, building their dam in the exact location planned by officials, and thus saving taxpayers £1m.Beavers also help reduce the impact of drought. In the dry summer of 2022, when farmers were struggling to grow grass for livestock and plant crops, a lucky few in Devon and Cornwall, where there are beavers, did not face the same problems. Drone footageshows parched, beaver-less landnext to lush, green, beaver habitats. How? Because the ponds they dig hold water in the landscape, water that can then be used when rain is scarce. We are likely to have more frequent droughts due to climate breakdown, so beavers will be able to help prevent the worst effects of these.Currently, England’s beavers are mostly in enclosures, where they have been released by conservationists who have been observing the impact they have in a few constrained acres. Some, which have either escaped from these enclosures or been released by guerrilla rewilders, are living wild on rivers mostly in the south.This moment has been decades in the making. Ever since Gow and his fellow rewilders concocted their plan in the 90s, the momentum has built. Successive environment departments have tried to legalise the release of beavers, but have been blocked because of fears it will upset farmers and certain wealthy landowners. Almost every year, conservationists have been told it is almost time to tear down the fences of enclosures and set beavers loose to fix our rivers, only to be informed the scheme has once again been delayed.Some frustrated conservationists have taken the law into their own hands, driving around the country with beavers in the back of a van, conducting“beaver bombings”,where, unauthorised, they release a pair at a river and drive off again. It is faintly absurd that normally law-abiding nature lovers have felt forced to conduct clandestine beaver operations.But this won’t be necessary any longer. These industrious rodents will, in the coming weeks, be living free all over the country, with the first expected to be released by the National Trust atPurbeck Heaths in Dorset.I urge you to go and visit, so you too can experience the magic of watching wild beavers.Helena Horton is an environment reporter for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionBiodiversityConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder women are giving up on it”, Comment).This method has widely and misleadingly been promoted as “natural”. It is based on the simplistic notion that a menstrual cycle follows a reliably regular pattern, which I call the “egg-timer model”. The core assumption is that ovulation occurs only during a four- to five-day period in mid-cycle, known as the fertile window. The rationale of the rhythm method is that conception can be avoided by restricting coitus to the remaining, non-fertile cycle days.In cases where conception occurs despite use of the rhythm method, according to the egg-timer model this is most likely to result from an ageing sperm fertilising a fresh egg, or from an ageing egg being fertilised by a fresh sperm. In either case, an increased risk of miscarriage or abnormal foetal development is expected. In fact, objective surveys have revealed that the failure rate of the rhythm method is high (exceeding 20% in practice). One reason for this could be the little-studied phenomenon of long-term storage of sperm in the neck of the womb.Prof Robert D. Martin, Emeritus Curator, the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IllinoisWomen must not be gaslit regarding the potential consequences of hormonal birth control on mental health. Anxiety and depression are not uncommon side-effects and for some can have serious consequences, especially if health professionals deny that synthetic hormones may be the cause and do not act swiftly to offer alternatives.It is true that hormonal contraceptives do not affect all women this way, but since we have no reliable way of knowing who may be negatively affected, we must be open with women that this is the case and that hormones may not suit everyone. We must also believe and support those who report extreme changes in mental state after commencing treatment.We must of course also ensure young women are aware of the risks of using untested cycle tracking apps promoted online. It is possible, with the right education and tools, to avoid pregnancy without hormonal birth control. Unfortunately, this requires a different approach and investment in women’s health, which I’m unsure health services currently have capacity to deliver.Miriam Avery, mental health nurseManchesterTrump’s real missionYoureditorialis correct to say that “a dangerous new international order is unfolding” (Comment), but Donald Trump hasn’t acted for no gain for himself and his backers.Slowly and skilfully over the last decade, the billionaire class has worked to delegitimise the slow process by which America’s democracy widened inclusion and diversity. Simultaneously, capitalism stripped millions of working-class Americans of the rights to an affordable roof over their heads, to decent healthcare and access to higher education. Then, vast sums were spent by those billionaires on the Trump campaign with its racism, misogyny and intolerance, and then his administration’s attacks on policies for “inclusion and diversity”.Do not be fooled. Trump and Elon Musk are not cutting the government budget, bureaucratic waste and excess. Nor are they slashing the deep state and the global American security apparatus.Acting on behalf of “lending institutions and moneyed incorporations”, they are demolishing the slow, regulatory process of holding back rampant, extractive capitalism. They are hacking away at democracy – both at home and abroad.David MurrayWallington, south LondonA war footing is vitalAndrew Rawnsley summarises very clearly the options available to Sir Keir Starmer as he prepares to go to the White House at this pivotal and indeed terrifying moment (“What can Keir Starmer say at the White House that Donald Trump might listen to?”, Comment, last week).I feel strongly that our government should be bold and forward thinking and put itself and the country on the equivalent of a war footing. It needs to push through fast a raft of measures to improve our self-sufficiency, especially in food, energy, and defence. As we did in the Second World War.They need to hold cross-party brainstormings, initiate a blitz of public information to get the whole country engaged and involved. Act fast. This could bring the country together. We left Europe and the US has left us, we are alone and we need to come together, work together. Good could come out of all this horror.Freya HartleyTorquayAnimal suffering is rifeMarion Rowe is right to point out how shocking it is that farmed prawns have their eyestalks cut off, causing them pain and, of course, making them blind (Letters, last week). Sadly, mutilations are commonplace in today’s animal farming.Dairy and beef cows are dehorned, and male beef calves castrated. It is commonplace for an egg-laying hen to have the tip of her beak sliced off without anaesthetic, while still a chick. Lambs have their tails docked and the males are castrated. Animal Aid urges people to boycott the products that result from all this suffering, by choosing a vegan diet.Iain Green, Director, Animal AidTonbridge, KentRich pickingsIt may interest Catherine Bennett (“Elon Musk’s four-year-old son blended in perfectly in the Oval Office with all the other bogeymen”, Comment) to know that many of the earliest books written for children sought to encourage good conduct, and were particularly hot on the issue of nose-picking.Thanks to Katherine Rundell, the award-winning children’s author, I learned that the 15th-centuryLittle Children’s Little Bookwarned children not to “wipe your nose or nostrils, else men will say you are come of churls”.

After 20 years of filming she thought she’d seen it all… Until she became a mother.Sun 2 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 2 Mar 2025 07.04 ESTShareThe broadcaster Stacey Dooley gave birth to her daughter, Minnie, in January 2023. Though she has reported on women for almost two decades, she has been surprised by the transformations of motherhood. “I went into it so unprepared,” she says. “I cannot begin to tell you.” Like other soon-to-be parents, Dooley decided against attending antenatal classes and rejected manuals offered by friends. “You know, I used to see mums finding it tough and I’d think, ‘It can’t bethathard.’ I really used to think that. Which is fucking hilarious. I owe all of those women an apology.”Dooley and I are in a hotel café in Knightsbridge, west London, where she is later due to meet her accountant. She has written a book,Dear Minnie, in which she profiles women who have had different experiences of conception, pregnancy and labour. Dooley’s own pregnancy was comparatively straightforward: some sickness, a scheduled C-section, though “the sleep deprivation knocked me for six,” she says. “I’ve never in my life been that tired.” In the book, Dooley describes the first six months of Minnie’s life as an overwhelm of struggle and vulnerability. “My living room looked like a teenager’s bedroom,” she writes. Her partner, the dancerKevin Clifton, with whom Dooley was coupled during the 2018 series ofStrictly Come Dancing, was given two weeks of paternity leave before being hauled back to work. (Clifton is currently appearing in a UK tour ofChicago.) “I remember him leaving and shutting the front door and being like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?’” Dooley recalls. “And I felt envious. That he was going to be sleeping from 10pm to 8am. I remember feeling jealous of that.”Dooley describes Clifton as a “brilliant” father. “Everything he does is for her,” she says. But still, work as a performer is demanding and Dooley, though well-supported by her mother as well as Clifton’s parents, was sometimes alone, and taken aback by the cloud of worry that blew into her home. “I’m fairly level-headed,” she says. “My natural default is relatively chill. I like to think I can take things on the chin. But Minnie is my Achilles heel.” Once, when she was a baby, Minnie contracted bronchiolitis, a common lung infection in children, and Dooley took her to hospital. “I had all the nurses saying, ‘This is completely normal, it’s bronchi season, it’s fine!’” She raises her eyebrows. “It’s difficult not to catastrophise.”Dooley seems slightly surprised by what has become of her life. “I hadn’t taken into consideration how vulnerable I’d feel. And you’re madly in love with this person. And it’s a love you don’t recognise.” At one point, she reaches for her phone to share a picture of Minnie, who sits bright-eyed, with tight red curls, on Dooley’s bed. “Here’s something I didn’t think would happen,” she goes on. “She’s made me love everyone.”This is surprising. Dooley is known in the television industry to be determinedly hard working and unapologetic about what she wants. A force. “I’ve always tried to behave well,” she tells me, but prior to becoming a mother “it wasn’t the priority.” A friend of mine who once met with Dooley professionally remarked on the ferocity of her ambition and found her difficult to warm to. (“I wonder how much she is a character of herself,” my friend said.) “So much of my identity was wrapped up in what I did for a living,” Dooley says. The work, it was clear, came first.View image in fullscreenPresenting ‘Stacey Dooley: Inside The Undertakers’ in 2023.Photograph: BBC/Firecracker FilmsStill, people change. Dooley describes motherhood as providing her with “a sense of purpose you didn’t have before”. Asked whether her work offered purpose, she replies, “I feel proud. It gave people a platform. It highlighted some important points,” but “I wasn’t radically changing things.” (She adds, “What else was I doing? Nothing.”) Dooley believes that “the priority now is trying to be a really fucking good mum,” and that “work is important, but it’s work”.Throughout our conversation she is informal, friendly and earnest, though she often recoils at her newfound earnestness, as if embarrassed. I sense it has been unusual for her to discuss her own feelings so gushingly, but she cannot help but go on. When I first ask Minnie’s age, she replies, “Two,” before adding, winkingly, “and obviously she’s the brightest, cleverest, most advanced two-year-old you’ve ever met.” Later she says, “I know this is annoying, Alex. I’m not unaware of how annoying this is. But her speech is just…” She mimics the awe of proud parents everywhere. “The shit she comes out with.”InDear Minnie, Dooley describes herself as her daughter’s “mum/assistant/slave”. When I bring this up she nods and says, “I’ve spent my whole life assuring everyone that I’m a strong woman. That I’m independent. That I won’t let anyone take the piss. Apart from my own child.”I’ve always tried to behave well, but it wasn’t the priorityDooley grew up working class in Luton. For a while it was just Dooley and her mother. Her father battled alcohol abuse and was “not around,” she says. He died when she was in her 20s. Dooley’s mother held several jobs, but there was struggle. “She would get money at the start of every week and during the last few days things would become tough.” She often used spare time to clean the homes of her friends and Dooley would eat dinner alone. (She once described her childhood diet as consisting of “the three Ps: Pop Tarts, Peperami, Pot Noodle.”) Still Dooley recalls being “really very happy” and feeling “incredibly loved”. Dooley’s mother was from Liverpool. Her grandmother was a publican – people called her Crazy Haze – in the north of England and visited when she could. For two weeks after Dooley’s birth, her mother looked after her baby alone. “I think she had a friend there when I was born,” Dooley says. “But people have their own lives, they’ve got their work, they’ve got their families.” Dooley has “no idea” how she did it.”.While Dooley was growing up, her mother encouraged her to “stand up for yourself, work hard, look after people,” Dooley recalls. It is a mantra by which she stands and one she will pass on to Minnie, who is already “very bossy, very loud, very confident”. (“I would hate for her to lose that,” Dooley says, before joking, “I’m a raging narcissist. I want my child to be just like me!”) When I ask if her own experience of motherhood has changed the way she thinks about her mother, she responds, “It has, which is annoying.”“Why is it annoying?” I ask.“Well, you know what it’s like, mums can be a pain in the arse.”Dooley and her mother are extremely similar, she says. “If we spend too long together we do each other’s heads in. And Minnie is a carbon copy of me.”I ask what Clifton is like.View image in fullscreen‘Socially he can’t dance. Unless he’s got some Latin choreography’: Kevin Clifton and Stacey Dooley on Strictly Come Dancing, 2018.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA“Kev’s very reserved,” she says. “As a performer – on stage, on Strictly – he’s sort of outrageous. It’s a very camp kind of… Ta-da! But as a man he’s shy, he’s unassuming, he doesn’t talk much in social situations.” If he and Dooley were at a wedding, she says, Clifton would avoid the dancefloor. “Socially he can’t dance. Unless he’s got some Latin choreography.”Dooley and Clifton live in Liverpool, close to her mother and not far from his parents. (At once point, Dooley considered naming her daughter Cilla, “but I was like, it might be a bit on the nose, if she’s got red hair and she’s living in Liverpool”.) They are a long way from Luton now. Still, Dooley’s early life has been well documented and the stories have helped form the public impression that she is a working-class girl done good, which is not far from the truth. Dooley first appeared on TV as a contributor on the 2008 documentaryBlood, Sweat and T-shirts, in which she and several other Brits travelled to India to navigate the sweatshop experience. Dooley was 20, a bit green, but unafraid to speak her mind, which encouraged BBC Three’s incumbent controller, Danny Cohen, to finance her own series. “It was all very accidental,” she says of her career. “I’d left school at 15. I was from Luton. I didn’t have an uncle at the Beeb.” But the series,Stacey Dooley Investigates, in which she reported on current-affair issues around the world, was well received. “I did end up in some sketchy areas,” she says, “and that sort of schtick became my USP.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d left school at 15. I was from Luton. I didn’t have an uncle at the Beeb’: Dooley (far right) campaigning against sweatshops in 2009.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyTo many, Dooley’s closest contemporary in the scope of their interests is the broadcasterLouis Theroux, who is 17 years Dooley’s senior. Theroux is known for probing subjects from behind a self-deprecating front that disguises intellectual rigour. Though she left school early and without qualifications, Dooley’s intellectual brio is equivalent to Theroux’s and many of her documentaries have been similarly revelatory. (She has made more than 70 films for the BBC.) She exists in the public imagination as a kind of go-getter, but is also commonly described as too emotionally involved with her interviewees – an unfair, sexist trope – and, though in 2018 she received an MBE for services to broadcasting, her work has been deemed lesser as a result.This is unfair, of course, and it has to do with both sexism and classism. (I wonder if a male documentarian would have been encouraged to write a book on parenthood after having children?) And yet Dooley’s audience continues to want more and the BBC remains an enthusiastic employer. In an email,Nasfim Haque, the current Head of Content at BBC Three, described Dooley as “a rare and relevant voice in the documentary landscape”, and that her “authenticity resonates, especially among young audiences who crave truth”.I suspect Dooley would flinch at the use of the word “authenticity”. Throughout our conversation, she finds it hard to use professional buzzwords – “organic”, “the journey” – without a self-deprecating flourish of irony. When I ask why she struggles, she shrugs.Other people feel confident saying these words, I tell her. “Maybe I feel a bit daftsaying them.” It is agreed that although she is fluent in the language of the professional world, it is not her “mother tongue”.The way Dooleydescribes her earliest films feels to me as if the BBC were conducting an experiment: what would happen if we dropped a young, plain-speaking girl into a hostile environment and filmed the results? I ask if she ever thought her early BBC series were exploitative.View image in fullscreenDooley with Hajja Ganna, a woman looking for her son, on ‘Stacey Dooley Investigates: Nigeria’s Female Suicide Bombers’ in 2009.Photograph: BBC“I’m not saying this just to toe the party line,” she says. “But it never felt voyeuristic. It never felt like they were taking advantage.” And things have moved on. “When I started, most of my colleagues were privately educated. Most of them lived in London. Most of them were middle-aged. Most of them were men. But there are more girls on the crew now. More girls shooting. More female execs.”In the beginning, Dooley felt the need to prove herself. “When I first started doing current affairs-based issues, there was a bit of head-scratching. Like, who is this 20-year-old from Luton with no qualifications? Why has she been given two BBC commissions? So I think I was always trying to convince people that it was justified, that it was well-received, that there was an appetite for that kind of filmmaking.” She continues, “You’ve got high-brow, middle-aged, middle-class men writing opinion pieces on you. And sometimes they were considerate and generous and other times they weren’t. So, of course, when you’re in your 20s, you’re thinking, ‘Oh, there’s this one guy who works in the City who doesn’t get me.’ And that’s really important to you at that moment – which is hilarious now, because I promise you, hands on my heart, I couldn’t care less.”Dooley’s career has not been without controversy. In 2019, the Labour MP David Lammy accused her of promoting an image of “her as heroine and black child as victim” while Dooley was in Uganda to film a documentary for Comic Relief. (She was later labelled a “white saviour”.) I ask if she’s considered what it will be like when Minnie grows up and reads about her. “There will be a time when she goes back and reads things about her mum. And some people will have called her a moron, thought she was completely useless and really weren’t into her at all. Which is totally fair enough. But, hopefully, she’ll be robust enough to recognise that that’s just somebody’s opinion. And they’re entitled to that. And it doesn’t actually mean that much.”Though Dooley now considers work secondary to motherhood, she continues to work remarkably hard. Since Minnie’s birth, she has written a book, finished several BBC documentaries and performed in a West End play. During the first year of Minnie’s life, while the baby was still being breastfed, she travelled to work with her. (Once, when Minnie was young, Dooley stayed overnight in a Nevada brothel while Minnie and Clifton slept in a trailer outside.) Still, she hasn’t entered a hostile situation since becoming a mother and she finds it difficult to be away from home for more and a single night. “I need to try to be around for as long as possible,” she says. “And on a very boring, logistical level, I need to be home more. Minnie’s got football on a Saturday.”View image in fullscreen‘Having my daughter has made me love everyone’: Stacey Dooley wears jumper bymadeleine-thompson.com; jeans bymotherdenim.com; hoops byastridandmiyu.com.Photograph: Kristina Varaksina/The ObserverI wonder if she has considered what might make things easier for working mothers?“That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it,” she says. “There needs to be flexibility, obviously. People need to appreciate that mothers are mothers first and foremost. And if you trust them, they’ll continue to do a brilliant job because, wrongly, they’ll feel like they have to overcompensate, because you’ve allowed them to be a mum.” After a pause she adds, “Childcare in this country is a joke. The cost is crippling. Which means amazing women go off and have a baby and can’t come back.”“What’s the answer?” I say.“That’s for Keir Starmer to sort out. That’s for the Houses of Parliament. Don’t askme, Alex.”Towards the end of our conversation, I ask what Dooley pictures in her future.“Personally or professionally?” she asks.“Both,” I say.“I would like to have more children,” she says. “But it’s not a given, is it.”InDear Minnie, Dooley shares regret at not having a family earlier.“If I’d started sooner, I could have had more,” she says now. “I might have had two, or three or four. But you have to be realistic about these things. Like, biologically.” Dooley turns 38 this month. “I did everything I needed to in my 20s. I had an amazing decade of prioritising myself. All of that freedom. But, actually, I think I should have… I didn’t know I’d feel like this.”In the book she writes how she never felt maternal. “Other mums were always destined to be mums. They knew. It was non-negotiable for them. But I didn’t have that thought.”I ask what Clifton, who is 42, thinks about having four children.“He’s up for it,” Dooley says.“Because he’s touring,” I say.“Exactly,” she says. “He’s got those 10pm to 8am sleep shifts.”Dear Minnie by Stacey Dooley is published by BBC Books at £22 and is out on 13 March.

Why should a woman be given her power by a man, she wondered. And it’s something she’s still wondering about.She’s Auspicious is a dismantling of the idea of woman being put on a pedestal, bestowed with value through someone else’s eyes. Being shaped by an outside view of womanhood – even a supposedly flattering one – is a suffocation of sorts. Prakash is an Indian-American dancer, best known in the UK for performing with Akram Khan, who has mentored her. Her brand of bharatanatyam (the traditional dance form comes from southern India) blends classical technique with a questioning sensibility and the freeform structure of contemporary theatre.View image in fullscreenMythili Prakash: She's Auspicious.Photograph: Daniel DittusPrakash is an accomplished dancer who, at first at least, doesn’t give too much away. A contained presence, her movement is economical, undemonstrative, and not clouded by the strain of visible effort (there’s great skill in that, and power over her instrument). She can balance in absolute stillness, rooted to the earth.As the piece progresses she gradually scrolls through emotional states: anxiety, relief, delight, enforced restraint, with her usually freely expressive hands suddenly clamped stiff over her mouth. She begins as a woman, plainly dressed in black and white, but is elevated to goddess status, reappearing in vivid red, in a kind of shrine made of scaffolding, with a coterie of followers. Seven women in shades of indigo bow and pray and sing and make music for her. She is deified and decorated with jewellery. But for Prakash, that’s not the aspiration. You get the sense that this goddess is also a woman, a mother, a person of flaws and conflict (and strength and compassion). When Prakash throws off all expectations, her hair swings loose, her movements become bigger and freer, feet planted wide, mouth agape with something akin to both hunger and glee.She’s Auspicious turns into a paean to girl power, an uprising. Percussionist Aswini Srinivasan especially drives the energy forward with racing rhythms, the women banging sticks against the scaffold, the shrine tumbling. It’s a piece about agency; an undoing of the myth.At Sadler’s Wells East, London, until 2 MarchExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

By the time 2001’s MahoganySoulmade her a star, she’d logged two decades in the game, starting out in pioneering all-girl rap trio the Sequence, before passing through went-nowhere R&B groups like Devox and Vertical Hold and writing and singing with other artists (including D’Angelo, her former lover and father of their son, Michael). Once Clive Davis’s Arista Records signed her in 1999, those years of experience set her apart from the neo-soul pack, having worn a powerful grain into her rich, agile voice, and steeping her music in soul’s deep history.Her debut for Arista, Black Diamond, retooled lush 70s soul for the new century: Green Grass Vapors – a love song to the sweet leaf with Stone “higher than the Thunder Dome” – was from the same funky swamp as D’Angelo’s Chicken Grease, its smouldering guitar like a moaning panther. A remarkable reading of Marvin Gaye’s Trouble Man, meanwhile, mastered the track’s breathless, staccato chorus without breaking a sweat, channelling Gaye’s existential agonies with every holler to an oblivious lord.But it was Mahogany Soul – her first for Davis’s new label, J Records – that announced Stone’s true arrival. It opened with Soul Insurance, backing singers bending the hook to Lady Marmalade around Stone like armour as she delivered a fearsome rap like Caught Up-era Millie Jackson, hard and wise but with a heart ready to get broken again. The 75-minute epic celebrated good men (Brotha) and spiritual forebears (If It Wasn’t), and served up gritty memories of her years of pre-fame struggle (20 Dollars); More Than a Woman was a wonderfully sinful slow-jam with Calvin Richardson. But the album soared highest when Stone skimmed the painful depths of love – What U Dyin’ For? sought to liberate good women from bad men, while her signature anthem Wish I Didn’t Miss You, repurposed O’Jays’ Backstabbers to deliver a new classic rumination on love’s eternal sting.Stone was now a contemporary of the neo-soul uprising led by friends and collaborators D’Angelo, Erykah Badu and Musiq Soulchild, but her age and experience gifted her music a superior weight and authority. Follow-up Stone Love opened with an a cappella riff on the Supremes’ titular hit and then quickly revisited the boudoir where Mahogany Soul’s charmed break-ups and make-ups occurred (on Stay for a While, a delectably slow-burn suite of longing and lust, Stone got carnal with Anthony Hamilton over molasses-sweet swing). Elsewhere, Stone’s classic sensibility negotiated the new era – Lovers’ Ghetto lifted the same Dynasty sample Camp Lo rode for their cult hit Luchini (This Is It), while the joyous I Wanna Thank Ya paired Stone with Snoop Dogg.Stone relocated to the reborn Stax Records for 2007’s The Art of Love and War, a perfect home for an artist so steeped in soul and funk’s 70s glory days. The album offered killer duets with legends Betty Wright (on Baby, a storming repudiation of a man who’s left his former lover behind now he’s hit the big time) and James Ingram (My People, a lithe update of Stevie Wonder’s Black Man). It was Stone’s highest-charting LP, but her next, 2009’s Unexpected, stumbled. If Stone sounded uncharacteristically disengaged throughout its upbeat bangers, she probably was; her father had died shortly before production began.Unexpected didn’t trouble the Billboard 100, and Angie exited Stax to find herself adrift in a disrupted industry. But while the albums that followed never matched Mahogany Soul’s triumphs, the deep cuts were golden. Forget About Me, from 2015’s Dream, evoked D’Angelo’s offset groove while taking potshots at her former lover. Full Circle in 2019 served up Dinosaur, a squelchy swamp of dark funk wondering “where did the good ones go? They’re on the verge of extinction”, and Grits, where Stone played a frank sex therapist: “You call it smashin’/ What about passion?”; “Tell that boy to stir like grits / circular motion / nice and slow”. Meanwhile 2023’s Love Language peaked with The Gym, a final, beautiful duet with longtime foil Musiq Soulchild. In these moments, you can hear the glory of Mahogany Soul echoing, the promise of further brilliance. And it’s a compounding tragedy that last night’s terrible accident has deprived us of any more of Stone’s magic.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Robert Wise’s swirling, swollen 1965 film version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical has been a personal favourite since long before I ever thought to list personal favourites – a seasonal staple, a constant generator of unprompted earworms, a point of good-natured familial conflict between those who love it and those who merely pretend not to, a film so laden with short-cut iconography that it rushes quickly to mind when I see a certain shade of upholstery, a particular bob haircut or even a passing nun.And yet I have no memory of the first time I saw it, where I was or who hit play on the VCR, or when that unbeatable, unshakable song score of cast-iron Broadway bangers first claimed a significant chunk of real estate in my brain. I must have been so young I didn’t exactly know what films were or how they worked; any older and those would all be vivid mental milestones. Essentially, for as long as I’ve been aware of cinema, The Sound of Music has seemed to me its very essence – if not the best movie ever made, themoviestmovie ever made, a Rosetta stone for the form that everyone can read and reference and recognise.Mary Poppins at 60: a dazzling Disney masterpiece that hasn’t lost its shineRead moreI could identify parodies of it before I fully understood satire; its tunes would regularly surface and survive outside the context of the film, whether on Christmas compilations – stray lyrical references to snowflakes and paper packages will do that for a song – or in nursery-school singalongs.Julie Andrewsmay have been the first movie star I understood as just such an entity: with The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins both looming large in my childhood canon, it seemed astonishing to me that her face and voice could somehow be the driving force of both. Did all films star Julie Andrews? I youthfully wondered. It seemed to me they should.How much of the film’s legend was founded in its first two minutes? At a conservative estimate, I’d venture 90%. That absurdly grandiose opening shot was a history-making statement of intent: that lofty, luxuriant long view of the Bavarian Alps announces both a whopping budget and a sprawling departure from the confines of the Broadway stage, before we drop and swoop into Andrews ecstatically swirling in an eye-searingly verdant meadow, as she launches into bell-clear song. To this day I misremember if the camera is spinning more than Andrews herself; the effect is so exhilarating that we feel spun along with it. Who hasn’t, on encountering an open green space, felt at least fleetingly compelled to spread their arms and whirl freely, belting out out “thaaaa hills are aliiiiiive” at the top of their lungs? Many people, probably. But it feels to me a primal urge.It’s a moment of many types of beauty fused into one: photographic, geographic, choreographic, high kitsch and high camp. I’d distrust anyone who professes themselves unmoved by it in any way and in truth, nothing in The Sound of Music quite lives up to that vertiginous opening salvo, for all the tuneful, comforting, heart-plucking pleasures of the three hours that follow. Much of its interior drama is shot in the flat, beige house style of the era’s prestige studio cinema; beyond the perky, picturesque Salzburg location shooting of the Do-Re-Mi number, the film’s flourishes of scenic spectacle are often a mere addendum to modest, straightforward, heavily extended storytelling – a sprig of parsley on a generous plate of meatloaf.This imbalance only became clear to me on a hungover New Year’s Day rewatch a couple of years ago: I saw The Sound of Music so many times as a child that I took a near 20-year break from the film for it to regain its fascination, or me mine. After the infallible, head-clearing tonic of that first number, I was struck by the frequent smallness and occasional stiffness of the film that once seemed to me as big as any could be. The stilted love triangle between Andrews’ impossibly winsome Maria, Christopher Plummer’s improbably handsome Captain von Trapp and Eleanor Parker’s unluckily jilted Baroness is the stuff of any dusty midcentury soap; the collective angst of the motherless von Trapp children is vaguely written and blandly performed. The film urgently needs the stakes-raising intrusion of the Nazis in its second half; the breath-held tension of its climactic escape sequence may be drafted in from another movie altogether, but necessarily so.View image in fullscreenJulie Andrews and Christopher Plummer in The Sound of Music.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockAnd yet The Sound of Music is, as ever, more than the sum of its parts. That includes not just the X-factor assets of Andrews’ peachy luminescence and the miraculous alchemy that takes place between her and her grinning onscreen brood, or the irresistibly sticky quality of even its worst songs – Something Good, specifically, which I can still sing by heart – but the unquantifiable personal associations that each viewer brings to the film. It is, for me, a work enriched by the countless quote marks that surround it now. That the already riotously chintzy Lonely Goatherd number is forever bonded in my mind with Gwen Stefani’s 2006 hip-hop makeover of the song only intensifies the glee it brings me. That I can’t see Parker’s character without mentally reciting the viral McSweeney’s letter formally announcing the cancellation of her nuptials is also the film’s benefit. As a film, The Sound of Music has always been flawed; as a culture objet, it gets ever more diamantine.It was later in my childhood, as my affection for the film slotted into a nascent cinephilia, that I learned with some astonishment that it wasn’t universally regarded as a masterpiece – that Pauline Kael was fired from McCall’s magazine for calling it a “sugar-coated lie” and “the sound of mucus”, and that many shared in her revulsion. Later, Slavoj Zizek would term it a pro-fascist film, to cheers from detractors who have long felt pummelled by the musical’s deathless popularity. The Sound of Music was perhaps the first film to alert me to the notion of critical subjectivity, to generally agreed strata of good taste and bad taste, and to the illicit thrills of enjoying the latter.But it’s never become a guilty pleasure: there’s too much earnest rapture in the film for that, too much honest pleasure, too much dizzily twirling joy. Film anniversaries often prompt reflections on the shortness of time, but in this case, I marvel that The Sound of Music isonly60: it’s hard to believe that cinema lived and thrived as long as it did without the film’s most enduring images, inspiring fantasy and mockery in equal measure, as elemental and immovable as the Alps themselves.Explore more on these topicsThe Sound of MusicMusicalsJulie AndrewsChristopher PlummerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mi like mi coffè very importante,” the first verse begins.Cash goes on to sing: “Mi money numeroso, I work around the clocko. That’s why I’m sweating like a mafioso,” and: “Life is like spaghetti, it’s hard until you make it.”Codacons, an Italian consumers association, lodged an appeal to the European Broadcasting Union questioning whether it was appropriate “to allow a song that offends a country and an entire community” to be part of the competition.In a statement in February, the association said the song was filled with “the usual cliches of coffee and spaghetti, but above all the mafia and the ostentation of luxury, which conveys a message of a population tied to organised crime.”In a video for the song, Cash drinks coffee from a takeaway paper cup, in what was perceived as another slight on Italian coffee culture.Cash said he loved Italy for “the food, architecture, design and coffee” and he had never imagined that the song would cause such offence.“I believe a lot in this song,” he said. “It has something magical. None of my team wanted it to come out because it was very different from my previous songs, but when I played it to my grandmother she started crying and I realised there was something special [about it].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its development chief, James Townley, said the idea came about after the organisation’s Spanish and Portuguese arm, Shine Iberia, discovered that almost every country plays musical chairs, realising it had global appeal.Townley said it chimed with the current times because nostalgia was popular “with the way the world is at the moment”, so audiences wanted escapism. Musical chairs fitted the bill as it “conjures up memories, probably, of a time that they were incredibly happy”.He said: “Kids and adults love it. It seems to put smiles on people’s faces the moment you talk about it, because it’s something most people have played or their kids are now playing.”Shine Iberia spent a year refining and supersizing the game for TV while keeping it true to the simplicity of the original. Tweaks include illuminated chairs and a “master chair” grand final prize.Townley said the music played during the game was an opportunity for more nostalgia, although it could provide a platform for new artists too.He said that in the current climate, it was not a surprise that nostalgic games owned by manufacturers such as Hasbro and Mattel and childhood pursuits were being discussed. In addition to Game of Chairs, Banijay has a new Channel 4 series about knitting presented by Tom Daley called The Game of Wool, while the BBC will have Chess Masters, fronted by Sue Perkins.Townley said that if a show had a universal theme or played into nostalgia it really helped it reach audiences, because viewers immediately recognised it, and global streamers such as Netflix and Amazon wanted shows that “travel around the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said reboot was “not a dirty word” as it took lots of creative renewal to update old series for current audiences and Banijay was actively discussing bringing back three or four more.Game of Chairs will be shown first in Europe, before rolling out on TV channels around the world.Explore more on these topicsGame showsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

This time, with Jimi Goodwin stillunable to return to his frontman rolefull time, the Williams brothers are more prominent on vocals. Sensible given anongoing tour, although not always successful here. Goodwin’s querulous, oddly comforting croon may not be at its strongest, but he brings an emotional heft to songs such as Orlando that’s missed whenever he’s not behind the mic.RenegadeandSaint Teresaare the most typically Doves moments on the album, impeccably constructed but a bit gloomy. Although their signature songBlack and White Townis a clarion call for choosing colour over monochrome, there’s little evidence of similar choices here. From its title onwards,Constellationsfor the Lonelyis about trying to find poetry in misery – and sometimes just finding more misery. WhenCold Dreamingborrows from Doves classicJetstream, it reminds you that there’s just not enough of the latter’s propulsive energy throughout this album, even if their prog-tinged productions are as impressively intricate as ever.Watch the video for Doves’ Cold Dreaming.Explore more on these topicsDovesThe ObserverPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

If you’re waiting forHarry Hill’s to do so – curious, perhaps, to see what late-period Hill has in store – might I suggest you don’t hold your breath? The big-collared one is 60 now, and New Bits and Greatest Hits moves the dial not a jot on the formula that has, since the 1990s, made him one of our silliest and most joyful entertainers.Perhaps you could identify a maturer sensibility in what passes for the theme of tonight’s nonsense, which anchors itself in a story about the death of Hill’s nan. But we’re some considerable distance from“trauma comedy”, as Hill uses the set-up mainly to justify loopy jokes about “bags for life” and his difficulty spelling nan’s name in flowers alongside the coffin.The other running gag derives from a play on the phrase “hearing dog”, and culminates in one of those moments – in which Hill specialises – when you double-take at the daftness of what you’re watching on a stage. “This isn’t a dream, you know,” he reminds us at one point – shortly after he’s been balancing on an ironing board, blasting his own fleshy face with a leaf-blower, while a puppet bird flaps around him from the end of a fishing line.Not everything here is that arresting. But it comes at you so pell-mell, in surprising shapes and sizes and always with devilry and delight on Hill’s part, that you’ll seldom stop chuckling for long. I will cherish his anecdote about an armed raid at an artisan butcher. So too a double-act with his ventriloquist’s dummy son, Gary, involving a performance of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay featuring a referee’s whistle inserted in the back of poor Gary’s head.Other returning features of Hill shows gone by include Stouffer the cat, Wagbo – and there are inflatable sausages too. A Wheel of Jokes shares Harry’s finest absurdist one-liners from yesteryear. As their brilliance reminds you, beneath all this offhand, forever-young delinquency works a true comedy craftsman, chiselling away at funny to make it funnier still. Tonight, the yield is substantial.At the Haymarket, Basingstoke, tonight; New Theatre Royal Lincoln on Wednesday;then touring.Explore more on these topicsComedyHarry HillreviewsShareReuse this content"

His looks were so outlandish, his costumes so teemingly various, they jam every inch of thishuge retrospective. He is a gilded boy-god, a Christmas pudding on legs, a prosthetised Venus of Willendorf. He is aleather-clad damein a zipped-up mask or a Regency dandy in pistachio pantaloons, their orange polka dots spreading upwards all over his face.View image in fullscreen‘A Regency dandy in pistachio pantaloons’: Fergus Greer’s Leigh Bowery Session 4 Look 19 August 1991.Photograph: © Fergus Greer. Courtesy Michael Hoppen GalleryHe fills the frame every time, in period photographs and videos, an enormous Australian with a shaved head and powerful calves, standing 6ft 3in and higher in towering platform soles painted scarlet or silver. Even though he is long gone, a sense of his colossal presence is apparent from the opening gallery, where a rack of Bowery’s earliest costumes gives an immediate sense of his size.He had left a quiet Melbourne suburb for London in 1980, and was wearing patchwork coats and tweed jackets with hillbilly hats. The first of many portraits in this show, a tentative drawing by the fashion designer Rachel Auburn, shows him in a baseball cap before he has shorn off his hair. For a moment, it seems as if this going to be a V&A show, gorgeously fashion-conscious, one costume after another in elegant vitrines.Bowery’s body is not just a complex instrument of self-portraiture; it becomes a living sculptureBut playing alongside is a hilarious film of Bowery and his pals, already post-punk, getting into frocks and police hats in the Stepney flat where he lived for the rest of his life, lined with kitschStar Trekwallpaper. Waiting for the dancerMichael Clarkto arrive, they turn gossipy and fractious. It is like a souped-up scene fromEastEnders.Soon we are at Taboo, the nightclub Bowery hosted in a Leicester Square basement on Thursdays, and Clark is flat on the floor with a half-clad lover. Snapshots cover the walls, music booms out. A beautiful monochrome photograph byDavid Gwinuttshows Bowery and his unrequited love,Trojan, in Picasso-inspired makeup and glittery hats outside the club. Trojan will die at 21 of an overdose.An early diary, Bowery’s handwriting cast on a large scale, like everything about him, ponders the question of whether to change image. It is almost poignant, when you consider what is to come. He will burst through drag and bondage, couture, carnival and masquerade to create personae without parallel. Here is his famousdalmatian dress and mask, the vast pinstripe suit caked with sequins he wore to Andrew Logan’s Alternative Miss World, theunitardhe used to conceal his wife, Nicola, during the “birthing performances”, when she would emerge from between his legs.View image in fullscreenA still from Dick Jewell’s video What’s Your Reaction to the Show?, 1988.Photograph: Dick JewellHeadpieces with glowing lightbulb ears, lace neck corsets, thick facial makeup that conceals him entirely, the trademark egg splat dripping down over his skull in every colour of latex and paint. His shapeshifting is sometimes reminiscent of the French artistClaude Cahun, especially the sunburst masks, padded skirts and goggle eyes. But Bowery’s body is not just a complex instrument of self-portraiture; it becomes a living sculpture: a majestic column, a strutting vector with apompom for a head, at one point so completely concealed in white Lycra that the spreadeagled form no longer appears human at all.The whole show is evocative not just of another era in music, dance and performance art, but also the media. There are vividly inventive magazine shoots here fori-D,BlitzandtheFace– currently having its own celebratory exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery – as well as for the press. And in a droll sequence for BBC One’sThe Clothes Show, Bowery spends a day at Harrods in spangled hoods and sequined trapeze dresses, parodying the stunned punters. Auntie would never broadcast such programmes today.Bowery went on to design costumes for Clark’s dancers, who perform on pointe in massive platforms and tights with the bum missing to music by the Fall in American video artist Charles Atlas’sjump-cutting film. Bowery toured with the troupe, bringing back wild variations on Noh costumes, plus an extra layer of couture cutting from Japan. (It is a pity this show makes nothing at all of his ability to stitch staggering get-ups from old curtains.)And then he becomes an artwork in himself, posing daily in front of a two-way mirror in Anthony d’Offay’s gallery in 1988. Cerith Wyn Evans’s contemporary video records every kind of vox pop response, from the baffled to the liberated, at the spectacle of the great exhibitionist as installation.There are many portraits in this show, climaxing, inevitably, with Lucian Freud’s nude studies of Bowery lolling, sleeping, or splayed on the ground with one leg cocked, lending a monumental defiance to both his own nakedness and Freud’s heavily worked painting. Bowery is said to have nicked an unfinished work from Freud.What is missing from this show is any hint of his wilful grotesquerie, either, pissing and defecating in small clubs onstage. Grimy footage of Bowery laboriously giving birth to his wife gives an inkling of his later performances, however, in stark contrast to Fergus Greer’s stylish photograph of the couple bound together.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy Michael Hoppen GalleryBut there are words as well as images atTate Modern. And perhaps this is where Bowery’s feelings emerge, in postcards to friends, all exuberant emotion and explicit humour, and in his A3 diaries. An entry from 1990, after a high hit of a show, reads: “Hungover, depressed, full of regrets, no money.” Bowery already knows he is going to die. He kept his illness secret, telling his sole confidant to explain his final absences as a trip abroad. Tell Them I’ve Gone to Papua New Guinea was the title of Fitzrovia Chapel’s Bowery show in 2022, on the site of the Middlesex hospital, where he died of an Aids-related illness in 1994.‘A living, breathing work of art’: Leigh Bowery by those who knew him bestRead moreThis retrospective grows harsher, darker. The shapes become more bulbous, the forms more exaggerated. Some of the images are sinister as well as ugly.Even in his civvies, Bowery liked to wear wigs, ill-fitting jumpers and a strip of tape to yank one eyebrow awry. He wanted, he said, to be like that “weirdo in the street that you tell your mum about”.But look at his denim jacket fluttering with gold feathers, which turn out to be nothing more than thousands of blond hairpins, or his beard of bristling pegs. Or the multicoloured ribbons wound around his naked body like shining reels at John Lewis. Make yourself new every day.This is what stuns, in the end – this extreme originality. No matter what body you were born with, or how shocking you might appear to others, Bowery’s work is a lesson in looking – and living – like nobody else.Leigh Bowery! is at Tate Modern, London, until 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsLeigh BoweryThe ObserverArtPerformance artTate ModernPaintingLucian FreudExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What could be more normal? Back in the 1970s, it wasn’t; or not for the 100,000 people deemed “sub-normal” and, under the feeble-minded (control) bill of 1912, segregated and put into institutions – often for life.Two groups of young people challenged this situation: residents of one of those institutions, Cardiff’s Ely hospital, and students from the city’s university. Together, they brought about a revolution that resulted in the closure of about 90-plus institutions and the creation of a model of supported living that today is copied around the world.Tim Green’s playHousematestells their story as an agit prop-style educational entertainment, combining fast-flowing action, snappy narration, sharp characterisations and live music. Joe Murphy (artistic director ofthe Sherman) and Ben Pettitt-Wade (artistic director ofHijinx, a theatre company specialising in inclusivity for neurodivergent artists) are the production’s joint directors; they showcase the form at its best, putting across a clear message with dramatic impact.We settle into our seats; 1970s hits are belted out by a rocking pub band (made up, it turns out, of the actors/characters we are about to meet). We sing along. The keynote of the evening is fun-inflected, collective engagement, counterpointed by highs of emotion and lows of horror and indignation.The story centres on the friendship between student Jim Mansell and hospital resident Alan Duncan and their shared love of rock’n’roll – and its consequences. The two meet on the day when Alan and his friend Heather discover they are to be taken out somewhere they have never been by someone they have never met. The place is the park; the person is Jim.First among equals in the impressively well-balanced, nine-strong ensemble are Peter Mooney’s brilliant Jim and Gareth John’s determined Alan – the strength of their connection radiates from the stage. Production and subject matter alike show, practically and affectively, how individuals taking action can transform lives and society.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We meet him briefly at the novel’s start – still alive – night-walking as if he could “never be easy”.After the announcement of the news in assembly, the day marches on unimpeded, with brutal precision. Chadwick’s book is not only underpinned by an incisive faithfulness to details – canteen cutlery like “fish poured from a net”, 1980s “ceiling swirls like crests of royal icing” – but an unwavering adherence to her own time-stamped chapter form. Leaping between the perspectives of students and teachers, it transpires that the children’s chief concerns include the forthcoming timetable changes, or the injustice of the deceased teacher no longer marking their projects.The cast of children on the precipice of adulthood are caught in the crosshairs of grownup politicsThose more deeply troubled are further beyond reach: the enigmatic, enthralling Tin, who “made the hot, empty days sparkle like broken glass”. Tin has suffered a tragedy of her own, making the event seem like history repeating – but her classmates are convinced her upset pertains to her boyfriend Jonah and best friend Robin, together involved in “a Sunday night of bonus shock and betrayal”.Graver tensions are also at work. Beneath the day’s onslaught of normality, it becomes clear that Mr Ardennes was on one side of a split between a more progressive faction of teachers and a more tyrannical group, spearheaded by Gomme – nicknamed “the Mad Penguin”. This divide serves to be microcosmic of 1980s society as a whole: workers railing against the authorities.Against a backdrop of Thatcher and the Falklands war, Chadwick’s cast of children, on the precipice of adulthood, are caught in the crosshairs of adult politics. Each represents a different class archetype and these are shrewdly – if slightly cruelly – drawn. In the refraction of their various viewpoints, Chadwick is adept at finding the lesser tragedies bursting at the seams, amounting to a clever and compassionate debut.Dark Like Underby Alice Chadwick is published by Daunt (£10.99).

The third feature fromPalo Alto-director Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis, niece of Sofia),The Last Showgirlis a wisp of a thing, clocking in at under 90 minutes and shot in just 18 days. The film’s structure, more a series of vignettes than a linear narrative, feels like the fleeting reflections of a life captured in the facets of a mirror ball. It’s initially tempting to dismiss the picture, like its central character with her breathy, little-girl voice, as superficial. But there’s a bruising cumulative power to this melancholy little paean to an ending era. And Anderson, whose character is left questioning not just what the future holds, but also the costly choices that shaped her past, is excellent, delivering a performance that has single-handedly rewritten the way she is viewed as an actor.Shelly has only ever been a showgirl; with well over 30 years of service under her garter belt, she is, by no small margin, the longest-serving cast member of Le Razzle Dazzle, an old school Vegas spectacle full of rhinestones, forced smiles and barely there costumes. The show is the last of its kind. It is, says Shelly firmly, a descendent of Parisian Lido culture. But Vegas punters, it seems, no longer have the appetite for showbiz cultural relics, even if they come dolled up in ostrich feathers and nipple tassels. Le Razzle Dazzle has already lost half of its weekly shows to an X-rated adult circus. And now comes the news, delivered by the socially maladroit stage manager Eddie (a lovely, low-key, sad-sack turn from Dave Bautista) that the casino’s management has decided to close the show for good. For most of the girls, who view the gig as just another job that pays the rent, it’s an annoyance. But for Shelly, whose whole identity is wrapped up in her status as a Razzle Dazzle showgirl, it’s an existential emergency.View image in fullscreen‘Terrific’: Jamie Lee Curtis in The Last Showgirl.Photograph: APWith just two weeks to go before the show closes and uncertainty looming, Shelly weighs her options. Her age – she tries for 36, admits to 42 (“Distance helps,” she twitters) but in fact, she’s 57 years old – counts against her. But she hauls herself on to the audition circuit anyway. Before we even see her at the film’s opening, we hear her – heels clip-clopping purposefully as she strides on to a stage to try out for a jaded producer (Jason Schwartzman). The alternative is the route taken by her friend, former showgirl Annette (a terrific Jamie Lee Curtis, brassy, brusque and baked to a crisp by the desert sun), who now serves cocktails on the casino floor in an ill-fitting tailcoat and tights so shiny they make her legs look like clingfilm-wrapped ham. To complicate matters, Shelly is also struggling to rebuild a relationship with her semi-estranged adult daughter Hannah (Billie Lourd), whose childhood she largely missed in order to pursue her dream of a stage career.It’s tempting to draw parallels between Anderson’s performance and that of Demi Moore inThe Substance– both, after all, are characters whose worth to the entertainment industry has been linked to their youth and beauty, played by actors who had to deal with the same entrenched attitudes. But while Moore’s prosthetics-wrestling, Grand Guignol gurning is a lot of fun, Anderson’s is the more satisfying turn, a performance that speaks volumes in small details. There is an elegant pair of companion scenes – one early, one towards the end of the film – in which Shelly leaves voicemails for Hannah. The first is all fluttery panic, like a butterfly caught under glass; the second is sober, considered, each word weighted. There’s a whole character arc just in these two messages.Watch a trailer for The Last Showgirl.While as a piece of storytelling, it can feel flimsy, many of Coppola’s directing choices are perceptive enough to add real depth to the picture. The score, by Andrew Wyatt, is lush, romantic and steeped in the kind of old Hollywood,Busby Berkeleynostalgia that shapes Shelly’s self-image. And the rough-around-the-edges Super 16mm cinematography works particularly well: the shimmering, gauzy lens flare softens the strip malls and wasteland parking lots of daytime Vegas in the same way that the layers of sequin-dusted tulle bring a synthetic magic to the tired and tacky reality of Le Razzle Dazzle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, so much can be seen not only as it is but also in the process of becoming different.This makes Ann Yee’s production ofOtherlandan extraordinary 3D testimony, a valuable gathering of information and a finally unsatisfactory drama. Chris Bush, author ofStanding at the Sky’s Edge, one of Sheffield Theatres’s biggest musical hits, has, without writing an autobiography, drawn on her experiences as a trans woman to produce a twofold story that examines the particular question of what people think it is to be a woman, and considers what is it to become other than your accustomed self.Harry, christened Henry, marries Jo, an adored college girlfriend, before realising that a real life demands becoming a woman, a discovery that leads to the end of the marriage. Living as Harriet, before transitioning, she is greeted with wounding bewilderment from her mother (couldn’t the person she thinks of her son stop distracting people’s attention?) and with sniggers and insults – “What is that? – from strangers. Fizz Sinclair’s Harry is tender, graceful and touching.Meanwhile her former wife – Jade Anouka at full sizzle – falls for another woman (a beguiling Amanda Wilkin) and agrees, against all her former wishes, to have a baby. In doing so she becomes for a time a stranger to herself and her new wife.There is plenty of insight inOtherland, including the observation that foetuses are routinely given the dimensions of middle-class food: they may be compared to an olive but never to a turkey twizzler. Yet Bush too heavily underlines her significant points. Halfway through, the play’s naturalism is briefly abandoned. Fly Davis’s design splits open to reveal a murky pool containing an early mermaid version of Harry, caught in the net of men who classify her as a monster. Meanwhile, Jo, entering the world of maternity care, is reimagined as a robotic baby-machine.Throughout, an onstage chorus is put to just the use it shouldn’t be, unless describing something undetectable. It tells the audience what to see: “Harry’s shoulders stoop as she turns in on herself.” Fizz Sinclair does not need the commentary – she is particularly powerful when suggesting suppressed pain and quiet withdrawal, which makes her final happiness the more buoyant.View image in fullscreen‘Two good reasons to see anything’: Tamsin Greig and Celia Imrie in Backstroke.Photograph: Johan PerssonAnna Mackmin’s new play,Backstroke, starring Tamsin Greig and Celia Imrie – who are two good reasons to see anything – moves through eddies of wordspin and whirlpools of interest. In tracing the coming and going, guttering and flaring relationship between a middle-aged woman and her dying mother, the play, directed by Mackmin herself, comes in myopically close to each scene. The dialogue is sharp but the action gets jammed.Ab Fablong ago dealt the death blow to the idea that daughters of the late 20th century were going to follow tradition and be more rebellious than their staid mothers. This daughter, Bo, played byTamsin Greig, is not as censorious as earnest Saffy, but she is furrowed. Well, she must have had a hard time at school: Bo is short for Boudicca. Greig, straight-faced but with windmill hands, is made up just right by designer Lez Brotherston in unyielding denims and a bobbly capacious jumper that her mother deems “lesbian”. She deploys her singular calm as an actor to appear both intent and distracted – pulled between her own troubled adopted daughter and her ailing mother; tugged by exasperation, affection, admiration and desperation.Seen at first inert in a hospital bed, stilled by a stroke, Imrie springs into full embarrassing life as she relives her days with her daughter: dependent, neglectful, occasionally affectionate. With flowing grey hair (shorthand for drifting wits), a fringed shawl and ankle-length dress, she talks about her “dillypot” in magnificent, mad and maddening detail, informing her shuddering daughter that “whenever your daddy went down on me” she had a fantasy about a hare. As she prepares for a few days away she dimples while announcing she is packing only one tiny travelling loom.Lucy Briers puts in a neat cameo as a sour-faced ultra-Christian nurse who dispenses aggression as if it were an act of grace, sweet-talking her patient as she feeds her the cherry yoghurt she hates. She is completely credible. As is the flickering emotion between the two stars – their very lack of consistency is authentic. Though it is clear from the beginning how this is going to end, shifts of feeling and slow disclosure of shared secrets make the evening twist unpredictably. The trouble is that when every small thing becomes an event, propulsion is overwhelmed.Backstroke?

Paroled prisoner Lang (Eddie Peng) is hired to round up the area’s many stray dogs to prettify the place, but his sensitive personality leads him to hide one spirited canine in his own home. There’s some great doggy acting – and the monosyllabic Peng is pretty good too – as the duo realise they are kindred spirits. Despite the grim setting, it’s a surprisingly light-hearted drama. SWThe Wicked Lady (Leslie Arliss, 1945), 6pm, Talking Pictures TVWith its upper-class romance, lavish dresses and heaving bodices, Leslie Arliss’s 1945 period melodrama is typical of Gainsborough studios’ populist output. This is one of its best efforts, with Margaret Lockwood having a ball as the selfish, scheming Barbara (“always one for excitement”), who steals the dull but rich fiance of her best friend (Patricia Roc) then turns her hand to highway robbery. There, she joins forces with bad boy Captain Jack (a lubricious James Mason) and things go even further downhill. SWLynn + Lucy (Fyzal Boulifa, 2019), 11.55pm, BBC TwoChildhood friends Lynn (Roxanne Scrimshaw) and Lucy (Nichola Burley) are still close as grownups.

But when the baby dies suddenly, and Lucy’s partner is arrested, the bond between them is stretched to breaking point. Fyzal Boulifa’s debut feature is a sharply observed tale of lies and judgment, in which moral certainties are hard to come by and social pressures can twist relationships, with the two leads giving performances of subtlety and emotional range.

In 2002, she switched her focus from news to art, though the boundaries between the two are porous. She took this photograph in 2011 as part of a project that featured professional Iranian female singers who, since the 1979 revolution, had beenbannedfrom performing or recording solo because of the regime’s interpretation of Islamic law.Tavakolian made images of the singers as if they were in recording studios, mouthing their words or, as she described it, “performing in their mind in front of a large audience”; she also made imaginary album covers, like this one, for her muted divas. “For me,” she said, “a woman’s voice represents a power that if you silence it, imbalances society, and makes everything deform. I let Iranian women singers perform through my camera while the world has never heard them.” The project was called Listen. The ban on solo singing is still in place.Tavakolian’s image is included in a new exhibition of images from the Magnum agency devoted to Women Power. Some of the photos were taken by pioneering female photographers (Inge Morath, Eve Arnold), and others by men (Robert Capa, Elliott Erwitt) “who have been able to narrate the female condition”. The Magnum agency itself was not always synonymous with feminism. I rememberonce askingArnold how she had been treated as a young woman among those alpha male war photographers. “I was patted on the head by them, of course,” she said, “[Inge and I] both had problems with all these difficult men. But I recently had my 90th birthday and I’ve been getting all kinds of faxes telling me what fun we had… So I guess we must have done…”Women Power is at Villa Bassi Rathgeb Museum, Abano Terme, Italy from 22 March to 21 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big picturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re not alone in that, of course, or even the worst offenders: no wine term is as insidiously irritating as ‘pan-fried’ or ‘handcooked’. Still, it can be grating when something unexceptional, even a little banal about the where and how of a wine’s production is presented as the key to its unique brilliance. I’ve grown wearily sceptical in recent years, for example, of the incessant use of ‘cool climate’ as a term of praise, not least when it’s used to describe wines from places that aren’t, in the global context, very cool at all. Still, there are moments when its use is both factually justified and helpful in preparing potential buyers for a particular set of stylistic cues – and Virgin Wine’s new, pristine, scintillatingly fresh and pure-fruited sauvignon blanc made by Iona in South Africa’s coolest region, Elgin, is undeniably one of those moments.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.M&S Lyme Bay Bacchus, Devon, England 2023 (£15,Marks & Spencer)English wine – to borrow from the title of drinks writr Henry Jeffreys’ witty, gossipy 2023 book on its latter-day transformation from amateurish hobbyist’s playground to serious, venture-capital-infused business – is all about making the best of Vines in a Cold Climate. And for all that our domestic summers may, on average, have grown significantly warmer over the past few decades (and, in the process, made it much easier to ripen grapes much more consistently from year to year), wine production even in southern England is still very much on the northern margins. Necessarily, then, the wines made there are still marked by the high acidity and low alcohol that are the key character traits associated with cool-climate winemaking – characteristics that are very much attributes in the two styles with which England has so far had most success: tongue-tinglingly energetic sparkling wines (such as the reliable, well-priced Coates & Seely Brut Reseve NV; £36.95,coatesandseely.com); and crisp, dry, spring-meadow aromatic whites (such as M&S’s leafy, grassy bacchus).Tapanappa Foggy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir, Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia, Australia 2022 (from £36.22,spiritly.com;simplywinesdirect.co.uk)Where English winemakers have struggled is getting red grapes to ripen sufficiently to make appealing red wines. Even in warm, sunny years, English red wines will always be at the paler, lighter, crunchier, more evidently acidic end of the spectrum. But there are times when that light style comes with enough red-fruited finesse to make some delightfully refreshing drinking – both the super pale, hibiscus and rosehip-tangy 9% abv Don’t Feed The Ponies Vol 7 – Billy 2023 and the slightly darker, slightly fuller, slightly softer but still crisp, red-berry and redcurrant-filled Pinot Noir 2022 from South Devon’s Sandridge Barton (£21.99 and £35, respectively,sandridgebarton.com) being prime examples. The stubborn cliché of Australian winegrowing, by contrast, is that it’s all about rich shiraz grown in energy-sapping heat, but the country has pockets of cool that are proving ideal for excessive-heat-hating pinot noir: not least the Foggy Hill Vineyard on South Australia’s Fleurieu Peninsula, home to Tapanappa’s superbly slinky, complex, Burgundy-like red.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Slices of fat, brown-skinned onions, now peeled and sliced and on their long, long journey from crisp, white and pungent to sweet, golden and soft enough to crush between thumb and forefinger.I am not exaggerating when I say the process is slow. Try to hurry, or forget the occasional stir, and your onions will end up hard and singed. Take your time and they will emerge sticky and golden, with the bonus of a thin layer of sweet goo on the bottom of the pan.These onions are to be a filling for a tart. Not a quiche-like egg and milk filling, but one that’s purely of onions, thyme and cheese – a heavily veined creamy blue, at that.This will be a slim tart that can be eaten for lunch with a winter leaf salad (spinach, red chicory and frisée, perhaps) or simply cut into squares and wolfed with a cold beer. Either way, it is not a job to be hurried.Meanwhile, there are slices of sweet potato in the oven, soon to be tossed with a miso dressing. The plan is that they will come from the oven slightly caramelised to sit on top of a mound of sticky rice.The miso dressing works well with maris pipers and is also a useful one for tossing with green, chubby heads of pak choi. Which, incidentally, I would steam so that you can get the contrast between the sweet juicy stalks and the sweet, aromatic syrup.Onion tartYou can fill the raw pastry shell with the onions and bake it, but you will get crisper pastry if you cook the tart shell first, then fill it. Pretty much any cheese is suitable here, but a creamy blue, such as gorgonzola orstichelton, adds a deliciously piquant note. Best to avoid saltier blues like roquefort for this one. You will also need a rectangular 20 x 30cm tart tin.Serves 6. Ready in 90 minutesFor the pastry:butter90gplain flour150gegg yolk1parmesan4 tbsp, gratedwater1-3 tbspFor the filling:onions1.2kgolive oil3 tbspthyme leaves2 tbspgarlic2 clovessherry vinegar1 tbspcreamy blue cheese(such as stilton or stichelton) 175gFirst make the pastry. Cut the butter into small pieces, then put it into a food processor together with the flour and a good pinch of salt. Reduce to fine crumbs, then add the egg yolk, grated parmesan and as much water as needed to make a firm but rollable dough (usually 1-3 tbsp). Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured board and bring together into a ball. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.For the filling, peel and halve the onions and cut into thin segments. Warm the oil in a large, deep saucepan. Add the onions and let them cook, partially covered by a lid, for a good 25 minutes until soft and golden. Stir them regularly.While the onions are cooking, chop and stir in the thyme leaves. Peel and carefully grate the garlic and stir into the onions. When the onions are pale gold in colour, sticky and soft, stir in the sherry vinegar and a grinding of salt and black pepper.Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll it out on a lightly floured board to fit the tart tin. Lower it into place, usher it up the sides of the tin and trim any overhanging pastry.Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and place an empty baking sheet in to heat up. Loosely line the pastry with kitchen foil or baking parchment and fill with baking beans (I use old coffee beans), then bake on top of the heated baking sheet for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the paper and baking beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes until dry to the touch.Crumble the cheese into pieces about the size of a hazelnut. Transfer the onions to the baked tart case and distribute the cheese among them. Bake on top of the hot baking sheet for about 30 minutes until the surface is golden.Leave to settle for 15 minutes, then cut into pieces with a large, sharp knife.Sweet potato with miso and maple syrup dressingView image in fullscreen‘I usually eat this as a light supper with rice’: sweet potato with miso and maple syrup dressing.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThis warmly aromatic glaze for sweet potato is at its best when it is almost caramelised (and why I suggest cooking the potatoes on foil, so the pan is easy to clean). I usually eat this as a light supper with rice, but the sweet orange potato slices and their dressing make an interesting side order for grilled chicken.Serves 2, with rice.Ready in 1 hoursweet potatoes500gwhite miso paste2 tbspginger40g, freshgarlic2 cloveslight soy sauce3 tbspsoft brown sugar1 tbspmaple syrup1 tbspmirin1 tbspgroundnut or vegetable oil4 tbspHeat the oven to 200c/gas mark 6. Line a large baking sheet with kitchen foil. Peel the sweet potatoes, slice into rounds roughly 1.5cm thick, then lay them out on the foil in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes until tender. Test with a metal skewer – if the point goes through them effortlessly, they are soft enough.While the potatoes bake, make the dressing. Put the miso paste in a small mixing bowl. Peel and finely grate the ginger into it, then do the same with the garlic. Stir in the soy sauce, brown sugar, maple syrup, mirin and oil, then mix well to a loose dressing.When the potatoes are ready, pour the dressing over and turn them with kitchen tongs to evenly coat. Return to the oven and bake for a further 20-25 minutes until the sauce has started to caramelise. Serve with steamed rice and, if you wish, chopped coriander.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater recipesrecipesShareReuse this content"
