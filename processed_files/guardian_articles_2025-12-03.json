Now, at 96, she’s stealing the show in Eleanor the Great. What’s her secret? ‘Be a looker-ahead’Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTShareIt is surely a comfort to anyone still awaiting mega-success to know that June Squibb was in her mid-80s before she hit the big time. Her role as a foul-mouthed matriarch in the 2013 film Nebraska brought her an Oscar nomination, and she had her first leading role in last year’s action comedy, Thelma. Now she’s playing the lead again, in the new film Eleanor the Greatandshe’s currently in rehearsals for a show on Broadway. Is Squibb, who has just turned 96, sick of talking about her late-peaking success? “I think people are interested, so no, it’s not a bad thing,” she says. “But it is funny, because when I first came to New York – it was the 50s – I did The Boy Friend, a musical, and I was a big hit.” But it was theatre, she concedes. “The film thing is so different.”In Eleanor the Great, Scarlett Johansson’s directorial debut, Squibb plays Eleanor Morgenstein, a 94-year-old woman who, mourning the loss of her best friend Bessie, moves from Florida to New York to be near her daughter. Encouraged to make new friends, Eleanor goes to the local Jewish community centre to join a choir, but the woman belting out Stephen Sondheim is enough to make anyone rush for the door. “Oh god,” mutters Eleanor, backing away, before being scooped up by the Holocaust survivors group, meeting at the same time, who erroneously assume she’s one of them. Lonely and grieving, US-born Eleanor finds herself passing off Bessie’s survival story as her own.I spent a whole day in bed with a guy.  We started laughing. We didn’t even know each other!“I just loved her from the beginning,” she says, speaking via Zoom from the rented New York apartment she stays in for theatre rehearsals. “All the quirks. She’s just so full of everything. I mean, she’s not very nice sometimes, and I like that because it gives you something.” Eleanor’s awful lie gets dangerously out of control when Nina – a young journalism student she befriends, played by British actor Erin Kellyman – wants to bring her story to a wider audience.View image in fullscreen‘She’s wonderful, very honest, very open’ … with Scarlett Johansson at Cannes this year.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageIt was a lovely shoot, says Squibb. Johansson was “wonderful. She’s very honest, very open.” Squibb and Kellyman became real-life friends, put up in the same apartment building by the production. Squibb would invite Kellyman to dinner at her place, or to dinner parties Squibb gave at the Joe Allen brasserie, the theatre district institution. “Erin met a lot of my friends from New York, people that I’ve known for years.” Does Squibb have lots of younger friends too? “I do,” she says. “Well, at my age, everybody’s pretty much younger.”Squibb is great company, funny and wise, the sort of person you could ask anything: sex, politics and religion are not off-limits. “Everyone thinks older people aren’t sexual but I think about sex,” Eleanor tells Erin. What about Squibb? “I think so, sure,” she says with a smile. “If I see a handsome young man, I recognise that this is a handsome young man. I don’t think I dwell on it maybe the way I did when I was younger, but we’re still thinking about it.”How does she feel about the political situation in the US, and other parts of the world? “It worries me – and I’ve been through a lot. I’ve seen a lot. I think the world is in a really scary place. I’m just appalled. Now people are brazenly showing the swastika all over. I mean, that’s scary.”Johansson cast real-lifeHolocaustsurvivors in the support group, including Sami Steigmann, a prominent speaker and educator. And Rita Zohar, who plays Bessie, was born in a concentration camp in what is now Ukraine. Steigmann especially, Squibb says, “was so dear. He was welcoming me, rather than me saying, ‘I’m here and you’re coming in [to my film].’ That I loved. It was a wonderful experience, not at all what I thought it would be. There’s no doom and gloom. We were there, we worked together and did our jobs.”Squibb was a teenager when the second world war ended. She remembers seeing photographs in news magazines of concentration camps being liberated. They would stay with her all her life. “It was horrifying.”Some critics feel that to fake a Holocaust experience is an especially dreadful kind of lie and morally irredeemable. Squibb is more understanding. “I do think that Eleanor’s need was to be close to Bessie and [the support group is] where she needs to do this. I can understand that. It does bring her closer.” The idea would seem to have its critics in the film industry too –Johansson said this week that one of the project’s financial backers pulled out when she refused to drop the Holocaust elements.Grief is a big theme of the film – not just Eleanor’s, but also that of Erin, who has recently lost her mother. At the age of 96, Squibb must have had to learn a lot about dealing with grief, not just the loss of friends and colleagues, but her husband of 40 years. “Well, I am a great looker-ahead,” she says. “I always think, ‘What’s going to happen tomorrow?’ I don’t say it’s easy. I don’t mean that at all, but I think that’s what I do. When my husband died, I was more interested in protecting my son, who was in his 20s. He wasn’t a child, but it affected him tremendously. So rather than suffering grief, I was trying to help him get through it.”View image in fullscreenDinner at her place … with Erin Kellyman and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Eleanor the Great.Photograph: PRSquibb grew up in Vandalia, the small city in Illinois, where her father ran a clothing shop, before joining the navy during the war and later setting up a successful insurance company. Her mother had played the piano at a cinema showing silent movies, then stayed at home to look after Squibb, an only child. She felt, she says, “from the time I had any thoughts, that I was an actress. It never occurred to me that I was anything else. I have no idea where it came from.” She took any drama or dance classes she could, then joined the Cleveland Play House. Her parents weren’t that happy. “My father was rather proud of me, but my mother always hated it. I think she would have loved it if I had just stayed in Vandalia my whole life and did the usual, gotten married, had children. That’s what she wanted.”View image in fullscreenTheatre trouper … Squibb in the 1950s.Photograph: Courtesy: June SquibbSquibb did get married in her early 20s, and converted toJudaism– something she says felt important to her, not because her new Jewish husband or his family expected it. It was “a wonderful experience”. The marriage only lasted for seven years, but Squibb’s faith remained, even though her second husband, Charles Kakatsakis, an acting teacher, was not Jewish. “I’m very pleased and proud to be able to say I’m Jewish.”By her late 20s, she had moved to New York and was working in the theatre, including in Gypsy on Broadway in 1959, in which she played the stripper Electra. “I had seen it early on, and it just knocked me out. I loved Ethel Merman in it. She was a force of nature. I loved the show, and to be going into it – wow! That number, You Gotta Get a Gimmick, every night it just blew the house away.”She made extra money with modelling, for trade shows. “Like automobile shows – I would be the host with shorts and the low-cut top and fishnet hose.” With a laugh, she says she also did photographs for true-life confessions in magazines. That sounds quite racy. “Well, it was. It was funny. I remember one day this guy and I spent the whole day in bed together and we started laughing. We don’t even know each other.”For a young woman working in the 50s and 60s, sexual harassment was somewhat inevitable. “But I also was rather naive, and I think I didn’t see a lot of it. But of course, there was. I was a dancer, too, so it was always no clothes – just the legs out all the time!” When the #MeToo movement started, she remembers talking to a friend who had been a dancer at the same time. “I said, ‘How did we handle it?’ We both agreed that we – and other women we knew – knew what the line was, and you didn’t go over it.”View image in fullscreenHer first lead role …  with Richard Roundtree in 2024’s Thelma.Photograph: NBC UniversalSquibb was in her early 60s when she got her first film role, in Woody Allen’s Alice, and soon she was racking up small roles in big films – working with Martin Scorsese in The Age of Innocence, with Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman, with Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt. Did she feel nervous going on to film sets with such names? “No, it was always just work,” she says. “I had the script. I learned it and I was ready to go.” It helped, she laughs, that “I always feel my role is the leading role, no matter what it is. I have that ego that whatever I’m doing is the important thing in this film.”Now Squibb is in the leading film roles, and long may it continue. She seems to have that theatre trouper resilience and work ethic, ingrained since her early training. While shooting Eleanor the Great, Squibb came down with bronchitis but, in Johansson’s words, “powered through”. She says: “I have always had a stamina and energy, and I don’t think I’ve lost that, not completely anyway. When I was working, I always managed to find the stamina to keep going, whether it was a matinee into an evening or whatever.” She has, she adds, always had a feeling “that I can do anything”.Eleanor the Great is in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmScarlett JohanssonAgeingHolocaustJudaisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Overwhelmed by all the different smells she can pick up on her walkies. Convinced that this is going to be THE BEST DAY EVER. Spoilt for choice as she is surrounded by countless enticing sticks. Yet somehow she always manages to grab the wrong end of every one. I suppose you could call that her special talent.There were any number of angles onthe budgetKemi could have chosen at prime minister’s questions. The chancellor’s promise in last year’s budget that she wouldn’t be coming back with more tax increases this time round would have been a start. Rachel Reeves had even made a commitment not to make further freezes to the tax thresholds. All this might have made for a tricky session for Keir Starmer, who is trying to convince us all that last year’s budget never happened. That we have started from a new ground zero.And yet. And yet Kemi just can’t help herself. She is a sucker for any conspiracy theory going. The wilder the better. It’s what X was made for. Night after night, scrolling through social media for inspiration. So what we got from the leader of the opposition was madness. Though, like many people, she assumes it is the rest of the world who are crazy. At one point she suggested Reeves was in “la-la land”. Pots and kettles.Kemi began with theresignation of Richard Hughesas chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Dark forces were at work, she suggested. There was more to his departure than met the eye. He had been pushed by men and women in grey suits. Only he hadn’t. It may be true that the Treasury wasn’t Hughes’s biggest supporter, but he left because the organisation he ran had made the biggest cock-up in its 15-year history. The OBR has one job. Not to leak its forecasts before the budget. That’s the “responsibility” bit of the OBR. So building an amateur-hour website that could easily be accessed was not a good look.No matter. Did the prime minister think the person in charge of a failing organisation should resign, Kemi continued. Dear oh dear. Can we think of an organisation that is failing more badly than the government? Oh yes, the Tory party. Polling at record lows. Haemorrhaging support to Reform by the day. There are now more than 20 Tory MPs and ex-MPs who have signed up to Team Nige.Much more of this and there won’t be anything left of the Tories. And who is in charge? It sounded very much as if Kemi was making an appeal to Kemi to resign. Her subconscious plays tricks on her sometimes. Demands the truth. Though Kemi herself was oblivious. She was laughing as if she was having the time of her life. As if she was nailingPMQs. There weren’t so many laughs coming from the benches behind her. Many Tory MPs are all too aware of their leader’s limitations.And needless to say, these demands for resignations – Kemi is now up to two or three a day – were not Conservative policy when they were in government. Otherwise Kemi would have been demanding her own sacking much earlier than today. Not to mention that of many of her colleagues. Starting with Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor. As work and pensions secretary he had presided over record increases in the welfare budget. And Kemi was calling outLabourfor a Benefits Street budget. Go figure.This was all just for starters, though. Because Kemi was also convinced that somehow all the budget briefings – the 2p rise in income tax that never happened – were proof of massive stock market manipulation. All this had been done to game the system. Civil servants in the Treasury had made billions. The chancellor herself should be prosecuted for market abuse.Literally no one except Kemi believes this. Not even her pet Melster, though he has to go along with her as he gets a bit scared of her when she’s this mad and angry. What actually happened was that the government didn’t know what it was doing. It was chaos, pure and simple. There was no hidden hand at work. Just a Treasury in panic mode as it tried to work out how to land its budget.For herpiece de resistance, Kemi rewrote history. Just to make her present make sense. For the last year she has been trying to persuade us that the country’s finances were in a desperate state. And most of us didn’t need much convincing. We feel it every day, even if we may not entirely agree on the culprit. Labour may be more incompetent than hoped but it was the Tories who did the most damage. Yet for Kemi’s market manipulation conspiracies she is now trying to persuade us that the economy is actually in tip-top shape. That Reeves is raising taxes just for the hell of it. She is not even bothered that this has been contradicted by the OBR. Kemi believes what she wants to believe.All this left Keir in his happy place. There was just one difficult moment when he ignored the awkwardness of being newly converted to the benefits of lifting the two-child cap, having previously suspended his MPs who had voted in favour of it. But for the most part he could just let Kemi rant on. Embarrassing herself and her backbenchers as time and again she missed the point. This should have been an easy win for her and she messed up. “She’s lost the plot,” Keir observed. It was hard to disagree.That should have been an end to it. But curiously, the speaker had granted the Melster an urgent question on Hughes’s resignation, even though we all knew exactly why he had resigned. It gave everyone something to do, I guess. The Melster had been hoping the chancellor might answer for herself but Rachel had done a runner straight after PMQs. She is looking done in. This hasn’t been her best week.Instead, it was left to James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to deputise, as he had for another budget UQ on Monday. He deadpanned yet again, revealing that the chancellor had been happy for the OBR to reveal its forecasts. The Melster looked downcast. He had been told by Kemi there was another conspiracy to be uncovered. There wasn’t. If it looks like a clusterfuck, the chances are it is a clusterfuck.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKemi BadenochKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsConservativesLabourRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

But at least in my set-up there are two adults. In families with only one earner it must be especially frustrating to be charged as much as a family where there are two.Vaila McClure from the charity Gingerbread, which campaigns for lone parents, says they are often low earners and have pressures on their finances. “So many single-parent families really struggle to afford to go out,” she says. “Single-parent families shouldn’t be overlooked – they are still part of society. Money shouldn’t be a barrier for them because of unfair ticket pricing.”Over the summer the charity ran a scheme with the National Trust, which runs stately homes and other historical attractions across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to offer free tickets to single-parent families. McClure says for some it was their only day trip. “People may dismiss it and say ‘it’s just a day out,’ but it’s really, really important for families to be able to spend time together,” she says. “Children are missing out on that cultural capital, on having fun and on just doing the things that their friends are doing.”McClure says thinking is still dominated by the traditional two-adult and 2.4 children set-up, even though that is not representative of every family. In 2024,almost a quarter of the UK’s 8.3 million familieswith dependent children had a single parent – a total of 2 million. A survey done on behalf of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) found for41% of people, family tickets “rarely match my family structure”.Not every attraction or activity has a family ticket. Some, such as the big Merlin group attractions – which include Legoland and Alton Towers – charge an individual price for day tickets and you simply pay for the number of people who are going. But there are lots of places that advertise a family ticket, which you would assume offers a discount.I chose a selection from around the UK to look at. Because of the time of year, I included ice rinks and cinemas as well as days outside. For each I looked at full-price tickets and then how big a discount was available on the family ticket. At most places children below a certain age get free admission – as it varies, in all cases I included children who needed a paid-for ticket. I used online prices for weekend dates in the current season.View image in fullscreenGingerbread and the National Trust ran a scheme in the summer to offer free tickets to single-parent families.Photograph: Stephen R Johnson/AlamyThe first thing that struck me was that many of the single-parent offers were aimed at people with three children. This was the case at the ice rinks currently outside at Hampton Court Palace in London and at the Boxpark in Liverpool. At Hampton Court a family of two adults and two children could save £12, or 16% of the full price, with a £61 family ticket. The same ticket is available for one adult with three children. Their saving is smaller, at just under 10%, as children’s tickets cost less, and for a single-parent family with one or two children the family ticket is more expensive than separate ones.You also need three children to benefit from the family tickets on sale at branches of Cineworld, at the Making of Harry Potter tour and at the Bristol Zoo Project. Official figures show that in 2024, just 14% of single-parent families had three or more children, so most will not benefit from these offers.The majority of single-parent families (54%) have one child, while 32% have two children. Although not typically described as family tickets, there are some discounts available for an adult with one child, though these are principally aimed at parents of young children. Cineworld, for example, offers deals for junior films. Deals from outside organisations – such as National Rail and Kellogg’s – often reduce prices for two people, but attractions do not seem to bother.When I compared prices for families with two kids and looked at how big the discount was for a single parent compared with the discount for two parents, in several cases it was less.AtUlster Folk Museum, for example, a family ticket for four represents a saving of 24%, while a family of three saves just 11%. Elsewhere, the family version of Scotland’s Explorer Pass, which is run by Historic Environment Scotland and offers entrance to along list of sitesover a 14-day period, gives a 61% saving to two adults and two children and 10% to one adult and two children.A spokesperson on behalf of National Museums NI, which runs the folk museum, says it has to balance affordability with its responsibility to protect and care for Northern Ireland’s national collection, and that prices are continually reviewed.“We work to ensure that visiting our museums is accessible, enjoyable and great value for all families,” they say. “Recognising that families come in all shapes and sizes, we provide flexible small-group ticket options and benchmark our pricing carefully across the sector.”Historic Environment Scotland says the family option on the Explorer Pass is priced as two adults, meaning children in effect go free. “However, we will also be reviewing this price structure to ensure our products provide optimum accessibility for our family markets,” a spokesperson says. At Edinburgh Castle, which it also runs, a single parent with two children gets a slightly better deal than a two-adult family, saving 10.5% over individual tickets, compared with 10%. Yet the spokesperson acknowledges a range of family price tickets “does not cover all family combinations, and we are in the process of reviewing our pricing”.Five years ago Gingerbread worked with the museumBletchley Park. Its family tickets now offer a substantial 28% discount to a single parent with two children, versus a 19% discount to a two-adult two-children group. The National Trust also tilts the discount on its annual pass in favour of single parents, and day tickets at Kew Gardens are discounted more for them.Bernard Donoghue, director of the ALVA, says many attractions offer free or discounted tickets aimed at people who qualify for certain state benefits, typically including universal credit, which some working parents are entitled to.He says “very few” of the ALVA’s members have a rigid definition of what makes a family “and more and more are moving towards memberships which look like 2025 families”.When deciding on pricing he says: “They need to balance the operational costs of running the attraction, which are getting greater every day, with their social mission to be as accessible and inclusive as possible.”Explore more on these topicsDay tripsThe price of everythingParents and parentingFamilyChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 3 Dec 2025 08.10 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 08.12 ESTShareHello and welcome to the Long Wave. This week, I had the huge pleasure of an audience withPeepal Tree Press, which has been home to authors such as Bernardine Evaristo and Roger Robinson. Peepal Tree publishes books from the Caribbean and its diaspora, and has just celebrated its 40th anniversary. I spoke to its founder, Jeremy Poynting, and fiction editor Jacob Ross, and what ensued was a masterclass not only in publishing, but in diasporic art.A passion that became a publisherView image in fullscreenEmotional labour … Peepal Tree filled a vacuum in the publishing industry.Photograph: Peepal TreePeepal Tree is a rare story of an independent publisher that has not only survived and thrived, but stayed close to its roots. Literally. It is still based in the same house in Leeds where it was launched in 1985. Peepal Tree began, Poynting says, as “an expensive hobby”. Poynting had just completed a PhD onCaribbeanwriting, and in the course of his travels and research, met people who had books that they couldn’t get published. “I thought there was a niche there,” he says. There was no publishing industry in the Caribbean to speak of, and in the UK, large publishing houses were not interested in Black diaspora books that were not selling at commercial volumes.In the Caribbean itself, distribution was such a problem that it deterred publishing. “The region had such poor interconnections. You had to deal individually with every bookseller,” and writing about the Caribbean was “not much valued in the region”. In bookshops, there would be a “tiny section” for the genre.Pain and printingView image in fullscreenClassic literature … after some growing pains and workshopping, Jeremy Poynting and his team finally got it off the ground.Photograph: Peepal TreeBut Peepal Tree persevered. How did it go from a hobby to a going concern? “With pain,” Poynting says, laughing. To cut costs, he bought a printing press and set it up in the garage where they printed the first 12 books. “For 12 years we did everything,” he says; typeset, printed, folded, bound, and made books on the premises.Then Peepal Tree received an Arts Council grant, which, in addition to Poynting remortgaging the house, set the publisher on the path to viability. “It was very painful in the beginning, but what it enabled us to do was to punch over our weight. It got us off the ground. We realised that our backlist was generating significant amounts of money every year.”In the Caribbean, growth of demand and availability of their published works was “uneven” and “accidental”, he says. For example, he recollects, there were at one point “two really good shops in Guyana, and then the owner of one got a US green card, and that was it”. Half the book supply in the country disappeared overnight. Trinidad remains the strongest market due to having a substantial middle class, good bookshops, and a large literary festival inBocas Lit Fest.A star-studded lineup of authorsView image in fullscreenClose to the subject matter … its authors have won a slew of industry awards and accolades.Photograph: Peepal TreePeepal Tree’s first writers in the 1980s were “recently arrived”, Poynting says. Not Windrush generation, but those who had come to the UK after the first wave of Caribbean movement to Britain, and were writing about the region, but from a British base. Peepal Tree published Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo’s first work in the early 90s. And has gone on to publish such writers as Emily Zobel Marshall, Dorothea Smartt and Roger Robinson, whowon the TS Eliotprize.Ross tells me that The Mermaid of Black Conch, written by Monique Roffey, and which won the Costa prize, had 12 or 13 rejections before Peepal Tree published it. This is where Peepal Tree distinguishes itself, he says, by being close enough to the subject matter to see its appeal in a way that more mainstream publishers cannot. The book was “set in the Caribbean, on issues that are quite particular to the colonial and postcolonial experience, it was a fable”, the sort that Peepal Tree grasped.Incubation of talentskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kevin Jared Hosein, “who is massive now”, Ross says, was one of those writers that Peepal Tree worked with for “sometimes over a year. You want to see how they evolve and you are prepared to facilitate that evolution.” Robinson was another writer incubated within Peepal who “went on to become one of the most well-known poets on the contemporary Black British scene”.Remarkably, Peepal Tree runs a straight submissions process, sifting through a huge number of manuscripts and finding diamonds in the rough. They now publish writers from all Black British backgrounds.I was curious about what Peepal Tree made of the expansion of appetite among mainstream publishers for Black writers since Black Lives Matter. The answer was a fascinating and nuanced view on how Black writing can become compromised by the wrong gatekeepers: “We had an opening of the doors,” Ross says, “but this door has a spring, and it closes back almost automatically. What you’re now noticing, five years later, is a closing of that gap.” What was picked up, he says, was a “particular kind of Black writing that focused on trauma, that conforms to conventional classic English ideas of what writing is and what a novel is”, one that “doesn’t embrace the cultural elements or the tradition” the writers are from.Interrogation and the possibilities of Black writingView image in fullscreenFacilitating evolution … fiction editor Jacob Ross at Peepal Tree’s 40th anniversary celebrations.Photograph: Peepal Tree“I don’t want to be too condemnatory,” Ross says. It should be fine to be so, I say to Ross, since one of the drawbacks of having a small space in the publishing scene is that sense of embattlement and therefore reluctance to constructively critique.“There’s a deeper issue here,” he responds. “The idea of a novel is not interrogated enough. Novel means new. And what we have lost, or what we risk losing, is the kind of malleability and flexibility that the novel as a piece of fictional architecture offers us. You don’t challenge the form itself. And I think there are enormous possibilities. I think that the writers coming from our cultural spaces and demographic need to think a little bit more about not just what they’re saying, but how they’re saying it. What cultural or narrative resources they can draw on from their own cultural space.”That is a thought, delivered with passion, that I think applies to all forms of writing, not just fiction. It rang loudly in my head as I left our conversation, and I felt briefly mentored, with a window into that transformative Peepal Tree treatment.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsBooksThe Long WaveCaribbeanBlack British cultureColonialismnewslettersShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Christmas has begun. Don’t come for me with your pedantry about partridges and pear trees. The lights are lit, the turkey sandwiches are in Pret: ’tis the season, already. For the next few weeks we will be in a bubble that has its own festive rules. This is an alternate universe in which it is perfectly acceptable to have Michael Bublé on your Spotify playlist and to drink at lunchtime (to be fair, it is almost dark by then) and non-negotiable to play parlour games.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Christmas also comes with its own set of fashion rules, some of which are set in stone, and others which are updated every year. So I thought it may be helpful to have a quick refresher on how to dress for Christmas. Not least because one of the ways in which this time of year is its own little world is that even people who don’t like parties go to parties.If parties aren’t really your thing, you probably dress to reflect that. You go in full wallflower regalia so people don’t make the mistake of thinking you may be fun to talk to. Here’s the thing: you are better off doing completely the opposite. Instead of trying to blend into the background, wear something that gives the impression you are in a party mood. This is the better strategy, for several reasons.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Taylor, Christmas ready in the 1950s.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesNumber one: you can in fact dress yourself into a party mood. If you wear something upbeat, you put yourself in a more party-appropriate headspace. Number two: if you look as if you are fun at parties, people will come and chat to you, and this makes parties more fun. Number three: if you arrive with a bang, then if you still find you aren’t in the mood a little later, you can make a French exit and everyone will remember you as having been on great form.If you are going to a party in someone’s home, they may impose a shoes-off rule, so that means nice socksSome old party dressing rules no longer apply. For instance, the old stricture about showing only legs or cleavage and not both feels a little outdated in the age of the naked dress, so if skin is your thing, go for it. There is new etiquette to navigate instead. For example: making an effort no longer tracks with buying a new outfit. A dress from a vintage store, or recycled from your own wardrobe, is more of a flex these days. Fashion is always about how we live now.Also, if you are going to a party in someone’s home, bear in mind that they may impose a shoes-off rule, so that means nice socks, even if you thought they were going to be hidden under your boots; don’t choose an outfit that you only feel good in while wearing a heel. And, finally, make sure your phone fits in your evening bag or in a pocket: the endless plaintive cry of “Have you seen my phone?” gets old fast.But the most important rule of Christmas dressing is an evergreen one. From now until new year, think about what you would wear for an equivalent event in the non-festive period, and then turn the dial up by a generous 30%. This is the only way to fit in. You are operating against a backdrop of fairy lights and tinsel, so an understated outfit that may work perfectly any other time of year can look inadvertently curmudgeonly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Assume the crash position before watchingLucy ManganWed 3 Dec 2025 07.23 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.29 ESTShareIn the top corner of the screen as With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration opens is its age rating: “U – no material likely to offend or harm.” This may be true in the traditional sense. But I would advise any viewers who are British, not in the acting profession and/or not married to the Duchess of Sussex to take as many anti-emetics as medically advisable, then assume the crash position.We open with Meghan literally skipping through aChristmastree farm. “Once a year you get to do the tree thing!” She then decorates it, which she loves because it allows you to “encapsulate your family’s story!”. She likes to position the baubles “so they find their light”. Once she has done that, it’s time to fill a 24-pocketed Advent calendar with – no, not chocolates, you fat English pleb, but “small gestures” and “little findings” for your children. “I’m writing notes that say ‘I love you because you are so kind!’ and ‘I love you because you are so brave!’” Do the children leave notes in return, I wonder? “Should we give up hope of the occasional Freddo here?” “Morning trans fats are the tradition to start, Mother.”“Small moments create the energy you want for the holidays,” and you can achieve them by hand-painting cookies. Many things are “elevated” – gift-wrapping with wax seals foremost among them, though I think attaching them with a hot glue gun is … not? Many more things are “darling” or “absolutely darling”, and this I find difficult.Meghan has the usual array of guests; one who meets her on her own turf, some billed as friends, and a couple of celebrities she has been worshipping since she was born or whatever. I cannot be expected to listen to everything.View image in fullscreenWell played, sir … Will Guidara manages to out-drivel Meghan.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix/PAAnyway. The one to meet her on the same emetic turf is restaurateur Will Guidara. She makes himcacio e pepe gougèresand “reindeer chow” to take home to his wife, who, Meghan informs us, “loves sweet, nostalgic treats”. I hope she likes them when they look like actual animal droppings, because that’s what she’s getting.She and Will make crackers and compete to out-drivel each other. The holidays are all about “connecting”, says Meghan. He sees this and raises her by not remembering what he’s eaten at the best dinner parties but “remembering that I left with my heart feeling full”. A few feeble jabs from Meghan, then he delivers the knockout blow: “What’s really going to attach it,” he says as she sticks one of the damn crackers together, “is the love we feel for the person we’re making it for.” Oh sir. Well played.The friends are Lindsay and Kelly. The three of them have known each other for years. Photographs of them as teenagers and twentysomethings are shown as proof. They eat a cinnamon pastry star, quiche cups and baked pears, drink “bubbles” with pomegranate syrup and make Christmas wreaths. “I’m curious to see how they all look different!” says Meghan, which is such an odd thing to say that I have not stopped thinking about it since.Naomi Osaka, the tennis player and Meghan’s first celebrity, is like a cool plunge bath after an overheated sauna. I’ve never seen anyone more desperate to get home. She spends most of the holidays not relaxing but “chasing after my daughter”. “But that is so soul-filling,” says Meghan, squeezing her eyes shut. Naomi looks at her in polite bemusement. She paints a plate very badly and leaves. I pledge undying allegiance to her.View image in fullscreenI pledge my undying allegiance to her … Naomi Osaka on With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix/PASecond celebrity up is Top Chef’s top chef Tom Colicchio, but who cares because as he makes his family’s traditional festive beet, olive, fennel, pickles and anchovy salad and salted cod, who should turn up but H! Or, as we used to know him, Prince Harry. Balder than ever but still charmingly at ease and blessedly calm. He hates beets, olives, fennel, pickles, anchovies and fish, which almost makes you proud to be British. So it’s just as well Meghan has made her mum’s chicken gumbo too, although it’s so spicy it makes him sweat. Come home, Harry. Just come home.And that, mercifully, is the end. I feel both offended and harmed, but in the spirit of goodwill I will add a star to my rating in gratitude for the fact that at least we are safe now until next year.

They described a “keeping your head down culture” where their concerns were inadequately addressed. Consultants said that there was “systemic bullying, harassment and racial discrimination among staff”.The report, leaked to the Guardian, follows a series of devastating incidents at the Blackpool Victoria hospital that have resulted in multiple arrests and six members of staff being imprisoned in the past two years.Twonurses were jailed for stealing drugsand unlawfully sedating patients to make their shifts easier. The trust’s leadingheart surgeon was imprisonedfor sexually assaulting five colleagues.In October, a coroner ruled that an elderly female patient had been sexually assaulted andunlawfully killed in her hospital bed; a murder investigation has concluded without identifying a culprit.The trust has been accused by the British Medical Association (BMA) of doing too little to combat a “toxic culture of fear” and failing to “make the necessary changes to improve conditions for doctors”. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, described the hospital’s recent failings as “abhorrent”.The report does not mention the convictions of staff but provides context to the serious issues that have troubled the hospital since 2018, offering a precise account of the culture running through the institution.The hospital is also the subject of an inquiry into its maternity unit and of a police investigation, Operation Bermuda, into whether corporate failings led to the death, ill-treatment or neglect of stroke patients.The RCP team visited the hospital in October 2024 and interviewed medical staff who told them about “significant challenges” including “longstanding recruitment and retention issues” across all departments, flagging that these staffing problems were affecting patient safety.“Significant concerns have been raised about cultural problems, including bullying and harassment, particularly affecting international medical graduates,” the report states.It notes that frequent leadership changes have led to a lack of institutional memory and accountability. The Trust has had five chief executives since 2018.The report also heard concerns of “overwhelming” acute care overnight workloads; understaffing at weekends making it “very difficult” to review sick patients; staffing and funding shortages affecting the management of chronic disease and Parkinson’s services; doctors being fearful of airing problems; and poor supervision and training across the hospital.Understaffing was so chronic that resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – were suffering from stress from having to look after the hospital’s sickest patients because consultants were not available, the report suggests.Dr Neil Hartley-Smith, the trust’s medical director, said substantial changes had been made since the report was delivered in January.The trust acknowledged that there had been a delay in circulating the report, caused by cancelled meetings and a change in medical leadership, but said improvements were put in place in that time.The trust has been referred to NHS’s recovery support programme, which replaced the special measures programme. It provides intensive support to NHS providers classified as being in a “critical condition”.Hartley-Smith said: “Doctors are a vital part of the team here at Blackpool, so we took the feedback seriously. Since the RCP visit in October 2024, we have strengthened education and training for our junior doctors, improved the induction and support we give to doctors who trained overseasand ensured that protected learning time is built into rotas.“We have also created better ways for doctors to raise issues and see actions taken, and we have made sustained improvements in key areas of patient safety. In addition, we have recruited 116 doctors across the trust, including 32 new consultants. As a result, NHS England has recently stepped down the significant concerns it was monitoring around the learning environment for doctors in training.” The hospital faced an unannounced snap inspection from the Care Quality Commission, the healthcare regulator, last week.Streeting said patients in Blackpool should continue to come forward for NHS care and said urgent work was already under way to improve the situation. “Not only am I determined to turn the trust around, but to tackle head on the stark health inequalities that have been holding back Blackpool’s communities for too long,” he said. “It is a stain on our nation that a baby girl born in Blackpool will live seven years less than one born in Wokingham, and the NHS should and can act as a leveller for our society.”Quick GuideContact Amelia Gentleman about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Amelia using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We need to see greater engagement and transparency from the trust.”The Blackpool Victoria’s seven-year stretch of difficulties began when a student nurse blew the whistle over the behaviour of staff on the hospital’s stroke ward in 2018, leading to the arrest of several workers for inappropriate sedation of patients and stealing drugs. One nurse messaged a colleague boasting that she had sedated an elderly patient “to within an inch of her life”, a court heard.Last August, avulnerable 27-year-old man killed himselfin a hospital toilet after waiting for 22 hours to be seen by the mental health team; a coroner ruled his death was “contributed to by neglect”. In February, alocum doctor was jailed for 12 monthsfor punching a patient with dementia in the face after he used a racist term. A healthcare assistant was jailed in 2023 on eight counts of sexual assault against colleagues.Resident doctors told the visiting RCP team they felt there was “often inadequate supervision and poor workload management, which has a negative impact on patient safety”. Trainee doctors were often “handling multiple roles and responsibilities, leading to stress and fatigue”. These members of staff reported that their concerns were not adequately addressed by senior leadership and described “a culture of ‘keeping your head down’”.Some doctors viewed Blackpool as “a stepping stone rather than as a long-term career destination”, the inquiry team heard, adding that there were “recruitment challenges, exacerbated by geographical location and perceived disadvantages compared with nearby trusts”.Amelia.gentleman@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsEnglandBlackpoolHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Timesreportedthat Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. The videos appear to be a walk-through of the property.1:37US Democrats release footage of Epstein's private island – videoThe materials released on Wednesday were from law enforcement authorities in the US Virgin Islands. They were taken in 2020, the year after Epstein died by suicide in jail.Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, including Little St James, which some locals told the New York Times they had nicknamed“pedophile island”. In 2022, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islandsreached a settlementfor more than $100m with Epstein’s estate afterthey alleged“dozens of young women and children were trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive in the Virgin Islands at Epstein’s secluded private island, Little St James.”View image in fullscreenA newly released photo by House Democrats of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.Photograph: House committee on oversight and government reformEven though the images and videos released on Wednesday do not reveal anything new, they appear to be an effort from Congress to keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release the files.

The source said an Israeli helicopter had also landed in the area.Israel’s military said on Sunday that it had killed more than 40 militants over the past week in operations targeting tunnels near Rafah.Multiple sources told AFP last week that negotiations were under way regarding the fate of the fighters still in south Gaza’s tunnel network. A prominent Hamas member in Gaza told AFP that the group estimated their number to be 60-80.Also on Wednesday, UN secretary generalAntónio Guterrestold Reuters there was something “fundamentally wrong” with how Israel conducted its military operation in the Gaza Strip and there were “strong reasons to believe” war crimes had been committed.“I think there was something fundamentally wrong in the way this operation was conducted, with total neglect in relation to the deaths of civilians and to the destruction of Gaza,” Guterres said.“The objective was to destroy Hamas. Gaza is destroyed, but Hamas is not yet destroyed. So there is something fundamentally wrong with the way this is conducted.”Israel’s mission to the UN in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guterres’s remarks.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people.Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed at least 70,117 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable.The health ministry says that since the ceasefire came into effect, 360 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire. Israel’s military has reported three soldiers killed during the same period.Additional reportingby ReutersExplore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsAntónio GuterresIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a celebratory gathering for FBS, a multimillion-dollar business that promotes a radical approach to giving birth without medical support.Promotional footage from the Matriarch Rising festival shows Saldaya dancing beside her private lake, wearing a crown. That same weekend, more than 3,000 miles away, in Dundalk, a town on the east coast ofIreland, Naomi James,bled to death after freebirthing her son.Naomi James.Photograph: Courtesy of Naomi James’s familyIt is impossible to say with any certainty whether James would have survived if a midwife or doctor had been present. Neither is it possible to know exactly how influential FBS was on James’s decision-making, although she appears to have been scarred by bad experiences with maternity services.Yet the 38-year-old photographer’s social media accounts shed light on the milieu of content she was consuming during her pregnancy, which was consideredhigh risk because of her two previous caesarean sections.On 21 February 2024, James liked a post captioned “freebirth rocks” that was hashtagged #freebirthsociety. The following month, she appears to have been recommended an FBS podcastcalled“The Freebirther’s Guide to Hemorrhage with Yolande Norris-Clark” by her doula. “Definitely one to listen to,” wrote the doula in a comment, which tagged James, beneath the episode on Instagram.It is not known whether James listened to the episode, in which Saldaya said that while she had seen “tonnes of haemorrhage manufactured in the hospital” as a result of unnecessary interventions, she had never seen a haemorrhage in a free birth.“From what I know to be true,” said Saldaya, “I have never once, not one time, seen or heard of a situation where a mother died from any complications at home, but specifically we’re talking about blood loss.” Three months later, on 23 June 2024, James died of a postpartum haemorrhage after her free birth.Aninvestigation by the Guardianlast week found 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS. The tally includes two women in the US who nearly bled to death after haemorrhaging following free births.Most of the cases relate to mothers in the US and Canada, but also include births in Switzerland, France, South Africa, India, Australia and the UK.Experts in birth who reviewed FBS content for the Guardian said it included information that was“misleading” or “dangerous”, including in relation to the risk of haemorrhage.Last Tuesday, the Guardianrevealed that the NHS has been directingpregnant women contemplating a “free birth” to an online factsheet that linked to FBS podcasts, describing them as a source of “empowering stories” that can help British women “preparing for their own birth”. The web page was run by the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services (Aims), a charity, which has now removed the reference from its website, saying it was “not aware of the serious concerns” associated with FBS.Saldaya has not responded substantively to repeated requests for comment. In a reply to an email listing 35 questions (one of which related to James), Saldaya said “some of these allegations are false or defamatory”. She did not respond to requests for further clarification.View image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya (centre) made up the term ‘radical birth keeper’ to manoeuvre around laws against practising as a midwife when not registered.Photograph: Free Birth Society websiteJames’s brother Adam Boyle, 39, said he believed his sister was “radicalised” by influencers, and there was nothing “anyone could have done” to change her mind about her birth plan. “She so firmly believed in what these influencers said, and her ability to do her own research,” he said.Like many women drawn to FBS, it appears that James had previously experienced poor maternity care.James wrote in online free birth groups about having been denied her choices by medical providers in previous pregnancies. When she was in labour during a previous pregnancy, James wrote, medical staff had refused to let her use a birthing pool because they considered her to be high-risk due to her body mass index.It appears that freebirthing may not have been James’s first choice. “For me,” James wrote, “I’m having a free birth because it’s my only option to have a HBA2C [home birth after two C-sections].”In March 2024, she posted in a free birth Facebook group to say that a doctor had laughed at her when she told them she planned to have a vaginal birth after two previous caesarean sections.This disrespectful treatment, she wrote, made her feel “so frustrated”, and consequently she stopped attending many appointments. James wrote: “These encounters, although so hard and frustrating at the time, make me more determined to fight for myself and other women. I want a better system for my daughter one day.”As she disengaged from maternity services, she sought information online, participating in a “clubhouse”, a private, online birth discussion group, led by Kemi Johnson, one of the most prominent birth influencers in the UK. A former midwife turned “birth keeper”, Johnson has deregistered from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and amassed 42,000 followers on Instagram, where she routinely excoriates NHS maternity services.View image in fullscreenKemi Johnson (left) and Emilee Saldaya in a Free Birth Society YouTube video entitled: ‘Laying Down the License to Truly Serve Women with Kemi BirthJoy Johnson’ from 21 January 2022Photograph: Free Birth Society/YouTubeJames attended Johnson’s online discussion on 5 March 2024, according to posts she made on Facebook. James wrote afterwards: “I am confident in my choice and I’m excited for the journey.”James leaves behind a husband and four children. “I grieve not just her loss as my sister,” said Boyle, “but all the milestones in her children’s lives, where her absence will be so deeply felt.” He added that James had plans for how she’d celebrate each child as they grew up. “To know that she won’t be here to make those moments so special is such a loss.”In 2022, Johnson appeared on the FBS podcast. She told Saldaya she referred British women to FBS, telling them: “You need to see all the twin pregnancies and thebreech babies falling out of women.”Much like Saldaya, Johnson has a record of inflammatory language when discussing maternity services. In response to a post about mothers who freebirth being investigated by child protective services (CPS), Johnson said parentswho choose to give birth in hospital should be referred to CPS for “ignoring the iatrogenic [medically induced] harm being caused to themselves and their baby”. She has labelled doctors “knobstetricians” and alleged that the UK has “very rapey maternity services”.The maternity care system is one-size-fits-all and … I don’t want what they’re offering, so what am I to do?Reign LawrenceJames was active in a number of other home and free birth Facebook groups while pregnant with her fourth child. But Johnson, in particular, appears to have left a mark on James. As well as attending Johnson’s private birth discussion, she interacted enthusiastically with her content on social media.During her pregnancy, James liked 15 Instagram posts by Johnson, some of which were about mothers who, like herself, were rejecting medical advice and choosing to freebirth. James also recommended Johnson to other mothers considering their options. On 28 February 2024, James commented: “❤️🙌👏❤️” under a post by Johnson about a “badass”, “queen” mother who had freebirthed after a C-section and revision surgery.Contacted for comment by the Guardian, Johnson did not respond.There is almost no data available on free birth, although anecdotally many midwives report seeing a rise in the number of women giving birth without any medical support.Reign Lawrence, 39, a railway worker, was browsing Instagram in 2021 when she came across Norris-Clark, Saldaya’s business partner. “I liked her articulateness and confidence,” said Lawrence, who lives in Dudley, in the West Midlands.Lawrence said she did not engage with FBS content, but she followed Norris-Clark, a leader of the group, on social media and later joined her private membership for £37.50 a month. At the time, Lawrence was a student midwife. “I wanted to get into their system to try to improve it,” she said. “I was a super-idealistic little student midwife.”But by the time she became pregnant in October 2021, Lawrence said she had become disillusioned with the NHS. She had seen mothers receiving what she felt were unnecessary interventions, and being talked about disparagingly by staff.Norris-Clark, she said, was “very influential” in affirming her decision to have an unassisted birth, although she stresses the decision was her own. In May 2022, Lawrence freebirthed twin boys in a hotel room in Jamaica. The youngest twin died shortly after birth; his older brother survived and is now a thriving and happy toddler.There is no way of knowing if the outcome would have been different in a medically supervised birth. As soon as she noticed her son was in distress, Lawrence said she took him to hospital.View image in fullscreenReign Lawrence is one of two British women known to have lost a twin after a free birth.Photograph: Reign LawrenceLawrence said she did not regret freebirthing, but wished she had been given more options. “The maternity care system is so one-size-fits-all and so you kind of go, well, I don’t want what they’re offering, so what am I to do?”There are some conditions that aren’t obvious to a parent when a child’s born, but can be picked up by a healthcare professionalDr Joanne NichollThe Guardian is aware of at least three other British women who lost babies after following FBS or other radical free birth influencers.UK authorities are wrestling with how to respond to the apparent rise in freebirthing.In April 2025, the national network of designated health professionals, a committee of NHS doctors and nurses responsible for child safeguarding, published aposition statementurging the government to legislate for the mandatory examination of a child by a health professional within 24 hours of birth, which does not always happen at present.“Women make a really careful choice to freebirth,” said Dr Joanne Nicholl, who co-authored the statement. “And they’ve absolutely got their child’s best wishes at heart.”But parents, she said, might not always realise their babies were unwell. “There are some conditions that aren’t obvious to a parent when a child’s born, but can be picked up by a healthcare professional.” Nicholl gave the examples of low thyroid levels, which can lead to brain injury, and congenital heart disease, which can be fatal.“It’s not about curtailing their choices around free birth,” Nicholl added. “It’s saying: ‘Let’s just let someone have a little look at your child, check them over.’”Free birth is legal in the UK. It is also legal to provide emotional and practical support to a woman in labour, whether in a paid capacity as a doula, or as a family member, partner or friend. But it is illegal to “claim to be, or to practise” as a midwife if you are not on the NMCregister.To manoeuvre around these sorts of regulations, Saldaya made up the term “radical birth keeper”, or RBK. “To be crystal clear, a radical birth keeper is, in practice, [an] authentic midwife,” she said in 2025. FBS’s Radical Birth Keeper School, a three-month course conducted via Zoom, has 850 graduates around the world.To avoid legal jeopardy, Saldaya tells students that she accepts cash “gifts” only after a successful birth, does not sign contracts and avoids women who might blame them if a birth goes wrong.View image in fullscreenA screengrab of Yolanda Norris-Clark from The Complete Guide to Freebirth online course.Photograph: Complete Guide to FreebirthIn the UK, there are at least 13 FBS-accredited working birth keepers,according to a paid-for directory seen by the Guardian. It is not clear whether they are attending births or what services they provide, and there is no evidence they are breaking the law.The Guardian is aware of one FBS-accredited birth keeper who appears attuned to the legal risks. She offers an online course for fellow birth attendants who want to support freebirthing women “without fear” of getting into trouble with the authorities. One session explores the law in the UK and “how to take sensible steps to protect yourself”.She posted on Instagram recently that she used to obsessively delete messages to her clients, insist only on payment after their babies were born, tell clients not to disclose her name to medical professionals, and told one client that were she to experience a birth emergency, she would not go to hospital with them.Contacted by the Guardian, she did not respond to a request for comment. She told followers recently she created her course because she felt that a lot of what she’d learned in FBS’s RBK school was incomplete and unhelpful.Norris-Clark also declined requests for comment. Saldaya has previously said she does not “encourage strangers on the internet to do anything at all”. Norris-Clark has called critics of FBS “pathetic losers”, defending her partnership with Saldaya as “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. On 22 November, the day the Guardian published its investigation into FBS, Saldayaposted a statement on Instagramcriticising “propaganda on mainstream news”.“This is what it means to be a disruptor,” she said. “They will try to discredit you. They will lie about you. They will attempt to silence what they don’t understand.”The Birth Keepers, a multi-part Guardian podcast series investigating the Free Birth Society, is released later this month.

The treatment of chronic disease, including Parkinson’s, were just some of the areas blighted by what appears to be a toxic culture.But the Royal College of Physicians report, leaked to the Guardian, exposes much broader challenges for theNHS– and particularly for hospitals in the most deprived corners of Britain.Clinicians in places such as Blackpool are overwhelmed by generational ill health and entrenched poverty, acrisis that is deepeningin many parts of the country. Their ability to respond is often hampered by their struggle to attract the best staff.The issues are complex. Hospitals in poorer areas are flooded with people who have chronic health problems, including higher rates of depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions worsened by living in damp homes.The worst-performing NHS trusts in the league table broadly tally with levels of deprivation.League table of NHS TrustsBlackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, and University hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust were in the 10 worst-performing trusts, with Hull University teaching hospitals NHS trust in 11th from bottom.In the 2025 indices of multiple deprivation, seven neighbourhoods in Blackpool ranked among the top 10 most deprived inEngland. Kingston upon Hull and Birmingham were among the local authorities with the highest proportions of neighbourhoods among the most deprived in England.The problem is exacerbated by inequalities in primary care. The current formula for distributing GP funding, known as the Carr-Hill formula, uses expected workload of GP practices to determine distribution of funding, but it is based on outdated figures and has left people in deprived areas and coastal towns with the fewest GPs.Astudylast year by the Royal College of General Practitioners found that GPs in deprived areas were responsible for a staggering 2,450 patients each on average, 300 more than in affluent areas of England. When patients struggle to get a GP appointment, they often end up in A&E.“People who have choices who are affluent want to live in affluent areas so won’t necessarily choose to move to the places in need,” said one NHS manager.Another in north-west England said poverty was having a “massive impact” on the quality of healthcare: “We can’t seem to attract GPs into our population, we’ve got a lot of homegrown GPs, so we’re quite understaffed per head of population which can have issues on [patient] access and other things.”Researchers from Lancaster University also found that hospital facilities and resources, geographical location, and reputation all played a role in the recruitment and retention of medics.Last year the UKFPO (UK Foundation Programme) introduced a new system for allocating newly qualified doctors, which was previously based on academic achievement and further study.Under the new system, applicants are instead given a random number, which determines where they will spend the first two years of their medical careers. With more demand for places at the best hospitals, and those in big cities, the system, although not without its critics, has made it less likely that the brightest and best new doctors will never end up at the worst-performing hospitals.There is also an income stream issue;research published in the BMJfound that hospitals serving more deprived populations struggled to generate private income. Researchers found an “uneven distribution” of income from private patients and charitable donations across NHS trusts, which was linked to deprivation levels.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is leading what he called the biggest NHS transformation plan in a generation in an effort to move care away from struggling hospitals and into communities – and from treatment to prevention.But the challenge is stark. Britain has the lowest life expectancy in western Europe and one of the highest tallies among rich countries for preventable deaths. NHS bodies in the regions have been ordered to slash their budgets in half and cut as many as 13,500 jobs, leaving senior figures alarmed about how this squares with Streeting’s focus on community care.One NHS manager, who did not want to be named, welcomed the government’s “real focus” on addressing health inequalities but said questions remained about whether more deprived areas of the country would see more funding. Another described the cuts as “brutal”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthPovertyEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

I have a really, really low bar for what constitutes an amiable or reasonable way of passing the hours. I do not habitually feel a tremendous urge to fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds’ worth of distance run, admirable though I find the people who manage it. But filling 90 of them with a two-part documentary about the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree by a pair of local berks two years ago? Come. On.The wildly inflated sense of the film’s own importance is demonstrated by the fact that its original title was The Slaying at Sycamore Gap. The slaying. Theslaying. Just before broadcast it was renamed The Sycamore Gap Mystery, but it is the original that better suits the risibly sombre tone of the programme and the gathering bathos as the 90 minutes – 90 minutes! – progress.DI Calum Meikle usually investigates homicides. “I never thought I’d be here talking about criminal damage,” he says, sombrely. But as it became clear that the local landmark, thought to have been planted about 120 years ago by the then landowner John Clayton, and made more widely famous by its appearance in the Kevin Costner film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves had been deliberately cut down, outrage mounted and the Northumbria police mobilised. “Could this have been committed by someone younger in years who hasn’t seen the potential significance of his actions?” the DI wonders to camera with an admirably straight face. Close examination of the crime scene reveals something revelatory. “We were minus the wedge. Hmm … This is interesting.” That’s the wedge – explains the programme to us in minute detail – that tree fellers cut out of a tree with chainsaws when they are felling it. It’s easier than trying to push the whole thing over, I guess. And it was probably a two-man job, so now we are looking for a duo with access to chainsaws who may possess a wooden wedge they’ve kept as a trophy.A 16-year-old, meanwhile, has been arrested. One contemporary online commentator suggests “putting his bollocks through a bacon slicer”. It is not clear if this should happen before or after he is charged or found guilty. No matter. He has an alibi, so he and his bollocks are released unsliced.View image in fullscreenA distinct Chris Morris vibe … DI Calum Meikle unveiling the tree stump in The Sycamore Gap Mystery.Photograph: undefined/CandourBut here, surely, is the crux – if you’ll pardon what feels like a pun though I’m not sure if it is – the interesting part of the story is the strength of feeling that the loss of the tree engendered. How apparently disproportionately human beings can react to the destruction of something rather than someone. Why was it so painful? Why did the fire at Notre Dame cause such grief? What of ourselves have we invested in objects? How do things – trees, nature, art, architecture – come to mean so much to us? Or are there moments in sociocultural life that are just flashpoints, lightning rods for a whole chaotic mass of frustrations and miseries? For once, we find something in this hard and endlessly fragmenting world that we can all agree is a bad or sad thing, and from there it takes on a howling life of its own. How many people were grieving purely for Diana? How many people really want X, Y or Z cancelled for his or her perceived misstep in the latest online furore? How, in essence, does Man A come to want to chop the balls off Man B for chopping down a tree? This, surely, is the fascinating part.We will never know, because The Sycamore Gap Mystery is determined to follow the world’s most boring investigation as every moment of it unfurled. The top of the stump is cut off and removed to a place of safety “to maintain the integrity of that first cut”. An aerial shot of it being unveiled by DI Meikle on what looks like a mortuary table, surrounded by shadows, starts to give the whole thing a distinctChris Morrisvibe. But this is not satire.Eventually, the two culprits are identified (“Both individuals reside in the Carlisle area,” says Meikle’s boss, DCI Rebecca Fenney, thrillingly). We watch some equally thrilling footage of Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers being interviewed by the police. On a phone belonging to one of the criminal masterminds (“A couple of brain-dead five-year-olds in grown men’s bodies,” says Lynn, who is described as the local “plant lady” and who should really have been in charge of production) is a video of the felling and a picture of a wedge of wood from a large tree. “I realised there is something significant here,” says DCI Fenney. This programme is, if nothing else, a gift to those of us who revel in the perfect unnaturality of police speak. Is it the right wedge, though? From the right tree? The suspense is unbearable. A forensic botanist confirms that it is. Hurrah. The men are eachsentenced to four years and three monthsin prison. No bacon slicers are involved.Criminal damage to viewers’ intelligence, however, has been committed. DI Meikle, get off that murder case. I need you.The Sycamore Gap Mystery is on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

We were building a theatre that wasn’t meant to exist in Belarus. Tom replied almost instantly: “You can count on my support. But what else can I do for you?” Our request was both audacious and simple: we asked him to come to Belarus.He agreed, asking only for some time to finish the final edit ofRock’n’Roll. When he arrived, he didn’t give the classes we had asked for. Instead he listened, he asked questions. We took him to meet the whole underground resistance movement: artists, underground theatre-makers, the wives of friends who had been kidnapped and murdered, political prisoners, youth activists, journalists and human rights defenders. Sitting with us in the “London” bar in Minsk, he said something that captured everything we felt but had not yet found the words for: “A dictatorship is not a political category, it is a moral one.”Tom became Belarus Free Theatre’s lifelong patron and our mentor. He told us, with a directness that always cut through the noise, that if we wanted to influence politics, we had to write great plays and stage great productions, because people only listen to those who know what they’re doing.He proved that point at the Brussels Forum, one of the world’s most prominent political gatherings, where we had asked him to speak. For days afterwards, the corridors were ringing with praise for the playwright who understood the dangers of rising authoritarianism in Europe and beyond, more clearly than many politicians. He explained it simply, through the prism of his own childhood.Tom was our guardian angel and dear friend. We will miss his love, his humanity, the moral clarity and steadiness he taught us to carry into the world. Thank you, dear Tom. We love you.‘His face cracked up with that devilish smile’Carrie Cracknell,directing Arcadia at the Old Vic in London next yearView image in fullscreenGenuine enthusiasm … Stoppard in 2023.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianI can thank Tom for many things, not least for ending my very uninspiring early acting career. Cast as Annie in a student production of The Real Thing, I was simply no match for his dazzling dialogue, speed of thought or emotional depths. It was a moment of utter clarity about my own limits, and one that sent me headlong down a path to a career as a director. I told him this on one of our recent Zoom calls, and his face cracked up with that devilish smile that seemed to make the room change temperature.It has been a great honour to have conversations with Tom over the past few months. His work ethic remained resolutely undimmed – engaging in each casting decision and wanting to discuss his beautiful, complex and multilayered play. At points he would pause for thought, cigarette in hand, and I would feel as though I was gazing through the screen at a living portrait, a precious moment in time. Aside from his profound intellect Tom seemed defined by a rare humility and genuine enthusiasm. As we begin rehearsals forArcadianext week, his loss will be felt keenly by the whole company.‘He suggested we stage the crowded bar scene on a table’Nina Raine, director of Rock’n’Roll at Hampstead theatre, London, in2023View image in fullscreenCharming, brutal … Tom Stoppard and Nina Raine in rehearsals for Rock’n’Roll.Photograph: Manuel HarlanTom was a weird mixture of contradictions. He was very charming. He was also brutal and blunt in the service of his plays. In Moscow, watching rehearsals of The Coast of Utopia, he once turned to me and whispered “I wish that actor would stop grinning like Father Christmas in a Coca-Cola commercial.”Part of Tom was very literal. And part of him was delighted by the liberties, departure and flights of imagination taken by the director.In Rock’n’Roll, Tom envisaged a totally realistic Cambridge house with a conservatory and garden (as seen in the first Trevor Nunn production in 2006). I saw an empty space, in the round, with a table. I could see Tom was uncertain about this bold move. The set designer Anna Reid and I had a terrifying afternoon in Tom’s Notting Hill flat. Talking him through the model box, we couldn’t eat the sandwiches he’d bought us. At last, Tom seemed persuaded.‘We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard!’ – actors salute the great playwrightRead moreWe then auditioned many tables (I texted him photographs). Was this too small? Did that look enough like agardentable? Could this also serve as a desk in Prague? I felt a huge pride, near the end of rehearsals, when Tom rang me to suggest we stage a crowded bar sceneon the table.Finally, he was more radical than I was. Unfortunately, the table couldn’t take the weight of the actors.In the hyper-naturalistic Nunn production, there were long blackouts with music. We, on the other hand, would go to a half-light, and non-verbal balletic “action” to music – as I explained to Tom often, feeling more pretentious each time. I absolutely dreaded him watching the process, so I cunningly arranged his afternoons off for our movement sessions. But I’ll never forget Tom deciding, unbidden, to stay on and watch. The actors were leaping about, jumping, skipping, primal-screaming – preparatory work. I was in agony. Tom watched, utterly fascinated, and then turned to the wonderful choreographer, Jane Gibson: “I’d like to do that.”Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreBelarus Free TheatreCarrie CracknellPolitical theatreOld Vic TheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hummus?Old news, keep up!Who with? The Joneses?Only if you make that “with whom”, and if the Joneses shop atWaitrose. Every year the famously upmarket supermarket publishes a report that gives some indication of middle-class eating trends.And?No one’s talking about avocados or hummus any more.What are they talking about?For one thing, “we’re observing a new trend in how people use their freezers,” says Tim Daly, Waitrose’s frozen food product developer.I’m guessing they’re not filling them with frozen peas and oven chips?Make that triple-cooked chips, wagyu roast potatoes and four-cheese potato gratins.And for afters?Dubai chocolate?So first half of 2025! Also, call it “pudding”, please! Back to Daly, who says: “In Viennoiserie …”Inwhat?Pastries, basically, where all-butter cinnamon swirls are up an impressive 322%. Ottolenghi’s roasted pistachio and sour cherry ice-cream is also popular, reflecting “growing interest in unique, global and savoury flavours”.Is that just in ice-cream?No, for actual savoury stuff, too, such as condiments and spreads.What sort of things are we talking about?Oh you know, zhoug, ssamjang, chamoy. Also umami paste, and Spicy Sriracha Sprinkle.Some of which I’ve heard of.Zhoug is a spicy paste originally from Yemen, made with coriander, parsley, garlic and chilli.I knew that.So spicy is hot, in other words?Although “fricy is the new swicy”.Excuse me?We’ve moved on from swicy – sweet and spicy, for example hot honey. Now it’s all about fricy: fruity and spicy, which is “driven by authentic Mexican and wider Latin American trends and incorporates a softer spice profile with tropical fruits, peaches, and melons”.Anything else?Some of these taste changes are inspired by TikTok and Instagram trends. The rise of Korean-inspired bibimbap sauce (white miso paste, honey, garlic and chilli powder), for example.Any observations about the way we – or rather they – eat?Yes: snacking! Waitrose’s survey of 4,400 customers revealed that 57% sometimes replaced meals with “nutrient-dense, high-protein” snack food.Because?Several factors: the rise in the use of weight-loss medication (and corresponding decline in appetites), for one. But also some people just can’t be arsed.Do say:“Do you want to add a bit of zhoug to that hummus?”Don’t say: “Nah, you’re all right.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’re here to change that, with a selection of the best, most thoughtful gifts for mothers. You won’t find any washing-up sponges, reusable baking-tray liners or three years’ worth of pink leather driving gloves (all genuine gifts that haunt myChristmaspast). But there are a few dos and don’ts.Don’t try to squeeze your budget too hard by buying a gift that’s meant to be more expensive: if you’ve only got £20, don’t get a jumper, go for bath oil. Also,Christmas is a time for treats; please, no joke presents, as they always fall flat.Anything homemade by your child is a win: my husband once framed a painting my kid had done that elevated it very nicely. In fact, anything homemade at all: a pal recently visited with a pot of marmalade made with her daughter from oranges in their LA garden, which gave me great joy for weeks after her visit.Experiences are nice: last year my husband gave me 12 notecards, each with a date, time and the name of restaurants he thought we should go to for lunch. Gift vouchers are great, too, but be warned, they can get lost or expire (I just tried to use a voucher for a restaurant that closed down six months ago, and felt slightly sick at the waste).For shop-bought presents, go for elevated versions of anything she already likes – in premium fabrics, for example – orpersonalisedif there is the option (which there increasingly is). I always love supporting independent, ideally female-founded brands. Many of these below either have charitable elements or are B Corp companies, too, meaning they take social and environmental accountability seriously. Here are my 64 best, tried-and-tested gifts for mums.The best gifts for mumsHome and gardenView image in fullscreenEnamel photo frame£38 at Addison Ross£38 at AmazonI’m loth to share this secret, as it’s my go-to “thoughtful” gift for nearly anyone. However, as well as being a decent price for a luxury photo frame, when you add it to your basket at Addison Ross, you can upload a picture – which will then arrive already framed and wrapped in a luxurious blue box. I have several at home and have given lots more. Every room needs a pop of red, but there are more neutral colours if you’re not feeling so brave.View image in fullscreenHot-water bottle and eye mask£50 at Siân EstherA personalised hot-water bottle (and eye mask) is an indulgent gift – you don’t need it, but I write with one of these navy ones in my lap and find it makes life cosier and prettier at the same time. Siân Esther was founded by Siân Adkins and named after her late mother. Adkins donates money from sales to the women’s charityLuminary Bakery.View image in fullscreenApple AirTag£24.69 at John Lewis£24.69 at AmazonSome practical presents may seem underwhelming upon unwrapping, but they will be used so much that they remain at the front of the recipient’s mind. An AirTag is just that. As someone who loses keys regularly, they’re now affixed to my key chain, giving me reassurance that my keys are in the house, or on luggage when we go away. Plus, I’m sick of reading gift guides where only men get tech suggestions. We want them, too.View image in fullscreenLime squeezer£25 at Urban Bar£29 at AmazonThis is niche, but it’s honestly a great present for someone who loves a margarita (you could pair it with a bottle of tequila). I think it’s up there with one of my most-used kitchen gadgets. The weight of this is pleasing, and it adds to the drama of cocktail-making.View image in fullscreenClover matchbox sleeve£35 at Matilda Goad & CoI love this chic matchbox cover, which means you can leave it out on display (more handy), and it can be engraved. Mine never leaves my mantelpiece. If you’re after something cheaper, I also love beautifully decorated oversized matchboxes, such as these byLamp London(£8.95), which will leave the gift-buyer with change from a tenner.View image in fullscreenMagick eye candle£70 at Evermore LondonFilm director and artist Charlotte Colbert has collaborated with Evermore London on this beautiful candle, which draws on the symbolic rituals of the winter solstice. All the candles are vegan and have a wonderfully rich scent. The glass jar is so beautifully designed, you’ll want to keep it. I’ve cleaned out previous Evermore jars to store pens and makeup brushes in.View image in fullscreenRed stripes egg cup£14 at Villa Bologna PotteryI find ceramics impossible to resist – and love this cheerful little egg cup, handmade and hand-painted in Malta. Add in a handwritten voucher for breakfast in bed.View image in fullscreenThe Amberfaux flower arrangement£89 at Ett Hem LondonFresh flowers are beautiful, but ultimately wasteful. I have faux flowers from female-led Ett Hem London and swap them out seasonally. These pretty amber ones are perfect for now, but if the budget is tighter, Ett Hem sells flowers by the stem from £21.View image in fullscreenRed Chinese evergreen plant and potFrom £16 at Patch£33 (plant and pot) at SelfridgesA plant is another nice alternative to flowers. I’ve had lots of luck with Patch plants before, including its Aggie (which I have a fondness for because that’s my daughter’s name), more commonly known as a red aglaonema – a beautiful, festive plant.View image in fullscreenBottle vase£32 at ToastI love the makers Toast selects to support and sell. I’m eyeing up this gorgeous ceramic vase by Bert Jones, a potter who works from a converted shipping container studio outside Newport.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Alejandro EitoBare root rose£23 at David AustinEven those who think they’re a nightmare in the garden can handle a bare root rose – they’re easy to pot and care for (they’re dormant over winter), and a bare root rose is much cheaper than one already in bloom. David Austin is the gold standard – if your mum is a gardener, she’ll really appreciate that.View image in fullscreenChristmas gift box from Olia Hercules£55 at Experience UkraineThe chef Olia Hercules has curated a beautiful box of handmade Ukrainian goodies, including woollen socks, herbal tea from the Ternopil region, recipes, cards and a signed copy of her memoir. The sales support local artisans and craftspeople, and 10% of profits go to NGO Molotok, which helps Ukrainian children affected by the war.View image in fullscreenTekla washcloth£14 at Selfridges£16 at TeklaEveryone needs a washcloth upgrade, and Tekla’s 600gsm version in cheery red stripes is weighty and soft – plus, it will last for ever. I’m not quite suggesting this is the only gift you should get your mother, but it would make up a nice package – or if your budget can stretch to a gift set, the trio of towels is lovely.View image in fullscreenInflatable helmet£350 with e-pump at VenteteThis is a wild-card pick, but for cyclists – particularly the casual urban cyclist who is tempted to rent a bike and not wear a helmet – this inflatable helmet could literally be life-saving. It packs down into a tiny pouch, and comes with a pump – and an independent study has found that it absorbs shock 44.1% better than ordinary foam helmets.For more, read our guide tothe best gifts for cyclistsView image in fullscreenSweetie pillboxes£35 at TookaThese are adorable little containers designed to sit on the nightstand and hold anything slightly unsightly, from earplugs to vitamins. They’re designed by Sophie Campbell for her own brand, Tooka.FashionView image in fullscreenMerino bed socks,two pairs£25 at PairsSocks for Christmas get a bad rep, but luxury ones are an easy win. These merino bed socks by Scottish brand Pairs come in a two pack for £25, but you could split them up into two gifts of £12.50 each. They’re exceptionally cosy, non-itchy and naturally regulate temperature – perfect for someone like me who’s permanently too hot or cold in bed.View image in fullscreenKnitted cashmere neck tie£49 at KiltaneI can’t tell you how useful these triangle scarves are – how did I live without one (in every colour) before? Super soft, 100% cashmere, it’s more useful than a bigger scarf because you can wear it indoors without looking like you’re about to leave. A pop of red (although there’s a huge range of colours) looks festive and brightens the face.View image in fullscreenBoxer shorts£35 at BananaI get too hot in full PJs at night, so my solution is these chic, 100% cotton poplin boxer shorts designed by a woman who wanted the style of men’s boxers but for a woman’s body.View image in fullscreenUltimate tank bra£30 at Adanola£30 at SelfridgesForget lingerie: this tank bra is technically for exercise – and I do wear it for weights at the gym or yoga (it’s not supportive enough for a run) – but it’s also perfect for daily wear. It’s soft, has a bit of compression and doesn’t leave you wanting to yank off your undergarments at the end of the day. Coffee bean is my colour of the moment.View image in fullscreenGingham slippers£55 at If Only IfPretty slippers are always well received – even if the recipient already has a pair. I’ve started taking a slightly more fancy pair with me to people’s houses, so that I can be cosy in shoes-off homes.For more, read our guide tothe best slippersView image in fullscreenCashmere gloves£85 at &DaughterI love the brand &Daughter (I bought myself a cardigan from here to mark my daughter’s first birthday), and these super-soft cashmere gloves, spun near Loch Leven and made in Hawick, Scotland, are a great entry-level gift.View image in fullscreenKnit your ownbeanie£16.80 at Wool and the GangWool and the Gang has fail-proof knitting projects for beginners, with the nicest wool and needles all included. This is a cute knit-your-own beanie that will provide happy crafting hours over dark January evenings.View image in fullscreenBeaded phone rope£18 at Not Another BillWho doesn’t lose their phone at the bottom of their bags? This can help – and also, on a less festive note, help prevent your phone from getting swiped. Great stocking gift.View image in fullscreenMolly bag£75 at Queens of Archive£75 at AnthropologieLily Allen is one of a host of celebrities who are fans of this Cheshire-based, female-owned, independent brand. The fit on the party dresses is spot on for those who want to highlight a waist, but not a tummy; if you can’t stretch to a dress, this sweet little party bag is my top pick.View image in fullscreenCloud scrunchie£35 at Kindred of IrelandThis oversized scrunchie looks as good on the wrist as in the hair. It’s made from offcuts of Irish linen from the gorgeous Northern Ireland brand Kindred of Ireland, and sewn locally; a proportion of profits go to a charity that supports survivors of human trafficking.View image in fullscreenWrist warmers£75 at HerdThere’s something pleasingly yesteryear about knitted wrist warmers. These are made from English wool that’s farmed, spun and naturally dyedwithina 150-mile radius.View image in fullscreenLora clip in olive£27 at Space NK£28 at TortMona Ghafoori, founder of the cult Tort hair claws, believes life is too short to have boring hair – and her selection of clips and claws is just the little dopamine fix any mum bun needs. They’re designed to capture long and short, fine and thick hair (thanks to the overlocking claws). Tort offers free repairs.View image in fullscreenBlack butterfly lace tights£45 at Ganni£45 at FarfetchEvery mum loves Ganni (it’s almost cliche levels at certain school gates), and there’s a reason why: it feels edgy and cool. Which is just what you want to feel.View image in fullscreenFabric shaver£33 at Very£33.75 at AmazonFor anyone who loves their knits, a little fabric shaver is an essential bit of kit to keep them looking new – and these are the cutest I’ve seen from a great Swedish brand that I’m devoted to for its steamers.For more, read our guide onhow to make your knitwear last longerJewelleryView image in fullscreenLoom cuff£110 at OtiumbergThis is a top-tier gift (or maybe one to club together on, as I asked my brothers to do for a recent birthday), but it will earn you mega brownie points. A chunky design that’s not heavy, it doesn’t pinch or weigh down the ear (as some cuffs do), and because you don’t need a piercing, it’s suitable for anyone. I recently bonded with a 60-year-old fashion editor at a dinner wearing the same cuff. It’s a sister-owned, independent British brand – and the business is B Corp-certified.View image in fullscreenFine gold belcher bracelet£45 at Tilly SveaasThis looks a lot more expensive than it is: it’s lightweight, 18-carat gold plated. I keep it on all the time – even in the shower or at the gym. Taylor Swift is a fan of the brand, which is a licensedFairminedlabel (meaning the gold is responsibly mined), and founder Tilly Sveaas designs and assembles the pieces in London. They come in beautiful packaging, too, meaning your wrapping burden is reduced.View image in fullscreenMini huggies£32.50 at Monica VinaderI have a longstanding love affair with Monica Vinader jewellery: I wore it on my wedding day. I think it sits in the perfect place between luxury and affordability, making it the perfect present. These mini huggies are a lovely gift. An increasing number of women have ear stacks and need options, and these come in gorgeous packaging.View image in fullscreenGold and silver huggies£68 at Astley ClarkeMixing metals looks very modern, and these U-shaped huggies do it for you, in a very chic way.Books, stationery and cultureView image in fullscreen2026 classic diary£45 at Mark + FoldYes, we have calendars on our phones, but a physical diary makes me feel a bit more organised – and opening one signals a year of possibilities. I’ve had a Mark + Fold diary for the past three years, and the mustard might be my favourite – with its card made from recycled coffee cups and thick inside paper, all made in England, and bound usinglay flat binding(which stationery geeks like me really appreciate, as it’s easier to write on). Filling up a diary with proposed lunch dates, cinema trips and gallery visits would make a thoughtful present.View image in fullscreenThree-month book subscriptionFrom £45 at Phlox BooksHaving the experts at indie bookshop Phlox in east London pick you a book each month is a real treat. You buy a voucher, and Phlox emails the recipient (when they activate it!) a detailed questionnaire about book preferences and what they’ve read. I’ve had books including Oisín McKenna’sEvenings and Weekendsafter a thoughtful subscription last Christmas. Each book comes wrapped, so it feels like a special delivery each month.View image in fullscreenWait … You Did What?!memoir journal£28 at Wait … You Did What?!Who doesn’t have a story to tell? Worried she didn’t know all the details of her father’s life, journalist Sophie de Rosée created this memoir-prompt with fun questions that will help your recipient jot down all the milestones in their life. A sort of DIY memoir, it can even be personalised with a picture of your recipient.View image in fullscreenDead and Aliveby Zadie Smith£18.70 at the Guardian Bookshop£17.28 at AmazonFans of Zadie Smith’s writing will be keen to unwrap this new book of essays – especially if, like me, you heard her speaking recently on a slew of podcasts to promote the book.View image in fullscreenNicolas Party: Murals£72 at Hauser & Wirth£49.37 at AmazonA beautiful coffee table book from the gallerists Hauser & Wirth, celebrating the mural work of celebrated Swiss painter Nicolas Party. You could pair it with a trip to the gallery in London to see the works on display, which is free.View image in fullscreenThe Boss notebook£50 at SmythsonWhat is she? The Boss, of course. And she’ll feel extra special with a luxury notebook, handmade in England with a crossgrain leather cover that you can get embossed with your mum’s initials. It comes in a beautiful box, with bows on, to make it feel extra luxe.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Johnny Stephens PhotographyEveryman cinema gift membership£95 at EverymanI bought this for myself at the start of the year, and I look forward to my movie nights so much: a membership forces you to go.

Onsuri is a family-run estate in Jordan, led by olive oil sommelier and master miller Amelia Bilbeisi, and she’s rightly proud that its oil has higher levels ofpolyphenolsthan the industry standard. The bottle is very pretty, too.View image in fullscreenSpice Dept spice tins£29.99 at Spice DeptI discovered these cleverly stacking spice tins on Instagram, and they’re brilliant, sitting beautifully on my kitchen shelf. All the spices, from Kanthari chilli to green cardamom, are sourced from farms the founders have visited and vetted in India and Sri Lanka. The tins are refillable, so you can subscribe or send off for more spices, which arrive in compostable pouches.View image in fullscreenDark Woodscoffee trio£32.95 at Dark Woods CoffeeI start thinking about my morning cup of coffee at about 9pm the night before, and I’ve tasted a lot of brands in the quest for the perfect blend. My favourite, which I now have on subscription, is by Dark Woods, which is based in a Victorian textile mill at the foot of the West Yorkshire Pennines (near where I’m from). It’s delicious, and the company is also B Corp-certified, donates a proportion of profits to local community projects (£30,000 in two years) and supports projects including orphanages in the countries it sources from. I started with the trio tasting pack, then picked my favourite (Crow Tree) to come every month.View image in fullscreenSabzi biscotti£6.50 at Sabzi DeliI discovered the brilliant Cornish deli Sabzi on a recent trip to Truro, and was delighted to discover the company does mail order. The biscotti is a perfect small gift – delicious with its dark chocolate, pistachios and Iranian barberries. If you’re in for an upgrade, you can also get a gift pack of biscotti; the brand’s own spiced nuts; and a spiced seed topper, which you can throw, Prof Tim Spector-style, over soups or salads to up your gut health.View image in fullscreenMother Root ginger£24.95 at Waitrose£29.95 at AmazonI’ve tried endless no-alcohol alternatives in a bid to replace that 5pm glass of wine, and not all are created equal. Mother Root, however, is one I subscribe to. I love the taste so much – and have given it (successfully) to lots of other women in my life. Mix with tonic, a sprig of rosemary and a slice of orange, and you have yourself a spicy little non-alcoholic cocktail.View image in fullscreenSardines in organic extra-virgin olive oil£5.95 at the Tinned Fish MarketThis is quite specific – she must like fish – but tinned sardines are chic, and these beautifully packaged ones are the tastiest out there.

I’ve been using all three of these products (the oil cleanser, serum and face creme) for the past six months, and they make me glow. I’m devastated they’re about to run out – but all are designed to be refilled, meaning much less packaging waste to feel guilty about.View image in fullscreenFfernfragrance£89 at FfernFfern, based in Somerset, creates a seasonal fragrance four times a year, using natural ingredients and artisan techniques. I’ve had a few bottles and they’re small enough to fit into a handbag and spritz on the go, and smell subtle enough that they don’t overpower (I’m not a frequent fragrance wearer) but draw compliments. It’s an exclusive club to join: there’s a waiting list. But if you join now, you can order the next perfume just before Christmas – and your recipient will receive it at the spring equinox. Failing that, you can buy aseasonal candle.View image in fullscreenSatin Kajal liner£32 at Victoria Beckham£32 at Space NKVictoria Beckham does makeup extraordinarily well. After it sets (before which you can gently smudge it), this waterproof eyeliner really doesn’t budge. For me, with hazel eyes, the best colour is the rich, matt cocoa – it has a small amount of copper glimmer that I feel brings out the green in my eyes. And it comes in such luxe packaging that opening the box feels like a treat.View image in fullscreenInto theDeep bath oil£55 at Dreem DistilleryI love this female-founded independent brand: I’ve used the bath salts for years and am newly hooked on the CBD drops. I use them when I’m wide awake at 3am, and while I can’t say they always send me back to sleep, they give you a lovely sleepy feeling, rather than a manic list-making one. The bath oil is gorgeous – and something I would be delighted to see in my own Christmas stocking.View image in fullscreenCheek flush£26 at Merit Beauty£26 at SephoraSometimes a quick swipe of blusher is all you need to give your face an instant boost.

If this colossus is just the first of a new breed of bulky supertalls, is Britain next?Oliver WainwrightWed 3 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.18 ESTShareAmong the slender needles and elegant spires of the Manhattan skyline, a mountainous lump has reared into view. It galumphs its way up above the others, climbing in bulky steps with the look of several towers strapped together, forming a dark, looming mass. From some angles it forms the silhouette of a hulking bar chart. From others, it glowers like a coffin, ready to swallow the dainty Chrysler building that trembles in its shadow. It is New York’s final boss, a brawny, bronzed behemoth that now lords it over the city with a brutish swagger.Fittingly, this is the new global headquarters of JP Morgan, the world’s biggest bank. The firm enjoys a market capitalisation of $855bn (£645bn), more than Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup’s combined, and it looks as if it might have swallowed all three inside its tinted glass envelope. Last year, for the first time, it made more than $1bn a week in profits. Chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon likes to boast of its “fortress balance sheet”, and he now has an actual fortress to go with it – built at a cost, he revealed at the opening, of around $4bn. He has certainly made his mark. It would be hard to design a more menacing building if you tried.This is a machine to crush the hybrid-working movement once and for allThe Brobdingnagian pile is the work of Foster+Partners, led by the 90-year-old Norman Foster, who is no stranger to penning extravagant bank headquarters. His HSBC tower in Hong Kong was the world’s most expensive building when it opened in 1986, standing as a costly essay in structural redundancy, with a stack of steel suspension bridges bolted to its facade. It wasdescribed by one former partneras “a sledgehammer to crack a nut”. In comparison, the JP Morgan tower is like using a bronze-plated bulldozer to puree a pea.View image in fullscreenExploding … steel columns at street level.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + PartnersThe sheer amount of structural steel – 95,000 tonnes in total – is obscene for a building that contains just 60 storeys in its 423-metre height, half the number of floors you might expect in such a colossus. It uses 60% more steel than the Empire State Building, which is taller and has more square footage. One leading engineer calculated that if the steel was flattened into a belt (30mm wide by 5mm thick), it would wrap the world twice – an apt symbol of the bank’s throttling global domination.If the building is a bullying affront to the skyline, it is just as domineering at street level. It erupts from the sidewalk with gargantuan bunches of steel columns that fan out at each corner, clutching the base of the tower like Nosferatu fingers. Positioned to dodge train tracks below, the columns splay out to hold the building’s swollen mass ominously above new strips of privately owned “public space”, where shallow steps and planters look designed to deter lingering. To the west, on Madison Avenue, the building greets the street with an incongruous cliff face of carved granite boulders. This, it turns out, is an artwork by Maya Lin, who has achieved the impressive feat of making real stone look like fibreglass scenery from Disney’s Frontierland, complete with morsels of mossy garnish clinging to the cracks.On the other side of the block, along Park Avenue, the security guards will let you peer through the windows to admire a US flag hanging from a 12-metre high bronze flagpole at the top of a staircase in the lobby, which, in another surreal twist, flutters in an artificial indoor breeze. It is a rare artwork by Lord Foster himself, who intended the flag’s movement to reflect the wind conditions outside. On the calm, still day of my visit, it was billowing at a stiff clip. In this “city within a city”, JP Morgan gets to dictate the weather it wants.Inside, everything is colossal. Great walls of fluted travertine, sourced from a single quarry in Italy, rise up through the 24-metre-high lobby, flanking a grand travertine staircase framed by a pair of hugeGerhard Richterpaintings. Banks of elevators shuttle the 10,000 workers up into a vertical office-wellness universe, complete with a 19-restaurant food court (with kitchen-to-desk delivery), a hair salon, meditation rooms, fitness centre, medical clinic and a pub. The column-free office floors are fitted with circadian rhythm lighting, creating a carefully calibrated environment, detached from the outside world in the manner of a Las Vegas casino, in the hope that employees might never leave their desks. Dimon is serious about getting everyone back to the office full-time,despite the pleas of his staff. This is his machine to crush the hybrid-working movement once and for all.View image in fullscreenSurreal twist … the lobby flag that blows in an artificial breeze.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + PartnersThe ceiling heights may be lofty (adding many more cubic metres of air to heat and cool), but when an image of the new trading floors was posted on social media,condemnation was swift. Comparisons were made to factory-farmed chickens, Chinese sweatshops, and the very 1950s cellular office space that open-plan layouts are intended to avoid. A conspicuous steel truss zigzagging through the space somewhat undermines the “column-free” claims, and raises questions over the building’s structural logic. One engineer who has studied the plans notes that adding a few more columns and reducing the spans by a couple of metres could have reduced the building’s carbon footprint by 20-30%. But then Foster and Dimon wouldn’t have got the heroic, protein-fuelled steelwork they so desired, slicing its way through the building in monumental Vs.Beyond the structural braggadocio, they were also keen to dial up the theatrics by night. Every evening, for miles around, New Yorkers can now gaze in wonder and horror as the tower’s summit transforms into a glittering crown, bubbling with twinkling lights that rise up the facade like a supersized flute of champagne. It is the work of Leo Villareal, whorecently illuminated the Thames bridges. Sometimes, the throbbing diamond shape adds an inescapable Eye of Sauron vibe. At other moments, it appears to shift into a pulsating yonic void.Vajazzled steeple aside, what makes the tower’s pumped-up extravagance so galling is that it saw a perfectly good office building needlessly bulldozed. The 52-storeyUnion Carbide headquarters, built in 1960 as the celebrated work of Natalie de Blois at SOM, stood as a sleek, Miesian monolith. It had even undergone a full refurbishment and environmental upgrade in 2012 – trumpeted by JP Morganat the timeas “the largest green renovation of a headquarters building in the world”. Just seven years later, at the hands of the same ruthless bank, it became the tallest building ever to be intentionally demolished. To be replaced by something almost twice the height, but with just eight extra floors.View image in fullscreenA touch of Vegas casino … a carefully calibrated environment detaches employees from the outside world.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + Partners.The reason this happened, beyond ego and greed, can be traced to a 2017 zoning change. There had been a growing fear among landlords in East Midtown that the area was losing its lustre as the world’s pre-eminent business address. Office tenants were flocking west, to theglistening new shafts of Hudson Yards, in what is known, in real estate lingo, as the “flight to quality”. The city’s solution, in a shortsighted act of self-sabotage, was to allow Midtown to shape itself after the soulless corporate wasteland of Hudson Yards. Incentives were introduced to encourage demolition, including allowing the sale of unused “air rights” from landmarked buildings within the 78-block area. This means that historical structures that didn’t fill the maximum bulk allowed on their plots could sell their unused potential to others. JP Morganacquired 65,000 square metres of air rightsfrom Grand Central station, and 5,000 square metresfrom St Bartholomew’s church nearby, allowing it to inflate its size far beyond the usual limits.What few might have predicted is the cumulative effect that unleashing this scale of development might have. The JP Morgan tower is not a one-off, but merely the first of a whole new breed of steroidal supertalls. An even bigger 487-metre high, 62-storey tower wasrecently granted permissionat 350 Park Avenue nearby, also designed by Foster+Partners as another bunch of towers strapped together, with the look of a discount bulk-buy. SOM won permission for asimilarly sized monsterat 175 Park Avenue, set to pierce the ground with more fans of columns converging to a point. This part of Midtown will soon resemble a huddle of bloated bankers squeezed into stilettos, casting ever longer shadows down the canyons of Manhattan and obliterating views of the city’s cherished peaks, while crushing a generation of handsome, usable buildings beneath them.For those viewing it from a distance, you may care little about the fate of New York. It is a place long shaped by the forces of unbridled capital, where form follows finance and landowners get to build “as of right”, citizens be damned. But Foster’s bronze goliath is a prelude of what may soon be built in London, on an even bigger scale. Last week, JP Morgan announced that it will begin work ona 280,000 square metre European headquarters in Canary Wharf– by far the biggest office building in the capital, containing more space than the Shard, Gherkin and Walkie-Talkie combined. The design, also by Foster+Partners, has only been teased with a glimpse of a ground-level corner, showing some curved bronze fins wrapping a bulging glass drum. Brace yourselves for what’s out of shot.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureDesignNew YorkNorman FosterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will the left just stand by?Neal LawsonIt’s time for a harsh reality check. A progressive bloc of parties refusing to see a common threat risks disasterNeal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassWed 3 Dec 2025 12.11 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.14 ESTShareThe right always does unity and solidarity better than the left. While real difference exists between liberals and social conservatives, or between globalisers and nationalists, the right has a stronger sense of self-interest. It is much less likely to allow perfect to be the enemy of good.It is by understanding this that you can see past Nigel Farage’s denial of comments that he expects Reform to do an election deal with the Conservatives,as reported by the Financial Times. Particularly since this denial is caveated by his statement that he won’t work with the Tories “as they are”. Likewise, reports in the Times that senior Reform figures are appealing to Farage to secure the defection of Robert Jenrick and appoint him as chancellor after an election victory may berejected by Jenrick. But whatever their individual ambitions, both will surely concede to the emerging consensus: to unite the right, at whatever cost.It is easy for Farage to deny these claims for now, riding high as Reform has been since the general election. But despite doubling its support, it has seemingly hit a ceiling in the low 30s in the polls. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have stabilised in the mid-teens.With no knockout blow looking likely from either side, there is immense pressure from party funders and the rightwing press,the Daily Mail in particular, which wrotea strident leadercolumn in September calling on “all the talents on the Right to come together to sweep away this lamentable excuse for a government”.It is not hard to see why. Analysis conducted by my organisationCompassshows that at the last general election the combined vote of Reform and the Tories should have won them 202 extra seats but they cancelled each other out. Avoiding this in 2029 could take many forms, from an outright merger, an alliance or simply whatLabour and the Liberal Democrats did before the last election, which is to agree in private which party went for which seat. This last arrangement has the benefit of being deniable and doesn’t require any detailed public negotiations.But progressives will probably not have the easier luxury of strategic integration. While the regressive bloc is divided in two, the progressive side splinters into four in England if Your Party gets itself election-ready, alongsideLabour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but not forgetting assorted independents. That number rises to five in Scotland and Wales with the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. This potentially disastrous fragmentation of the party-political scene has been a long time coming. A world of two polarised upper and lower classes and two TV channels, BBC and ITV, has given way to far more nuanced identities and multiple options and platforms in almost every aspect of life. A two-party politics was never going to survive this huge culture shift.As in 2019 and 2024, a party can be handed a majority if there is a polarising issue of the day such as Brexit or the desire to be rid of the Tories. But the underlying fragmentation means that even with respective majorities of 80 then and 180 in 2024, governments have no electoral and civil society foundations for the long-term management of the country on a single-party basis. Labour’s 2024 victory was the lowest in terms of quantity of vote and arguably quality of support. It is little wonder chaos has ensued.Labour strategists know all this. But their answer isn’t to embrace the fragmentation and the pluralist politics such differences demandbut double down on control and coercion. They will try to frame the next election as a clear choice between whoever is the Labour prime minister andNigel Farage. In this it mirrors the strategy of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who keeps pushing to the centre right to build the non-far right majority in the belief that voters have nowhere else to go.But the harsh truth is that this strategy is doomed to fail. First because progressive voters are increasingly unprepared to hold their noses and vote for what they perceive as a non-progressive option, even if it’s the least bad. France saw the rise of theNew Popular Front, while in theUK voters are backing the clearest progressive alternative to Reform, like they did in the recent Caerphilly byelection to the Senedd where Plaid Cymru won, and Labour went from first to a very distant third.But more importantly, this coercive strategy simply papers over the cracks of a politics in which the Overton window moves steadily towards the hard right and the likely big victory of the party that represents a full-fat rather than semi-skimmed version of national populism.Cold electoral logic suggests the right will unite in some shape or form. On the left the ball is in Labour’s court in two crucial respects. First it must become once again a clearly progressive choice for progressive voters. Waging war on asylum seekers and stripping back the jury system are the very opposite of what’s needed. Instead, what’s needed is a fundamentally different fully throated economic approach to re-making Britain in the interests of greater equality, such as wealth taxes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was one of the most urgent questions asked in 2021 when a serving police officer, PC Wayne Couzens, was charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. In thefirst reportof Elish Angiolini’s inquiry into this dreadful sequence of events, published in February last year, she made the eminently sensible recommendation that any individual with a caution or conviction for a sexual offence should be rejected during police vetting.It seemed the very least that should happen, yet we’ve learned from Lady Angiolini’ssecond report this weekthat the recommendation has yet to be implemented. She reveals that it took 18 months after publication for police chiefs to agree a blanket ban on recruits who have convictions, and even then it wasn’t included in draft Home Office regulations issued in September this year.The Home Office has now told Angiolini that a ban will be included, but it won’t be retrospective. The delay is all the more astonishing because her first report highlighted a series of “lamentable and repeated” missed opportunities to stop Couzens, who was a heavy user of violent pornography and had a history of exposing himself in public. Couzens should never have been a police officer and neither shouldDavid Carrick, who was sent to prison for life in 2023 for committing sexual offences against more than a dozen women while serving in the same force.Angiolini’s latest report offers an insight into the extent of the problem, revealing that checks against the police national database in 2023-24 led to 461 police officers, staff and volunteers being referred to “an appropriate authority”. Nine cases triggered further criminal investigations and 88 disciplinary investigations.As Angiolini reminds us, all sorts of promises were made after Everard’s murder. Yet here we are, more than four years later, reading another report that is basically a catalogue of repeated and preventable failures. A quarter of police forces in England and Wales have yet to implement “basic policies for investigating sexual offences”. Neither police nor government ministers know the scale ofattacks on womenin public spaces by strangers. Efforts to reduce violence against women are “fragmented, underfunded and overly reliant on short-term solutions”. Apromise in 2023to give violence against women and girls (VAWG) the same status in crime prevention as terrorism hasn’t been met.The truth is that it isn’t a priority at all. “Too often prevention in this space remains just words,” Angiolini says bluntly. Labour won an election almost 18 months ago with an eye-catching promise tocut VAWG by half within a decade, but Angiolini points out that the government’s strategy for delivering on the promise has yet to be revealed.No one should be surprised. Violence against women is a more reliable producer of reports than measures that might give sexual predators pause. There is a familiar pattern here, beginning with uproar in the media when a particularly egregious offender is finally exposed, followed by the panicked commissioning of yet another report. The conviction in2009 of John Worboys, the taxi driver who drugged and raped women who got into his cab, was rapidly followed by theStern review.The then home secretary, Theresa May, gave the Stern report aneffusive welcome. “Our comprehensive and detailed action plan sets out how we are going to tackle these crimes – supporting those at risk, helping victims and ensuring offenders are brought to justice”, she declared. I don’t doubt she was sincere, but by 2021 a sharp drop in the number of rape prosecutions prompted the then government to set up an “end-to-end rape review”. Three years later, things were even worse, leading Labour to describe the number of prosecutions as “shamefully low” in its 2024 election manifesto.So many reviews, so much hand-wringing, yet impunity remains the norm for the vast majority of rapists. The reason is not hard to find: sexual violence is a crime that prompts more scrutiny of the victim than the offender. Until very recently, traumatised women were told an investigation could not go ahead unless they signed a formgiving detectives accessto their work and home computers, school and medical records since birth, and handed over their mobile phones. No such demands were made of suspects, even though text messages and habitual use of violent porn might be relevant to building a case.Disbelief is at the heart of this scandalous situation. Not just disbelief of individual women, although that’s bad enough, but an underlying attitude among some officers that rape doesn’t really exist – and a reluctance by police chiefs and ministers to make it grounds for dismissal. Three years ago, a report for the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the Home Office admitted that investigations were being hampered by officers whodismissed rape reportsas “regretful sex”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the quality of investigations is undeniably affected by the calibre of the officers carrying them out, some of whom inhabit a culture (like that alleged atCharing Cross in central London) where misogyny and racism is rife.That’s why Angiolini’s insistence that “perpetrators must be the focus” could not be more timely or welcome. So is David Lammy’s announcement on Tuesday that rape victims willno longer be portrayed as serial liarsin courtrooms. Victim blaming has been allowed to flourish in the criminal justice system for far too long, encouraged by a failure to root out police officers who share the mindset of perpetrators.Joan Smith was co-chair of the mayor of London’s Violence Against Women and Girls Board from 2013-2021Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But is this so wrong?Wed 3 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 13.49 ESTShareHave you heard that a family of four in the US is now considered poor if their household income is under $136,500 (£103,300) a year? Don’t @ me about the maths – I’m just the messenger. The person behind this calculation isMichael Green, who is chief strategist and portfolio manager for Simplify Asset Management. I think this means that he makes large sums of money by fiddling with even larger sums of money. When not doing that, Green writes a newsletter and recently published a viral piece on Substack arguing that the poverty line, calculated as $31,200 by the Department of Health and Human Services, is a “broken benchmark”. These days a family with a low six-figure income is officially “the new poor”, he reasoned.Green’s essay has sparked numerous rebuttals, with people arguing that he had turned the poverty measure into a middle-class measure. “It’s completely disconnected from reality,” the economist Kevin Corinth said,for example, noting that the $136,500 figure was higher than the US median household income of $83,730. “It’s laughable to put a poverty line far above the median income in the United States.”Is it reallythatlaughable? I don’t think there’s anything particularly funny about the fact that it’s hard for a family to live on the median income now. While you can certainly quibble with Green’s figures and methodology, the larger point he makes is valuable, and something more people in his tax bracket need to understand. One of the most frustrating things about the 2024 election was the way in which Joe Biden (and then Kamala Harris) kept insisting howgreat the US economy was. That messaging was enraging because, for most people, the economy doesn’t mean markers such as labour market resilience. It means: “Can I afford my housing, my transport and my dinner?” It means: “Can I really afford to have a kid when childcare costs the same as college and health insurance keeps going up?” The answer to all those things is, increasingly: “Hell, no.”The fact that life is now ridiculously expensive is hardly a revelation, but I’m glad that a Wall Street bro is finally cottoning on. Green has figured out why there’s such immense anger in the US.

Why can’t the NHS just give me someone to talk to?Adrian ChilesI can forgive shabby hospitals, confusion over appointments, even doctors’ poor bedside manner, but all the apps in the world can’t replace a real personWed 3 Dec 2025 12.51 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 14.46 ESTShareIhadthis thing on the back of my shoulder, which a dermatologist at an NHS hospital looked at. He was brisk, verging on brusque. He said it was either one complicated-sounding thing or the other, but I distinctly heard the word “carcinoma” in there somewhere. He said I’d have to come back and have it taken out, and then they would see whether or not it was a carcinoma. Great. When? We’ll write to you, he said. I suggested that, if cancer was a possibility, then a bit of hurry-up might be called for. To which he said: “Oh, it won’t make any difference now. The only thing that would have made any difference was if you’d come sooner.” To me, this sentence argued against itself somewhat. Time was either of the essence, or it wasn’t. I even flirted with the idea of interpreting “won’t make any difference now” as his way of saying I was doomed anyway.I called the dermatologist I had previously seen about it privately, and she told me not to be silly, it would be fine. A GP I know said the same. I thanked my lucky stars that I’m privileged to have access to such people.Two weeks later, I was back in for the excision, performed by the same guy I’d seen before. This time, he said he was pretty sure it was cancer, cancerous, a carcinoma, whatever. What is the right bloody word to use anyway? This obviously raised the question, if it is cancer, then what do we do? “Then,” he said, “we have to have a conversation.” Honestly, I don’t think there’s a way of hearing this without it sounding ominous. But by now I was almost past caring. All I wanted him to do was stop saying worrying things and, instead, whip out his scalpel, go in as deep as he fancied, and dig the bastard thing out. This he did. He told me to get the stitches taken out in 10 days’ time, and he would either call or write with the results of the tests.On the way home, something dawned on me: if there were now to be a problem with the wound or, like in some horror film, the excised growth reanimated and came bursting up through the stitches, I had no means of contacting this dermatologist. I doubt I would ever have had cause to talk to him, but I would have liked to have known the option was there. So what would I have done? Gone back to my GP, I suppose, taking up their valuable time.A week later, a letter arrived from the hospital. With trembling hands, I opened it. Imagine my exasperation on finding this was not notice of my results, but notification of the original appointment for the excision. Terrific. And still no one to speak to.This, more than anything, is what matters to me. I don’t care about the shabbiness of hospitals, confusion over appointment times and places, even the poor communication skills of some doctors. I just want to know there’s a number to call, which will get me someone relevant to talk to.But there isn’t. I know this, because when I had no choice but to call, there was no one remotely helpful on the other end of the line. Twenty-three days after the excision, my phone pinged with a message saying there was stuff to read on myNHSapp. This was last Thursday. There were two letters on there – one inviting me to an appointment to see a new dermatologist at a different hospital on Monday, the other to an appointment in March with yet another dermatologist at the original hospital. No test results then. Obviously too grim to relate by letter. The first appointment was presumably to give me the bad news – that I was done for – and the second would be just to check I was dead.I got a grip. I called the number on the letter. Apart from anything else, I’d be 200 miles away on Monday so needed the appointment to be over the phone. The number, of course, went to some central admin call centre. “I will escalate the request,” the woman said. I emailed. Nothing back. Then, ping! Oh, this will be it. Nope. Just a text confirming the appointment. Then, another ping! This one, surely? No. This was yet another confirmation, generated for the NHS by a company called DrDoctor – “award-winning technology and expertise to transition the NHS to a hybrid model of healthcare”. There were emails too. And also, so help me God, an automated phone call seeking my feedback on the quality of service. By now I wanted to flush my phone down the toilet. This crap masquerades as communication, but communication is either two-way or it’s nothing. So this was nothing. Plenty of DrDoctor, but no actual doctor.Drowning now in an alphanumeric soup of different passwords and usernames, I dug deep into the apps. One of them, ostensibly from the trust but “powered by Patients Know Best” – told me the test results weren’t due until 18December. The founder of Patients Know Best, I read, was motivated by his frustration at “witnessing patients experience suboptimal care as a result of disjointed information sharing”.I decided not to drive the 200 miles to the hospital for the Monday morning appointment. This was just as well, because if I had done so I would have been sitting in the waiting room when my phone rang with the telephone appointment I’d requested. I was too beside myself with gratitude to moan much about not being informed that this would be happening. “Admin’s a totally different department,” the nurse on the phone said, apologetic but helpless. She was kind, she was knowledgable, she was all I’d wanted. It took just five minutes.Oh yes, I almost forgot, it was a squamous cell carcinoma. All removed and won’t spread. So not nothing, but not serious. Needs keeping an eye on. Whatever, I don’t care, because I now have this skin cancer nurse’s email. The human contact feels as good as any treatment or cure.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealthSkin cancerAppscommentShareReuse this content"

He said Nelson didn’t wish to do a full term of six to nine years, a remark that didn’t feel controversial at the time. After all, while US presidents may go on into their 80s these days, chairs of globally important banks tend not to.Nelson has been an HSBC non-executive director for two years, so should know the bank’s unique vibe by now. He’s also done time on the boards of BP and post-crisis Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest during periods of boardroom rough and tumble. Those are not insignificant qualifications for the role, and when the balance sheet is as complex as HSBC’s, top-level audit experience helps.Yet it’s easy to see why – likely length of tenure aside – Nelson wasn’t attracting much betting money. He may have advised banks at KPMG but he’s not a banker. He hasn’t chaired a FTSE 100 company. And he doesn’t bring much experience of walking geopolitical tight ropes.HSBC is a UK-regulated bank that makes half its money in Hong Kong and mainland China and must constantly be alert to flare-ups between Washington, Beijing and London. Memories are fresh of how HSBC wasaccused by Mike Pompeo, when US secretary of state, of “a corporate kowtow” to the Chinese Communist party for its response in 2020 to Beijing’s move to end Hong Kong’s autonomy.Maybe it was the political and Chinese considerations that led HSBC to interview podcaster (and former chancellor) George Osborne for the role. Come on, though, that would have been an extraordinary appointment: Osborne doesn’t have banking or boardroom expertise. Goldman Sachs’s Asia boss Kevin Sneader, a former management consultant, was reported to be another on the shortlist but clearly didn’t convince enough of the board either.It is, admittedly, a hard post to fill. There simply aren’t many figures who tick all the boxes. HSBC, for most of its 160 years, shopped internally for its chairs but that approach led to a few exciting bust-ups. Tucker, former boss of the Prudential and Asian-focused insurer AIA, was the first external appointment in 2017 and fitted the bill as an experienced financial services executive and old China hand.Yet the difficulty in finding candidates isn’t an excuse for an appointment process that, as names have come in and out of the frame, has appeared shambolic. Tucker probably didn’t help matters by hopping off a year earlier to go back to AIA, but succession-planning is meant to be a constant obsession for boards. The game is about maintaining a likely list of candidates just in case you need to move quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your tasteWed 3 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTShareIlike year-end list season. I like an opportunity to remember and reflect on the records that stuck with me over the course of a year – especially when there is a chance to recommend something that others may have overlooked. I like looking through friends’ favourites for albums that I missed completely, and making a big listening queue. I like following along as critics attempt to determine the year’s “best”, even when I end up yelling into a group chat about how wrong they all are. I like it because it all requires looking back, racking your brain and processing your year in listening. It requires thinking.This year, asSpotifyWrapped takes over social media feeds again, I am struck by how the whole concept seems to discourage that critical practice for something more passive. It nudges listeners away from deep consideration and towards accepting a corporate-branded scorecard reflecting a very specific perspective on musical value. It encourages music fans to believe that the records they streamed the most must be the ones they liked the most, which is surely not always the case.What’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our yearsWhat is lost when we entrust Spotify’s systems of data collection and interpretation to do our year-end reflections for us? What ideas and recaps are we not writing and sharing when we hand over that labour to tech companies who would prefer to automate our thinking? What playlist are you not making when you share the one Spotify has made for you?As with other ways in which convenience culture infects music – from personalised playlists to prompt-based audio generation and beyond – it makes sense that some fans would receive their results, see the “share” button, and dutifully comply. But what’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our years. When our own thoughts and recollections aren’t written down they can simply get lost. When we just accept that what a streaming service tells us about our music taste is true, there is much that we arenotremembering, learning or celebrating about the music of our years and lives.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead moreSpotify Wrapped now feels like just another example of something personal and precious that is being automated away from us; another example of a supposedly unbearable task of thinking and writing being “offloaded” in order to make life more frictionless. It is an especially urgent consideration in 2025, a landmark year for consumers being sold on this sort of cognitive offloading via consumer-facing AI. It can feel as though every day there is some new start-up prompt-based surveillance product claiming to ease the daily burdens of reading, writing, researching, summarising or brainstorming – but this is the work that helps shape how we think, how we make connections, what we remember and what we forget. It may sometimes feel unpleasant and it may require friction, but friction is where connections get made, and working through that process is a part of staying sharp and curious and in relationship with the world around us. Without those points of friction, the degeneration of critical thinking just continues.There is much to be said about how corporate decision-making shapes public memory when it comes to music – not just because marketing budgets often determine what becomes popular but because corporate strategy decides the very metrics that dictate what has value. But Wrapped does not just use corporate metrics to communicate what’s important to the market – it uses the same logic to make claims about what’s important toyou. It reinforces its own logic into not just taste but one’s sense of self.View image in fullscreenSpotify Wrapped takes over a digital art space in London.Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for SpotifyAnd there are other reasons to find the whole Wrapped idea generally troubling – and not just Wrapped but the similar year-end recap campaigns that other streaming services have launched to mimic it. These are essentially meme-like advertising campaigns for companies that notoriously pay musicians penny fractions. And they are only possible due to user-surveillance practices. As for Spotify specifically, in a year in which the biggest music streaming company has made headlines for its outgoing CEO’s investment in military AI technology and thesubsequent artist boycotts, its deals with major labelsto build generative AI products, big changes in its leadership and its running of ICE recruitment ads, there will likely be much Wrapped-synchronised commentary on the state of streaming – and the varied reasons users will find for opting out this year.‘One minute it’s “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved’: can anyone escape Spotify?Read moreSo what will we opt into instead? This year, rather than letting a streaming service tell you what records were important to you simply because you played them the most on one app, consider taking the time to write a list based on what you actually connected with. Share it if you feel like it – even if it’s just a notes app screenshot or a scribbled, handwritten list that you photograph and share with a caption. Even if you only text or email it to some friends. Or if you prefer, write it in a notebook just for yourself and your archives.I can already hear some of the defeatist replies this idea is likely to receive: “But the people who post their Wrapped were never going to make their own lists anyway!” To which I say: “Why not?” It may require some research but at least you can determine the parameters for yourself. I would suggest a list of records you feel may have been overlooked, or a list of your favourite local releases. Or how about a list of the most exciting live shows you saw, or the most surprising new-to-you music from the past? The possibilities are limitless.

After a decade in eerie command of the Republican party, with primary voters in his cult-like thrall and down-ballot elected officials feeling they have no choice – and often no inclination – to diverge from him,Donald Trumpsuddenly seems not quite in control of his own political machine.Fractures have emerged in the Maga coalition; Trump’s approval issinking; the Democrats, long anemic and risk-averse in the opposition, showed signs of life in elections last month; and the cumulative effect of a series of long-running scandals, most particularly the Epstein affair, seem to have alienated core components of the Trump faithful. Trump has faced some rebukes from a once largely compliant federal judiciary: his personal attorney, Alina Habba, wasrecently declared ineligibleto serve in the US attorney role Trump had appointed her to, and hissignature tariffs seem likelyto be struck down by a conservative supreme court majority.John Roberts has badly weakened our democracy. Will he ever stand up to Trump? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreTrump himself, meanwhile, is unfocused, losing his signature humor and charisma, and showing his age. In recent photos he looks pale, exhausted; he seems to havestruggled to keep his eyes openin front of cameras. Trump seems more interested in the construction of his oversized ballroom than in the work of policy. His advisers – the scheming group of frauds, racists, opportunists and swindlers who surround him in his second term – are evidently running the show, and they do not always see eye to eye. The old man won’t be around forever; Republicans are beginning to imagine what the country – and more importantly, their own careers – will look like without him.Is this how the Trump era in American politics ends – not with a bang, but with a whimper? It would be overstating the case, and speaking far too soon, to say that Trump has become a lame duck, or that the Republican party is moving on from the identity that he gave it. But the signals of his waning influence are everywhere.For one thing, more and more Republicans seem willing to break with Trump – something that would have been unthinkable for them, and a kind of career suicide, just a few months ago. While Trump was able to compel Republicans in the Texas state legislature to draw new congressional district mapswith just a command(an effort that is now facing anuphill battle in the courts), Republicans in Indiana are resisting Trump’s push to have them do the same, with one GOP legislator saying that she “will not cave” on redistricting even as she announced apipe bombthreat had been called into her house.Other signs are beginning to stir. Trump, with his typically casual relationship to the truth, has insisted that the economy is booming as a result of his ill-conceived tariff program. “Costs are way down,”he said, falsely, in a long 10 November interview with Fox’s Laura Ingraham. ButIngraham pushed back– rare for a Fox host – and soon, other rightwing mouthpieces were, too; weary of repeating the Biden administration’s 2024 mistake of projecting a sunnier picture of the economy than that reflected by consumer sentiment, and perhaps chastened by the sweeping victories of 2025 Democratic candidates who ran on messages of affordability. Soon, both JD Vance and Ben Shapiro were telling a different story on the economy. “When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don’t believe that,”Shapiro said.Vance asked votersfor “patience”: “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do.”It’s a low bar, to be able to merely contradict or disagree with the president. Nevertheless, it is noticeable that more and moreRepublicansare clearing it; many of them have spent the better part of their careers, at this point, praising the emperor’s new clothes.A few are going further. Among the most damaging scandals of the Trump era is the slow drip of revelations about the depth of friendship between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the dead financier and pedophile, and the accumulation of documents both from Trump to Epstein and by Epstein about Trump that suggest that Trump, in Epstein’s parlance, “knew about the girls”. The Epstein saga, after all, had been a major fixture of the paranoid conspiracies in the far-right media ecosystem, whose podcasts, Discords, and YouTube channels helped drive Trump to victory in 2024. Those conspiracy-minded communities once viewed Trump as a quasi-messianic figure – as in QAnon, the pandemic-era viral sensation that posited Trump as the leader of a vast, secret effort to undermine a cabal of powerful pedophiles. But these same groups have begun to turn on Trump as the newly revealed documents from the Epstein estate – and the Trump administration’s efforts to repress them – have made this fantasy harder to maintain. The politicians who swept into office on the strength of the QAnon theory are taking note. Majorie Taylor Greene, an ambitious Georgia congresswoman and onetime conspiracy theorist,broke with Trump publiclyover the Epstein issue; soon after hedeclared her an enemy, she announced that she would beleaving Congress in January.She won’t be the last. As Republicans continue to face strong headwinds from anti-Trump sentiment going into 2026, and as Trump himself dwindles in popularity, accumulates liabilities, and proves unwilling to compromise on his demands or reward loyal Republicans, it is likely that more and more GOP representatives will be looking for the exits. Meanwhile, Maga has begun to eat its own, with infighting over Epstein, antisemitism and economics slowly beginning to turn Trump’s operatives against each other as they jockey for position. The Trump era is not over – far from it – but we may be seeing the beginning of its next phase: what is likely to be a bleak, bloody and belligerent battle of succession.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He wants the glory of having brokered a deal anddoes not carewhether it is fair or not. As for Vladimir Putin, he only wants peace on terms that achieve things which the Russian army has failed to manage with force. The Kremlin demands territory not yet won on the battlefield and limitations to Ukraine’s capacity to act as a fully sovereign state.Mr Trump has never shown much natural aversion to giving Mr Putin what he wants. He has not applied serious pressure on the Kremlin to end its aggression, nor rebuked the Russian president for starting the war. He sees nothing wrong with a process that discusses the fate of a country, including de facto partition of its territory, without representatives of that country at the table.If Ukraine’s interests are factored into White House thinking at all, it is down to assiduous diplomacy by its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his European allies. Their interventions have so far prevented Mr Trump selling Kyiv out completely, much to the Kremlin’s frustration. This week’s trip to Moscow by the White House envoy, Steve Witkoff – usually a credulous audience for Russian negotiators – producedno breakthrough. Mr Putin attributes the impasse to “sabotage” of the process by Nato’s European members. He treats any recognition of Ukrainian interests as an attack on Russian national dignity.Russian propaganda often singles Britain out as a villain in this regard – something that Sir Keir Starmer should take as a compliment in recognition of his service to the cause of Ukrainian self-defence. The prime minister deserves credit for his part in the combined European effort to counteract White House pandering to Mr Putin and for his leading role in coordinating a “coalition of the willing” to show unwavering solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy.Correcting Mr Trump’s pro-Russian biases is a sisyphean task. The diplomatic effort must be constantly sustained. Meanwhile, European leaders must always be attentive to their duty to build autonomous capacity to protect the continent. On that front, Sir Keir is less consistent. He has agreed a European defence and security agreement in principle and, in recent weeks, he has spoken with growing conviction about the need for closer EU cooperation. In practice, the rapprochementhas stalled, in part for want of political impetus from Downing Street.In aspeechearlier this week, the prime minister restated his insistence that there is no dilemma when it comes to relations with Europe and the US. That view is either naive or disingenuous. Mr Trump is not a reliable ally to Europe or anyone else. He sometimes speaks of the EU withundiluted hostility. His trade policy recognises no mutual strategic interests, only clients and enemies. That prejudice is not unique to the current president. It is embedded in Republican ideology. It would be unwise for any European country to bet its national interest on transatlantic partnership.Mr Trump’s indulgence of Russian arguments overUkraineis a warning. In an even bigger security crisis, could Washington be counted on to take Europe’s side against the Kremlin? That the answer is uncertain should compel Sir Keir to accelerate his claimed ambition of restored closeness to Europe. Vague aspirations must now urgently become concrete deals.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

New working patterns would help without compromising resultsWed 3 Dec 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 14.46 ESTShareCan you guess which professionals in England work 26 hours of overtime a week withoutcompensation, give up time with friends and family to deal with the workload and often find themselves on callin the holidays? Not CEOs, bankers or even doctors, but teachers. No wonder, then, that teachingvacancies are at the highest level ever. Workload is the top concern thatteachers cite for leaving the profession, with almost as many quitting as those who joined last year. The consequences are stark: a quarter of English schools do not have aphysics teacher, andmany key subjectsaren’t being offered at A-level in the poorest places.The 4 Day Week Foundation believes that a shorter working week could alleviate these pressures if trialled in a way similar to the Scottish proposals of a four-day week, with a flexible fifth day that allows dedicated time for marking and lesson preparation. This means the work that teachers are currently forced to do at weekends and evenings would be integrated into the working week instead of being unpaid overtime.The foundation is not proposing sending pupils home for a whole extra day, which should assuage parents’ concerns about having to pay for childcare. Instead, it suggests teachers get a four-day week in the classroom, while schools remain open five days. The argument should be compelling for a government that has pledged to hire 6,500 new teachers to deal with the ongoing crisis, but without anyclear plans of how to do so.There are understandable concerns from school leaders. Many say that they barely have the funds to meet current demands, let alone introduce new working patterns, and they warn that arranging reliable, high-quality cover for staff could be expensive. A shift to shorter weeks would inevitably mean reworking timetables as well. Ministers are backingflexible workingin teaching, but progress has been too slow.Schools that have experimented with new working patterns are already seeing results. The academy chain Dixons introduced a nine-day fortnight last year and boostedretentionby 43%. TheEducation Endowment Foundationfound that teachers value protected time for marking, smaller classes and basic healthcare as much as a 10% pay rise. With schools spending £1.25bn on supply teaching every year – mostly toagenciesthat often pay teachers around half of what they charge schools – reducing burnout would save money as well as staff.Some worry that a shorter week might harm academic outcomes. But research by theAutonomythinktank on the small number of schools that have innovated seems to suggest the opposite. The Community Schools Trust in Forest Gate, east London, which opted for a four-and-a-half-day week in 2022, saw itsresults improve the following year, and claims that staff are much happier too.Teachers in England work some ofthe longest hours of all OECD countries, averaging 51hours a week. No wonder many flee abroad for better working conditions. The government has tried – and largely failed – to lure overseas talent with£10,000 relocation bonuses. Teachers need to stop being forced into pathological overwork. The four-day working week campaign is not asking for a radical restructuring of schools, simply that teachers have a better work-life balance. Cash must be found. This isn’t a perk; it’s a necessary reform to stop a system collapsing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromDiana GoodandFrancis FitzGibbon KCWed 3 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 15.26 ESTShareSimon Jenkins implies that removing juries will give us the benefits of European inquisitorial judicial systems or the enlightened Scandinavian approach to justice (David Lammy is right to slash the use of juries – it’s an open-and-shut case, 28 November).Neither the Leveson report nor David Lammy’s memo suggest anything of the kind. They seek to retain the adversarial system and simply remove the democratic element that is its best safeguard in serious cases.The deep concern that criminal lawyers and defendants express at this worst-of-both-worlds is not special pleading. It is the insight of the people caught up in a system that most of the public understandably do not consider closely until they are unlucky enough to be charged with a crime, or otherwise see from the relatively comfortable perspective of a juror or journalist.Tellingly, Mr Jenkins seems to describe having been on juries who returned not-guilty verdicts because they could see it was obvious that a criminal conviction was a grossly disproportionate consequence of what they had been asked to assess. He should consider whether a case-hardened professional judge on their umpteenth grievous bodily harm case would retain the same sense of proportion in analysing the same facts.We know that jurors bring a humane, rounded perspective to the system that trained professionals who spend their life in court cannot. Mr Jenkins and his fellow jurors seem to have done exactly that, even if his patience was tested by the delays involved in getting things right.Simeon WallisBarrister, 2BR chambersMy experience of sitting as a part-time judge in the criminal courts is that juries work well. Jurors take the job very seriously and tend to come to the right conclusion (except in fraud cases). It brings citizens who are complete strangers together to decide something serious. If only we had more opportunities for citizens to come together in people’s assemblies to contribute to government policy decision-making.The terrible court backlogs and numbers detained without trial are the result of massive underfunding, not juries. Simon Jenkins mistakenly blames juries for the numbers in prison. Juries only decide guilt – sentencing is exclusively the judge’s job. And Jenkins’s idea that barristers like juries because they want an audience shows that he has watched too much television.Barristerswant to be paid, not to have an audience. The solution is more funding, not abandoning trial by jury.Diana GoodLondonOf his experience as a juror, Simons Jenkins writes: “All we knew was that a guilty verdict leading to a jail sentence would be grotesque. Going to prison is not a matter of months. For most people, its consequence is a sentence for life.” There he identifies one of the greatest values of the jury – their ability to decide a case according to conscience. Judges can only apply the law in all its grotesque harshness, whether they like it or not. Abolish juries and we lose that protection against legally sanctioned oppression.Francis FitzGibbon KCBarrister, 23ES chambersHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The government’s removal of “luxury” vehicles may sound reasonable, but these cars account for just 5% of Motability leases and disabled people already pay the extra costs themselves through advance payments.At the same time, the government isabolishing £300min Motability tax reliefs – a move that Motability itself says is likely to be passed on to disabled customers. This means higher advance payments, more expensive leases and fewer suitable vehicles available. These cuts will reduce independence, not public spending.More troubling is the justification. The policy is being sold as supporting UK manufacturing despite the reality that our car industry is diminished and largely foreign-owned. Using disabled people’s mobility as a lever for industrial strategy is deeply cynical.I say this as someone who knows what is made possible by adapted vehicles. I don’t use Motability today, but I grew up in a family where all four of us children had muscular dystrophy. In the 1990s, my siblings and I relied on large, specially adapted Chrysler Voyagers.They were never “luxuries”; they were the only vehicles capable of safely carrying power wheelchairs, aids and medical equipment, and the only way we could travel to work, to hospital appointments and to see friends and family.Motability has long been one of the UK’s quiet social-policy successes. These changes narrow choice and undermine that purpose. For a Labour government to adopt rhetoric that echoes rightwing narratives about “luxury” cars is a disappointing and dangerous step.Colin HughesLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This rests on an idealised view of capitalism. Early capitalism saw similar dynamics: the East India Company, backed by the British state, controlled trade routes, exploited resources and wielded political power, enabling it to charge above-market prices for commodities such as tea and spices.In Capital,Karl Marxnoted that English landlords helped establish capitalism by dispossessing peasants and commodifying land. They earned monopoly rents from their exclusive control of this productive resource – a portion of surplus value originally created by exploited labour and first appropriated by industrial capitalists before being transferred to landowners.Varoufakis contrasts this with today’s firms, arguing that they extract rents rather than produce goods. But these rents still originate in labour. Every product sold onAmazondepends on human work – whether in factories, warehouses or delivery networks.Far from signalling feudalism’s return, Amazon exemplifies capitalism’s evolution. Its power lies not in escaping capitalist logic but in intensifying it: global supply chains, algorithmic management and relentless cost-cutting squeeze labour harder than ever. The global working class today is hundreds of times larger than in Marx’s era, and its exploitation underpins the rents that Varoufakis describes. To frame this as “technofeudalism” risks obscuring the real problem – not a break from capitalism but its deepening grip on production, distribution and everyday life.Prof Benjamin SelwynUniversity of SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ashes hostilities are renewed and the hosts don’t need to ask too many questionsGeoff Lemonin BrisbaneWed 3 Dec 2025 12.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.15 ESTShareAt last, at long last, an Ashes series is about to start. It feels that way, anyway, after so many months of lead-up, such an eternal blur of preview and prediction and preamble, were supposed to reach their end – only to find that the end was instead a momentary interruption, a hiccup, an indigestion-dream of aTest from Perth, a contest done in the span of 31 hours, leaving everyone to return to punditry and prognostication for a further 11 blasted and benighted days.We are, for pity’s sake, in a discussion cycle about Ben Stokes correctly applying a bike helmet while not on a bike, or Steve Smith correctly applying eye-black stickers in his Tim Tebow tribute act, or the archaeologically uncovered fact that Australian teams have agood record at the Gabba. Like farmers waiting for the rains, we are praying for play to start to let us talk about something that has happened, rather than something that might. Even the day-night format means another wait, four more hours than would usually be the case before the balm of the first ball.The Spin | Pink-ball wizard: batters on facing ‘devastating weapon’ Mitchell StarcRead moreEnglandconfirmed their teamwell in advance with an interesting call, deciding that the best way to improve a side whose reckless batting imploded is by including a top-order T20 smasher at No 8 because he might bowl a few overs of spin that they do not think they need. But just at the moment when anyone observing this series felt that there was literally nothing left to talk about, Australia will now wait until the toss to decide on a gamble in their XI that they may be willing to take.The call is whether to include the regular captain Pat Cummins as part of a dizzying game of three-card monte that selectors have been playing with the squad in recent days. Usman Khawaja was included in that squad despite recent injury, then ruled out because of the same injury. Cummins was ruled out because of recent injury, and maycome into the XIdespite not being in the squad. The possible knock-on effects of both are convoluted.Cummins, it seems, is now feeling good enough in training that waiting for the third Test in Adelaide seems excessive. But overnight nerves might get the better of anyone in the decision-making chain, pondering the fallout that would await them if that comeback turned out to be too soon. That leaves a nation of Australians in the highly unusual position of going to sleep the night before a Test match without knowing who will captain the team the next day. The stand-in, Steve Smith, took the press conference as though he would do the job, but declined to confirm that this would be the case.If Cummins returns, the cards in the dealer’s hands could be whisked in various ways around the table. Perhaps in order to mitigate the number of overs required of him, he could be part of a four-man pace attack and replace Nathan Lyon. That might also mean bringing Beau Webster into the middle order, given he could offer spin. If Cummins plays alongside Lyon, instead replacing Brendan Doggett as one of three quicks, Webster could still be included to bowl backup seam alongside Cameron Green.View image in fullscreenCould Pat Cummins’ return make way for Beau Webster?Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAIf Webster does not bat in the middle, Josh Inglis will, because Travis Head will open the batting. Unless, that is, they decide to send Inglis up to open in the first innings, but perhaps send Head up to do the job second time around if they need to chase as they did in Perth, or to add fast third-innings runs before bowling in an evening session.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much has been made of him being left out in Jamaica earlier this year, and two pink-ball Tests in Adelaide 2024 and Hobart 2022, where he was not required. This reasoning absurdly omits the other 11 day-night tests that he has played, all of which have seen him bowl more than 20 overs in the match, five of which have topped 40 overs, and the highest of which was 67 overs.Don’t get carried away, is the subtext. Pink-ball games can move in fast forward. So can red-ball games, as we saw at the start of this series 1 million years ago. Plenty of the time, though, pink-ball cricket can be long and slow and require graft, just like the other stuff. There will be tactical considerations about batting time in an effort to bowl in the evenings, but the evenings can be got through or turned to the batting team’s advantage, like any other session. Even in this series, even in this format, even if surprise inclusions do come to pass, there is still a chance that over five days, some of the cricket might feel normal. If it is another fast one, at least we will have 11 days to chat until Adelaide.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamAustralia sportCricketThe AshesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the 94th minute and Federico Chiesa was waving his arms in front of Liverpool fans, rejoicing not in delivering a victory befitting his job as a striker but in saving thePremier Leaguechampions from certain defeat. Sunderland should consider their point at Anfield as an opportunity missed.Chiesa’s celebration followed his goalline clearance to denySunderlanda first win at Anfield since October 1983. Slot, though restrained in his technical area, must have been tempted to join in. His team were staring at a 10th defeat in 14 games when Wilson Isidor, on as a Sunderland substitute, raced through from goalkeeper Robin Roefs’s smart pass and rounded Alisson in the Liverpool goal. Chiesa, on as a substitute as Slot chased victory, had abandoned his attacking instincts to track back and produced a vital block. Liverpool were spared another inquest, just about.Liverpool 1-1 Sunderland: Premier League – liveRead more“In the final minutes I thought we were close to making it 2-1 because we had a few set pieces and were constantly around their box,” Slot said. “But then from one set piece their goalkeeper gets the ball and when I looked up I saw their player completely free on the halfway line. The good thing is Fede could have thought it had nothing to do with him but he kept sprinting back and made a good block. The draw was the minimum we deserved.”That was a positive take on proceedings by theLiverpoolhead coach. The Premier League champions were again subdued on home soil and, although they did put Sunderland under pressure late on, rarely threatened to cancel out Chemsdine Talbi’s deflected opener until Florian Wirtz forced Nordi Mukiele to unwittingly concede an 81st‑minute own goal. Roefs made only routine saves as Liverpool then pushed for what would have been a flattering victory. “The players are discovering a new league,” the Sunderland head coach, Régis Le Bris, said. “It is our debut in this league and I think we are learning fast.” Le Bris’s assessment was more accurate than his opposite number’s.Few could have predicted that the newly promoted Sunderland would be above the reigning champions in the table come December but they showed why in a high-tempo, confident opening. Brian Brobbey led the line impressively on his first Premier League start and engaged Ibrahima Konaté in a constant physical battle. Close support from Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée ensured the Liverpool defence were never comfortable in the first half.View image in fullscreenChemsdine Talbi’s shot flies beyond Alisson to give Sunderland the lead.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockDominik Szoboszlai presented the visitors with their first genuine opportunity. Trai Hume took possession of the Liverpool midfielder’s loose touch and let fly from 25 yards. Alisson could only push Hume’s effort on to his crossbar and was relieved to see the rebound bounce clear.Liverpool promised only in flashes. Wirtz and Alexander Isak looked to build on their improvements at West Ham on Sunday but received little service as carelessness characterised Liverpool’s play. Alexis Mac Allister did come close to opening the scoring but his free header from a Joe Gomez cross struck the base of a post.Mohamed Salah was left on the bench for the second game in succession, the first time that has happened in his phenomenal Liverpool career, but introduced at the start of the second half with Slot having seen enough aimless attacking play. Salah replaced the anonymous Cody Gakpo with Szoboszlai shifting into his favoured central role and Wirtz out to the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool were unable to capitalise on the let-off. Their performance was not good enough to do so.Five minutes after the defender’s warning shot Sunderland took the lead following an error by Virgil van Dijk. The Liverpool captain mis-controlled and misplaced an attempted clearance straight to Le Fée. The playmaker fed Talbi who, in space on the right, took aim with a shot that struck Van Dijk on the backside and sailed beyond Alisson into the far corner. It was the 11th time in the past 14 games that Liverpool had conceded first and the Anfield crowd did not hide its annoyance when Isak and Andy Robertson squandered possession cheaply in quick succession.This time there would be a response. Sunderland were holding out comfortably when a lapse in concentration by Talbi invited Curtis Jones to steal the ball off his toes. Wirtz took over inside the Sunderland box and weaved his way past Reinildo Mandava and Dan Ballard brilliantly before swiping at goal. His shot was sailing wide but struck Mukiele and diverted in.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was not even particularly memorable. There was an enterprising start fromArsenal, who delighted the Emirates Stadium when a lovely move ended with Merino scoring for the second time in four days, but their attacking flow faded after the opening 20 minutes and they ended up leaning on their resilience after the loss of Cristhian Mosquera to injury before half-time increased their issues at the back.A more fragile side would have wilted in those circumstances. Yet Arsenal coped without Mosquera – the unfamiliar partnership of Jurriën Timber and Piero Hincapié holding firm – and their 18-match unbeaten run in all competitions is testament to their steel, as well as how their deep squad is holding out despite the absence of key players in defence and attack.The leaders are, of course, being stretched as the weeks go by and the fixtures pile up. Declan Rice limped off with a calf problem during the closing stages – “We need to check on him,” Arteta said of the midfielder – and it will be tougher when Arsenal visit Aston Villa on Saturday. Losing Mosquera when Gabriel Magalhães and William Saliba are already missing in central defence is clearly not ideal and, coupled with the worries over Rice, left Arteta grumbling about the schedule after a draining period.“Give us another day [to prepare],” the manager said. “We’re all going to benefit. We’ve never had such schedule – not only in the Premier League but every competition internationally as well. It’s common sense. The players are not machines.”Although Arteta does not have a reputation for tinkering, part of his focus has to be on preserving energy levels during this slog of a season. He cannot overplay key assets and the benefit of freshening things up was evident during a start in which Arsenal did not appear to be carrying any extra weight after facing Tottenham, Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the space of a week.This is why Arteta invested so much in bolstering his resources last summer. Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard are still missing up front but what a luxury it is to be able to give Eberechi Eze a breather and bring in Martin Ødegaard. There was also a rest for Saka, whose place on the right went to Madueke, while Timber dropping to the bench meant Ben White came in for his second league start of the season.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka’s powerful strike makes sure for Arsenal.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAIt was not a surprise that Arteta singled out White for praise. The right‑back has had a terrible time with injuries but this bustling performance was a step in the right direction. “I’m very happy for him as a human being,” said Arteta, who loved both White’s powerful defending and how the 28-year-old’s overlapping runs ensured that his partnership with Madueke clicked early on.There were 11 minutes on the clock when they combined for the opening goal. White began the move with a lay-off to Madueke and confused Rico Henry by continuing his run. TheBrentfordwing-back was in clear danger. Henry watched for the dart inside from Madueke but that was a decoy. Madueke waited for help and then opened Brentford up with a drag‑back to White, who reached the byline and hung up a cross for Merino to head past Caoimhín Kelleher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Consistency is the key for the England player. He should have scored before half-time only to spurn three opportunities, and he faded before making way for Saka in the 61st minute.Brentford, who started with Nathan Collins, Jordan Henderson, Mikel Damsgaard and Igor Thiago on the bench, had forced their way back into the contest. They almost equalised when Kevin Schade met a corner from the right, only for David Raya to tip the forward’s header on to the bar. “We caused them problems,” Keith Andrews, Brentford’s manager, said. “We made it uncomfortable.”Arsenal were tense after an awkward fall led to Mosquera making way for Timber. Brentford could not make their physicality count. They forced a succession of set pieces but did not test Raya even after introducing Henderson, Damsgaard and Thiago. It grew tense. Riccardo Calafiori and Rice were denied by Kelleher and there were howls from the home fans when the fourth official’s board showed six added minutes.Not to worry. Moments later Merino released Saka, who squeezed a shot past Kelleher. Arsenal did enough again.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The pressure had been mounting after a run of four successive defeats that had dropped the side into the relegation zone, and left speculation swirling over Daniel Farke’s future at the club.Arsenal 2-0 Brentford, Leeds 3-1 Chelsea, and more: Premier League – liveRead moreHowever, this comprehensive and deserved victory againstChelseawas a performance that had all the hallmarks of Wilkinson’s great teams of the 1990s – aggression, energy and quality. Wilkinson was given a standing ovation at half-time when he was inducted into the National Football Hall of Fame.The result not only moved Leeds out of the bottom three, but perhaps alleviated some of the pressure on Farke in the process. He switched to a back three for the first time this season in a response to Leeds’s recent woes, and it paid off in some style. From minute one, the hosts were the superior team and Chelsea had little in the way of an answer on a night they will be keen to forget and move on from quite quickly.As for Leeds, this will be an occasion they will cherish and one they will hope to build upon with the stuttering champions, Liverpool, the visitors on Saturday.First-half goals from Jaka Bijol and Ao Tanaka put the hosts into a deserved two-goal lead by half-time and, while Chelsea responded with a Pedro Neto goal after the restart, Dominic Calvert-Lewin exploited a shambolic defensive error with 18 minutes to go to ensure there would be no doubt over the outcome.View image in fullscreenJaka Bijol heads Leeds into an early lead from a corner.Photograph: Chris Radburn/Reuters“It’s been a long time coming,” Farke said. “The players deserve to have a night like this because I can’t remember one poor home performance in the last 15 months.”Inspired by his tactical adjustment, Leeds were magnificent in the early exchanges. Bijol’s thunderous header from an Anton Stach corner broke the deadlock inside five minutes and a raft of chances came the hosts’ way thereafter, too. They finally took one of them as half‑time approached when Tanaka beat Robert Sánchez from long-range to double Leeds’s advantage.In response, Chelsea offered little. Whether they were jaded from theirexploits against Arsenalthree days earlier is unclear, but this was a performance way below the levels they have delivered this season, with not a single shot on target in the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those changes had a swift impact, as Neto turned home a Jamie Gittens cross to halve the deficit. But any Chelsea momentum was short-lived, and to Leeds’s credit they weathered what was ultimately a brief storm to get back on top of proceedings.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Cole Palmer (centre) up against Ilia Gruev (left) and Anton Stach. Palmer missed a chance to equalise on his first appearance since September.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PALukas Nmecha thought he had restored their two-goal advantage before his fine finish was ruled out for offside but it mattered little. Chelsea struggled to mount a meaningful threat for an equaliser and when Tosin Adarabioyo fumbled inside his own area, the ensuing scramble led to the excellent Calvert‑Lewin tapping into an empty net to spark jubilant scenes among the home support.By full time, all seemed well in this part of West Yorkshire as Farke celebrated with the home support. He may need more than this in the long term, but it was some start in terms of a showing to prove he is still the right man for this job.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We need to build throughout time and make sure we’re tracking in the right direction.”England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, said excitement around the draw was “wonderful” and echoed Itoje on the objective for 2027, 24 years afterEngland dramatically defeated the Wallabiesin Sydney to become world champions for the first and only time.“We’ve been very clear in saying our aim is to win the World Cup and a number of other nations will be saying the same,” Borthwick said. “We are working towards it.“The team is progressing, it’s transitioned a lot since the last World Cup over the last 18 months … I want to make sure that our supporters in Australia in two years’ time have loads to cheer about.”Quick GuideRugby World Cup 2027 drawShowPool ANew Zealand, Australia, Chile, Hong KongPool BSouth Africa, Italy, Georgia, RomaniaPool CArgentina, Fiji, Spain, CanadaPool DIreland, Scotland, Uruguay, PortugalPool EFrance, Japan, USA, SamoaPool FEngland, Wales, Tonga, ZimbabweWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked for his memories of theWales victory against the hosts Englandat the 2015 tournament, Borthwick said: “As ever with every England v Wales game, it was very hard-fought and I am sure the game in Australia will be exactly the same: full of passion and full of spirit.”Itoje said he will relish the expectation that seems bound to grow as a buoyant England build towards the tournament. “The converse would not be ideal, if this England team had no expectation or you played for a team that had no hopes,” he said. “That’s a situation I don’t want to be in. If we want to go out and do what we want to do, we have to walk that line and welcome whatever comes. If that’s part of it we have to welcome that.”A Wales repeat of 2015 seems a remote prospect – they have slipped to 11th in the world and were humbled in a record73-0 home defeat by South Africalast Saturday – and pool-stage jeopardy is lessened with four third-placed teams qualifying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The perception and impression that you get is that Fifa is dragging itself into becoming part of a public relations tool to normalise an increasingly authoritarian US government. That is a real concern and we’re very troubled about that.”Daniel Norona, the Americas advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, said there was a “high possibility” of immigration raids being conducted during World Cup fixtures. “Attending a soccer match should never result in arbitrary detention or deportation,” Norona said.“The threat of excessive policing, including immigration enforcement, at World Cup venues are deeply troubling, and Fifa cannot be silent. Fifa must obtain binding guarantees from US authorities that the tournament will be a safe space for all, regardless of political stance, opinion or immigration status.”Ninety US civic organisations wrote a letter to Fifa in June urging the organisation to use its leverage as World Cup organisers to push the Trump administration into guaranteeing the safety of local people and visitors.“We call on Fifa to use its influence to encourage the US government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans who seek entry to the United States to attend the tournaments, and the constitutional rights of the many immigrants who already live, work, and contribute meaningfully to the cities selected to host them,” the letter read. Jennifer Li of Dignity 2026, one of the letter’s signatories, said no reply had been received to the correspondence.Under the general provisions of its statutes, Fifa insists it is “committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights”, and has been approached for further comment. As has the US State Department. Last week a department spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are doing everything we can to support a successful World Cup. At the same time, the Trump Administration will not waver in upholding American law and the highest standards of national security.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupFifaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has signed a two-and-a-half year contract.Martin O’Neill signed off his spell as interim manager with a 1-0 home win againstDundeeon Wednesday night. The result moved Celtic level on points withHearts, who remain top of theScottish Premiershipon goal difference despite being held to a 1-1 draw at home againstKilmarnock. Celtic also have a game in hand on their title rivals.European football: Real Madrid’s Frenchmen run riot at Athletic BilbaoRead moreDuring his tenure O’Neill also saw off Rangers in a League Cup semi-final to set up a final at Hampden Park against St Mirren on 14 December.The final gives Nancy an early chance to secure a trophy. He won the MLS Cup with Columbus Crew in 2023 and the Leagues Cup in 2024, when he was named MLS coach of the year. He also took the Crew to theConcacaf Champions Cup finallast year.Nancy said in a club statement: “I am so happy to be namedCelticmanager, it is a massive honour for myself and my family. Before I say anything else I want to do one thing – I want to thank the great Martin O’Neill and Shaun Maloney for all they have done in recent weeks with the team. The job they have done has been fantastic.“These guys have given so much to the club across so many years and I know our fans, likeme, all recognise the brilliant job they have done during this recent period. They have my total respect and my total gratitude.“I hope to meet them both very soon and thank them personally.

Dense breast tissue is a risk factor for breast cancer, and can also make mammograms more difficult to read.Those undergoing breast screening in Australia are already told of their breast density, and the measure is being considered in the UK by the National Screening Committee (NSC).Thestudy, conducted by researchers at the University of Sydney and published in the BMJ, looked at data from 2,401 women who had been screened for breast cancer in Australia between September 2023 and July 2024 who were classified as having dense breasts.Researchers then randomised the women into either the control group, who were not told of their breast density, a group who were notified of their breast density and were given written information about its implications, and a final group who were told of their breast density and given a link to an online video with information.After eight weeks, women were surveyed about their psychological response to their results and whether they had intentions to speak to their GP or pursue additional screening.Women who were told of their breast density were more likely to feel anxious and confused about what to do after these results than the control group, according to the analysis.Both groups who were notified of their breast density also had significantly higher intentions to talk to their GP about their screening results, at 22.8% and 19.4%, compared with 12.9% for the control group.The NHS breast screening programme inEnglanddoes not currently include the assessment or recording of breast density on screening mammograms.Sophie Brooks, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said that having dense breasts couldmake it harder to detect canceron a mammogram, but it was not something people could check for themselves or change.She added: “This study suggests that telling women about their breast density has mixed results. Women who were told were more likely to seek advice from their GP, but they were also more likely to feel anxious and confused, highlighting the need for clear information and support. More research is needed to investigate whether informing women about their breast density could have a positive impact or not, and the UK National Screening Committee are currently looking into this.”Overall, the study concluded that women “notified of their dense breasts felt anxious and confused, did not feel more informed to make decisions about their breast health, and wanted to be guided by their general practitioners”.Melanie Sturtevant, associate director of policy, evidence and influencing at BreastCancerNow, said: “Knowing personal risk of breast cancer could allow people to make informed decisions about their own breast health. But studies like this one are really important to understand the impact of informing people about personal risk factors like breast density, including on a person’s mental health. The findings underline that learning they were higher risk left many women feeling more anxious and confused, and more likely to ask their GP for further information.“Currently in the UK, routine screening does not involve recording information about breast density, and a review into whether additional screening should be offered to women with dense breasts is ongoing. While we appreciate the need for a strong, evidence-driven process, we want to see the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) conduct this with more urgency and transparency.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerWomen's healthHealthWomenCancerEnglandNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

Badenoch has ruled out the idea of joining forces with Farage.Another donor confirmed to the Guardian that Farage had discussed what a deal with theConservativescould look like and the Reform leader did not think this was feasible with Badenoch.“I believe it will happen and it should happen,” the donor said, adding that even Conservatives who were potentially sympathetic to the idea of a deal believed it was too early to act now given the fluidity of Reform’s position and structures.The donor said the only chance the Conservatives had of winning alone would be to move decisively to the centre, most likely under a different leader, and that Badenoch would lose if she tried to take on Farage from the right.Several other Reform donors said they backed Farage’s strategy of aiming to become the dominant party at the next election, with any decisions on pacts not possible until after a contest has been fought.With Reform leading in the polls, some senior Tory rightwingers believe the party will need to do a deal with Reform to survive, but it is as yet unclear what any pact would look like.Options range from a pre-election non-aggression pact under which the two parties would avoid standing against each other in certain constituencies, to a post-election confidence and supply arrangement, and even to a full-blown coalition in order to govern.Tory sources suggested that any discussions about a pact would have to remain private – or take place after the election. One shadow cabinet minister said: “Reform wouldn’t want to talk about it before the election because so many people still don’t like Tories.”Jenrick is understood to be among those who believe a deal is inevitable. In April a leaked recording captured him vowing to “unite the right” before the next election.One ally said: “Rob and Nigel agree on most things but on some Rob issues is to the right of him. Nigel is proceeding cautiously because he wants to be seen as more moderate.”On Wednesday, Jenrick rejected the idea of defecting to Reform, saying: “It wasn’t very long ago that I was running to be leader of the Conservative party, so I’m not going anywhere.”Tory strategists say about a quarter of their voter base would be willing to back Labour to keep Farage out of No 10, while three-quarters would vote for Reform, a quarter enthusiastically.Explore more on these topicsReform UKConservativesNigel FarageKemi BadenochRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

Perry died at 54 after struggling with addiction for years, dating back to his time as one of the biggest stars of his generation for his role as Chandler Bing.The actor had been taking the surgical anesthetic ketamine legally as a treatment for depression. But when his regular doctor would not provide it in the amounts he wanted, he turned to Plasencia, who admitted to illegally selling to Perry and knowing he was a struggling addict.He texted another doctor that Perry was a “moron” who could be exploited for money, according to court filings.Perry was found dead in hisLos Angeleshome by his assistant, and a medical examiner ruled that ketamine was the primary cause of death.The judge emphasized that Plasencia did not provide the ketamine that killed Perry, but told him: “You and others helped Mr Perry on the road to such an ending by continuing to feed his ketamine addiction.”“You exploited Mr Perry’s addiction for your own profit,” she said.View image in fullscreenDr Salvador Plasencia arrives for his sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday.Photograph: Ted Soqui/EPAPlasencia was led from the courtroom in handcuffs as his mother cried loudly in the audience.Plasencia’s lawyers had tried to give a sympathetic portrait of him as a man who rose out of poverty to become a doctor beloved by his patients, some of whom provided testimonials about him for the court. The attorneys called his selling to Perry “reckless” and “the biggest mistake of his life”.Perry’s mother and two half sisters were in attendance at the hearing and gave tearful victim impact statements before the sentencing.“The world mourns my brother,” Madeleine Morrison said. “He was everyone’s favorite friend.”“You called him a ‘moron’”, Suzanne Perry said to Plasencia. “There is nothing moronic about that man. He was even a successful drug addict.”Plasencia also spoke before the sentencing, breaking into tears as he imagined the day he would have to tell his now two-year-old son “about the time I didn’t protect another mother’s son. It hurts me so much.”He apologized directly to Perry’s family. “I should have protected him,” he said.In July, Plasencia pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine. Plasencia was the first to be sentenced of the five defendants who have pleaded guilty in connection with Perry’s death.In August, Jasveen Sangha, a woman known as the “Ketamine Queen”, agreed to plead guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death. She is set to be sentenced later this month, where she could face up to 65 years in prison.The other three defendants will be sentenced at their own hearings in the coming months.Perry spoke candidly about his addiction struggles over the years, writing in his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, that his alcoholism began as a teenager, and that he became addicted to painkillers after a jet-skiing accident in 1997. Following his death, Perry’s family establishedthe Matthew Perry Foundation,whichaims to create“a future free of addiction stigmas, where everyone has the resources and opportunities to thrive in their recovery journey”.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryLos AngelesUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it will only be supported to run just over a quarter of the time, down sharply from almost two-thirds of the time currently.When the deal wasagreed in February, the energy minister, Michael Shanks, said the company’s subsidies had been cut because it “simply did not deliver a good enough deal for billpayers and enabled Drax to make unacceptably large profits”.Drax has also faced abacklash from green groupsamid criticism of the company’s claims that it sources wood only from “well‐managed, sustainable forests” to manufacture the pellets burned at its power plant.The power plant’s support payments were originally due to end in 2026 but it is now in line to earn £458.6m a year between 2027 and 2031 after the governmentagreed to extend its subsidies beyond 2026, according to analysts at Ember.Frankie Mayo, an analyst at the climate thinktank, said: “Britain remains too reliant on polluting fuels, including biomass. While this will wind down as wind and solar grow, we’re not fully there yet: the use of imported fuels for power jumped in July 2025, though fell in subsequent months.“Halving public subsidies for biomass power at Drax from 2027 will mean reduced reliance on this expensive and polluting fuel, but clean power development can help Britain cut imports faster.”The government was approached for comment.The Guardian revealed last month thatDrax continued to burn 250-year-old treessourced from some of Canada’s oldest forests as recently as this summer, according to a new report from forestry experts at Stand.earth, a Canadian environmental non-profit.The report’s findings suggest that the Drax power plant was burning “irreplaceable” trees even as its owners lobbied the UK government for the additional green energy subsidies. Drax said the pellets were typically made of “low-grade” wood rejected by commercial sawmills and either sold to the biomass industry as waste wood or burned to prevent wildfires.Responding to the Stand.earth report, a Drax spokesperson for Drax said: “Our sourcing policy means Drax does not source biomass from designated areas of old growth and only sources woody biomass fromwell-managed, sustainable forests.”These designated areas of old growth amount to less than half of the total old-growth forest areas in British Columbia.Dr Iain Staffell, a professor at Imperial College London, and the lead author of the report, said: “Power demand is rising at its fastest rate for 10 years as we swap petrol and diesel cars for electric vehicles and new data centres power more of our lives online. Bridging the gaps in supply when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining is the ultimate test for our electricity system.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryBiomass and bioenergyDraxnewsShareReuse this content"

Burning gasoline is a significant contributor to global heating and transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.“We are officially terminatingJoe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, Cafe standards that imposed expensive restrictions,” Trump said in an Oval Office announcement, flanked by top auto executives including the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis. “It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate.”Trump’s EPA moves to abandon tough standards for deadly soot pollutionRead moreThe Corporate Average Fuel Economy (Cafe) standards, first established in 1975, set the average fuel economy targets for new vehicles and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more fuel-efficient.TheBiden administrationproposed modest increases to the requirements for the vehicles most Americans drive as part of a push to promote electric vehicles and address the climate emergency. Joe Biden required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031.Trump is now rolling that back, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The standards proposed by him would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Wednesday’s announcement marks the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner energy vehicles, includingrelaxing auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealing fines for automakersthat don’t meet federal mileage standardsandterminating consumer creditsof up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.Trump, who calls the climate crisis a “hoax” and whose administration is in the grips of a cost of living crisis, said he was seeking to weaken the rules in order to make new cars more affordable. “These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [former transportation secretary Pete] Buttigieg want them to build,” said his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, who was also in the Oval Office. “This is important for American jobs. The more cars we sell, the more jobs we have in this country.”’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, miraculously, an oil pipeline that crossed directly over the fault line was unscathed.Engineers behind the design of the 800-mile system were prepared. Knowing the high likelihood of seismic activity along the route, which bisected theDenali fault, they constructed sections wherethe pipeline rested on rail girders, allowing it to sway and shear without snapping.“It worked because they could pinpoint how and where to build: they could put their hand right on the fault,” said Edwin Nissen, a seismologist at the University of Victoria. “The problem forCanadais that there’s nothing like that in British Columbia, where a pipeline has been proposed. There’s never been a study as detailed as they one they did for the pipeline in Alaska and as a result, there’s just so much we don’t know.”View image in fullscreenThe Trans Alaska pipeline constructed with extra-long support beams shows where it crosses over the Denali fault.Photograph: RGB Ventures/SuperStock/AlamyCanada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has given his government’s blessing to an oil pipeline last week that would cross Alberta and British Columbia and terminate at the Pacific. But amid fierce debate over the political, environmental and economic implications of the project, experts warn that the multibillion-dollar project faces immense – and poorly understood – geological hazards.While no route for a heavy oil pipeline has been officially proposed, nor has any company stepped forward to build it, the most efficient route from Edmonton, Alberta, would invariably pass through the Rocky Mountain trench and along the sparsely populated north of British Columbia before terminating at the Douglas Channel, a region with a crenulated landscape of deep fjords. The project has already faced strong opposition from First Nations over fears that Carney’s government will lift a five-decade oil tanker ban in the region.So far much of the public debate has focused on the immense risk of a maritime disaster, but Nissen warns the geography of the landscape itself presents fresh and troubling risks.Nissen and his research team argue that at least two seismic faults, including the Rocky Mountain trench which most Canadian geologists believe are “extinct” or long dormant, are instead still active and “can host big surface-rupturing earthquakes”. He also says the tectonics in mountainous areas along the Pacific coast are “very poorly understood”.“This part of the world, where we’re talking about a pipeline, is very poorly instrumented and as a result, we actually know very little about it,” he said. A large earthquake – or even smaller earthquakes triggering landslides – could unleash environmental disaster.View image in fullscreenA large crack on the Tok Cutoff highway, caused by an 7.9 magnitude earthquake on 3 November 2002 in Alaska.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe challenge for Canada is that the vast majority of its seismic monitoring instrumentation is heavily concentrated along the country’s southern border, where the bulk of the population lives.“In the places where the pipeline might get built, there’s basically no monitoring of earthquakes. There’s no monitoring of landslides. And we don’t have the instrumentation that would actually map out small earthquakes along these faults,” he said. “Science funding in Canada is pretty threadbare compared to America. We don’t have the resources to just go out and deploy seismic stations and GPS stations. It’s expensive business and we don’t have the funds.”David Eby, British Columbia’s premier, has emerged as a sharp critic of the project, expressing frustration over being excluded from discussions between Ottawa and Alberta even though the route would cross through his province.“The oil sands in Alberta will get most of the profit from this pipeline, but all of the risk is being placed on British Columbia and particularly the First Nations along the west coast,” said Nissen. “In a way, it feels like the global financial crisis of 2008: the profit was private, the bailouts were for the big bank and the risk was basically subsidized by all taxpayers.”View image in fullscreenA full moon helps illuminate the Alaskan pipeline under the faint glow of the Aurora Borealis on 19 November 2002 near Milne Point, Alaska.Photograph: Getty ImagesWhile risks of building in seismically active areas can be minimized through engineering, that process is “phenomenally expensive” if the “basic science” has not yet been completed.“What’s going on in these regions? Where are the faults? What is the risk of an earthquake on each of them? These are questions we should ideally be asking – and have answered before the conversation even begins about a pipeline,” he said. “Black swan events are by their nature unlikely, but they’re something we should factor in. Because when these massive landslides and massive earthquakes and tsunamis happen, they often take professionals like myself by surprise.”In 1958, an earthquake in a remote Alaskan bay triggered a landslide which in turncreated a mega-tsunami, with a wave reaching a height of roughly 553 meters– nearly double the height of The Shard in London.A wave of such “phenomenally terrifying elevation” was only possible because of the physical geography of the fjord, where, unlike in the ocean, the energy could not easily dissipate, said Dan Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary.The challenge for a pipeline stretching across British Columbia is that the landscape around a possible terminus is eerily similar to that of much of Alaska’s south-eastern coastline, where the Lituya Bay mega-tsunami occurred.The most likely location for a terminal where large oil tankers could load up with crude oil for transport to Asia is in the Douglas Channel, an increasingly busy shipping route through the fjord.Canada minister resigns from cabinet over Carney’s controversial oil pipeline dealRead moreCanada’s geological survey has recently carried out “superb” high-resolution sonar mapping, uncovering roughly 100 past landslides in the Douglas channel, said Shugar. While some were small, a handful were “truly gigantic” and would prove “catastrophic, not only to a tanker, but potentially to any towns or other infrastructure in the fjord”, he said.While these events are scattered over tens of thousands of years, with enough data and time, scientists could calculate a recurrence interval, which gives a rough sense of how often these landslide might occur.“When we’re designing or making decisions about facilities that have a lifespan of decades we need to be considering the geophysical risks that might exist – even if those risks are relatively small,” he said. He points to Greenland’s government,which recently announced it would “discourage” all marine trafficin a fjord over risks of landslide-created tsunamis.“We tend not to have a very long view of history. Our politicians tend to think in four-year time frames. But nature doesn’t care about that. Geology certainly doesn’t care about that. And the disasters of the past teach us that ecosystems can take many decades to recover from what might only unfold in a few minutes.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaOilFossil fuelsEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

About 700 parents of children attending during the time Chan worked at the nursery in London, from 2017 to his arrest by 2024, have been contacted by police.His repeated offending while entrusted with vulnerable children was discovered by chance.He pleaded guilty on Wednesday to 26 offences from 2022 to 2024, including attacks on four young girls aged two to four, whom he sexually assaulted on nursery premises, and offences relating to more than 25,000 indecent images of children.View image in fullscreenVincent Chan filmed some of his sexual attacks on the girls, between two and four, with the nursery’s iPads.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAChan, of Finchley, north London, was employed at a now closed north London nursery run by Bright Horizons, one of Britain’s biggest providers of early-years care.A review will establish whether safeguarding procedures were followed. Some parents are considering legal action against the nursery and told the Guardian complaints they had made to the nursery about Chan’s behaviour before his offending came to light had been ignored. Bright Horizons declined comment on that aspect but pledged cooperation with the review.Chan’s attacks happened in broad daylight when the nursery was full of children and staff.About 20 parents of children at the now closed nursery were at Wood Green crown court as Chan pleaded guilty to all 26 charges. Some stared at him as he stood in the dock, speaking only to confirm his address and utter “guilty”, sometimes barely audibly, to every count.Cmdr Hayley Sewart said: “His responsibilities included feeding, clothing, cleaning and interacting with the children, tasks that required a high degree of trust and safeguarding.”In a statement, some of the families described Chan’s unmasking as an attacker of children as a “sickening discovery” and his abuse as “despicable” against “innocent victims who could not fight back”.But their statement also made clear the families’ anger at the nursery: “We feel that Bright Horizons has failed us, and we want answers. How was someone like Vincent Chan employed? Why did safeguarding systems fail completely? And how were such horrific crimes against children able to continue for so long without the staff responsible for safeguarding at Bright Horizons nursery acting?“We are concerned that failures in management and supervision at Bright Horizons allowed this abuse to go undetected, and we are committed to securing accountability for our children.”View image in fullscreenAlison Millar from Leigh Day, the solicitor for the families, said outside Wood Green crown court that there were ‘many questions that need to be answered’.Photograph: Lucy North/PAAlison Millar, a solicitor and partner at Leigh Day, said: “The families we are in contact with feel very strongly that there were major failings of safeguarding at Bright Horizons Finchley Road nursery. We look forward to the findings of the local child safeguarding practice review but there are many questions that need to be answered.”The court heard that two children Chan had admitted offences against were yet to be identified. The material he filmed himself, which was found on his devices, was crucial to his admissions of guilt.The Metropolitan police are working through pictures and video found on more than 60 digital devices seized when Chan was arrested to rule out fears he could have committed dozens more offences.The offences to which Chan, who was an early-years practitioner and nursery nurse, pleaded guilty include five sexual assaults by penetration of a child between two and four years, four sexual assaults, 11 counts of taking indecent photos, and six of making indecent images of children.He had passed enhanced vetting to get the job in 2017, had worked in a school previously and had no criminal record.Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the investigation, said: “Chan’s offending spanned years, revealing a calculated and predatory pattern of abuse. He infiltrated environments that should have been safe havens for children, exploiting the trust of families and the wider community to conceal his actions and prey on the most vulnerable.“Our investigation remains ongoing, and we are continuing to review digital devices and assess Chan’s conduct across all relevant settings.”It was by chance that the danger Chan posed was discovered. In 2024 he was reported over a safeguarding concern when it emerged he had made videos mocking the children in his care. He was arrested in June 2024, and suspended from his job.In September 2024 his electronic devices – phones, laptops and memory sticks, as well as 15 iPads from the nursery, 69 devices in total – were sent for digital examination. It was not until September 2025 that evidence on the devices of his sexual abuse of children was found. He was charged on 9 September 2025.Basford said: “We recognise the member of staff who raised their concerns, as without that first report of child cruelty Chan’s abuse could have continued unchecked, putting countless more children at risk. These appalling offences have caused deep shock and distress.”The Met said 700 parents of children who passed through the nursery from 2017 to 2024 had been contacted.Basford said for parents: “Uncertainty will remain as to whether their child may have been harmed.”Bright Horizons, which says it runs about 300 nurseries and preschools in the UK, said: “We are shocked and appalled by this individual’s horrific crimes.“This individual’s actions represent not only a violation of the victims, but also a profound betrayal of the trust placed in him by families and colleagues.“We have extensive safeguarding practices in place, designed to create safe environments for children to learn and grow. While this individual’s actions came to light after a colleague raised concerns and followed our whistleblowing procedures to report him, we fully accept that the evidence shows the individual was able to commit these crimes despite our safeguarding measures.“In light of this, we have commissioned an external expert in this field to undertake a full review of our safeguarding practices.”Sentencing will be on 23 January and the judge told Chan he faced a long time in prison. He was remanded in custody pending sentencing.A dedicated NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 0828 had been set up for all families whose children attended the nursery.Explore more on these topicsLondonChild protectionCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Reform UK is not expected to have any, despite a request from Nigel Farage. Farage wrote to the prime minister in August saying he wanted to appoint peers “at the earliest possible opportunity” but a Reform source said he had received no response.Katie Martin, who was Reeves’s chief of staff for almost five years, is expected to be made Labour peer despite a chaotic run-up to the budget, two sources with knowledge of the list said.Described by Reeves as her “most trusted adviser”, she has alreadytaken on a new rolein the Treasury focused on strengthening the government’s frayed ties with business, but could also made a minister in the Lords.A former Downing Street director of communications, Matthew Doyle, is also understood to have been offered a peerage, with one source saying he was a “dead cert”. It is unclear whether he has accepted it. Neither Doyle nor Martin responded to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenMatthew Doyle, former Downing Street director of communications.Photograph: Imageplotter/AlamyOutgoing union leaders are also likely to be on the list, including the former Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis, who called for“a degree of silence”from other union bosses who had criticised Keir Starmer.The veteran Labour aide Carol Linforth, who ran the party’s annual conference and removed Keir Starmer’s jacket afterhe was glitter-bombedduring his speech two years ago, has also been tipped.The appointments aim to continue Labour’s efforts to rebalance the Lords in its favour and prevent the opposition from slowing down the passing of legislation – as it has done on renters’ rights and abolishing hereditary peers.Most recently Labour figures have criticised Conservative, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peersfor their opposition to the employment rights bill. Last week, ministers abandoned a plan to offer workers protection against unfair dismissal from their first day in the job, in an attempt to get the legislation through before Christmas.Meanwhile, proponents of the assisted dying bill have accused seven members of the Lords of trying to scupper itby tabling nearly 1,000 amendments in the upper chamber. The bill’s sponsors fear it will get filibustered if peers push many amendments to a vote.The Tories currently have 283 peers, compared with Labour’s 210. Even once the Conservatives’ 44 hereditary peers are gone, they would still have about 30 more members of the Lords than the government, sources said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These cases were compounded by the absence of any mechanism within either the UK or Kenyan justice systems to hold Batuk soldiers accountable for child support or other consequences of such misconduct.”The inquiry also “noted with deep concern” the killing of Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was found in a septic tank in the grounds of a hotel where she had been drinking with British soldiers in 2012.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua Wanjiku holding a picture of her sister Agnes Wanjiru, 20, whose body was found two months after she disappeared.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APThe report said: “It was submitted that the process of investigation has faced undue interference and obstruction, allegedly by Batuk personnel, which continues to hinder the delivery of justice.”A former British soldier has been arrested in relation to Wanjiru’s death and extradition proceedings have started. He denies the charge and has said he intends to contest the extradition.Among other allegations detailed in the 94-page document are that a man named Tilam Leresh was shot and killed by a Batuk officer while herding livestock, that local people had been injured by unexploded ordnance and a former G4S supervisor at Batuk alleged that military aircraft had deliberately frightened livestock, causing distress to farmers.“The committee received extensive evidence of environmental degradation caused by Batuk’s activities,” the report said.“Many witnesses expressed concern that Batuk’s military exercises have caused serious ecological damage in the training areas of Laikipia and Samburu, with corresponding harm to public health, livelihoods and conservation efforts.”The region is home to wildlife including elephants, big cats and rare species such as the Grévy’s zebra. “Loud explosions, heavy troop movements and occasional training-related bushfires have disrupted wildlife habitats and migration corridors, often driving animals into nearby farms and settlements,” the report said.The report also detailed an incident in 2021, when “during a military exercise at the conservancy, Batuk personnel were reported to have caused a fire that engulfed over 10,000 acres of land”.“The inferno led to substantial destruction of local flora and fauna, forced wildlife to flee the area and displaced residents of the surrounding Lolldaiga region, who were exposed to noxious fumes and intense heat carried by strong winds over the Lolldaiga Hills,” the report said.The inquiry made a number of recommendations, including the development of a visiting forces code of conduct to include zero tolerance of sexual violence, as well as setting out environmental obligations and social responsibility.It also recommended:The establishment of a survivor liaison unit to offer legal aid to victims of crimes linked to Batuk personnel.For the British and Kenyan governments to negotiate “mechanisms to hold Batuk soldiers accountable for child support”.The creation of a military-linked crimes taskforce to oversee investigation and prosecution of offences committed by foreign military personnel.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said on Wednesday: “We were grateful for the opportunity to submit evidence to Kenya’s National Assembly defence, intelligence and foreign relations committee’s inquiry into conduct at the British Army Training Unit Kenya and note the publishing of the inquiry report today.“We deeply regret the challenges which have arisen in relation to our defence presence in Kenya.“Our statement – offered in the spirit of cooperation to the committee – responded to the issues highlighted during the inquiry into Batuk and outlined the actions taken to address the concerns raised.“Where new allegations have come to light in the committee’s report, we stand ready to investigate those under our jurisdiction fully once evidence is provided.”Explore more on these topicsBritish armyKenyaMilitaryAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, the broadcaster is now facing criticism over a plan to cover some games at next summer’s World Cup remotely to keep down costs.The 2026 tournament will be the biggest ever, hosted across three countries, different timezones and including an expanded 48-team lineup. To keep a handle on costs, theBBCis considering asking TV commentators and pundits to cover some lower-demand games from its base in Salford, Greater Manchester.The unprecedented plans mark the latest BBC attempt to adapt to the falling value of licence fee income, whichhas declined by about a third since 2010. The costs associated with having commentary teams in a stadium, even without accommodation and flight expenses, are understood to be significant.However, it is expected that the broadcaster will have commentators and pundits in the US throughout the tournament for major games, including all of those played by the home nations.Insiders have denied claims that its commentators will not broadcast from the US until the quarter-final stages.View image in fullscreenClive Tyldesley, ITV’s former lead commentator, said all his counterparts prefer to cover games in person.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe tournament will take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, with some games kicking off as late as 2am BST. The expanded format means it features some smaller teams, such asUzbekistan, Curaçao and Haiti.BBC planners are worried about spending limited resources on less popular fixtures in the early hours of the morning.It has also proven difficult for the BBC to plan a central US hub for its coverage. While New York will host the final and a lot of key matches, fixtures will be played out across a huge area.Given the timings and costs, some at the BBC cannot understand how other broadcasters will manage to staff all games they are covering from the stadiums.Clive Tyldesley, ITV’s former lead commentator, said commentating remotely was now not unusual, but that all his counterparts preferred to be watching in person.“There is not a commentator in captivity that would not prefer to be in the stadium,” he said. “The whole experience is more vivid and actually, the technique of commentating on a football match in the stadium is easier and more accurate than commentating off a screen.“We are there to convey information, but also to convey some of the excitement and mood and temperature and feel of the game. That is amplified at aWorld Cup.“A commentator will see only what the viewer sees, reporting remotely. You cannot choose what to focus on – you are in the hands of a director. However, from time to time, it is a good exercise for commentators because it focuses their attention on the viewers’ perspective.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In earlier tournaments, one commentator is said to have been flown to games they were not even commenting on, to help them gather more information and familiarity with the teams.With sports one of the key areas still driving audiences to live broadcasts, streamers and podcasters are also scrambling to nail down their World Cup coverage.It has emerged thatGary Lineker, formerly the BBC’s highest-paid star until he left the broadcaster earlier this year, has signed a deal with Netflix for the streaming company to host his podcast The Rest is Football during the tournament.Lineker had been scheduled to front the BBC’s World Cup coverage next summer, before he departed after his apology foramplifying online material with antisemitic connotations.The former England striker apologised for reposting a video criticising Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically an antisemitic insult used in Nazi Germany to characterise Jews. He said at the time that he had not seen the image and would “never consciously repost anything antisemitic”.HisNetflixdeal is a sign of increasing interest from streamers in sporting events and rights. Lineker’s filmed podcast will be based in New York and produced daily throughout the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupBBCGary LinekerNetflixShareReuse this content"

The results revealed mice with microbes from dog-owning teenagers showed more sniffing of unfamiliar mice and approaches towards trapped cage-mates.“This [latter] behaviour is called “preconcern” or “empathetic concern”, which is a kind of empathetic response in human and animals,” said Kikusui.The team added that the abundance of certain bacteria in the gut of the mice were associated with differences in their social behaviour, with some of these strains also associated with teenagers’ behaviour.“Although it is not possible to directly compare human and mouse behavior, these results suggest that the microbiota is partly responsible for the improvement in adolescents’ social behavior after living with dogs,” the team write.However the team did not analyse the microbes carried by participants’ dogs, with Kikusui noting “it remains unclear whether these differences [in microbes among dog owners] stemmed from the dogs themselves or whether owning dogs reduced stress, leading to the resulting changes in microbiota,” he said.Prof Stefan Reber of Ulm University, who was not involved in the work, agreed. “It has only been shown that teens with dogs have a different salivary microbiome than teens without dogs,” he said.In addition, how the microbes might be influencing behaviour has yet to be determined.Kikusui added that the study did not mean everyone needed a canine companion. “Even without owning a dog, maintaining a diverse microbiome can potentially improve mental health scores,” he said.Indeed for some, owning a dog might be a negative experience. “It is known that dogs with many behavioural issues can impose stress on their owners,” Kikusui said.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthDogsYoung peopleChildrenPetsAnimalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

A senior staff member of the college and a senior official from the European Commission were also indicted, the EPPO said, after all three were questioned by Belgian police.The investigation, which led topolice raids on the headquarters of the EU foreign service in Brusselsand the elite College of Europe postgraduate school, as well as Mogherini’s home, has deeply shocked EU insiders. Prosecutors suspect fraud in the tender for a contract to run a training academy for young diplomats, which was awarded to the College of Europe by the EU foreign service.The EPPO, the EU agency in charge of prosecuting fraud involving European funds, said the accusations concerned “procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy”. It added: “All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the competent Belgian courts of law.”All three have been released “as they are not considered a flight risk”, the EPPO said.On Wednesday, Mogherini issued a statement via the College of Europe. “In its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness,” she said. “I have full confidence in the justice system and I trust that the correctness of the College’s actions will be ascertained.”The College of Europe has said it would cooperate fully with the authorities “in the interest of transparency and respect for the investigative process”.In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the EU’s current foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the allegations were “deeply shocking but should in no way tarnish the good work that the vast majority of you are doing every day”.Kallas, who is one year into a five year mandate, said integrity and accountability “will only improve under my watch” and that the current process showed “safeguards are in place and working”.One of the accused is understood to be Stefano Sannino, a senior commission official, who was secretary general of the European External Action Service from 2021 to 2024. A request for comment sent to him was referred to the commission, which declined beyond saying it was co-operating with an investigation into activities that took place before the term of the current EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.Mogherini was the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs from 2014 to 2019, after a brief stint as Italy’s foreign minister. She went on to become rector of the College of Europe, a training ground for European officials and politicians. Her appointment in 2020 proved controversial, with some alumni arguing she lacked academic credentials and experience of running a major academic institution.The College of Europe, which receives EU funding, was awarded the tender in 2020-21 to run theEuropean UnionDiplomatic Academy, a nine-month training programme for young diplomats. Prosecutors have said they have strong suspicions that confidential information had been shared with one of the candidates taking part in the process.The diplomatic academy was launched as a pilot project in 2022 with a budget of nearly €1m (£880,000) and the aim of “building a European diplomatic corps that shares a truly common diplomatic culture”, according to the commission website. Mogherini, who also serves as director of the academy, described it as “a great step forward” for European diplomacy.About 40 diplomats from EU member states and institutions took part in the first nine-month programme in 2022-23, with 50 joining in the second year. In the second programme, diplomats spent four months in Bruges and a month at the EEAS headquarters in Brussels, as part of the programme where they were trained in EU policies, as well as diplomatic skills such as negotiation, communication and protocol.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an easy source of food. All they have to do is endure our presence, not be aggressive, and then they can feast on anything we throw away.”In Toronto, Canada, raccoons have become so numerous that a popular T-shirt boasting “Toronto v Everybody” has now been widely supplanted by one that now reads “Raccoons v Toronto”.Alcohol consumption is abundant in the natural world, according to a recent study. It occurs in nearly every ecosystem, with most animals that eat sugary fruits and nectar likely to be regularly drinking it.A rampage by aferal pig that stole three six-packsof beers in the DeGrey River rest area in Western Australia prompted warnings for campers to secure their food and alcohol. One camper said the pig drank all 18 beers, then got involved in an altercation with a cow.In Turkey, anobviously intoxicated brown bear cubwas rescued from a forest by people after eating “mad honey”, ordeli balin Turkish – a substance produced in small quantities by beekeepers in the Kaçkar mountains above the Black Sea, where rhododendrons produce a potent neurotoxin and the honey that bees produce from it can induce a mildly hallucinogenic or euphoric state.Explore more on these topicsVirginiaAlcoholWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

A collapse into government control under a special administration regime (SAR) – aform of temporary nationalisation– “could occur in the very near term” if it is unable to agree the terms of a formal takeover by its controlling lenders.Those creditors have asked the regulator, Ofwat, and the government for Thames to belet off future fines for pollution, arguing the prospect of hundreds of millions of pounds of extra costs is making a turnaround impossible.The standoff has already continued for months longer than originally anticipated and the talks were expected to have concluded by the end of the year.On Wednesday, the company said: “Discussions are taking longer than expected but this is a complex situation and the current phase of the restructuring plan will likely take a number of months to conclude.”Revenues rose by 40% to nearly £2bn after the company was allowed toraise customers’ bills by 31% in April. Thames Water insisted it was making good operational progress, helped by a 22% increase in investment to £1.26bn, paid for by the bills increases.Thames Water has been on the brink of collapse for more than a year as it has struggled under the weight of £17.6bn of net debt,built up over decadessince privatisation.People living along polluted Thames file legal complaint to force water firm to actRead moreThe supplier, which serves 16 million customers in south-east England, has been dogged by poor environmental performance, with sewage leaks provoking public and political outrage andadding huge costsin the form of fines.The number of sewage spills into rivers and seas dropped by 20% during the period, to 292 as some of its investment took effect. The bills increase prompted a 75% increase in complaints to more than 55,000 during the period, although complaints linked to its water and wastewater services dropped by 11%.The utility came close to being taken into temporary government control earlier this year when it was forced to gaincourt approval for a £3bn emergency funding planthat also wrote down the value of some of its debts to zero. Since then it has been working on a second deal to restructure the rest of its debts and pass formal ownership to its lenders.Those bondholders are led by a group of hedge funds including the combative US firms Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital, as well as more traditional investors such as Aberdeen and Insight Investment. Within proposals to the government, bondholders have asked for 15 years of leniency from environmental fines from the government to try to recover.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet ministers are also desperate to avoid taking control under an SAR.Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said: “The first half of this year has been shaped by good progress across all areas of our operational transformation. We saw a 20% drop in pollutions and leakage performance is holding steady despite the extremely dry summer.“This progress has all been achieved as we also manage the recapitalisation of the business. We continue to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led solution that we believe is in the best interests of our customers and the environment.”The company lost £1.6bn before tax in the year to March because of a £1.3bn credit loss.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterCorporate governanceWater industryAnnual resultsUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Balaji, an Indian national, was previously the chief financial officer of Tata Motors, the Indian owner of JLR.Balaji was due to take over the reins of a business that was performing well, generating nearly three years of consecutive quarterly profits. However, any chance of a smooth transition was dashed by a crippling cyber-attack in August thatstopped all productionat JLR’s factories.JLR declined to comment on the departure and McGovern was still listed on the company’s website on Wednesday. Autocar India, which first reported on McGovern’s departure, said he had been removed with immediate effect.David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said the abrupt removal “has sent shock waves through the automotive world”. He said it would herald “much more than a routine management reshuffle” but rather “the symbolic end of an era” and was perhaps a sign that Tata was looking to exert more control.View image in fullscreenMcGovern at an event in LA in 2017.Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for JLRMcGovern returned to Land Rover in 2004 after an earlier stint and rose to be in charge of designing its key products, including its flagship Range Rover, its bestselling Range Rover Evoque and several other models.His stewardship includedhiring Victoria Beckhamas a creative design executive in 2010. In 2017, tensions emerged after Beckham said at the launch of a special VB Evoque: “I’ve designed a car that I want to drive, a car I think [her husband] David wants to drive.” McGovern latersaid: “She didn’t design the car … I’ve forgotten more than that woman will ever know about [car] designing – to be a car designer takes years.”McGovern was elevated to the role of JLR’s chief creative officer in 2021 by the then chief executive, Thierry Bolloré, giving him oversight of the struggling Jaguar brand as well. McGovern retained the role under Bolloré’s successor, Adrian Mardell.Bolloré had scrapped an advanced plan for an electric Jaguar that followed on from previous models, and McGovern was tasked with completely overhauling the brand in an effort to end years of weak sales.The product he came up with was amajor departurefrom previous, fairly traditional Jaguars. The Type 00 targeted wealthy, younger, international buyers rather than going head to head with BMW as another executive saloon car. It featured a large, angular design with no rear window, and the initial concept design was shown in pink and electric blue.The company faced a ferocious and at timeshate-filled backlashfrom some quarters after a teaser campaign featured several androgynous models. Elon Musk and Trump criticised whatTrump calleda “stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement”. McGovern, seen as assertive and sometimes combative by people with whom he has worked, said the car displayed “fearless creativity”.McGovern’s departure raises questions about how much of the concept car will survive into production, although prototype models were at a fairly advanced stage before the hack disrupted production plans. A person who has driven the car said it would wow drivers.The new electric Range Rover overseen by McGovern will also be a crucial car in JLR’s transition away from petrol and diesel. The design is nearly identical to the petrol version, but sales are expected to be delayed because of the cyber-attack. JLR hadinitially plannedto make the first deliveries by the end of this year.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it had offered financial support to the traders to help them find new premises.View image in fullscreenThe new Albert Island site, in Royal Docks in Newham.Photograph: Vistry GroupView image in fullscreenAerial showing the location.Photograph: City of London CorporationNow the corporation has identified Albert Island, a brownfield site in Royal Docks owned by the Greater London Authority (GLA) earmarked for regeneration, for the move. Despite being next to London City airport’s runway, the 10 hectare (25 acre) site is little-known, even to Londoners.The corporation estimates the project would generate £750m in local expenditure and bring 2,200 jobs to Newham, one of the capital’s most deprived boroughs. Other development plans for the site include a new shipyard to service and repair Thames riverboats, as well as a marina.Greg Lawrence, chair of Smithfield market traders’ association, said the announcement was a “significant step forward”.Lawrence has worked at the meat market since 1966, when he was 16. He said: “This location offers traders the space and opportunity to grow our businesses while continuing to serve customers across London and the south-east.”.The corporation, which is exceptionally wealthy compared with typical UK local authorities,faced a backlashover its plans to permanently close the ancient food markets and build on the sites. In June, the corporation said it hadestablished a regeneration teamto help find a new location for the meat and fish markets.‘Dagenham is worried’: London borough in limbo after Smithfield and Billingsgate move axedRead moreWhile the corporation owns and runs Smithfield in central London and Billingsgate near Canary Wharf in east London, their long history means they were established by acts of parliament that fix them to the existing sites.They can only be closed when parliament passes the private bill, deposited by the corporation, which would repeal the legislation and allow the land to be used for other purposes.The Guardian had previously highlighted the worries of agroup of east London fishmongersfrom Ridley Road market in Hackney, east London, who shop daily at Billingsgate and objected to its closure, saying it would put them out of business. The intervention threatened to disrupt the passing of the corporation’s private bill through parliament.Alicia Weston, the founder of the food poverty charity Bags of Taste, who speaks on behalf of the fishmongers, welcomed the news of the Albert Island proposal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two buildings on the site are being redeveloped, and theLondon Museum is scheduled to open therein late 2026.Billingsgate, which has been located next to the Canary Wharf financial district since 1982, has been earmarked for housing.While the volumes of produce sold at the two markets have declined over the past century amid the rise of supermarkets, they still account for roughly 10% of the meat and fish consumed in London and the south-east, according to an independent report commissioned by the corporation.The traders have been told they can continue in their current locations until at least 2028, and the corporation said most had previously agreed to move to a new site.View image in fullscreenWork in progress for the new London Museum to be housed within the historic Smithfield market buildings in central London.Photograph: Museum of London/PAHowever, a new markets complex on Albert Island is still some way off.“There’s a lot more to do – and a developer to be agreed – but this is undeniable progress,” said the corporation’s policy chair, Chris Hayward.The corporation said it had signed an agreement with the GLA to work on the Albert Island proposals, although market operations at the site would need planning permission from Newham council.The new markets – which would be known as New Smithfield and New Billingsgate – would continue to operate their apprenticeship programmes, the corporation said, while a new food school would also be built on site.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryLondonMeatFishing industryRegenerationCity of LondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The role of HSBC chair hasbecome increasingly politicised, with Tucker navigating simmering tensions between the west and Beijing. While HSBC is headquartered in London, it makes more than half of its profits in Asia.Osborne, who was in the running to take Tucker’s post, would have brought political experience to a role that requires executives to walk a careful line between the interests of countries in the west and those in Asia.He served as chancellor from 2010 to 2016, before laterediting the Evening Standardand taking up a number of City roles including as part-time adviser to the US asset manager BlackRock, and a partner role at the investment bank Robey Warshaw. He is also an adviser to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Had he been successful, the HSBC job would have been Osborne’s highest-profile City role to date.The appointment of Nelson, who joined the HSBC board in 2023 and became interim chair in October, has raised questions over how long it will be before the bank has to restart its search for a permanent chair.The 76-year-old had “expressed a desire not to do it for the full six to nine years given the stage in his career”, said the HSBC chief executive, Georges Elhedery, in comments made at the Financial Times banking summit a day before the appointment was announced.Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the comments raised questions about the permanence of this appointment and would “reinforce investor concerns around leadership stability and longer-term succession planning at a critical juncture for the bank”.HSBC’s shares fell 1% on Wednesday after Nelson’s appointment.Gary Greenwood, a banking analyst at the investment firm Shore Capital, said: “The fact that the board has finally alighted on Mr Nelson suggests that it has not been possible to find a suitable external successor and, in our view, it is probably fair to say that Mr Nelson was not top of the list of permanent candidates, otherwise there would have been no need to appoint him as an interim successor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also served on the boards of BP and RBS Group, now known at NatWest.HSBC said its decision followed a “robust process that considered both internal and external candidates”.Nelson said: “I look forward to continuing to work with the board, Georges and the wider management team as we deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.”Explore more on these topicsHSBCBankingGeorge OsborneAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They also want to make sure the amped-up, usually drunk crowd stays hydrated. Without water, a mosher might feel sick, faint or pass out. “You don’t want anyone to get injured or hurt,” frontman Pele Uriel said.Most of the spaces Uriel plays or visits have water stations where customers can easily fill up. But some do not. The worst offenders sell bottles of water at astronomical prices, from $5 to $10. “There have been times when I asked for water, but they charged a lot, so I went to the store next door to buy some,” Uriel said.When things do happen, free water makes it not as bad for that personBrian HackelThese venues are not breaking any rules. The city of New York,hometo more than 25,000 bars, clubs and other nightlife venues, does not require them to supply free water to patrons. While a majority do – and most bartenders are trained to look out for signs of an inebriated customer – this most basic safety precaution is not accepted by all.Brian Hackel, an EMT who works at local festivals and events, often finds himself treating partygoers suffering from heatstroke brought on by high temperatures, close crowds and dehydration. “When things do happen, free water makes it not as bad for that person,” he said. “It absolutely makes a difference between someone getting an Uber and only having to go to urgent care, as opposed to needing an ambulance to a hospital where an IV drip can cost between $700 and 800.”View image in fullscreenPartygoers dance at Paragon in Brooklyn, New York, in the early morning hours of 7 December 2024.Photograph: Marissa Alper/The GuardianIn other locales, partygoers have better luck. In San Francisco, any venue with a dancefloor mustprovide“free, cool drinking water”. The same goes for businesses in Connecticut that serve alcohol. As of this year, Minnesotarequiresticketed events with more than 100 attenders to make free water available and allow guests to bring in their own factory-sealed water bottles. And after years of grumbling from tourists to the longtime party capital of the world, Ibiza, Spain, where somesaidplaces charged €10 for a water bottle, clubs must offer free water on demand.The most Hackel has seen water go for in New York is $12. In November he started apetitiondemanding the city put regulations in place requiring alcohol-serving venues and large gatherings to provide free water stations. More than 500 people have signed on, and Hackel wants to work with harm reduction non-profits, which campaign to minimize the risk that comes with drug use, to spread the word further and hopefully catch the attention of elected officials.Clubbing has changed dramatically in the past 25 years: is the party over, or just getting started?Read moreA long battle was fought in the UK to ensure all establishments selling liquor must provide free, cold tap water to customers. It started in Manchester during the city’s storied rave era, said Fiona Measham, chair of the criminology department at the University of Liverpool and founder of the harm reduction organization the Loop. The legendary nightclub the Hacienda was the center of “Madchester”, a scene known for its club-oriented musical acts such as Happy Mondays and New Order. But in 1989, the party dimmed when a 16-year-old girl collapsed and died in the club. It was the UK’s first widely publicizedecstasy death, and experts wanted to know exactly how it happened.Despite scary headlines and slogans like “one pill can kill,” ecstasy deaths arerare. But John Henry, a London toxicologist, made the connection between MDMA, whichcausesa rise in body temperature, and overheating while partying. Measham’s colleagueRussell Newcombe, a drug researcher, pushed for greater awareness of harm reduction at clubs, which could look as simple as telling revelers to drink water – half a pint an hour isrecommendedwhen taking MDMA – to combat the sweltering effects of drug use (made worse by the physical exertion that comes from dancing all night).In 1994, Newcombe published themanifesto“Safer Dancing”, in which he urged venues to provide “free, cold water … at the very least in the toilets, at best by providing water on the bars”. After that, Measham said it became “good practice” for Manchester clubs to do so, though it was not legally required. Venue owners knew that club kids were unlikely to order alcohol, as it lessens the effect of MDMA. Some started upselling water to take the place of booze sales.“It definitely became a point of contention,” Measham said. She remembers Mixmag, an electronic music magazine, publishing a list of rave clubs with symbols of water taps next to each that had hydration stations. “It was known that you wanted to pick the place with the tap symbol,” she said.Measham and others continued to publish studies and reports on the importance of staying hydrated during a night out. It took more than 15 years for the UK to legally catch up, with a 2010 update to the country’s liquor licensing rules. “I say half-jokingly that getting free drinking water to be a legal obligation in all UK licensed premises is my greatest achievement, and I want it written on my tombstone,” she said.View image in fullscreenAttenders at Bossa Nova Civic Club in Brooklyn, New York.Photograph: Marissa Alper/The GuardianStill, the law is vague, and there are many ways venues can interpret it. Measham points to the London club Fabric, which features an ice water bar, as a good example. “But I can think of other places that only have one [water] bar, as far as possible from where all the action is, and there’s always a massive queue, and they only give you a tiny little cup of it,” she said. “Some festivals in the UK won’t provide tap water at the proper bar that serves alcohol, but they’ll have a standpipe in a field that’s three-quarters of an hour’s walk from where all the entertainment is.”Security staff at concert venues usually have bottled water on hand, in case of health emergencies. In fact, it is not uncommon for artists to stop concerts when they see a fan who needs assistance in the crowd. (Billie Eilishhanded out waterto a Swedish crowd while performing in 2018, after one fan said: “We’re all just passing out.”)Cutting corners with community safety can really kill an event or venueRichard HartnellRichard Gallo, a 31-year-old publicist who lives in New York, goes out often and wonders why it has to get to that point. “If they have cases of water on hand in case anyone’s going to have a reaction, it blows my mind,” he said. “That could be alleviated by having multiple water stations around venues.” Gallo noted that he had seen friends drink straight out of clubs’ bathroom sinks as a (gross) last resort.Harm reduction advocates argue that taking care of patrons is a good investment. People do not want to go somewhere they feel is stingy with water.“In my experience, doing the right thing is profitable, and cutting corners with community safety can really kill an event or venue,” said Richard Hartnell, an organizer and director of outreach for DanceSafe, the non-profit best known for handing out free drug-testing kits at raves and festivals in North America. “If people know that you care, and don’t want anyone to potentially get brain damage from dancing five hours in a sweaty box with no water, then they’ll take your venue over the sketchy one.”‘I get to do whatever I want in the moment’: why more people are going to gigs, festivals and clubs aloneRead morePeter Kerre, a New York DJ and community activist, recalls visiting Brooklyn Mirage, a since-shuttered megaclub popular among fans of electronic dance music. “I would stand by the bar and see people order water, and I remember being baffled by the price,” Kerre said. “It cost almost as much as a beer. I chatted with one of the staff, and they told me: ‘Oh yeah, this is more of a pill crowd,’ [meaning] they could make some money off of selling water.”(The Brooklyn Mirage shuttered after failing to secure properpermitsafter a long renovation. The club did have water refill stations, but those were not by the bar and patrons needed to buy a bottle first. Representatives for Avant Gardner, which operated the venue, did not respond to a request for comment.)If New York does amend its rules about free water, Kerre hopes the regulations are specific enough to prevent venues from easily flaunting them. “Not only should there be stations, but those should be clearly illuminated,” he said. “If there’s an emergency, you want to know where the water is. There are exit signs in case of fire. There should be blue signs for water. Fire codes for the buildings, water codes for the bodies.”Explore more on these topicsClub cultureBars, pubs and clubsClubbingDance musicNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They asked me to photograph the country’sleading athletesbefore the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. I probably covered 30 different people over three days – I’m a quick shooter. I started out photographing on film, which is still my preferred medium. Even when I’m shooting digitally, I’m very selective and take care with every click.On a logistical level, it was much easier for me to work in a studio, though that was something I don’t usually choose to do. I’m more of an outside photographer: I like to go on location or shoot people in a park.For me, photography is a way to learn more about subjects. I use the camera to unlock new things that interest me. I’m informing myself rather than trying to inform the viewer. I photographed therave scenein the 90s because I was excited by it and wanted to get closer to it. And I photographed my home town ofRovigolong after I’d moved away, in an attempt to get to know more about the place I’d left behind.In this case, I didn’t know these people, but I always asked for half an hour just to talk with each subject first. I didn’t discuss the pictures – I just wanted to know where the person was coming from. I’d ask simple questions like: “What did you do yesterday? Are you married? What’s the last TV series you enjoyed? Which football team do you support?” Portraying someone is a sort of collaboration, but I didn’t discuss with each sitter how they wanted to be photographed. They trusted me to do my thing.Photography has to be spontaneous and instinctive – I feel more like a thief than a painterDonato Telesca, the subject of this picture, is a powerlifter who went on to win bronze at theParalympics. I’d been shooting him sitting against a vertical background, some more straightforward images, but while we were taking a break, and I was having a coffee, I noticed him leaning back on the floor and resting. There was also, by chance, a ladder in the studio, so I said: “Donato, please don’t move!” I took the ladder, jumped on it and photographed him from above.For me, photography has to be like that – spontaneous and instinctive. Something catches my eye and I want to capture it. I feel more like a thief than a painter, if you see what I mean. Here, I wanted to keep a reportage photographer type of approach, so I was shooting with the continuous light rather than using flash. When I go on location, I never arrive with an idea. I want to be able to improvise. That’s the method I took for this series.Some photographers who shoot in studios try to hide the fact, but I wanted to make it obvious that’s where we were. For example, I deliberately included things like the metal wheel of the ladder and that Scotch tape on the floor in the shape of an arrow. The Olympic Committee were wary of this approach but gave me complete creative freedom, and they were happy when they saw the results.I don’t really like explaining my pictures. I think that demeans them in a way, like trying to explain a song or a poem. But I do love to hear other people’s interpretations. Some people seeing this image for the first time didn’t immediately realise Donato has no legs – they thought he might just be sitting in a weird position. The orientation of the photograph adds another layer of ambiguity. Until you realise it’s taken from above, you might imagine Donato is defying gravity. But the most important thing is that when I showed him the picture, Donato was over the moon.View image in fullscreenMattia Zoppellaro.Photograph: Courtesy Mattia ZoppellaroMattia Zoppellaro’s CVBorn: Rovigo, Italy, 1980High point:“Beside shooting stars such as Lou Reed, Bono and Patti Smith, working on my current project on the Arabic world in northern Italy.”Top tip:“Travel light, sell the tripod – and don’t show the images to your subject before making your selection.”This image is part of theTaylor Wessing Portrait Photo prize exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 8 February.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyParalympicsParis Paralympic Games 2024Disability and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So, when the star came to play his home town of Ottawa, Canada, the ambitious kid made sure to sneak backstage with his guitar to play him a song he’d just written. “I started singing Diana to Chuck Berry when, suddenly, he stops me and says, ‘That’s the worst song I’ve ever heard in my life, go back to school.’”Rather than slink away from such a pronouncement, however, Anka used it as a spur. “Revenge is a motivator like you won’t believe,” the 84-year-old star said with an eruptive laugh the other day. “I said to myself, ‘I’m going to show him.’ That attitude has prevailed for me through my entire life.”Quincy Jones and Frank Sinatra: the audacious partnership that rocketed them to another planetRead moreIt didn’t hurt that, within a year, his dewy Diana became a global colossus, rising to No 1 in the UK and the US, making him the first Canadian artist to top the American charts while insuring he wouldn’t spend one more day at school. The next year, his equally lush single You Are My Destiny broke the top 10 in both countries, a triumph he tripled in 1959 and ’60 with mooning touchstones like Lonely Boy, Put Your Head on my Shoulder and Puppy Love.Remarkable as those achievements may have been, what separated Anka’s work from that of other teen idols – then and now – was that he wrote all those songs himselfandretained the publishing rights. Small wonder during our 90-minute interview, Anka referred to himself as a writer no fewer than 22 times. “Without the writer of the song, there’s no record companies, no executives, no lawyers. There’s nothing,” he said.At the same time, Anka knew his career would be nothing if he didn’t find a way to mature his sound as his teen years waned. Over the decades, he did both with enough regularity and rapidity to sustain a seven-decade career, extended by a new album, Paul Anka: My Way, set to arrive before his 85th birthday next year. In the process he forged key connections to stars from the 1950s (Buddy Holly) through today (Drake). Along the way, his compositions have ranked among the most performed pieces in music history, most notably My Way, which managed to become a defining anthem for bothFrank Sinatraand Sid Vicious, as well as the bouncy theme music for Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show, a 15-second refrain that ran the full 30-year span of the show, netting Anka multimillions in the process.The full arc of that evolution is now being told in a new HBO documentary titled Paul Anka: His Way. Speaking by phone from an LA recording studio near his home, Anka said his primary reason to participate in the film was to school the benighted in the scope of his achievements. “There are a lot of people out there who don’t know I wrote the last threeMichael Jacksonhits,” he said. “I take great pride in that.”The film’s structure – half of which takes place in the present – stresses another angle that’s crucial to him. “I want people to understand that I’m still functioning, that I can walk,” he said with a laugh. “Last week I played to 10,000 people at a stadium in Mexico!”The audiences he’s finding in such places aren’t entirely old. Six decades after its presumed sell-by date, Put Your Head on My Shoulder became a TikTok phenomenon by generating more than 145m collective views from over 21,000 videos made by young people miming to the song. In 2021, a version that mashes his original song with Doja Cat’s single “Streets” became a top 10 hit. “What a life was put on me that I can just sit home and get a check for something I did years ago,” he said. “It’s stupid money.”If the result has bought him a far more opulent lifestyle than he started with, his family were hardly starving when he was growing up. His parents, of Lebanese descent, ran a successful restaurant in Ottawa and, when prominent stars would stop by, Anka would make them listen to him sing. “I was always a ballsy kid,” he said.While his father wanted him to go into the family business he said, “I believed in being creative,” and he wasn’t shy about it. At 14, while visiting an uncle in California he sought out a local label that scored a hit with Stranded in the Jungle by the Cadets. He convinced them to let him cut a song he wrote, using the Cadets as his backup. While the song bombed, the next year he lobbied his parents to send him to New York where he successfully got the producer Don Costa to sign him to his new label, ABC-Paramount. Today, he refers to his first single for them, Diana, as “a stupid little song about a girl who wouldn’t even look at me”. Regardless, fans swooned.Before that, Anka says, he had “absolutely no success” with girls. “I went from knowing nothing to winding up with French women, Italian women, Japanese women who were all teaching me everything I was dying to know.”At the same time, he felt a cog in the teen machine. “Older people were telling me what to do and what to wear,” he said. “I was in a cage.”Worse, he was bullied by some older stars on tour, especially Jerry Lee Lewis. “He hated that I was so successful,” he said. “He picked on me and I would fight back. We would be throwing things at each other.”View image in fullscreenPaul Anka in 1962.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty ImagesBy contrast, he formed so tight a bond with Buddy Holly, that even though Holly was another rare teen idol who wrote his own songs, he still asked Anka to pen one for him. The result, It Doesn’t Matter Anymore, later covered by stars from Linda Ronstadt to Eva Cassidy, was the last piece Holly recorded before his death in a plane crash in 1959. He recorded it in a very different style than his other hits, eschewing the Crickets’ rhythm section to cut it with strings. Immediately after his demise, it became the first posthumously released song to top the UK charts. Still, Anka was so crushed by Holly’s death, he gave all of his publishing royalties for the song to his widow, a fact which, oddly, isn’t in the documentary.Despite his success as a teen dream, Anka was already feeling itchy. “I had this squeaky little voice, and I really wanted to mature,” he said.His role models were the kings of Vegas – Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr – all guys in suits who swaggered with a louche sophistication. Rather than snubbing the kid, “they totally embraced me,” Anka said, making him the youngest person to play Vegas to that point. In return, he brought a new audience to town, delighting the mafia guys who ran the place. Today, he has nothing but glowing things to say about the Mob. “I knew what they were capable of doing but I can honestly say they were gentlemen with me,” he said. “You’d shake their hands, and you had a deal they stood by.”In 1962, he made another important connection with an older entertainer. While brainstorming a TV special for Granada he felt it needed a comedian to break up the music. He settled on Johnny Carson, who wasn’t widely known at the time. When the comic got the chance to take over the Tonight Show shortly after, he asked Anka to write him a theme song and, while Carson loved the result, he ultimately told Anka he had to go with a piece penned by the show’s musical director, Skitch Henderson. That’s when Anka business savvy kicked in: he offered Carson half his publishing for the song if he would use his piece instead. The bribe worked! Years later, Carson’s lawyer told the New York Times that the royalties for it generated between $800,000 and $900,000 a year for three decades.That was hardly Anka’s only shrewd business move. In 1963, when his record company started losing faith in him, he bought back his entire catalogue, presaging Taylor Swift’s move decades later. Then, to exploit his growing international audience, he started recording his songs in a variety of languages, including Italian, which ended up making him one of the biggest-selling stars in that country. Still, by the British Invasion of the mid-60s Anka fell far behind the trends. In reaction, he began to act, if not particularly well, though he did land a role in the respected film The Longest Day, for which he also wrote the musical theme.His true comeback didn’t begin until 1969 when he wrote My Way as a final song for Sinatra who told him he was planning to retire at 58. Anka matched his self-valorizing lyric to a melody from a French song whose rights he acquired two years earlier. Today, he says he has no idea how, at 24, he had the wisdom to write one of the most celebrated anthems of ageing ever. “Where the Jesus did this come from?” he remembered thinking. “It changed my life.Floored as he was by Sinatra’s version, he was initially appalled by Sid Vicious’s anarchic take, which added to the lyric words like “fuck”, “cunt” and “queer”. “Would I have recorded it that way? No!” Anka said. “Would I have the imagination to do that? No! But I think everybody is entitled to express themselves.”A song he wrote for Tom Jones in 1971, She’s a Lady, not only gave the Welsh singer one of his biggest hits, it became a touchstone of swank. Three years later, Anka revived his own performing career with You’re Having My Baby, and while the song became his first No 1 hit in 15 years, it made critics blanch. The lyrics – which described the woman as havinghisbaby – inspired Ms. Magazine to name him “Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year”. “How could it be negative towards women?” Anka asked. “I have five women living in the house.” (He has five daughters.) “It was PMS all over the goddamn place.”Though his own hits dried up after the 80s, he kept reinventing himself, most obviously on his Rock Swings album in 2005 on which he performed swinging versions of guitar-driven songs like Soundgarden’s Black Hole Sun and Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit. “Dave Grohl told me he didn’t know what the lyrics [to Teen Spirit] meant until my version,” Anka said.The Michael Jackson hits he co-wrote, all released posthumously, came from sessions Anka did with the late star in the 80s. After Jackson’s death, his estate used key parts of one song to fashion the single This Is It, without knowing its true provenance. When Anka got wind of it, he threatened to sue if they didn’t give him 50% of the publishing, which they promptly did. The same pattern repeated for two more Jackson singles, one of which was sampled for Drake’s Don’t Matter to Me.In the years since, Anka has continued to tour. He still performs Puppy Love at 84. “Am I embarrassed to sing it now?” He admits: “Kinda.”To get over that, he puts himself in the place of fans who still clamor for it. He plans to continue singing it on his tour next year. He also has a new album he’s working on that’s meant to follow the one coming in February. Oh, and then there’s a play about his life he’s overseeing which he hopes to bring to Broadway. Asked what his own final curtain will be, Anka surmises the play might be a fitting culmination, though he isn’t sure. “I plan to keep doing this until I can’t stand,” he said. “Then it will be the big wave and out.”Paul Anka: His Way is now available on HBO MaxExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryFactual TVFrank SinatraTelevisionMichael JacksoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But will it really vanish?Stuart HeritageWed 3 Dec 2025 06.32 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 06.38 ESTShareIf you have noticed a heightened sense of millennial angst in the air recently, it is likely to be because Friends is leavingNetflixthis month. And, reader, the fans have not taken it well.“Absolutely raging,” one viewer tweeted upon hearing the news. “I’m cancelling my Netflix subscription,” raged another. A third, simultaneously managing to capture the mood of the nation while retaining a healthy sense of perspective, wrote: “FUCK OFF FRIENDS IS LEAVING NETFLIX IN THE UK WHAT THE FUCK WILL I DO TO RELAX WTF THIS HAS BEEN THE SHOW TO GET ME TO SLEEP SINCE I WAS A BABY WHAT DO U MEAN ITS COMING OFF NEFLIX IM SORRY BUT NO.”Alas, it is true. On 30 December,Friendswill leave Netflix, where it has been streaming since 2015. Which shouldn’t really be a surprise, because shows have a habit of bouncing around the streaming services. I remember trying to rewatch Mad Men a few years ago, a pursuit which ended up as a game of prestige Whack-a-Mole as it flicked from Sky to Netflix to goodness knows where. It’s just a part of the modern landscape.However, the fact that Friends, of all shows, has been the one to tip people over the edge says a lot about television in 2025. For one thing, Friends is absolutely deathless. The finale aired 21 years ago, and yet despite everything – changing tastes, fresher writing, increased choice – it is still such a go-to that the Independent recently called it “Netflix’s most rewatched series”.View image in fullscreenUproar … Courteney Cox (left) and Jennifer Aniston in Friends.Photograph: NetflixThis, of course, means that it is highly valuable. In 2018, Netflix had to renegotiate to keep Friends in its global lineup, and had to shell out $80m-$100m to do so. This was for a one-year deal. In fairness, this still represented a good deal for all involved; even at the higher end, that sum was less than 1% of Netflix’s revenue in 2018, and Friends ended up becoming themost-watched show on any streaming servicein the UK that year.But now we live in an era of streaming wars, with multiple platforms fighting tooth and claw for every subscriber they can get. And this is why Friends is really leaving Netflix. Friends is a Warner Bros show. Warner Bros is about to launchHBO Max in the UKfor the first time. Arguably no show in existence will be able to pull in subscribers like Friends. It makes perfect business sense, then, for HBO Max to claim Friends as its own.Aside from this, the uproar also provides a little insight into how people actually watch television. You’ll notice that very few fans are upset because Friends is a good show; instead, they’re broken-hearted because their routine has been disrupted. To them, Friends is a comforting piece of background noise they can put on while they do other things. Spend any time on X and you’ll see people talk about watching Friends while they eat, or study, or do jobs around the house. It’s a show people use to manage their ADHD. It’s a sleep aid.And this makes a lot of sense, because one of the most startling things about Friends has always been its efficiency. This wasn’t a show that ever took risks or played with the form. It’s a show where six attractive people machine-gun gags with a very specific cadence for 20-plus minutes. The studio audience laughs. Every few minutes there’s a blast of interstitial music. There’s a pattern to it, a comforting rhythm that you can set your body clock to.But, look, this has happened before. You might remember the days where Friends was an E4 mainstay, with episodes showing more or less around the clock. Friends left E4 in 2011, and there was a similar outcry back then too. “E4 is dead!” people wailed on forums. “Are Channel 4 burning all their bridges?”. In a very 2011 move, there was even an online petition to save it from moving to Comedy Central. “I’m so utterly disgusted, like, majorly,” it said. In an even more 2011 move,the petition received 81 signatures.The point is that everyone survived that. E4 kept going. Friends moved. The fans found it again. Just because it’s leaving Netflix, it doesn’t mean that this is the end of the world. And besides, we live in an age of such aggressive media consolidation that Netflix may well end up owning thestreaming side of Warner Bros, which it submitted a bid for last month; if it succeeds, it will probably own Friends again by Christmas. Maybe don’t cancel that subscription just yet.Explore more on these topicsFriendsTelevisionNetflixTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a leatherwoman, I thought it was absolutely brilliant. I loved the tension, and it’s funny as hell. It’s also incredibly hot.There isn’t a single consent conversation in the film, perhaps because that could be boring. I think it’s perfectly ethical not to include what may have been a lengthy negotiation between Colin and Ray but, on the flipside, sometimes there isn’t a conversation, and people decide to take risks. I’m all for people making their own decisions about taking those risks, as long as they’re able to assess them.View image in fullscreenOn the leash … Melling in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentAs a psychologist, I can see what psychological conflicts they were trying to pull away from. Ray may need to be in control because that’s how he manages emotion. When he loses control, it doesn’t feel safe to him. It’s harder to tell with Colin. He gains the ability to speak more about what he wants, now that he understands what’s being asked of him. It’s important people are made clear that a relationship of this kind can be very healthy.The sex in this movie is so impressive. It looked incredibly real.

Representations of BDSM or fetish are very often reduced on celluloid to thriller and horror-genre psychopathic sadists, or the much-maligned stereotypical gimp in the basement. With Pillion, we observe human emotions and reactions where love and BDSM interact, and which many of us in the kink community can relate to.I see this film as the ultimate homage to the origin story of leather BDSM. Gay leather culture originated in San Francisco in the late 1940s, ostensibly as a response to post-second world war motorcycle clubs, such as the one Marlon Brando belongs to in The Wild One (1953).There are nods to the wider fetish community: latex, rubber, pup and sports gear. There was plenty of diverse fetish representation – steel chain chokers and key holding, indicative of ownership, feature prominently. But oddly, a complete omission of leather BLUF (Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub), the more prevalent iteration of leather in modern-day fetish. Perhaps the producers wanted it to be as representative as possible of fetish, but felt uneasy over the visual aesthetic of some BLUF uniforms, as many in the kink community do?Nonetheless, Pillion is a film overdue about a community well used to stigmatisation from both the mainstream and the LGBTQ+ community.KrugerAfterDark is a fetish community journal on Instagram.‘It nailed that BDSM experimentation isn’t just in the bedroom’Luca, 29, Oxford‘I think my mum’s going to like it’: Alexander Skarsgård on his gay biker ‘dom-com’ PillionRead moreI’ve rarely seen a film so excruciatingly British, with the tiny princess dog along for the date, the Christmas pub singing, and the full-tilt awkwardness. The fumbling but genuine support from Colin’s parents crystallised the complications of trying to overlap two (or more) very different social spheres. The film had fun with the classic quandary of being brattish against control, but also not being prepared to take that control on.View image in fullscreenRay on the date … Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThe most interesting part was Colin and Ray’s experimentation. We get to see Colin take chances to explore something – an act, a date, a lifestyle, a self-description – and not nail it on the first try, yet keep going. I expected that the film might crush their relationship at the first sign of pushback or discontent from Colin, and the fact that they didn’t makes it much more complex. We get to see him walk willingly, if fumblingly, into unknown situations, discover that he does indeed enjoy parts of it, as well as realise that he doesn’t have to keep the parts he doesn’t or can’t work with. He is happy; he could just be a bit happier. Pillionnailed the idea of BDSM/kink being about experimentation and self-exploration, and not just strictly in bed.‘I cried four times’Max Hovey, 26, AshfordView image in fullscreenMax HoveyI was pretty blown away by Pillion. It was great to see something that showcased the less sanitised parts of queer culture. So often, representation is either really traumatic, or this polished romantic fantasy of queerness. To see the grittier, more raw and realistic parts of queer culture, specifically kink culture, was refreshing. There’s a lot that I related to. I think I cried four times.Pillion is a very striking portrait of loneliness, and it highlights how challenging dating can be for queer people. I’m someone who lives in a small town, and dating is very hard. It can feel very lonely, and the film really highlights that.View image in fullscreenLonely at the bottom … Melling in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentIn terms of Ray and Colin’s sexual dynamic, it felt like a lot of their love story was a metaphor for how we can accept way less than what we want and way less than what we feel we’re owed. Throughout the film, Colin is accepting less than what he wants. He’s yearning for something with more of a connection. You can see in the New Year’s scene, he clearly feels lonely and isolated, so he’s settling for any form of connection, even if it is purely sexual. It’s something a lot of queer people can relate to. When you’re experiencing that loneliness, you do just go along with things to feel any form of connection.Max Hovey is aqueer intimacy educator.‘Heartstopper is sweet but I’ve never seen myself in it. Pillion was different’Talia, 33, OxfordPillion rides off with top prize at British independent film awardsRead moreI remember the first time I attended a kink party. It was euphoric. The rules that chafed me in my day-to-day life were turned on their head. When I left, I literally felt high. I remember the person who had invited me said, “Welcome to the new way of the world.” I carried that other “world” with me for days. I sat there on the tube, looking at people with this feeling that they had no clue what was happening around them. I was the keeper of a magnificent secret, and none of the confines of my old life seemed to have power over me any more. Pillion captured this feeling perfectly. I’m not sure how people will react to Colin’s decision to tolerate (or even revel) in Ray’s treatment of him, but to me, his motivations were crystal clear.View image in fullscreen‘Some of us are perverts, and that’s ok’ … Pillion.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThe problem with the other world is that you can’t live in it all the time. There is lots of talk and fantasising in the kink community about 24/7 BDSM relationships – and I’m sure some people do engage in them – but at some point, someone has to file the taxes. Pillion isn’t afraid to sit in that uncomfortable juncture where fantasy meets reality.As a lesbian, I think one of my favourite things about Pillion is that it’s a queer film, but everyone in it is a little fucked up. Some of us are perverts, and that’s OK. Shows like Heartstopper are sweet, but I’ve never seen myself in them. I’m human, I’m flawed, and I’ve been in some terrible relationships. While my ex was not a leather daddy – although I did ride pillion on a motorcycle with her once – there were beats in this film that were relatable not because they were kinky, but because they encapsulated that desperate feeling of a toxic first love.‘The kink community has an authenticity absent elsewhere’HommedeCuir,55, ShropshireView image in fullscreenHomme de CuirI take my hat off to [director] Harry [Lighton] for having the balls to make this film. I think it’s funny, really thought-provoking, and it sheds a lot of light on the way relationships in our leather community work. There are so many moments in the film that touched my heart. I see so much of my own mum and dad in Colin’s parents.The kink community, for me, is the one place where you have a collection of people who are all together and showing off all their vulnerabilities. They’re their most authentic selves because you are seeing them as they really want to be seen. Obviously, they’re not going to walk around in it 24 hours a day, though some probably might. But I think it’s very rare that you encounter that level of authenticity and vulnerability in a world that is full of lies and bullshit.View image in fullscreenA real treasure … Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentAwkward clapping, no-sand beaches and Alexander Skarsgård’s thigh-high boots: a trip to Cannes to see my filmRead moreTo actually immerse yourself in that community is a real treasure.

It’s the ultimate film about how the screenwriter is always the loser and the chump. You can tell that Norma Desmond (Swanson) is washed up because she has actually written a screenplay – which is, however, more than Joe (Holden) ever achieves in the course of this film.Sunset Boulevard’s own script, co-written by Wilder with Charles Brackett and DM Marshman Jr, is of course superb. And after 75 years, we can appreciate the movie’s sober judgment about the dangers of cinephilia and Hollywood ancestor worship. The street name itself, with its dying fall, is an occult omen of the eerie and macabre things that happen here. David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive had the same chill. The street name is about the final ending, and this is one of the very few films of any sort with a really satisfying ending: the way in which the delusional old celebrity, her eyes pinwheeling, is finally induced to come placidly down the stairs to surrender to the authorities. She grimaces and gurns directly into the lens at the very last, rather like Anthony Perkins in Psycho – a film that incidentally was very much influenced by this one.Holden, with a rumpled slouch, plays Joe Gillis, a former copy boy on the Dayton Evening Post in his Ohio home town, who has come to Los Angeles to make it in pictures, but none of his scripts are selling any more. Chased by repo men who want his car back, he blows a tyre (an impressive stunt) and pulls in desperately to a creepy old house on Sunset belonging to Norma, who thinks he is the vet undertaker who is going to bury her deceased chimp. A strange musical wailing sound is revealed to be not part of the soundtrack but the wind whistling in the pipes of an organ in one corner of Norma’s dusty, ornate parlour, a clever “diegetic” gag.After clearing up the confusion, and having discovered his profession, Miss Desmond thinks that this smart-alec young fellow could be just the man to polish up her epic handwritten script for a film about Salome, to star herself, and soon the penniless Joe is staying at her house, with clothes and gold cigarette cases and watches bought for him by her as she plots her return (she detests the word “comeback”). But Joe finds himself working on another woman’s script: that of production assistant Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) who has a genuinely good idea. They are falling for each other … to Norma’s very considerable chagrin.Twenty-six years later, in fact, Swanson would marry her final husband in real life: a ghostwriter and former journalist. Her hilarious performance as Norma is crazed, intense but never entirely absurd, and also very sensual and witty. The film is quite clear that she and Joe are having sex, and that the experience is a sentimental education for Joe, who flourishes and matures in spite of himself under Norma’s tutelage.View image in fullscreenHilarious, crazed, intense … Swanson as Desmond, ready for her closeup in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Ronald GrantSwanson, a veteran of the silent era, brilliantly suggests a performer who has learned the extravagant mannerisms of early cinema at an impressionable age and can never unlearn them; the kabuki mask of silent movies has eaten into Norma’s face. Swanson executes the film’s many showstopper lines with absolute aplomb (“I am big; it’s the pictures that got small”; “We didn’t need dialogue, we had faces!”) and also does a very good impression of Charlie Chaplin.Sunset Boulevard is a self-referential film about Hollywood, with as-themselves cameos for Cecil B DeMille, Buster Keaton and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. And this is the heart of its terrible warning. Of course movie professionals should be aware of and inspired by Hollywood’s glorious past – but they must not, like Joe with Norma, be held captive by it. The style and mannerisms of silent cinema were not that way because people wanted them to be quaint and picturesque. Silent movies were thrillingly innovative and new, a staggering leap forward from vaudeville and nickelodeon. Movies were and are pure innovation.Finally, Norma finds herself at Paramount studios under the impression that DeMille actually wants to make this bizarre script of hers, where she irritably brushes away a microphone that strays too close to her face – that irritating talkie gadget. Perhaps the unspoken tragedy of Sunset Boulevard is that no one after this film had the intelligence to use Swanson’s undimmed style and comic flair. She really had transitioned to the talkies but only featured in three more films afterwards. This was her masterpiece.Sunset Boulevard is in UK cinemas from 5 December, and in Australian cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsFilmBilly WilderDrama filmsComedy filmsSilent filmComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first half is spent detailing the roadblocks she’s faced in her quest, marching through them like a Marvel hero. Then, as if throwing her arm round a young apprentice’s shoulder as she walks, she lays out her six-point plan for greatness with koans of wisdom such as: “Never eat with the hyenas / ‘Cause they will look at you as bones.” If her rap career ever falters – and it looks exceedingly unlikely to on this form – she could write a brilliant leadership training book.Ben Beaumont-Thomas19Bad Bunny – NuevayolThe opening track from Bad Bunny’s Debí Tirar Más Fotos is named after New York, but contains a whole world. It encompasses the displacement, identity and resistance of the Puerto Rican people; the sample of El Gran Combo’s 1975 salsa hit Un Verano en Nueva York celebrates the cultural innovations of diverse Latin communities mingling in mid-20th-century NYC; there’s puckish Dominican dembow; the longing for home – and its heat – of PR poet Virgilio Davila’s early 1900s work Nostalgia. (Themust-see videoadds even more layers of beauty and defiance.) For Bad Bunny’s domestic and diasporic audience, it’s a rallying cry, particularly in a year when he refused to play the USto avoid his fans being seized by ICE, and faced a racist backlash to his upcoming Super Bowl headline set. For anyone else, it’s an invitation to get on his level, to learn, pay homage, knock backun shot de cañitaand dance. And why wouldn’t you?Laura Snapes18Wednesday – Elderberry WineView image in fullscreenWednesday.Photograph: Graham TolbertMiles from their usual crush of hay-bale southern punk and screaming,the North Carolina bandreturned with this disarmingly pretty tear-catcher. But beneath all the twang and sway lay a fairly devastating account of the distance elapsed between two people – from knowing the niche things that make someone cry, like fairground rides and TV ads, to driving them to the airport in silence and simply wanting to give up on life – and their pained attempts to keep bobbing along like everything’s OK, like life still tastes the same.LS17Raye – Where Is My Husband!View image in fullscreenRaye.Photograph: Erik Pendzich/ShutterstockIt’s a scenario that you can imagine Aretha or Erma Franklin singing so well, though not at quite so high a tempo: a woman, having presumably been told by her well-meaning mates that Mr Right is out there somewhere, gets irate as she wonders where exactly he might be. From the foot-stamping mock petulance of the title downwards, it’s all delivered so knowingly by Raye as she gabbles her way through this screwball caper against a backdrop of Ronson-esque horns.BBT16Wet Leg – Catch These FistsIt took all of two seconds of this comeback to obliterate any worries that Wet Leg might be a one-album wonder: Catch These Fists crashes in like a boot through a door, its riff lurching past the splintered frame. Then in saunters Rhian Teasdale, as good a rock star as the UK has right now: “You should be careful, do you catch my drift?” It turns out all this aggression is a flash-forward. Teasdale then sketches out the ketamine-fuelled night out leading up to a showdown with a man who propositions her: “I just threw up in my mouth / When he just tried to ask me out.” The detail that the bozo in question drinks Strongbow Dark Fruit is perfectly observed.BBT15Geese – TaxesThe lead single from the precocious New York rockers’ album Getting Killed is one of the many examples of frontman Cameron Winter somehow accruing a lifetime of heartbroken wisdom in just 23 years. Taxes become a metaphor for the stuff we bitterly hold on to but have to give away, whether an apology or a moment of closure. He then howls: “Doctor, doctor, heal yourself … I will break my own heart from now on” – so funny for its ludicrous level of hurt, and yet so true to the way love can turn any of us into lost, lashing-out teenagers.BBT14Aya – Off to the EssoView image in fullscreenAya.Photograph: Dee IskrzynskaGalloping on the back of a pranged-out donk beat, UK electronic experimentalist Aya is, by her own admission, having a mad one: “A blizzard when the lizard den got pickled then – I’m sizzled, sozzled hen!” She conjures the skull-clattering experience of being too drunk on public transport at an indeterminate morning hour with new associates you’ve somehow made. An inner (and possibly outer) monologue burns like a fuse through her mind as she hurtles towards the next day’s horrible daylight: just one of many dizzying stories from one of Britain’s best lyricists.BBT13Olivia Dean – Man I Need“Is having a boyfriend embarrassing now?”, writer Chanté Joseph wondered in a viral Vogue piece – a modern conundrum that Olivia Dean has expertly articulated in her singles this year. Nice to Each Other had the singalong moment “I don’t want a boyfriend!” as she pondered alternative ways to be partnered, while Man I Need was even better, and an even bigger hit: her first UK No 1. The lyrics are exasperated as she has to coax and cajole a dithering doofus into carrying her away – but Dean’s giddy singing, sweeping this way and that on soft surges of adrenaline, suggests she’s loving the chase.BBT12Blood Orange – The Field (ft the Durutti Column, Tariq Al-Sabir, Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar)To describe the constituent parts of The Field may make it sound fragmented: there’s an interpolation of the sweet Spanish guitar from Vini Reilly’s 1998 song Sing to Me, with the vocals by Polachek, Dev Hynes and Daniel Caesar; an original verse sung by Tariq Al-Sabir; a spritely breakbeat; sharp, severe rips of cello. Yet Hynes makes it hang together exquisitely, like a spider’s web somehow bearing the weight of too many raindrops. Written after the death of his mother, it also shimmers with the heightened feeling of existing in a world that looks the same but is irrevocably changed.LS11CMAT – The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station / Take a Sexy Picture of Me / When a Good Man CriesView image in fullscreenCMAT.Photograph: Sarah DoyleIn her true breakthrough year, the Irish singer-songwriter was so popular with our voters that she had three entries in the Top 20 (combined here). Together they show the breadth of her talents: like a light entertainer who appeals to kids and grandparents alike while hymning the horrors of confronting one’s self-worth. Take a Sexy Picture of Me made a TikTok craze out of a multilayered examination of body image; Jamie Oliver catches a stray as CMAT has an existential freakout after seeing his massive face on a poster; and When a Good Man Cries is a slow fiddle-fringed do-si-do that nods to her love of country, telling a rich, racked story of a breakup as she wonders: am I the baddie?BBT10Smerz – You Got Time and I Got MoneyThe ironic distance on Smerz’s great second album Big City Life, with its savage assessments of a scene’s parties and fashions, put off some listeners: it’s hard not to wonder what scathing take the Norwegian duo might have on your cooked outfit and drink of choice. But their exacting eye made them gripping company – and the sincerity of their discernment was born out in this woozy, ardently romantic ballad about how transformative it feels for true love to exceed all expectations. The looping hook “put your hands around my body / I am yours and your only” feels as though it should have existed since the heyday of girl groups, coupled with strings that sound like Bitter Sweet Symphony given theDisintegration Loopstreatment.LS9Alex G – Afterlife“We were mean and 17 / Make it like a dream, she said / We were clean, like kerosene …” The rhyme schemes in this wondrous song stretch out to meet the easy stride of its mandolin backing: it’s as if a two-pint buzz on a summer’s day was made into music. And as the US indie darling (though now on a major label) sings the chorus “as the light came, big and bright / I began another life”, you’re reminded anew of the second-to-second business of being alive, and how we can mark out the path we walk on.BBT8Lily Allen – Pussy PalaceView image in fullscreenLily Allen.Photograph: Charlie DenisEvery single detail of Lily Allen’s possibly-fictional-quite-possibly-not discovery of a cheating husband’s sex den – “Duane Reade bag with the handles tied / Sex toys, butt plugs, lube inside” – cuts like a savage little knife with a pearly handle. Utterly grim but spellbindingly beautiful, its synths as prettily detailed as they are cosmically atmospheric, Pussy Palace may be the apex of Allen’s trademark for mingling sweet and tongue-curlingly sour.LS7Pulp – Spike IslandThis was the single that heralded the first Pulp album since 2001, and the band matched the sense of occasion with an anthem. Like so many of their hits, it has a disco rhythm that’s done with real affection rather than ironic affectation, and while Jarvis Cocker might not quite have Barry Gibb’s pipes, he’s so good when he lets his voice soar. “I was born to perform, it’s a calling / I exist to do this shouting and pointing,” he sings, exulting in Pulp’s return, as well as pre-emptively batting away any suggestions they’re past it: “No one will ever have the last word / Because it’s not something you could ever say / So swivel!”BBT6Jade – Plastic BoxIt’s been 84 yearssince Robyn released new music – actually, seven, now concluded bythe Swede’s great comeback Dopamine, which came out after we voted. But until then, aficionados of cry-as-you-dance pop were well fed by this stomping synth weepie from Jade’s (largely much wilder) debut album. Her account of feeling irrationally insecure about your relationship compared with what your partner may have had with their ex is crushingly well observed – as is her honesty about torturing yourself over it by obsessively reading their old love letters.LS5Addison Rae – Headphones OnView image in fullscreenAddison Rae.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicIf you’re gonna make a song about music’s ability to tranquillise pain, it has to live up to that premise itself. Headphones On nails the brief: it’s a perfect closed loop to get lost in, an absent-minded Möbius strip of glassy chillout, a perfectly Britney-like sugary-sad vocal that goes to the kind of emotional truths she was denied – “Wish my mum and dad could’ve been in love / Guess some things weren’t meant to last for ever” – and a searching sense of awe skimmed from the outer atmosphere of Madonna’s Ray of Light. The weightlessness of it seems entirely the point, untethering the year’s finest new pop star from her earthly concerns.LS4Lady Gaga – AbracadabraAfter her Bruno Mars duet Die With a Smile put her firmly back in the centre of the pop cultural firmament after some years drifting to its edges, Gaga used her 2025 album Mayhem to consolidate that position by giving everyone what they most love about her. There are double helpings on the big, brilliant single Abracadabra: two Gagas in the video (one good, one evil) and two house beats made for a gay club at peak sweatiness (one piano, one acid). There are even two choruses, both of them using the nonsense syllables that defined her biggest hit Bad Romance – the type of thing a particularly hammy musical theatre star would do for their vocal warm-up exercises. It all adds up to double the fun.BBT3Chappell Roan – The SubwayView image in fullscreenChappell Roan.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAThe better Chappell Roan gets, the crazier it is to think that pop’s best showgirl was once signed and dropped and had to claw her way back to supremacy. This year alone, her electrifying gift for subverting pastiche proved she can turn her hand to basically anything. After the winking country hoedown of The Giver in spring, she returned in summer with a pivot: a lovelorn Celtic pop epic in thrall to the Cranberries, their own Dolores O’Riordan as well as Sinéad O’Connor, reprising those torchbearers’ snarling, choral rage to rue the impossibility of shaking off heartbreak’s haunting. Roan has made clear that she won’t be back with a second album until she’s good and ready – maybe it’ll even take five years to write, she told Vogue. Thank God for The Subway’s endless replay factor.LS2PinkPantheress – Illegal“Hey, ooh, is this illegal?” Pink flutters at the outset of a song about meeting a new weed dealer – sounding less put off by the prospect than enticed by it. Several tokes later and they’re both getting high around the corner; next they’re chatting on her bed and tempting fate. Paranoia and shame quickly join the overwhelming rush of sensations, exemplified in a sped-up sample of the floodlit synths from Underworld’s Dark & Long (Dark Train) that throbs with all the disorientation and delight of a THC-addled brain struggling to get a hold of itself. By the end, Pink’s heart is rushing and she’s short for breath – but the song’s sugary allure makes clear that this is no cautionary tale. Try it, why don’t you.LS1Rosalía – BerghainRosalía: Berghain – videoThere’s no more boring debate than arguing over whether a piece of music conforms to the traditions of a particular genre. All that hot air and high dudgeon lavished on Berghain and whether the dramatic thrusts of the London Symphony Orchestra constitute classical music or Rosalía’s coloratura is or isn’t opera – who cares? These petty concerns pale in comparison to marvelling at what the Catalan visionary is up to by smashing all this grandeur together, coupled with lyrics in German and Spanish, Björk offering “divine intervention”, Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s “I’ll fuck you till you love me” rant, and references toa 12th-century German abbessfor good measure. The towering, gothic Berghain subsumes the listener in the same way the doomed relationship Rosalía sings about is swallowing her: being overwhelmed by a lover’s fear, anger, love and blood, dissolving like sugar in hot coffee when he’s around. In the song’s sheer scale and virtuosity, she steals some power back for herself – leaving us in turn trembling with awe at her one-of-one magnitude.LSListen to the Guardian’s best songs of the year on Spotify – or transfer the playlist toApple,Tidalor other servicesThis article was amended on 3 December 2025.

It is on our phones and laptops; it is creeping into digital and corporate infrastructure; it is changing the way we learn, work and create; and the global economy rests on the stratospheric valuations of the corporate giants vying to control it.But the unchecked rush to go faster and further could extinguish humanity, according to the surprisingly readable and chillingly plausibleIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies(Bodley Head), by computer scientists Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, which argues against creating superintelligent AI able to cognitively outpaceHomo sapiensin all departments. “Even an AI that cares about understanding the universe is likely to annihilate humans as a side-effect,” they write, “because humans are not the most efficient method for producing truths … out of all possible ways to arrange matter.” Not exactly cheery Christmas reading but, as the machines literally calculate our demise, you’ll finally grasp all that tech bro lingo about tokens, weights and maximising preferences.Human extinction is not a new idea, muses historian Sadiah Qureshi inVanished: An Unnatural History of Extinction(Allen Lane), shortlisted for this year’s Royal Society Trivedi science book prize. Colonial expansion and the persecution of Indigenous peoples implicitly relied on Darwinian theories about some species being fated to outcompete others. Extinction, she points out, is a concept entwined with politics and social justice, whether in the 19th-century erasure of the Beothuk people in Newfoundland or current plans to “de-extinct” woolly mammoths so they can roam the land once more. Whose land, she rightly asks.The idea of the landscape, as well as people, having rights, is explored by Robert Macfarlane in the immersive and importantIs a River Alive?(Hamish Hamilton). By telling the stories of three rivers under threat in different parts of the world, he floats a thesis that is both ancient and radical: that rivers deserve recognition as fellow living beings, along with the legal protections that accompany it. The book, shortlisted for the Wainwright prize for conservation writing, “was written with the rivers who flow through its pages”, he declares, using pronouns that wash away any doubt as to his passion for the cause.That awe at the natural world is shared by biologist Neil Shubin, who has led expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctica and takes the reader to theEnds of the Earth(Oneworld), also shortlisted for the Royal Society science book prize. “Ice has come and gone for billions of years … has sculpted our world and paved the way for the origin of our species,” Shubin says. But those geographical extremes are increasingly vulnerable, as climate change intensifies and treaties come under strain. This is polar exploration, but without the frostbite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It contains a consignment from the first ever seed bank, started in the 1920s by Russian plant scientist Nikolai Vavilov, who dreamed of ending famine. InThe Forbidden Garden of Leningrad(Sceptre), a powerful contender for this year’s Orwell prize, historian Simon Parkin uncovers the moving story of Vavilov and his colleagues, who fought to protect their collection as the city came under siege in 1941. Vavilov fell out of scientific and political favour, and was imprisoned with terrible consequences.If this all feels too gloomy for gifting, thenSuper Agers(Simon & Schuster) might be just what you’re looking for. The cardiologist and medical professor Eric Topol, who recently conducted a review into the digital future of the NHS, has been studying the “Wellderly” – who seemingly defy the rigours of ageing – to offer evidence-based tips on longevity. Breakthroughs such as weight-loss drugs and AI will further change the game on chronic diseases, he promises. This is the one that’s going under Mum’s tree, in the hope that 80 really is the new 50.View image in fullscreenTwo elegant offerings from neurologists stand out, in an Oliver Sacks sort of way, for using patient stories to tell us something about ourselves. InThe Age of Diagnosis(Hodder), Suzanne O’Sullivan courageously questions medicine’s well-intentioned enthusiasm for attaching labels – think ADHD, anxiety – to aspects of the human condition. This is sensitive political territory, given the public conversation about the 2.8m people who are economically inactive due to long-term illness, but it deserves a hearing. And inOur Brains, Our Selves(Canongate), winner of the Royal Society prize, Masud Husain sensitively explores how our sense of identity can go awry when disease strikes. The story of the woman who thought she was having an affair with a man who was really her husband illustrates that “the way in which people behave can be radically altered [by brain disorders], sometimes shockingly so”.Now, geography of sorts:Proto(William Collins) is science writer Laura Spinney’s fluid account of how Proto-Indo-European, a painstakingly reconstructed ancient tongue, became the precursor for so many languages. Its descendants gave us Dante’s Inferno, the Rig Veda (the oldest scripture in Hinduism) and Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. “Almost every second person on Earth speaks Indo-European,” Spinney writes, setting out on a global scientific odyssey that uses evidence from linguistics, archaeology and genetics to piece together its history.No Christmas book list is complete, of course, without a doorstopper biography – and, inCrick(Profile), Matthew Cobb gives us the definitive backstory of one of the towering figures of 20th-century science. Born in Northampton into a middle-class family, Francis Crick was an unexceptional young physicist who, with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins, went on to codiscover the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 and win a Nobel prize. Cobb captures the intellectual restlessness of a man who chased problems (and women) rather than disciplines, and who mixed with artists and beat poets. Crick, who died in 2004 in California, spent his later career trying to unravel the secrets of consciousness.View image in fullscreenTalking of towering figures, anyone left intellectually unsated by recent Oppenheimer-mania will relishDestroyer of Worlds(Allen Lane), in which physicist Frank Close ventures beyond the Manhattan project to tell the gripping story of the nuclear age. Beginning with the 19th-century discovery of a smudge on a photographic plate, Close spins a history that, via Hiroshima, Nagasaki and a lot of nimbly explained physics, closes seven decades later with the Tsar Bomba, a Soviet weapon detonated in 1961.It was second in explosive power only to the meteorite impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. A big enough hydrogen bomb, Close writes, “would signal the end of history. Its mushroom cloud ascending towards outer space would be humanity’s final vision.”Can we please not tell the superintelligent AI?Anjana Ahuja is a science writer and columnist for the Financial Times.To browse all science and nature books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

These sprawling technological endeavours, which mix narrative, social connectivity and the complete freedom to explore, are uniquely immersive and potentially endless. But do they represent a whole new idea of storytelling?This week I met Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar and lead writer on Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, who has been in London to talk about his new company, Absurd Ventures. He’s working on a range of intriguing projects, including the novel and podcast seriesA Better Paradise(about a vast online game that goes tragically wrong), and a comedy-adventure set in an online world namedAbsurdaverse. He told me that, 15 years ago, he was doing press interviews for the Grand Theft Auto IV expansion packs when he had something of a revelation about the series.“I was talking to a journalist from Paris Match, a very cultured French guy – and he said, ‘Well, theGrand Theft Autogames are just like Dickens’. And I was like, God bless you for saying that! But I thought about it afterwards and, well, they’re not as good as Dickens, but they are similar in that he’s world-building. If you look at Dickens, Zola, Tolstoy or any of those authors, there’s that feeling of all the world is here – that’s what you’re trying to get in open world games. It’s a twisted prism, looking at a society that’s interesting in one way or another.”View image in fullscreenA whole new world … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd Ventures/XIt was fun to talk about this idea with Houser, because I share his view that there are striking similarities between Victorian literature and modern narrative video games. The vast amount of descriptive detail in those works was intended as a form of virtual reality, conjuring an exact image into the mind of the readers years before the invention of cinema. There is also that sense of complete immersion. The first time I read Jane Eyre a decade ago, I was amazed by the interiority of the writing, how much information we were given about the lead character’s thought processes and how much freedom we were given to explore them.Houser also saw a structural similarity in Grand Theft Auto. “There’s that same sense of slightly spread out storytelling that you get in those big 19th-century novels from Thackeray onwards,” he says. “They are kind of shaggy dog stories that come together at a point. Those books are also very realist, in a way. They’re not leaping backwards and forwards in time. They are quite physical in that sense, and games are very physical.”For Houser, this interplay between Victorian literature and game design came to a head with the production ofRed Dead Redemption2, Rockstar’s masterful, elegiac tale of revenge and redemption in the late 19th-century US. “I binged on Victorian novels for that,” he says. “I listened to the audiobook of Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day.

We were trying to fill out the three-dimensional lives of the characters, and also to capture that 19th-century feeling of life and death, which was very different from ours.”I found it so pleasing that Victorian literature has had such a profound effect on Rockstar’s hugely successful adventures. The games industry can be so inward-looking, each new game a slight variation on a successful predecessor, each narrative a combination of the same fantasy and sci-fi set texts. There’s nothing wrong with drawing on Tolkien or Akira or Blade Runner, but it’s always worthwhile extending that literary gaze. I’m looking forward to seeing how Houser’s new ventures redefine the notion of open-world games for the second quarter of the 21st century, but part of me wishes he was going all out with a sprawling Victorian novel adventure.Forget Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, maybe it’s time for Middlemarch and Machine Guns?What to playView image in fullscreenGorgeously atmospheric … Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.Photograph: NintendoIt has been 18 years since the last Metroid Prime game. People have been born, started school, done their exams, and had their first hangovers in the time since I last viewed a mysterious planet through the visor of Samus Aran. So there’s quite a lot riding onMetroid Prime 4: Beyondfor fans of Nintendo’s most badass (and neglected) hero.I reviewed itthis week and am happy to say that it’s not a disaster. It’s uneven, old-fashioned and a bit awkward, but also gorgeously atmospheric, beautiful to look at and listen to, and very entertaining. It’s almost fascinatingly unconcerned with the conventions of modern game design, and I found it very charming.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:15-20 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While I adored Red Dead Redemption 2, it frustrated me that the only option to resolve most situations was with a firearm. I’ve seen plenty of amusing videos where players try to complete innately violent titles without bloodshed, so there seems to be an appetite for pacifism.”I have vivid memories of playing the originalSplinter Cellon Xbox as a pacifist: only knocking enemies out and hiding them, never killing them. It took meforever, but it was a legitimate option offered by the game. Steampunk masterpieceDishonoredand its sequel also famously let you finish the whole thing without killing anyone. You can use your supernatural powers to sneak around and manipulate people instead; if I recall correctly, though, the game is significantly harder if you shun violence.Most stealth games offer pacifist playthroughs, actually, though few specifically reward you for sparing lives. One exception to this is the superb comic adventureUndertale, the game that finally let you talk to the monsters.

But here is an end-of-year curio: psychological horror game Sleep Awake serves us synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan stepping into what is perhaps the schlockiest role of his life – a gigantic floating head named Hypnos.This late-stage cameo is not quite indicative of the game as a whole; the handful of hours prior to Numan’s arrival are more mournful than madcap. Mostly, you explore the dilapidated, tumbledown streets of what is thought to be the last city on Earth. This setting is a magnificent work of imagination. You see it through the eyes of a young woman named Katja, who moves along rooftops, gazing out upon a barren, lifeless hinterland, into labyrinthine streets whose darkness and arcane logic recall the stirring subterranean etchings of Italian artist Piranesi.How has the planet become so inhospitable, so thoroughly wiped of life? That never really becomes clear. Rather, Katja must wrestle with a more pressing concern: should she fall asleep, our hero risks disappearing into a strange, inaccessible realm caused by a disease referred to as the Hush. Like every other perpetually exhausted person here, Katja plops a few drops of stay-awake serum into her eyes. Suddenly, she sees psychedelic visions and kaleidoscopic refractions of space. Katja seems to be losing the plot; everyone else certainly has. What remains of society has crumbled into the sleep-deprived paranoia of rival gangs.Driven initially by a desire to care for an elderly relative, you direct Katja in first-person through the game’s many grotty, decaying spaces. At one point you’re on the turf of a gas-masked cult, so you try to sneak past them, crouching against walls and under tables to avoid detection. Yet there is hardly any tension: the enemies follow rote patrol paths; their field of vision is preposterously generous. This is a rather dull, easy game of hide and seek.Sleep Awake betrays a further lack of gameplay imagination. You’re called on to short-circuit electricity breakers by rolling carts into them; you have to open doors by finding obviously placed keycards. Slowly, the lustre of the city also begins to dull: it becomes clear you are advancing along a lavishly art-directed tunnel – really, only a lightly interactive and not especially scary fairground ghost train.This is a shame because Sleep Awake is visually daring. The exploratory action is intercut with bleary yet beautiful FMV sequences: the eerie silhouette of trees against a blood-red sky; bubbling liquids shown in extreme closeup. Sometimes these unsettling images are layered over the actual 3D space to gorgeously odd, arthouse effect. This surrealism extends to the death screen: should you get clubbed on the head by one of your dimwitted foes, you must walk out of the dark towards a spectacular light-filled door; as you do, the space mutates in hallucinatory real-time, spitting you out at your last autosave.The death screen is a rare moment when Sleep Awake summons something between dream logic and the strange hazy moments between sleep states that can feel like dreaming. The rest of the time, this narcoleptic nightmare merely wears its psychedelic aesthetics – floating Numan included – without interrogating them interactively. It’s too straightforward, too legible, and not actually illogical enough where it matters.

A couple of years ago,Midnight Moleburrowed through a Chekhov-inspired cherry orchard. Back in 2019, the irresistibly nutty yet chicSquirrel, which returns toLondon’s Unicornnext month, was sheer perfection. But the Egg’s most enduring Christmas critter is Snow Mouse, the puppet star of a popular early years show. It’s now been multiplied for this new hourlong adventure aimed at slightly older audiences, aged three to nine.After a trio of mice fly in like Mary Poppins, clinging on to brollies with their tails swinging, we meet three children who have reluctantly moved from the city to the countryside. The reason is unspoken – perhaps a divorce, as the eldest child, Megan (Nikki Warwick), speaks of her embarrassment. Her sister Juliette (Linda Scaramella) is a bookworm seeking everyday excitement to rival her novels while the youngest, Timmy (Martin Bonger), is a slightly fragile bundle of excitement.These town mice learn to love their new home thanks to the resident rodents who appear to them in turn and encourage them to find wonder in their surroundings. In doing so, the kids learn to stop griping and work as a team of equals, regardless of their ages. But the show is gratifyingly neither didactic nor schmaltzy – there’s a whisker of danger when Megan goes missing and Juliette relishes the potential tragedy with grotesque glee.View image in fullscreenMystery and mischief … Martin Bonger and Linda Scaramella in Snow Mice!Photograph: Mark DawsonUnder a glacier-like cloud, Zoe Squire’s set features a doll’s house that turns into bunk beds and when snow falls the whole auditorium is transformed into a cosy den. A diaphanous sheet is dragged over the audience as the siblings speak of a landscape newly covered as if by a giant white duvet. Boosted by Katy Morison’s lighting design, the effect is entrancing and, briefly, has the stillness of freshly laid snow.How Does Santa Go Down the Chimney? review – have yourself a merry little rumpusRead moreThis co-production withNew International Encounteris tightly directed by Alex Byrne, co-written by Byrne, Kate Cross and Georgia Casimir, with devising by the cast and composer Greg Hall. The actors join in on various instruments but it is Hall, dressed with charming incongruity in tux and bow tie, who plays the bulk of a score that blends mystery and mischief. It’s a great fit for the daredevil mice in dungarees who do a jig when promised cheese on toast and have a habit of disappearing. The theatre is intimate enough for everyone to get a good look at the puppets, made by Marc Parrett based on Edwina Bridgeman’s design, and directed by Chris Pirie.The cast are dab hands at improvising with the audience and also share a realistic sibling dynamic – there’s a clever parallel to the brothers and sisters in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, read by Megan.

Why is she so grumpy and where is her Alice band? The Alice (Elian Mai West) before us, in a grey skirt suit, is behaving like a thoroughly boring grownup. Then again, she is no longer in Wonderland: this is postwar Cardiff and she is a single mother facing up to some serious issues: a bombed out home, a husband lost to war and a free-spirited daughter, Carys (Mari Fflur), on the brink of adulthood, who wants to remain a child, and play.All the wonder has left Alice Liddell (who has the full name ofthe child-friend on whom Lewis Carroll may have based his books). She is a town planner for Cardiff council, heading up an unpopular project to turn a street on which children play into a multistorey car park. But the Queen of Hearts, the tyrant ruler of Wonderland, wants a rematch to a croquet game. So the White Rabbit (Keiron Self) skitters into Alice’s life and sweeps her back into a Wonderland populated by characters of the classic tale. All are given new storylines, rather like the errant fairytale cast of Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods.Hannah McPake’s eccentric new Christmas musical conjures Carroll’s kaleidoscope of fantasy, hallucination and dream (with the help of Elin Steele’s skewed set design), adds its own heady mix of children’s games and analogies to power and tyranny, and infuses it all with intelligent humour.There is a five-piece band on the stage with actor-musicians dressed like Wonderlanders. The songs are strong (lyrics by McPake, music by Lucy Rivers) – some are rather too wordy but there are plenty of belters. Red is a catchy power ballad sung by the Red Queen (Caitlin Lavagna). Out of My Box/Life on the Edge, by Humpty Dumpty (Oliver Wood) respun as an Elvis impersonator, is amusing. And there is an infectious number in Guess Who’s Back, sung by Alice, the Unicorn (Emily Ivana Hawkins) and the Hatter (Max James).View image in fullscreenAlice is behaving like a thoroughly boring grownup before she returns to Wonderland.Photograph: Mark DouetCarroll’s Alice stories are arguably coded searches for identity (“Who in the world am I?” says Alice, again and again). This musical incorporates that existentialism, such as in Hatter’s song Who Are You? She discover who she is – or rediscovers it – by the end.Steele’s costumes are wondrous, while her puppets range from sweet to stunning: the dreaded Jabberwock, when it appears, is breathtaking.This is an imaginative and playful way of reworking an old story about the importance of the imagination, and pleasure of play. You don’t stop playing because you grow up, you grow up because you stop playing, Wonderland’s characters tell Alice. It is through play that she learns to cherish her inner child. A lesson for us all.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsSherman theatreLewis CarrollChildren and teenagersChristmas showsreviewsShareReuse this content"

This queer drama from debut playwright Jess Edwards (director ofHotterandFitter) spirals a chance encounter into an abusive relationship. Shortlisted for numerous playwriting awards, Private View reaches for a physical manifestation of entanglement theory, where two separate particles become inextricably linked. But there is little romance here. Our unnamed women wind around each other until one of them can no longer breathe, as codependence quickly gives way to coercion.Our entangled pair are Sex Education’s Patricia Allison and The Gold’s Stefanie Martini. From their first meeting of jolting dialogue, Martini’s character – a rich, 39-year-old artist and recovering alcoholic – is intense. Off-puttingly so. Her overly sincere flirtation seems to push Allison’s character – a 23-year-old physics PhD student – away rather than pulling her close. This pattern recurs, with the surprise not in the artist’s descent into needy manipulator, but in the student’s more grounded desire to be with her.Rightly or wrongly, queer women are said to move fast in relationships. This chaotic couple’s romance includes a midnight lab invasion to see Allison’s physicist’s quantum experiment, beautifully realised by Catja Hamilton’s pulsing lights and Josh Anio Grigg’s fizzing sound. But their actions don’t have lasting consequences. This supposedly career-threatening incident quickly falls away, taking the story’s stakes with it.View image in fullscreenPulsing, heady … Patricia Allison (left) and Stefanie Martini in Private View, with lighting from Catja Hamilton.Photograph: Ciara RobinsonThe pair play with their power dynamics in bed (and public toilets), with Annie Kershaw’s direction and Hamilton’s lights creating brief, heady moments of seduction, like the after-image of a photographer’s flash, bodies silhouetted against thick blocks of club-night colour. Here, Allison’s character grows – yet again – wary. She likes being told what to do, but doesn’t want that to extend beyond how they touch each other. For Martini’s artist, the shaky feeling of control becomes her whole world.A stumbling attempt is made at a Stoppardian twirling of love and science, with earnest explanations of scientific theories shoehorned into conversation and laid out as grand metaphors. For London, for love, for the future. But the compression of their separate lives plays out as the pair frantically tell each other they are the same person, rather than making us feel it’s true. Private View is an aesthetically slick exploration of an unhealthy relationship, but it’s hard to really root for – or worry about – a couple you don’t believe in.AtSoho theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re in full-on entertainment mode. Co-created by actor, hoofer and reality TV judge Adam Garcia, this Irish dance and tap hybrid is a live embodiment of the small-screen age. At the outset, singer Tom Ball says phones and filming are welcome. That’s big-haired, sweet-natured Tom Ball – the Britain’s Got Talent finalist whose audition video has 8.7m views. He’s joined by Kiwi tap dancer Bayley Graham of America’s Got Talent, YouTube, Insta etc. One of the songs is the sea shanty that went viral on TikTok. You get the idea. Every number has the forceful energy of a 30-second clip.The setup is vaguely as if we’re all in a bar, dancers chugging shots and having friendly dance-offs, adding a commercial edge to the straight-up Irish step led by Lord of theDancealum Olivia Graydon going hyperspeed. In comes a stranger from out of town, Bayley Graham. A terrific tap dancer, he’s loose and rangy in the body, feet jumping from hot coals, powering out those beats with charisma and megawatt showmanship. (Slight niggle: from some stalls you can’t see the feet because of the footlights.)View image in fullscreenHaving a great time … Hayden Woodcock, Olivia Grainge and Lizzie Pitt in Emerald Storm.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianEmerald Storm is cheesy as a Wicklow cheddar; but it’s not cynical, so it’s hard to be cynical about the performers. There’s a big cast having a great time up there and they really want us to have a great time too. Ball ramps up the hits in the second half with Beyoncé’s Halo in the style of Bublé. Does it get a bit overblown? Sure. But he delivers a tune.The find of the night is Graham, a star on the rise. A telling moment comes during a solo turn, beats building up a head of steam, when he sees someone in the front row filming. While his feet are firing like a funky machine gun, Graham dances over, takes the phone, films himself, shouts “C’mon London!” into the camera and gives it back without dropping a beat. Then he spins, jumps and slams his feet on the stage. Mic drop. More people will probably see that video than ever see him dance live.

But Cropper’s distinctive guitar work animated many of the tracks out of Stax Records, theinfluential Memphis soul labelthat released a string of international hits by such soul luminaries as Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Rufus and Carla Thomas, and Eddie Floyd.Cropper played, and sometimes produced and engineered, on the MG tracks Soul-Limbo and Time is Tight, and such huge R&B hits as Redding’s (Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay and Mr Pitiful; on Pickett’s In the Midnight Hour and 634-5789; on Floyd’s Knock On Wood and Raise Your Hand; and Don Covay’s See Saw and Sookie Sookie.In 1996, the British music magazine Mojo declared Cropper the second-best guitarist of all time, behind onlyJimi Hendrix.Raised in Memphis and a guitarist since the age of 14, Cropper began working at the Stax Records store and studio at the age of 20, in 1961, after playing with saxophonist Charles “Packy” Axton, whose mother and uncle, Estelle Axton and Jim Stewart, launched the fledgling label out of a storefront record shop and adjoining movie house. An afternoon of noodling around in the studio with three fellow musicians – Booker T Jones, Donald “Duck” Dunn and Al Jackson Jr – yielded Green Onions, the track that put Stax on the map. The song reached No 1 on the R&B charts and No 3 on the pop side.Along with the rest of the MGs, Cropper served as the Stax house backing band, helping cut records for dozens of artists. “We would literally spend 15 hours a day in the studio,” Croppertold the Guardianin 2012. “I think we had 17 or 18 artists on the roster, so we had a pretty busy schedule.”Although Cropper parted ways with the label in 1970 due to issues with the front office, Booker T & the MGs continued to regroup for recording sessions and tours from the 70s through the 90s, and backed such artists as Neil Young, Bob Dylan, John Fogerty and the Band’s Levon Helm.Cropper also found success post-Stax as the lead guitarist for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd’s musical act theBluesBrothers, playing on their 1978 album Briefcase Full of Blues as well as four other albums. He also appeared in the 1980 feature The Blues Brothers and its 1998 sequel Blues Brothers 2000. Cropper continued to record and release music late into his life, with four solo albums released after the year 2000.As a member of the MGs, Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame in 1992. He is survived by his wife Angel and four children.Explore more on these topicsSoulBluesR&BnewsShareReuse this content"

The first Mr Men character was Mr Tickle, supposedly inspired by a question to Hargreaves by the infant Adam, thoughthe exact nature of the original idea is disputed by fellow author John Malam, who says Hargreaves began doodling the characters at work.Roger Hargreaves created 39 Mr Men, and then added the Little Miss characters to the series in 1981. The first screen adaptation was broadcast in 1974 on BBC1, with Dads Army’s Arthur Lowe providing the narration. A Little Miss series, featuring Pauline Collins, was first broadcast in 1983.In 2004, character rights were sold to Chorion, which licensed a new series in 2008 that was successfully broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK and Cartoon Network in the US. In 2011, the brand was sold on to Hello Kitty owners Sanrio, which is also a partners in the proposed film adaptation, and which recently launched Mr Men Little Miss Mini Adventures as a series on YouTube.Explore more on these topicsFamily filmsFilm adaptationsChildren and teenagersnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chew Valley Hoard represents a turning point in our nation’s story.View image in fullscreenThe coins were on display at the British Museum.Photograph: British Museum“But as well as evoking the turmoil after the [Norman] conquest, there’s a contemporary significance we’re seeking as well. I think we will ask our visitors to imagine what it must have felt like in 1066 and 1067 when the ruling class had been abolished and there was essentially no government. Obviously, they will draw on their own perspectives and ideas in responding.”The hoard was discovered by seven detectorists south of Bath in 2019. Last year the coins were acquired for the nation and went on display at theBritish Museumin London, where they were seen by thousands of visitors. The hoard is now in storage at the museum.On WednesdaySouth West Heritage Trustannounced a £993,345 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to deliver a two-year engagement project to celebrate the hoard and mark the 1,000th anniversary of William the Conqueror’s birth, in 1028.The coins will be shown at the Roman Baths Museum, Bath, from January to March 2027. They will then be moved to a temporary exhibition space atthe Museum of Somerset in Tauntonwhile a permanent gallery for them is built there. There will be other activities, learning opportunities and events centred on the coins.It is believed the hoard was buried for safekeeping in 1067 or 1068, a time of rebellions in the south-west against William the Conqueror.Represented on just under half the coins is Harold II, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, who was killed at the Battle of Hastings. A little over half feature William the Conqueror. There is one coin that features Edward the Confessor.About 100 moneyers – the individuals in charge of producing coins – from 46 mints including Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Hastings, Ipswich, London and York are represented. The coins of Harold II are mainly from mints in south-east England, perhaps suggesting financial preparation for the Norman invasion.Astill said that while many people had a concept of 1066 and the Battle of Hastings, they know less about what happened afterwards. “There was a long transition to full-blown Norman rule and there and there were periods of turmoil and rebellion particularly here in the south-west.”Exeter, 70 miles south-west of where the hoard was buried, was a centre of resistance to the Normans and was besieged by William in 1068. “It may be that the coins were deposited for safe keeping during that period,” Astill said.Federica Smith-Roberts, a councillor atSomersetcouncil and the executive member for communities, housing and culture, said: “The Chew Valley Hoard is a hugely significant treasure in every sense of the word and we cannot wait to welcome it back home to Somerset.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageArchaeologySomersetBritish MuseumnewsShareReuse this content"

I said, “Let’s talk about it.” ’Photograph: BBC/PARadioObituaryBrian Hayes obituaryPioneer of radio phone-ins who hosted a popular show on LBC in the 1970s and 80s, and won Sony awards for his work on BBC Radio 2 and Radio 5 LiveAnthony HaywardWed 3 Dec 2025 11.49 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 13.06 ESTShareThe Australian-born broadcaster Brian Hayes, who has died aged 87, was a pioneer of phone-in programmes in Britain. Soon after the launch of his mid-morning show onLBCin 1976, he was labelled “the rudest man on radio”, with a reputation for being abrupt with listeners and challenging their views trenchantly. However, he insisted: “I’m not rude, but I might be assertive or even aggressive. I think I might be a bit arrogant – but that’s not a character defect.”His abrasive manner, which included cutting off callers he thought were failing to back up their arguments, was part of the “game of verbal chess” he said he played with them. He was the ultimate devil’s advocate, in contrast to presenters such asJames Whalewho tried to emulate the American “shock jocks”, provoking listeners with their own opinions.“There are two sides at least to everything,” Hayes explained to Iain Dale ina 2013 LBC interviewmarking the 40th anniversary of the launch of the country’s first commercial radio station, broadcasting news and information to London.“I didn’t generally put my own point of view across. I said, ‘Here it is. You can either think that of it or you can think this of it. Let’s talk about it.’ And the first person who came on said, ‘I think that,’ and then I would argue that it wasn’t that – it was this. That, I thought, meant that I couldn’t be accused of taking a line and, what’s more, I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to be known by my opinions on politics or anything else.”The show, which ran until 1990 and attracted up to 500,000 listeners, also featured Hayes’s interviews with politicians – over two turbulent decades of conflict in the Middle East, the winter of discontent, theThatcheryears and the Falklands war – although he said he was more invigorated by his chats with big names in the arts and literature such asJoseph Hellerand Lawrence Durrell.After 14 years, following a change of management at LBC, Hayes – nicknamed “Brian Bastard” by Private Eye – was moved off the morning show and offered an evening slot, which he turned down.View image in fullscreenBrian Hayes, centre, presenting his LBC show, which featured interviews with politicians, on this occasion, in April 1979, the chancellor Denis Healey, left, and the shadow chancellor Geoffrey Howe.Photograph: ANL/ShutterstockBBC Radio 2 gave him a national audience when he stood in for holidaying presenters during 1991, before he took over fromDerek Jamesonon the breakfast show – newly titled Good Morning UK! – the following year. He was less at home in this mainstream mix of music, news and sport, and after 12 months handed over toTerry Wogan, who was returning to the station after almost a decade away.More happily, he presented the weekly evening programme Hayes Over Britain (1993-98) forRadio 2, returning to his tried-and-trusted format. One edition, on euthanasia, won him the 1993 Gold Sony Radio award for best phone-in.During the same period, he was back in the mornings taking calls for his show The Magazine (1994-97) on Radio 5 Live, where he also returned to breakfast time at weekends (1995-98), then hosted a late-night show (1998-2006). Another Sony Radio award came his way for anchoring the station’s coverage of the1999 Soho nail bombing. He described Radio 5 Live as “the nearest thing to LBC”.Hayes was born in Perth, Western Australia, and brought up in the mining town of Norseman, where his father was a gold miner, and then the city of Kalgoorlie. He said that even at school he enjoyed debate and was known as “a difficult little beggar”.He left at 14 to take a typing course, then went through jobs at the Kalgoorlie Miner newspaper, the Chamber of Mines, and a mining company, before his radio break in 1955, aged 17, reading the news and presenting music shows on the Kalgoorlie station 6KG. Five years later, he moved to 6TZ-CI in the coastal city of Bunbury and rapidly on to 6IX in Perth to present phone-in shows and documentaries.In 1971, Hayes emigrated to Britain.Radiowork was slow coming, so he found jobs as an usher at the Dominion theatre in London, then as a copytaker for the Press Association.Capital Radio, a new London commercial station that opened in 1973, a week after LBC, took him on as a producer of the phone-in show Open Line, and two years later he was presenting it. He joined LBC in 1976, with Margaret Thatcher, the new Conservative party opposition leader, as a guest on his first programme. He said she was as nervous as he was – and concerned that the headphones would ruin her hairdo. Later, he was named the Variety Club’s 1980 Independent Radio Personality of the Year.On leaving LBC, he had his own show on the BBC London station GLR during 1991 and, while at Radio 2, interviewed guests on the Radio 4 programme Midweek, alongside Libby Purves, from 1991 to 1994. He also presented the London Newstalk breakfast show with Douglas Cameron (1994-95).He later starred in the Radio 4 sitcomNot Today, Thank You(2006) as a washed-up radio presenter.In 1965, Hayes married Rosie Galati; they divorced in 1998. He is survived by their son, Sean, and a granddaughter, Emily.Brian John Hayes, broadcaster, born 17 December 1937; died 29 November 2025Explore more on these topicsRadioRadio industryRadio 5 LiveRadio 2LBCCapital RadioobituariesShareReuse this content"

There is no established framework for what “festive” means, and no recognised metrics of Christmassyness. It could be indicated by a lurid green/angry red colour in a place you’re not expecting it (McDonald’s Grumble Pie, I’m looking at you); or an existing thing, made into a more seasonal shape, or the introduction of a quintessentialChristmasingredient, such as a brussels sprout (though seriously, food giants, get over yourself if you think it’s cinnamon – this is an autumn spice).I am not here to critique the essentials of fast food (I love it). If you want someone who will come over like the critic inRatatouille, you’re just going to have to go and rewatch Ratatouille. I am merely here to eat six festive specials, and ask myself: do I feel Christmassy, punk?The Chicken Cranberry Katsu, Wagamama, £15.30View image in fullscreen‘Impressive’ … Wagamama chicken cranberry katsu curry.Photograph: WagamamaWe all know what a katsu curry looks like, right? A mound of rice; simple, breaded fried chicken sliced along each side; with a sweet thick sauce of miso, soy, ginger, honey and other stuff over the whole lot, to create a plate that is defiantly beige and homogenous, a gauntlet to all norms of food presentation. The sheer audacity of tweaking that for Christmas effect, plus the simplicity of the fix – exactly the same curry, with cranberries – were both impressive. My son ate a regular katsu as a control, because he’s a good boy. He said the limited edition was exactly right: they’re trying to convey Christmas spirit, not recreate Christmas dinner. The difference was subtle, unless you don’t like cranberries, in which case it’s like a siren. I do like cranberries. It was fractionally more calorific than the regular version, whereas technically, in order to be festive, a dish has to be 10 times more energy dense, and only 30p more expensive. So you might knock a couple of points off for that, but then give them back, because the first oath of festive variation is “do no harm”.Festive rating: 4/5The Festive Bake, Greggs, £2.10View image in fullscreen‘A bit grey’ … Greggs’ Festive BakePhotograph: GreggsOne time my dog found a pristine sausage roll on the pavement, and now every time he sees a Greggs’ bag he gets wildly excited, which I used to laugh at, the eternity of his springing hope, until I realised that I am the same, and ever since the steak bake, I can’t see a lattice pastry pattern without thinking, mmm, I’ll try that. The festive bake is a version of the chicken bake, and, praise be, refrains from substituting in turkey, which unlike every other meat tastes more like itself when it’s mass produced, becoming weirdly disgusting in the process. There are a load of adds: a herb dusting over the top, sage and onion stuffing, bacon, then more sage and cranberry in the white sauce, which sends it a bit grey, but I don’t mind that as much as you’d think. With my back against the wall, I’d say bacon is only Christmassy when proximal to sausage, which would also make the stuffing taste more like stuffing. There’s also no getting around the fact that the steak original is richer and more luxurious.Festive rating: 3/5Double Big Tasty meal, £9.49, Grumble Pie, £2.39, both McDonald’sView image in fullscreen‘Hard recommend’ … McDonald’s Grumble Pie.Photograph: McDonald’sGuys, the Double Big Tasty meal is a Big Mac! OK, it has a smoky sauce. But it’s a Big Mac! The brass neck of you, McDonald’s. Grumble pie, meanwhile, is green enough that there will be kids who think it’s made of spinach, so good luck with that. This is very close to the classic apple pie format, which is mysteriously good: somehow the gluey, atomically hot fruit never penetrates the crunchy pastry, to create an utterly reliable contrasting mouthfeel, which delights every sense except the ones that are on fire. So now just imagine that with cranberries and custard. And wait for it to cool down a bit, idiot. It does really throw itself into the season with those cranberries, while remaining as delicious as the original apple version. Hard recommend. Would eat again.Festive rating: The Double Big Tasty is delicious, but 1/5 for Christmas spirit. The Grumble Pie is much better, 4/5Stuffing Tower Burger Meal, KFC, £9.49View image in fullscreen‘Excellent’ … KFC’s Stuffing Tower Burger.Photograph: KFCOK, I’m gonna lay this out: the word “stuffing” is not festive of itself, and the flavours sage and onion are in no way automatically reminiscent of Christmas, instead conjuring school dinners and institutions and the depressing feminist 30s novels set in coastal towns. If you want to yell Yule, have you considered a chestnut? I know they’re a bugger to peel, but you’re the Colonel, I believe in you. Having said all that, if you remove the stuffing, this leaves you with a classic tower burger with a cranberry twist, and to refer you back to the Wagamama katsu, that’s exactly where you want to be: in the spirit. An excellent burger. They also do a festive bucket, in which the chief festivity is that it’s massive. Full marks.Festive rating: 3.5/5The Total Sleigh Burger, Nando’s, £10.95View image in fullscreen‘Vandalised by two bubble and squeak croquettes’ … Nando’s Total Sleigh Burger.Photograph: Nando’sIt’s very hard to figure out what went on in this development kitchen, unless there were two separate departments, one to do the burger, the other to do the seasonal wordplay – and hats off, you guys, this is fun to say out loud while punching the air. But that’s where Christmas ends. Maybe it’s unfair to single out Nando’s, as you could say the same for almost everyone, but chicken joints are pretty much anti-Christmas. Any other non-turkey joint, you could say, “Oh, we’re doing beef this year,” and people would reply, “How interesting and unusual,” but if you said “We’re doing a chicken,” it would sound as though you’d forgotten until half an hour ago that Jesus was born at all. What would taste like a perfectly serviceable burger with a really nice hot churrasco mayonnaise is vandalised by two bubble and squeak croquettes, in which the sage is overpronounced and the symbolism completely opaque. At a pinch, you could say it had a Boxing Day theme, but realistically, when did you ever associate bubble and squeak with anything, except your dad when he had a hangover?Festive rating: 1/5Festive Dozen, Krispy Kreme, £21.99View image in fullscreen‘Early caveman wreath’ … Krispy Kreme Christmas doughnuts.Photograph: Krispy KremeKrispy Kreme spoils us with their seasonal commitment, since they also launched Quality Street spin-offs last month, in which the caramel swirl was so sweet it made your ears ring (a real thing that happens) and the purple one was actually pretty successful. This festive dozen is more generic Christmas signifiers: a snowman, a Santa tummy, a Christmas tree in which the trunk is a tiny Flake, a classic ring doughnut with a chocolate topping that I guess is some early caveman wreath. You cannot critique them at the level of the filling, since indeterminate buttercream and cream cheese are evergreen. You really have to just look at them as an ensemble and, yup, that’s Christmas alright.Festive rating: 5/5Explore more on these topicsFast foodTaste testChristmasFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But my mother-in-law and her friend created the most delicious feast: a South Africanbraai(barbecue) followed by an incredible ice-cream Christmas pudding made by mashing vanilla ice-cream with a mix of tutti frutti, candied peel, raisins and cherries. This semifreddo is a take on that dessert: a light frozen custard that still carries all the festive flavours.Tutti frutti semifreddo Christmas puddingWe stopped using clingfilm in our kitchen 15 years ago now, because it’s not easily recycled and because of health concerns about the possible transfer ofmicroplastics into our food. Most semifreddo recipes tell you to line the freezer container with clingfilm, but I suggest using no liner at all, or silicone-free, unbleached baking paper instead.If, like me, you don’t love traditional Christmas pudding, then this ice-cream alternative might be just the ticket. It’s easy to make in advance, a little decadent and delivers festive cheer.Anna Jonesis one of the best food writers of our generation – her recipes are wholesome, adventurous and always easy to cook – and this recipe is adapted fromher original, but tweaked to incorporate the flavours of Christmas pudding. I like how she skips the usual ribboning process, when you’d normally whisk the yolks and sugar over a bain-marie, simply by adding creme fraiche or mascarpone. I’ve slightly increased the amount of creme fraiche to use up a whole pot and made the ingredients flexible, so you can use up whatever nuts, candied peel or spices you have in your cupboard.Serves8200g mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit(eg, glacé cherries, raisins or chopped apricots); even a few crushed biscuits are tastyFinely grated zest and juice of ¼ lemon or orange2 tbsp brandy, whisky, rum or marsala1 tsp ground mixed spices(eg, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom or allspice)3 large eggs, separated120g icing sugar300ml double cream200g creme fraiche, or 200ml extra double cream100g mixed nuts(eg, almonds, pistachios or hazelnuts), roughly chopped, plus extra to finish50g dark chocolate, finely chopped (optional), plus extra to finishLine a large pudding basin or loaf tin with baking paper. In a small bowl, macerate the mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit with the citrus zest and juice, the alcohol and your chosen spices.Separate the eggs into two clean bowls. Whisk the whites until firm. To the yolks, add the icing sugar, whisk until thick and pale, then beat in the macerated fruit.In another bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks, then whisk in the creme fraiche (or more double cream) until just combined. Gently fold this through the egg yolk mixture, then gently fold in the egg whites – use a large metal spoon to keep the mix airy. Finally, stir in the roughly chopped mixed nuts and finely chopped dark chocolate, if using.Spoon into the lined basin, cover with a plate or baking paper, and freeze for at least six hours or overnight. For the best results, move the semifreddo to the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to serve. Turn out on to a plate, top with extra nuts and grated chocolate, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWaste notFoodFood wasteChristmasIce-cream and sorbetFruitNuts and seedsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At that restaurant, and many others in the region, they specialise in 40-yolktajarin(tagliolini), for which a kilo of flour is mixed withthose yolks for the dough. This makes very rich pasta (particularly good with white truffles) – and a lot of leftover egg whites. Therefore, the thin, delicate and ethereal onion frittata they serve as an appetiser is made predominantly with egg whites, and a very different beast from the rich, thick omelettes I had known until this point – in fact, not a beast at all, but dainty, homely and elegant all in one go.Prep10 minCook25 minServes2 as a starter,or6 to nibble on2 medium artichokes, cleaned, trimmed, tough leaves pared, chokes removed, or ½ small head of radicchio, or 2 celery sticks4 egg whites2 whole eggs20g gratedparmesan35g butterSalt and black pepper1tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, or any vegetable oilSlice the artichoke or radicchio extremely thinly lengthways (about 1-2mm thick); if you’re using celery, slice it across or on the bias.

Saute for three minutes, until tender but with a little bite, then add the beaten egg mixture, distributing it evenly; use the back of a spoon to fill in any gaps. Fry for four minutes, or until the egg is almost set.Grease a plate with the oil and turn out the omelette on to it. Add the last 10g butter to the frying pan and, when it foams, slide the omelette back in and fry for two to three minutes more, until delicately coloured.

But I kept bursting into tears in public. At a Quaker meeting, it was as if someone had turned down the volume of the worldRobin CraigWed 3 Dec 2025 01.55 ESTShareIt was 2022, and my dad had just died from a rare blood disease. In the aftermath, I quit my PhD and moved back to London from Brighton. I coped by keeping incredibly busy. I regularly informed friends “I’m fine, actually”,as I threw myself into a new job in communications, went clubbing every weekend, picked up a side hustle selling secondhand clothes and got suspiciously invested in my gym routine. If I could just keep busy, I thought, perhaps I could drown out the growing tidal wave of grief.And it worked, until it just didn’t any more. I began to burst into tears randomly – during a work meeting, at the gym, on my commute – and everyone around me would politely pretend they didn’t notice the 28-year-old man weeping on the tube at 8.30am. I tried to push through it, but my ability to keep up with my own life was faltering, and all of it – the clubs, the job, the gym – suddenly felt unbearably loud and overwhelming.Amid the chaos, I began to take walks during my lunch breaks, to decompress. It was while I was strolling down Euston Road in London that I stumbled on Friends House, the central meeting house of British Quakers. I barely knew anything about the Quakers, and had a suspicion of religion after leaving the Anglicanism I was raised with, but I began to visit the garden regularly to unwind. One day I noticed the words “truth”, “simplicity”, “equality”, and “peace” engraved on the footpath. I became curious about who the Quakers were and what they believed.After weeks of sitting in the garden, I nervously ventured inside the meeting house where I found a bustling coffee shop and, next to it, a shop full of books on social justice, pacifism and faith. I furtively picked up a copy of Advices and Queries, a small booklet that acts as a kind of mini-guide for practising Quakers.I learned that Quakers meet to worship in silence, sitting in a circle until someone is deeply moved to speak, and that while Quakerism is founded onChristianity, many Quakers are secular.The booklet also said that Quakers should “Seek to know an inward stillness, even amid the activities of daily life”. Somewhere inside me I felt a deep yearning. I’d been so busy trying to stem the flood of grief, I wasn’t sure if I had felt any inward stillness at all in the months since my dad had died.I went to my first meeting that Sunday. I slunk into Friends House and, after being greeted by a cheerful Quaker representative, took a chair at the back of the meeting room. People gradually filtered in until there were about 30 of us and, after everyone had settled, silence descended upon the room.I quickly realised that I was about to spend an hour alone with my thoughts after months spent running away from them, and almost bolted out of the door in panic. But I took a second and looked around at what the experienced Quakers were doing. Some people were sitting with their eyes closed, so I copied them and shut my eyes, letting myself sink into the silence.It was as if someone had turned down the volume of the world, and all that remained was my feelings, sitting raw and open like a wound. Rather than running, I sat for an hour and let them wash over me. I left with a fresher perspective and spent the rest of the day in a calm daze. For the first time in a while, I felt anchored to something greater than myself.View image in fullscreenRobin and his father hold hands.Photograph: Courtesy of Robin CraigI began to attend Quaker meetings regularly, sometimes at different meeting houses across London. Each time I went, I found the silence anew and let myself sink into it a little further. I learned more about Quaker beliefs in pacifism, equality, and protecting the environment, and met Quakers from all walks of life. Some had even taken political action based on their faith, attending anti-apartheid protests and fighting for equal marriage. Most believed in God, but others were agnostic, and while the majority were older than me, I never felt out of place or patronised.Eventually, I started to have faith, too. I began to listen for the Holy Spirit in my day-to-day life and, as time went on, I began to question why I was keeping myself busy all the time. Gradually, I began to face the feelings I’d been running from.I found the tsunami of grief began to slow into waves, then gentle ripples. Attending Quaker meetings hasn’t made me perfect, but I believe I am kinder and more patient as a result. I try to slow down more and rush less – and I take much better care of myself. I rarely burst into tears on the tube any more.I also have a newfound appreciation for moments of calm. I’m more aware of the clarity that stillness can bring, and I’m grateful that I found the Quakers when I needed them most. I sometimes say that I have a quiet faith – not because it’s timid, but because it was found in the silence.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our waiter carefully ladles the sugary, egg-yolk elixir,zabaglione,into two bowls for dunking warmpansaroledoughnuts. Our conversation stops, a silent competition to nab the last one. We are literally livingla dolce vita.This dessert is a tradition in Apricale, a fairytale-like village in Liguria, Italy’s crescent-shaped region that hugs the Mediterranean. It’s a far cry from crowded Cinque Terre and posh Portofino to the east. This western edge, on France’s south-eastern border, feels more authentic and calmer in the winter, with more local people than tourists. Unburdened from competing with others for reservations, you are free to live in the present. Let spontaneity be your guide – or, in my family’s case, our appetites.Map for western Liguria, ItalyI came to Liguria with my twin, her husband, and their 11- and 14-year-old kids, inspired by my sister’s studies in Italy and our shared passion for the country’s comforting, kid-friendly cuisine. Our road trip meandered from the coastal Riviera dei Fiori to a constellation of medieval hilltop villages. In just 30 sq miles, we journeyed back in time.My Sicilian ex had introduced me to Liguria one January. Though it rained, the Maritime and Ligurian Alps block the wind, creating a microclimate with relatively mild temperatures that average 13C. My family’s December trip was bathed in the most sublime winter light, apt for alfresco meals.Heading east from Nice, the motorway is punctuated by a series of hair-raising turns and tunnels. Our first stop was a 45-minute drive away, just over the French border. Ventimiglia is divided into two parts: the bustling new town and the historical upper town,cittàalta, suspended between sea and sky. OnÜ Funtanin’ssun-soaked terrace, we tucked into fried calamari paired with Mediterranean views. The kids made like pirates in front of a statue of the Black Corsair, the star ofEmilio Salgari’s famous swashbuckling novel.View image in fullscreenThe Ponte Vecchio in Dolceacqua, painted by Claude Monet, with Castello dei Doria behind.Photograph: Stevan ZZ/AlamyWe entered the winding maze of the old town via the medieval Porta Nizza arch. Laundry hung from pastel facades, their beautiful patina born from centuries of wear. Two churches on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi have intriguing features: the hyperrealisticCristo Morto(dead Christ) statue at Oratorio dei Neri and the baptistery basin at the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta.Back in the car, we drove 20 minutes north to the riverside village of Dolceacqua. An impromptu search for “hotels with bathtubs” led us toTalking Stones(doubles from €67.50). Set in the 19th-century Borgo district, its cosy stone rooms are juxtaposed by modern whirlpool baths. The medieval Terra quarter sits across the Nervia river via the picturesquePonte Vecchiothat Claude Monet captured in paintings, as witnessed by his wooden cut-out next to the river.On Via Castello, my niece and nephew felt “hugged by the stone buildings” that leaned towards each other. We climbed the narrow Liguriancaruggi(alleyways) to theCastello dei Doria. Named for the prominent family of the 12th-17th centuries, Dolceacqua’s grand dame is now an open-air vestige of soaring arches, a history lesson that is ideal for hide and seek.We entered the winding maze of the old town where laundry hung from pastel facades, their beautiful patina born from centuries of wearBack in town for aperitivo atRe Maggiore, every drink came with a free plate of bites – “How it should be,” said my brother-in-law. Our waiter atLa Pasta di Üassured us: “Everything is amazing. If you don’t like it, I’ll eat it.” We tucked into local specialties,trofie(short, thin, twisted) pasta with pesto, potatoes and green beans, andbarbajuan(chard and ricotta-stuffed fritters). All paired with Rossese di Dolceacqua, an earthy red wine that’s rarely exported due to the steep, terraced vineyard’s small production.The next day, we motored 15 minutes north-east to one of “the most beautiful villages in Italy”, Apricale. The red-roofed village clings to green hills, seemingly defying gravity. Known as an artists’ town, Apricale’s labyrinthine alleys are lined with murals. We got a private showing, with stray cats the only sign of life on the empty streets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As did the similarly stone-arched dining room at the nearbyda Bacìristorante, where we half expected the waiter to slice our meat with a sword. The home to the aforementioned egg-yolk dessert serves heartyconiglio(local rabbit) and pork stew with polenta andfarinata(crispy chickpea fritters). En route back to the hotel, we popped into Perinaldo, another picture-postcard village, for a digestivepasseggiata– the traditional Italian leisurely evening stroll.View image in fullscreenA mural in the picturesque streets of artists’ town Apricale.Photograph: Travelbild Italy/AlamyBack on the coast, Sanremo felt like a bustling metropolis compared with the hilltop hamlets. The city of 53,000 became a tourism hotspot in the 19th century, when elite Europeans, particularly Britons, decamped to the Mediterranean for its curative winter climate. Ornate belle epoque hotels, casinos and villas (including the must-seeAlfred Nobel’s former home) are testaments to this era, their faded splendour like a starlet in her twilight years.The city’s Mercato Annonario was laden with gargantuan parmesan wheels, cured meats, and Liguria’s renowned Taggiasca olive oil. After a snack stop atCantine Sanremesiforsardenaira(a tomato, olive and anchovy focaccia) we windowshopped along the main drag, Via Giacomo Matteotti. Later, the Pista Ciclabile, a 15-mile (24km)coastal bike pathon former train tracks, was a highlight. Atop rented ebikes fromNoloBici, we whizzed through tunnels and past the turquoise sea.About 5 miles away in Arma di Taggia, atOsteria 1808we feasted on housemade 30-egg-yolktagliolinipasta, fresh-caught langoustines and fried anchovies, served with professional gusto by the owner, Francesco. He sold us bottles of Taggiasca olive oil to take home. It was the first time the future had crossed our minds. For Liguria is a place to live firmly in the moment.Explore more on these topicsItaly holidaysGenoa holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysCultural tripsRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The US author, tech entrepreneur and podcaster explains his theories on dating, crying – and the rise of Donald TrumpWed 3 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareIt takes balls to title your book Notes on Being a Man. And, superficially, Scott Galloway could easily be lumped in with a dozen other manosphere-friendly alpha-bros promising to teach young men how to find their inner wolf. He is, after all, a wealthy, healthy, white, heterosexual, shaven-headed, 61-year-old Californian who made his name and fortune as a successful investor and podcaster.But in reality, he is almost the opposite: liberal, left-leaning and surprisingly sensitive. The guy who advises his readers on “how to address the masculinity crisis, build mental strength and raise good sons” has been described as a “progressive Jordan Peterson”, or “Gordon Gekko with a social conscience”.Galloway is also sufficiently self-aware not to claim he has all the answers. “I don’t think it would be well received for me to say, ‘This is how you become a man,’” he says, speaking from his London home. “What I’m trying to say is, this is where I’ve had some success, and mostly where I screwed up trying to become a man.”He moved to the UK from Florida three years ago, partly because he and his wife thought it was a better place to raise their two sons, who are now 15 and 18. “Great culture, interesting people, the proximity of the continent is amazing, and the Premier League is just fantastic – there’s nothing like it.” Also: “If you’re talking about assault rifles or bodily autonomy, it’s not even a discussion here.” He still finds the weather challenging, though.There’s a studio in the basement where Galloway records hispopular podcasts: Prof G Pod (business and life wisdom – and he really is a professor, of marketing, at New York University); Raging Moderates (with the liberal Fox News host Jessica Tarlov); and most popular of all,Pivot, with tech journalistKara Swisher. The two of them are good company, comparing their jetset lifestyles, commenting on tech, politics and current affairs, their easy banter peppered with Galloway’s wilfully crude jokes. “We can rib each other,” he says, “because that’s a form of equality and affection.”View image in fullscreen‘Raging Moderates’ Scott Galloway and Jessica Tarlov in New York in April.Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty ImagesWhen Galloway first started talking about masculinity, he says, people weren’t prepared to listen. “It was like, here’s more misogyny, here’s more men blaming women – the gag reflex was so strong.” This was about four years ago, but all that has now changed. When Notes On Being a Man was released in early November, it raced to the top of the New York Times advice books bestseller list and Galloway has been in demand in the media ever since, giving his take on what’s wrong with men, and what to do about it.Galloway has plenty of statistics to back up his claim that young men reallyarein trouble. Drawing on research by writers such asRichard Reeves(author of 2022’s Of Boys and Men) and his NYU colleagueJonathan Haidt(whose recent book The Anxious Generation sounded the alarm on social media), he sketches out a landscape of rising rates of everything from boys’ school suspensions to male unemployment, addictions, loneliness, and failure to complete college. “We’re going to graduate probably two women for every one man from college in the next five years, because men drop out at a greater rate.”Galloway suggests that the previous denial of the problem, especially by the political left, might even have put Donald Trump back in the White House. “Let me offer that the reason we elected [him] is because of struggling with men.” Two groups that pivoted hardest towards Trump in 2024, he says, were young men, and women aged 45 to 64, and “my thesis is that’s the mothers of young men.” While Trump embraced the manosphere, the Democrats championed the interests of virtually every special interest groupexceptyoung men, he argues.In his book, Galloway’s solutions to men’s problems often boil down to a set of pithy codes and maxims, some of which feel like sound common sense, while others might feel rather old-fashioned. One of his oft-repeated tenets, for example, is that “men protect, provide, and procreate”. You could easily say the same of women. Also, Galloway tends to see the “protect” element in the context of men using their physical strength for good – “real men don’t start bar fights; they break them up” – even if a lot of the time, the thing people need protectionfrom, especially women, is other men.And the “provide” element he couches largely in economic terms. “I tell my sons, when you’re in the company of women, you pay for everything. And if you can’t, you don’t go out … A woman is not going to have sex with a man who splits the bill with her.” Signalling resource is one of the three things women find most attractive, according to another of his maxims, along with kindness and intellect. He admits his sons tell him this is a boomer view of modern dating, but “I try to go where the data takes me,” he says. “Research shows that society, and men themselves, are really hard on men when they’re not economically viable.”A woman is not going to have sex with a man who splits the bill with herAnd if men aren’t economically viable, that’s when the problems start, he contends. “They’re just going to have an absence of mating opportunities. And when men don’t have a romantic relationship, they tend to kind of come off the tracks.” He cites statistics that women fare much better without men than vice versa. “Men have a difficult time maintaining friendships without a romantic partner. They tend to reallocate that energy into conspiracy theory, going extremely online, porn – and they never develop the skills to establish a romantic relationship.” Galloway has been highly vocal about the tech industry and social media’s role in compounding these problems, by giving men easy dopamine hits and fewer reasons to ever leave their bedrooms. As he puts it, “I worry we are literally evolving a new breed of asexual, asocial male.”Galloway’s analysis can become somewhat Darwinian and reductive – a little bit, “men are this and women are this”, as if there’s a one-size-fits-all set of solutions to these problems – coloured by nostalgia for a bygone patriarchal order. Nuances of race or sexuality are barely addressed, as Galloway readily admits: “People say, well, what’s the masculinity code for gay men? And the honest answer is, I have no fucking idea. I’m not even gonna take a swing at it.”But isn’t it also a bit … Jordan Peterson? Peterson proposed his own cure for “the masculinity crisis” in his bestselling2018 book 12 Rules for Life, whichreceived as much ridicule as it did praise– rule number one was “stand up straight with your shoulders back”. And we’ve had plenty of masculine self-help books in this mould since. Galloway has a surprising respect for Peterson, not least for broaching this subject before it became fashionable. “Where we differ is that I find that Jordan basically uses his incredible skills of communication and knowledge of psychology to always reverse-engineer into an incredibly conservative viewpoint that sometimes, in my view, takes women’s rights away. That it basically goes back to this notion of ‘women are happiest when they’re in a supporting role to men’. I just don’t think that’s accurate.”View image in fullscreenGalloway in his podcasting studio: ‘I’m not saying that women need to lower their standards. I think men need to level up.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianGalloway is at pains to point out that he’s not blaming women for men’s problems. “I do not think the answer is to in any way economically disadvantage women,” he says. “I’m not trying to repackage violence here and say that women need to lower their standards such that we don’t have a bunch of angry men out there. I think men need to level up. And I think, as a society, we need to implement more programmes to level up all young people.”Given all this, you wonder why he chose to focus just on men. Beyond his book – in hisTED Talk last year, for example – Galloway has persuasively argued that the real problems facingallof society, especially in the US, are the transfer of wealth and power from the young to the old, and the commercialisation of politics, healthcare and higher education. When it comes down to it, he says, “this is a battle between liberal and illiberal, it’s not a battle between men and women. The genders have done a great job convincing themselves it’s the other gender’s fault. I just don’t think that’s productive.”Where Peterson and his ilk seek to trace men’s problems back to the erosion of conservative values, Galloway does some reverse-engineering of his own: back to a place of economic, romantic and especially family security. If there’s a moment “when a boy comes off the tracks and develops problems later in life”, he says, “it’s the moment he loses a male role model through death, divorce or abandonment”. The thesis is more personal than his data-driven approach suggests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Galloway was nine, his father walked out and moved in with another woman, leaving his impoverished mother to bring him up alone. Not exactly a role model, then, buthisfather, Galloway’s grandfather, was even worse, he says – an angry alcoholic. “When my dad was a very young boy, his father used to come home and wake him and beat him.” It’s a low bar, Galloway admits, but at least his own father was an improvement.Their relationship taught him a lot, he says. One of his biggest breakthroughs was when he realised that he kept a score card around relationships, starting with his dad. Like, “Why am I being such a good son when he wasn’t that good a father?” He says he became much happier when he put the score card away and just focused on being the sonhewanted to be – and the husband, partner, friend, co-worker he wanted to be, on his own terms. It’s made him happier and his relationships better, he says. His father died earlier this year. “My dad softened as he got older, and we had a wonderful relationship the last 20, 30 years of his life.”When Galloway tells his origin story, he does not paint himself as an exceptional talent. He was unremarkable academically and physically, better at scoring weed than picking up women, it seems. He puts his success as much down to luck and structural advantages: good schooling in a prosperous state in a prosperous country, not being subject to racial or gender discrimination, a loving mother, scraping into a good university (the University of California, Los Angeles). “The truth is, I was born on third base.” But having grown up relatively poor, economic security was always his motivation. “I took a very much like, ‘How do you win capitalism?’ approach.”View image in fullscreenPivot Live with Kara Swisher in Austin, Texas earlier this year.Photograph: Chris Saucedo/SXSW Conference & Festivals/Getty ImagesHe was also fortunate to hit his stride as an entrepreneur just as the dotcom boom was beginning, and founded some successful (and some unsuccessful) companies in emerging fields such as e-commerce and digital market research. In 2017 he sold his business intelligence firm L2 for $155m (he estimates his own net worth at about $150m (£117m)).Now Galloway divides his time equally between writing, investing and media, including his podcasting network. He is happy in London, but is planning to return to the US next year “to make America America again”. In preparation for the 2026 and ’28 elections, he wants to help build an informal, Democrat-friendly podcast network, and is already working with several Democratic candidates. “People hear all these celebrities talking about how they’re going to leave America. I actually think, when your country isn’t doing well, that’s when you’re supposed to go home.”Whether or not a crisis among men led to the current regime, the men now in power are definitely not the manly paragons Galloway has in mind. “I would argue that what Trump and guys like Elon Musk are doing could not be moreanti-masculine,” he says. “They have conflated, or tried to conflate, masculinity with coarseness and cruelty. And it’s not only incorrect, it’s a terrible role model for young men.”Who are Galloway’s role models? The first two he offers are Muhammad Ali and, more surprisingly, Margaret Thatcher. “I don’t know if it’s fair to call her masculine, but I think that kind of strength …” He’s also an admirer of Keanu Reeves, who “gives a lot of his exceptional compensation to other actors, is super kind, donates time, very humble”.Is Galloway a good role model? He’s not so sure. “People say, ‘Oh, your kids are so lucky to have you,’ and I get self conscious because there are so many weekends where I’m so wrapped up in my own shit and not spending enough time or attention with my kids. I’m not present enough. So I have huge impostor syndrome around this.”We live in a modern society where people are not going to kill you because you cry, and it just feels really goodFor all his life lessons, Galloway is not afraid to admit his own fallibility and vulnerability. When his father died earlier this year, for example, he spoke movingly about it and wept on his Pivot show. Crying is good for men, he argues. “For the last 3,000 years, we’ve been taught if you demonstrate weakness – and a way to demonstrate weakness is crying – that some other dude might take your shit, fuck your wife and eat your children. And so men have been taught to not express that weakness. And the good news is, we live in a modern society where people are not going to kill you because you cry, and it just feels really good.”He didn’t cry between the ages of 29 and 44, he says. Now “I don’t have anything that [holds] me back from crying. And it’s not an attempt to demonstrate my femininity, it’s just an attempt to slow time down.”Despite his rigorous fitness regime, his access to luxury experiences and cutting-edge healthcare (including regular testosterone injections), and his embrace of a certain amount of hedonism (he likes his cannabis edibles, he happily declares), Galloway is starting to feel his age.“When you hit about your late 50s, years turn into seasons, seasons turn into months, months into weeks, and it’s like, ‘Fucking A, the end is barrelling towards us.’ And one of the tricks I found for slowing it down is if you find something that inspires you and really moves you, stop and feel it, and touch it. I walked in Regent’s Park yesterday, and there’s this rose garden there I’d never seen. I’m not into roses, but I just thought, God, this is so cool. So I just stopped and thought, why do I find this interesting? Who does this? Why do they do it?”He gets emotional every other day now, he says, “in the context of watching Modern Family, or reading something that moves me, or hearing a friend talk about the struggles with their kids. And I’ve generally found that it informs your own emotions, it makes you feel closer to people, and that, for the most part, people are really receptive to it.” Especially other men. Rather than wanting to take his shit away, he says, “they’re like, Jesus, can I have some of that?”Maybe this openness to emotion is what really sets Galloway apart from his testosterone-fuelled peers. You can model the alpha-male lifestyle and dispense codes and maxims, but it still takes balls to admit it’s good for guys to cry.Notes on Being a Man by Scott Galloway (Simon & Schuster Ltd, £22).

The tide, it seems, is unstoppable. In July, the band the Velvet Underground went viral, amassing more than 1m Spotify streams very quickly – only to be revealed as an entirely AI confection. One week in November, three AI songs rode high in Spotify’s global viral charts, two from a fake country act, one, more worryingly, an anti-immigration song from Holland.This week, the record label of British pop star Jorja Smith hit out against an artist named Haven who, they claim, used AI to impersonate the singer on a viral track that rode high in Spotify’s global charts before being removed for alleged copyright infringement; only to be re-recorded with a human vocal, a version that debuted at No 37 on the UK Top 40.Would you listen to music composed entirely by AI?

These cases were compounded by the absence of any mechanism within either the UK or Kenyan justice systems to hold Batuk soldiers accountable for child support or other consequences of such misconduct.”The inquiry also “noted with deep concern” the killing of Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was found in a septic tank in the grounds of a hotel where she had been drinking with British soldiers in 2012.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua Wanjiku holding a picture of her sister Agnes Wanjiru, 20, whose body was found two months after she disappeared.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APThe report said: “It was submitted that the process of investigation has faced undue interference and obstruction, allegedly by Batuk personnel, which continues to hinder the delivery of justice.”A former British soldier has been arrested in relation to Wanjiru’s death and extradition proceedings have started. He denies the charge and has said he intends to contest the extradition.Among other allegations detailed in the 94-page document are that a man named Tilam Leresh was shot and killed by a Batuk officer while herding livestock, that local people had been injured by unexploded ordnance and a former G4S supervisor at Batuk alleged that military aircraft had deliberately frightened livestock, causing distress to farmers.“The committee received extensive evidence of environmental degradation caused by Batuk’s activities,” the report said.“Many witnesses expressed concern that Batuk’s military exercises have caused serious ecological damage in the training areas of Laikipia and Samburu, with corresponding harm to public health, livelihoods and conservation efforts.”The region is home to wildlife including elephants, big cats and rare species such as the Grévy’s zebra. “Loud explosions, heavy troop movements and occasional training-related bushfires have disrupted wildlife habitats and migration corridors, often driving animals into nearby farms and settlements,” the report said.The report also detailed an incident in 2021, when “during a military exercise at the conservancy, Batuk personnel were reported to have caused a fire that engulfed over 10,000 acres of land”.“The inferno led to substantial destruction of local flora and fauna, forced wildlife to flee the area and displaced residents of the surrounding Lolldaiga region, who were exposed to noxious fumes and intense heat carried by strong winds over the Lolldaiga Hills,” the report said.The inquiry made a number of recommendations, including the development of a visiting forces code of conduct to include zero tolerance of sexual violence, as well as setting out environmental obligations and social responsibility.It also recommended:The establishment of a survivor liaison unit to offer legal aid to victims of crimes linked to Batuk personnel.For the British and Kenyan governments to negotiate “mechanisms to hold Batuk soldiers accountable for child support”.The creation of a military-linked crimes taskforce to oversee investigation and prosecution of offences committed by foreign military personnel.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said on Wednesday: “We were grateful for the opportunity to submit evidence to Kenya’s National Assembly defence, intelligence and foreign relations committee’s inquiry into conduct at the British Army Training Unit Kenya and note the publishing of the inquiry report today.“We deeply regret the challenges which have arisen in relation to our defence presence in Kenya.“Our statement – offered in the spirit of cooperation to the committee – responded to the issues highlighted during the inquiry into Batuk and outlined the actions taken to address the concerns raised.“Where new allegations have come to light in the committee’s report, we stand ready to investigate those under our jurisdiction fully once evidence is provided.”Explore more on these topicsBritish armyKenyaMilitaryAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who has studiedSudan– its patterns of behaviour – knew genocide was a risk,” said the analyst, who produced frequent assessments for the FCDO, reports which can be disseminated throughout government departments.It amounted to “censoring”, they said, and was particularly disturbing as the UK is the UN security council’s “penholder” on Sudan,meaning it leads the council’s activities on the conflict.Q&AWhat is genocide?ShowAgreed by many as the gravest of all crimes against humanity, genocide is understood to refer to the mass extermination of a particular group of people, such as the attempts of the Nazis to eradicate the Jewish population in the 1940s.Conceived as a response to the Holocaust, theconvention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide– better known as the 1948 UN genocide convention – was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as an offence, defining it as an act committed with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.Behind this relatively simple definition lies a complex web of legal concepts concerning when and how the term can be applied.UN bodies have said they believe genocide to have occurred inSrebrenicain 1995, inRwandain 1994, inMyanmarin 2019, and inGazain 2025. Judgments of the international court of justice are awaited on all.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Meanwhile, a former FCDO official linked to the department’s atrocity prevention team told the Guardian that they also believed the suppression of the risk of genocide in Sudan was to protect the UAE from scrutiny.Difficulties raising atrocity concerns over Darfur, they said, were comparable to problems they experienced flagging human rights concerns relating to conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC).They likened the way in which the UK maintainedclose relations with Rwanda– despite Kigali’s military support for the M23 militia in eastern Congo – with how the UK has stayed close to the UAE despite its backing for the RSF (which the Gulf state denies).View image in fullscreenSudanese civilians at a camp in Tawila after fleeing El Fasher when the RSF attacked the western Darfur city and massacred hundreds of people.Photograph: Mohammed Abaker/APDRC atrocity assessments were “dropped for political reasons”, the former official claimed, adding: “That pattern of behaviour looks to have been repeated for Sudan.”However, the FCDO said a formal determination of genocide was never a political consideration.A spokesperson said: “The UK does not make formal determinations of genocide on the basis of politics.“It does so based on the judgment of a competent court, after consideration of all the evidence available in the context of a credible judicial process, and there is currently no such judgment in the context of Sudan.”Shortly after the April 2023 report warning of genocide was finalised for the FCDO, ethnic violence was already sweeping through Darfur. This vast western region is where the Janjaweed, the predominantly Arab militia that was the forerunner of the RSF,perpetrated a genocideestimated to have killed 300,000 Sudanese two decades ago.Two months after the allegedly censored document,possible genocidewas committed by the RSF in the Darfuri city of El Geneina. The UN estimates about 15,000 people from non-Arab and ethnic African communities were killed.The analyst alleged that even after the atrocities in El Geneina, the word genocide was prohibited from their risk assessments.View image in fullscreenChildren’s drawings on a wall in El Geneina of violence they had witnessed during the RSF attacks on the city in Darfur.Photograph: Karl Schembri/Norwegian Refugee CouncilEl Fasher, another regional capital in Darfur, was seized by the RSF last month, promptingsystematic mass killingsthat experts have likened to the opening days of the genocide in Rwanda.With the city sealed off and in effect a massive crime scene, intelligence suggests the RSF has spent weeks disposing of evidence, with experts detecting mass graves and possiblybodies being burned. Tens of thousands of the city’s residents are still missing.Days after Sudan’s war began on 15 April 2023, analysts submitted an assessment to FCDO officials outlining possible crisis scenarios that could also be passed to the UN’s early-warning systems, British intelligence or “Cobra” meetings, where senior ministers convene to coordinate the emergency response to a disaster.A Sudanese massacre foretold: the grim familiarity of the RSF’s rampage through El FasherRead moreThe analyst said that instead of being allowed to warn of the “risk of genocide in Darfur”, they had to state instead that there was a danger thatDarfurmight return to conflicts previously witnessed in the region.“I didn’t understand the head-in-the-sand attitude – the need to find more amenable language to an obvious risk,” they added.The final report has been seen by the Guardian but specific details are not being reported to protect the identity of authors.View image in fullscreenA burned village in North Darfur, 2011.Photograph: Jérome TubianaAbdallah Abu Garda, chair of the UK-based Darfur Diaspora Association, said the news raised “extremely grave” issues.“Our concern is that Foreign Office officials appear to have deliberately downplayed the risk of genocide precisely as Sudan was descending into one of the worst episodes of mass atrocities in recent memory,” he said.For years before war erupted, experts had issued warnings of the rising risks of mass atrocities in Sudan.In 2022 theUK Civil Society Atrocity Prevention Working Group, an umbrella organisation of human rights groups, wrote to ministers with concerns “that the UK’s systems, capabilities and policies towards Sudan still lack a focus on atrocity prevention, grievance and political marginalisation”.These warnings were repeated in June 2023, as atrocities were committed in El Geneina. Expertswarned MPson the foreign affairs select committee of continuing risks of atrocities across Sudan and that the FCDO’s Sudan team was ill-equipped to respond.View image in fullscreenThousands of civilians fled the RSF’s attack on Zamzam camp in April, when at least 1,500 people may have been massacred.Photograph: North Darfur Observatory For Human RightsKate Ferguson, a foreign policy expert on mass violence, and co-executive director ofProtection Approaches, told MPs that she believed even “when those warnings are being raised, whether in West Darfur or in Khartoum, [the FCDO] don’t have a system by which those warnings can be easily, rapidly and urgently raised to the ministerial office”.Approached for comment on what she felt had changed since 2023, Ferguson said: “It is difficult to see how our years of raising alarm of genocide returning to Darfur, and of warning the FCDO they needed to prioritise atrocity prevention, has translated into clear UK policy to prevent or protect – even now, with tens of thousands missing from El Fasher, facing unthinkable peril or [who] are already dead.”“Halting genocide is not easy but it is possible,” she added. “That’s why it is essential our foreign secretary and prime minister have full confidence in the analysis of atrocity violence they receive and that prevention options passed up for decision-making match ministerial ambitions and obligations to protect civilians in Sudan.“The RSF’s assault on black and Indigenous civilians will continue – our government’s expertise and systems must be fit for the urgent purpose of averting further catastrophe in [nearby]Tawila displacement campand across Sudan.”Meanwhile, the former FCDO expert within theOffice for Conflict, Stabilisation and Mediation, revealed that raising atrocity concerns over Darfur was similar to problems they had experienced relating to the Congo.“We were persistently warning about atrocity risks in DRC, but this was the time of the government’sRwanda policy[the UK’s proposed scheme to send asylum seekers to Kigali] and they didn’t want to know because it would go against British interests.“It felt we were getting into very similar territory on Sudan. You need to consider the [United Arab] Emirates to explain why people were struggling with how to talk about Sudan.View image in fullscreenPeople pray in Tawila cemetery, where dozens of victims of RSF attacks have been buried. The fresh graves, pictured in October 2024, are those of children who died of malnutrition.Photograph: Jérome Tubiana“What I can say is that from the outset of the war, evidence started to come in about Emirati involvement, progressively more and more,” said the former FCDO official.The UAE has repeatedly denied providing arms to the RSF.At the same time, the former official added, the FCDO was amassing evidence that genocide was likely to unfold again in Darfur.‘They slaughtered us like animals’: the inside story of how one of the biggest atrocities of the Sudan war unfolded in ZamzamRead moreThey said that a system for tracking the Sudan conflict was monitoring RSF recruits who had expressed ambitions to eradicate ethnic Africans from Darfur. “People were expressing genocidal intent,” they said.Although the US formally declared in January thatgenocide had been committedin Sudan by members of the RSF, the UK has not followed suit.The UK has said the determination of genocide was anissue for competent courtsto decide, but it would act to prevent atrocities.However, the former FCDO expert said this did not explain why genocide was removed from the early-warning report.“In this scenario, its use is totally acceptable because you’re portraying a worst-case scenario that would be difficult to describe without saying the word,” they added.An FCDO source said the UK was committed to upholding its obligations under the UN genocide convention and strongly advocated for accountability for all breaches of international law.View image in fullscreenWomen and children hide under a tree during an RSF drone bombing on Um Baru village, 29 October 2025.Photograph: Jérome TubianaThey added that the UK supported the work of theUN Fact-Finding Missionand the international criminal court and was funding a project to document and verify attacks on civilians.Abu Garda added: “Britain’s failure to properly assess and recognise ongoing atrocities has fostered impunity and contributed directly to further genocidal campaigns in El Geneina,in Zamzam camp, and now in El Fasher.“The British government must uphold its moral and legal responsibilities and act decisively to prevent genocide rather than minimise or obscure it for political or economic convenience.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Timesreportedthat Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. The videos appear to be a walk-through of the property.1:37US Democrats release footage of Epstein's private island – videoThe materials released on Wednesday were from law enforcement authorities in the US Virgin Islands. They were taken in 2020, the year after Epstein died by suicide in jail.Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, including Little St James, which some locals told the New York Times they had nicknamed“pedophile island”. In 2022, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islandsreached a settlementfor more than $100m with Epstein’s estate afterthey alleged“dozens of young women and children were trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive in the Virgin Islands at Epstein’s secluded private island, Little St James.”View image in fullscreenA newly released photo by House Democrats of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.Photograph: House committee on oversight and government reformEven though the images and videos released on Wednesday do not reveal anything new, they appear to be an effort from Congress to keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release the files.

Trump alsowarned that any country producing narcotics was a potential target, singling out Colombia, which has long been a close ally in Washington’s “war on drugs”.Shortly afterwards, Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, hit back in a social media post, saying: “To threaten our sovereignty is to declare war; do not damage two centuries of diplomatic relations.”Trump move to pardon Honduras’s ex-president shows counter-drug effort is ‘based on lies and hypocrisy’Read morePetro also invited Trump to visit Colombia – the world’s largest producer of cocaine – to see his government’s efforts to destroy drug-producing labs. “Come with me, and I’ll show you how they are destroyed, one lab every 40 minutes,” he wrote.Since August, the Trump administration has escalated tensions in Latin America to levels unseen since the 1989 invasion of Panama, under the pretext of anti-narcotics operations. The Pentagon has deployed a sizable naval force with nearly 15,000 troops on Venezuela’s doorstep in theCaribbeanand killing more than 80 people in strikes on small boats alleged to be carrying drugs.“We’re going to start doing those strikes on land, too,” said Trump on Tuesday.“You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live, and we’re going to start that very soon too.When asked whether the efforts would be limited toVenezuela, the US president said they would not.“I hear Colombia, the country of Colombia, is making cocaine. They have cocaine manufacturing plants, OK? And then they sell us their cocaine. We appreciate that very much. But yeah, anybody that’s doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,” he said.Longtime allies in the “war on drugs”, the US and Colombia have found their relationship fractured almost from the moment Trump took office for his second term.Their first clash came as early as January, when Petro – a former guerrilla and Colombia’s first leftwing president – refused entry to American planes carrying deported Colombians, insisting that they be treated with dignity.He laterreversed that decision, but relations further deteriorated in September, when, after attending the United Nations general assembly, Petro joined a pro-Palestine protest in New York and urged US soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders to “attack humanity”. He has also been a fierce critic of the airstrikes on the alleged drug boats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has since accused Petro, without providing evidence, of being an “illegal drug trafficker” and of fostering massive narcotics production, turning it into “Colombia’s main business”.Trump’s threat to Colombia came just hours after a former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking and corruption walked free from a US prison after receiving a pardon from Trump.Juan Orlando Hernández had been sentenced to 45 years for allegedly creating “a cocaine superhighway” to the US. During his time in office, Honduras became a major transit point for South American cocaine heading north and alsoa cocaine-producing hub.Speaking at the cabinet meeting, Trump described the investigation into Hernández – which had started before his own first term in office – as a “Biden horrible witch-hunt”.“If you have some drug dealers in your country and you’re the president, you don’t necessarily put the president in jail for 45 years,” he said.Explore more on these topicsColombiaUS militaryDonald TrumpDrugsUS foreign policyVenezuelaCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

That is not the case now, and it is not what is proposed in the plan [ReSourceEU] but this is a wake up call, a strong wake up call,” said Séjourné.The EU said the strategy was designed to reduce the impact of “market shocks” such as the disruption to the car industry caused by the recent, now lifted, ban on exports of chips by Chinain response to the Dutch government taking control of the Chinese-owned chip firm Nexperia.The EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said Brussels remained committed to the concept of open access to its markets but that was being repeatedly exploited to the disadvantage of European industry, leaving it “fire fighting” a succession of crises.Séjourné said that “for the time being” the EU wanted to “remind” companies as part of the strategy, procurement bosses must communicate with their board of directors on “how they plan to diversify”.“This is a way for us to gently encourage them to diversify … if this were not the case … We reserve the right to use legislation to simply oblige companies to diversify a certain percentage of their supplies,” he said.Senior EU officials said that “while the direction is clear” there was a need to “accelerate the process” as China continued to “weaponise” its hold on raw materials for “geopolitical purposes”.To kickstart the implementation of the strategy, two projects, a molybdenum extraction in Greenland and a lithium mine in Germany will get immediate funding.The EU will also look at financial support to enable companies to buy from more expensive sources than China and it will set up a “raw materials platform” that will pool company orders and build joint stockpiles.New restrictions will be introduced on scrap exports in 2026 of the metal and of scrap copper if necessary.View image in fullscreenDemand for lithium is expected to increase nearly sixtyfold by 2050.

The role of HSBC chair hasbecome increasingly politicised, with Tucker navigating simmering tensions between the west and Beijing. While HSBC is headquartered in London, it makes more than half of its profits in Asia.Osborne, who was in the running to take Tucker’s post, would have brought political experience to a role that requires executives to walk a careful line between the interests of countries in the west and those in Asia.He served as chancellor from 2010 to 2016, before laterediting the Evening Standardand taking up a number of City roles including as part-time adviser to the US asset manager BlackRock, and a partner role at the investment bank Robey Warshaw. He is also an adviser to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Had he been successful, the HSBC job would have been Osborne’s highest-profile City role to date.The appointment of Nelson, who joined the HSBC board in 2023 and became interim chair in October, has raised questions over how long it will be before the bank has to restart its search for a permanent chair.The 76-year-old had “expressed a desire not to do it for the full six to nine years given the stage in his career”, said the HSBC chief executive, Georges Elhedery, in comments made at the Financial Times banking summit a day before the appointment was announced.Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the comments raised questions about the permanence of this appointment and would “reinforce investor concerns around leadership stability and longer-term succession planning at a critical juncture for the bank”.HSBC’s shares fell 1% on Wednesday after Nelson’s appointment.Gary Greenwood, a banking analyst at the investment firm Shore Capital, said: “The fact that the board has finally alighted on Mr Nelson suggests that it has not been possible to find a suitable external successor and, in our view, it is probably fair to say that Mr Nelson was not top of the list of permanent candidates, otherwise there would have been no need to appoint him as an interim successor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also served on the boards of BP and RBS Group, now known at NatWest.HSBC said its decision followed a “robust process that considered both internal and external candidates”.Nelson said: “I look forward to continuing to work with the board, Georges and the wider management team as we deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.”Explore more on these topicsHSBCBankingGeorge OsborneAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It was carrying 12 Malaysian crew and 227 passengers, most of whom were Chinese citizens. Thirty-eight Malaysian passengers were on board, along with seven Australian citizens and residents, plus citizens from Indonesia, India, France, the US, Iran, Ukraine, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Russia and Taiwan.Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul, an Australian citizen, was onboard, welcomed news of the renewed search efforts, saying she was “incredibly grateful and relieved that the Malaysian government has committed to continuing the search”.“We’ve never stopped wishing for answers, and knowing the search will go on brings a sense of comfort. I truly hope this next phase gives us the clarity and peace we’ve been so desperately longing for, for us and our loved ones, since March 8th 2014,” said Weeks.Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement that it supported “all practical efforts to locate Malaysia Airlines flight MH370”, adding that it hoped the renewed search would bring “closure to families who have endured so much since the tragedy”.Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said: “We have noted relevant reports and appreciate the efforts made by the Malaysian side.”Jiang Hui, whose mother was on the plane, said his family “welcomes the continued search by the Malaysian government and Ocean Infinity”.View image in fullscreenA Chinese vessel scanning the sea for the missing flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean in March 2014.Photograph: Zhang Jiansong/REXPosting on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Jiang, who is from Beijing, said his family hoped the upcoming search, planned for 55 days, in future would have “no fixed period”.In the years since the disappearance, vast swathes of the Indian Ocean have been scoured in an attempt to locate the plane’s wreckage through multinational and private efforts, without success.Several pieces of debris have washed up, including awing part found on the French island of Réunionin the Indian Ocean, which was confirmed by Malaysia to have come from MH370 in 2015 – the first trace of the missing plane.Several pieces of debriswere later found along the east coast of Africa. However, no large pieces of wreckage or bodies have been found.Last year, Malaysia said it waswilling to reopen an investigationinto the disappearance if there was compelling new evidence. It agreed to a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Ocean Infinity to resume searching across a new 15,000 sq km (5,800 sq mile) site in the ocean. Under the agreement, Ocean Infinity will be paid $70m only if wreckage is discovered.However, the most recent search activity in the southern Indian Ocean was suspended in April this year due to poor weather conditions.Flight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, had departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2014, bound for Beijing. The plane was last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the strait of Malacca. Half an hour later, the airlineannounced it had lost contact with the plane, which was due to land at its destination about 6.30am.The families of those onboard have long campaigned for continued search operations, saying answers are needed to prevent another tragedy. Sometravelled to Madagascar in 2016to comb the beaches for debris. Relatives have also demanded accountability in the courts, and sought compensation from businesses including Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, the aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce and the Allianz insurance group.In January 2017, Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities announced the end of an underwater hunt for the wreckage that had been led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which for two and a half years searched 120,000 sq km in the southern Indian Ocean.Later that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to bring closure for victims’ families was a “great tragedy” and “almost inconceivable” in the modern age.In 2018, anofficial investigation by Malaysiaconcluded the plane was manually turned around in mid-air, rather than being under the control of autopilot, and that “unlawful interference by a third party” could not be ruled out. However, itdismissed theoriesthat had suggested the pilot and first officer brought the plane down in a suicide mission, and ruled out mechanical failure as a cause.In a statement on Wednesday, the Malaysian transport ministry said: “The latest development underscores the government of Malaysia’s commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy.”Reuters and AFP contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsMalaysia Airlines flight MH370MalaysiaAsia PacificPlane crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that consolidating China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.The Chinese government has agreed to combine all its diplomatic premises inLondoninto the Royal Mint Court site, which spans 20,000 sq metres near Tower Bridge in London.The final decision on whether to grant planning permission has been delayed to 20 January, around the time when the prime minister is planning to travel toChinafor bilateral talks. It is the third time ministers have deferred the decision.MI5 ‘very relaxed’ about proposed Chinese super-embassy in London, sources sayRead moreStarmer would be the first prime minister to visit Beijingsince Theresa May in 2018. In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to blow “hot and cold” on China and needed to strike a balance.“We had the golden age, which then flipped to an ice age. We reject that binary choice,” he said, describing China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and ingenuity” and “a defining force in technology, in trade and global governance”.“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism,” Starmer said.In a letter sent to concerned parties and released by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said their departments had “carefully considered the breadth of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.They said they had worked with police and others to ensure national security issues had been addressed and recognised “the importance of countries having functioning diplomatic premises in each other’s capitals, whilst maintaining the critical need to uphold and defend our national security”.The plan has met fierce opposition from some local residents and campaigners who are concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region.Several protests have taken placenear the site in recent months.A government spokesperson said: “An independent planning decision will be made by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government in due course.”“The Home Office and Foreign Office provided views on particular security implications of this build in January and have been clear throughout that a decision should not be taken until we had confirmed that those considerations had been completed or resolved, which we have now done.“Should the planning decision for a new embassy in the London borough of Tower Hamlets be approved, the new embassy will replace seven different sites which currently comprise China’s diplomatic footprint in London which clearly brings security advantages.”A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said: “We strongly deplore the UK side’s repeated postponement of the decision on the planning application for the new Chinese embassy project.”The spokesperson called on the UK to approve the planning application quickly “to avoid further undermining the mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides”.China bought the Royal Mint Court site for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled afterTower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022.The Conservative government declined to intervene but Labour took the matter out of the council’s hands by calling it in soon after taking power last summer.Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyAsia PacificKeir StarmerLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Some aspects are best described as shambolic.”However, it said it found no evidence of any “coordinated high-level effort to collapse the prosecution”, dismissing claims by senior Conservatives that there had been political interference.The JCNSScalled into question prosecutors’ judgmentat several stages of the processes, concluding that the CPS “could have surfaced or escalated issues over misaligned expectations much earlier”. The committee said:It was “unclear” why the CPS had concluded that a July 2024 ruling concerning a Bulgarian spy ring “altered the legal landscape so significantly” that they had to change their approach.It was “surprised” the CPS had deemed the government’s evidence insufficient to put to a jury when it had set out how China “posed a range of threats to the United Kingdom’s national security” that “amounted to a more general active threat”.The government “did not have sufficiently clear processes for escalating issues where there was a lack of clarity” and “the level of senior oversight” from cabinet ministers and national security advisers “was insufficiently robust”.The conclusions pile pressure on the CPS, which has maintained thatit did not have the evidence it needed to proceed. This claim has been challenged by senior lawyers including former director of public prosecutions Ken McDonald and former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption.“We regret that commonsense interpretations of the wording provided in the DNSA’s [deputy national security adviser] witness statements were apparently not a sufficiently strong basis for meeting the evidential requirements of the Crown Prosecution Service,” the committee said.Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, and Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser who was the government witness in the case, were among several senior figures who gave evidence to the JCNSS inquiry in October.Richard Hermer, the attorney general, and Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, faced questions about whether ministers or special advisers had had a hand in theabandonment of the case.Tory politicians had raised questions about a meeting of senior mandarins and Jonathan Powell, Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, to discuss the implications of the trial on 1 September, days before prosecutors pulled the charges.But the committee concluded that prosecutors had decided they did not have the evidence they needed more than a week before the meeting.It said it found no evidence of “improper influence or deliberate efforts to obstruct the prosecution” and concluded that Hermer had “acted with constitutional propriety” even though he was “not proactive” in assisting prosecutors with the case.A government source said: “The Tories spent weeks throwing around baseless accusations which have been proven totally untrue. The reality is that their negligence of national security left unacceptable gaps in the law.”The committee warned that it would be wrong to entirely pin the failure of the process on the outdated Official Secrets Act, as some ministers have done.In their recommendations, MPs urged the government to reform its process for communicating with the CPS and give better support to deputy national security advisers.They urged the Cabinet Office and security services to work with the CPS to formalise principles for handling sensitive cases within the next six months.They also recommended establishing a new rule for a formal case “conference” within 30 days of such charges being brought in order to avoid such a “lack of clarity” over the evidence in future.A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the strong interest in this case. We will review the recommendations carefully and work with partners to identify where improvements can be made.“Our decisions are made independently and based on law and evidence, and that principle remains at the heart of our work.”A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the committee’s report that makes clear that allegations about interference in this case were baseless and untrue.“The decision to drop the case was taken independently by the Crown Prosecution Service. We remain disappointed that this case did not reach trial.“Protecting national security is our first duty and we will never waver from our efforts to keep the British people safe.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Dense breast tissue is a risk factor for breast cancer, and can also make mammograms more difficult to read.Those undergoing breast screening in Australia are already told of their breast density, and the measure is being considered in the UK by the National Screening Committee (NSC).Thestudy, conducted by researchers at the University of Sydney and published in the BMJ, looked at data from 2,401 women who had been screened for breast cancer in Australia between September 2023 and July 2024 who were classified as having dense breasts.Researchers then randomised the women into either the control group, who were not told of their breast density, a group who were notified of their breast density and were given written information about its implications, and a final group who were told of their breast density and given a link to an online video with information.After eight weeks, women were surveyed about their psychological response to their results and whether they had intentions to speak to their GP or pursue additional screening.Women who were told of their breast density were more likely to feel anxious and confused about what to do after these results than the control group, according to the analysis.Both groups who were notified of their breast density also had significantly higher intentions to talk to their GP about their screening results, at 22.8% and 19.4%, compared with 12.9% for the control group.The NHS breast screening programme inEnglanddoes not currently include the assessment or recording of breast density on screening mammograms.Sophie Brooks, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said that having dense breasts couldmake it harder to detect canceron a mammogram, but it was not something people could check for themselves or change.She added: “This study suggests that telling women about their breast density has mixed results. Women who were told were more likely to seek advice from their GP, but they were also more likely to feel anxious and confused, highlighting the need for clear information and support. More research is needed to investigate whether informing women about their breast density could have a positive impact or not, and the UK National Screening Committee are currently looking into this.”Overall, the study concluded that women “notified of their dense breasts felt anxious and confused, did not feel more informed to make decisions about their breast health, and wanted to be guided by their general practitioners”.Melanie Sturtevant, associate director of policy, evidence and influencing at BreastCancerNow, said: “Knowing personal risk of breast cancer could allow people to make informed decisions about their own breast health. But studies like this one are really important to understand the impact of informing people about personal risk factors like breast density, including on a person’s mental health. The findings underline that learning they were higher risk left many women feeling more anxious and confused, and more likely to ask their GP for further information.“Currently in the UK, routine screening does not involve recording information about breast density, and a review into whether additional screening should be offered to women with dense breasts is ongoing. While we appreciate the need for a strong, evidence-driven process, we want to see the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) conduct this with more urgency and transparency.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerWomen's healthHealthWomenCancerEnglandNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

The federal government has set out that the platforms must have quick appeals processes in place for people who have been wrongly assessed as being under 16 to regain access to their accounts.Instagram’s age-verification identified a moustachioed adult as over 16 – but how did it go with a 13-year-old?Read moreIn the report, the TIO referred to Karen – not her real name – whose business page on social media was linked to her personal account. It was used to manage advertising and communicating with customers.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHer personal account was disabled without warning and she couldn’t contact customers via the business page as a result. She could not communicate with the platform to have the ban reversed because the response went to her disabled account.“She could find no other way to get help from them. Karen was worried about the financial and reputational damage to her business, so she contacted the TIO,” the report stated.Karen is one of an increasing number of customers going to the TIO to report problems with social media. The TIO stated that between 1 January 2023 and 31 August 2025 consumers made 1,537 digital platform-related complaints. The TIO found also there had been a 28.6% increase in such complaints between 2023 and 2024.Guardian Australiahas reported on similar account terminationsmade on Meta platforms in the past few months. Issues with account access – including platforms blocking or banning users – made up 36% of the complaints reported.Australia’s under-16s social media ban is weeks away. How will it work – and how can I appeal if I’m wrongly banned?Read more“We have heard from individuals and small businesses whose accounts have been locked due to alleged breaches of community standards, with no warning or explanation, risking personal and financial losses,” the TIO said.Google topped the digital platforms-related complaints to the TIO at 18%, followed by Kayo/Binge/Foxtel streaming company Hubbl at 15%, Apple and Microsoft at 14% of complaints each, and Meta (11%).The TIO found it was fielding these complaints because they often intersected with telecommunications issues – it can be difficult for customers to know whether an issue with a service is due to the platform itself, or an internet or connection problem.The ombudsman has recommended its remit be expanded to include digital platforms so they can respond to consumer complaints.“We are calling for the Australian government to expand the TIO to become the communications ombudsman,” ombudsman Cynthia Gebert said.“To support government reforms such as the under-16s social media ban and digital duty of care, it’s more important than ever that people have appeal rights when digital platforms get things wrong.”She said it was heartbreaking to tell people they couldn’t resolve their problems with the TIO.“When someone loses access to their telco service, we work with the consumer and the company to resolve the issue,” she said. “But when someone is accidentally locked out of their social media or cloud storage account, and the platform is not responding, there’s nowhere for them to go.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologySocial mediaAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His Estonian counterpart, Margus Tsahkna, said it was “pretty obvious” that the Kremlin was not interested in peace. “What we see is that Putin has not changed any course. He’s pushing more aggressively on the battlefield,” he said.Witkoff and Kushner will meet Ukrainian representatives in Miami on Thursday, a White House official said.European leaders, having been left on the sidelines of the White House effort to push through a peace deal, have instead been focusing on the need to plug the gap in Ukraine’s finances as the war grinds into a fourth winter.Von der Leyen outlined a €90bn (£79bn) plan, which she estimated would cover two-thirds of Kyiv’s funding needs for the next two years. She said other “international partners” would cover the rest.The aid would be funded by common EU borrowing or a loan based on Russia’s frozen assets in Europe. EU officials said these two options could be combined, but have always made clear the frozen assets loan was their preferred choice – despite stiff opposition from Belgium.The publication on Wednesday of a long-awaited legal text of the reparations loan will be followed by an EU summit this month at which EU leaders are being urged to agree a two-year funding plan for Ukraine to avert the looming cash crunch.The week Europe realised it stands alone against Russian expansionismRead moreLeadersfailed in Octoberto agree ona proposed “reparations loan”to Ukraine using the Russian assets, but the question is becoming increasingly urgent, with Kyiv forecastto run out of moneyfrom next spring. EU officials estimate Ukraine needs €136bn in 2026 and 2027 to continue its defence and keep the country running.The stakes became even higher after the Trump administration floated a plan to invest some of Russia’s frozen assets in joint US-Russia projects, as well as taking profits from $100bn (£75bn) of the funds that it had earmarked to reconstruct Ukraine.European leaders stronglypushed back against these ideas, which were part of a 28-point plan for Ukraine that has since been amended.About €290bn of Russia’s sovereign wealth in the west was frozen after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Most of those funds are held in Europe, above all in Belgium. Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, holds €183bn of the Russian assets and fears that any use of the assets could be tantamount to confiscation, violating international law and prompting a slew of legal cases.View image in fullscreenRussian soldiers display their national flag in Pokrovsk, Ukraine, which they claim to have captured, in an image released on Tuesday.Photograph: Russian Defense Ministry Press Service/APEU officials have always downplayed legal risks, arguing that Russia would maintain ownership of the funds. They propose an EU loan for Ukraine secured on the Russian assets.The plan hinges on the assumption Moscow will one day pay reparations to Kyiv and that Russia’s assets will remain frozen for the foreseeable future.Von der Leyen said on Wednesday the reparations loan would have “strong safeguards for our member states”, a response to the Belgian prime minister, Bart De Wever, who has said Belgium could face a multibillion-euro bill if Euroclear was sued by Russian individuals and companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

De Wever has said the reparations loan plan was“fundamentally wrong”and would be an obstacle to any peace deal, because the frozen assets could then not be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine.Von der Leyen said: “We are increasing the cost of Russia’s war of aggression and this should act as a further incentive for Russia to engage at the negotiating table.”Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said his government continued to see the reparations loan as “the worst of all” options.Arriving at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, he said: “The text the commission will table today does not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner. It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks.”He also said Belgium had been frustrated at “not being heard” and having its concerns “downplayed”.In theory, Belgium could be outvoted on the frozen assets plan, which is strongly supported by Germany, Nordic and central and eastern European member states. In reality, EU countries would be extremely reluctant to isolate Brussels, although the Belgian government will face pressure to agree.Von der Leyen said the EU had “taken almost all” of Belgium’s concerns into account. The proposal, she insisted, contained “very strong safeguards in place to protect member states and to reduce the risks as much as possible”.These safeguards included guarantees from other member states and the EU in the event Belgium had to repay any money, as well as protection against “unlawful expropriations outside Russia”, a reference to legal challenges in countries that are friendly to Moscow.The EU will also upgrade the law underpinning the asset freezing to ensure they cannot be accidentally “defrosted” by a veto from an EU member state. Currently EU sanctions must be renewed every six months by unanimity, including Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly government.Belgium will have welcomed the commission’s proposal of Brussels’s preferred option of an EU loan for Ukraine using unallocated funds in the EU budget as collateral. Belgium has said this is the least risky way to fund Ukraine, but many EU governments are reluctant to venture into more common borrowing.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, a strong advocate of the frozen assets plan, said this week that “raising capital together is also out of the question for some member states”.She said she was not seeking to “diminish the risks or the worries the Belgian government has”, but argued that a loan based on Russian assets was the best option and would “definitely strengthen European position vis a vis Moscow”.Additional reporting by Jakub KrupaExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUkraineReparations and reparative justiceRussiaBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Then the cameras cut out.Which areas is Russia demanding as its price for peace in Ukraine? – visual explainerRead moreWhat followed behind closed doors was not difficult to predict. Despite all thepressure on Ukraine to make concessionsthat Putin would accept, the assurances from the Trump administration that this was the best chance yet for peace, and the boosterism from envoys such as Witkoff and Kushner, the Ukraine peace deal has stumbled over an intractable, inevitable obstacle: Putin himself.The road to peace has always led through the Kremlin. That’s not a surprise given that it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion ofUkrainenearly four years ago that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions more displaced.And yet for weeks, the Trump administration has put pressure mainly on Ukraine – a junior partner far easier to cajole and cow than the Kremlin, in order to extract maximally advantageous conditions that it could offer to Putin in exchange for peace.“What we’re trying to see is if it’s possible to end the war in a way that protects Ukraine’s future that both sides could agree to,” said the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, after the Kremlin rejected the latest plan.Apparently not. Witkoff and Kushner found a Kremlin that remained as unwilling to compromise on key issues includingterritorial controland Ukraine’s future political status as when Trump first took office.View image in fullscreenPutin, flanked by foreign policy advisers Yuri Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, at the Kremlin during the talks.Photograph: Alexander Kazakov/APThat isn’t how the Kremlin presented the results of course. Shortly after the meeting, the longtime Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said that the talks were productive but that Moscow and Washington were “neither further nor closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine”.Given that there was a specific US proposal on the table drawn up in part by another Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, media coverage after the talks naturally saw that response as a Kremlin rejection.“No, this is incorrect,” said the Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “The thing is that the first direct exchange of views was conducted yesterday, and again, as it was said yesterday, some [proposals] were accepted, and some were called unacceptable, which is a normal working process in the search for a compromise.”A classic Kremlin “yes, but”, then. BothRussiaand Ukraine have remained eager not to be seen as the obstacle to peace in the eyes of Trump, but the Kremlin has broadcast its own plans to continue fighting until it gets the result it desires: considerable territorial and political concessions on Kyiv’s future military and political trajectory.Putin’s initialrejection of any dealthis week was widely predicted. Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, had written that the meeting was “never a negotiation. It was a deliberate, unambiguous presentation of Russia’s preconditions. Putin is now waiting to see whether this direct message will shift Trump’s stance”.But a Kremlin agreement to discuss theproposalmay mark progress, argued Thomas Graham, a former senior US official who has remained in contact with current and former Russian officials, in remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations.Putin was tiring, however, of the kind of wheeler-dealer process led by Witkoff, who is part of an influential set of five foreign policy advisers to Trump but nonetheless holds no formal role in government and is not trained in formal diplomacy.“Putin doesn’t want to see Witkoff coming to Moscow to have these discussions,” said Graham. “He really does want to turn this into what he would call a normal sort of diplomatic process where you get working groups together to work out the details of what are, in fact, very, very complex issues, where each side has significant differences and where there might be a possibility of bridging that.”Back to the working groups, then. For Ukraine, it could mark a crisis averted if the Trump administration views that Kyiv is not the main obstacle to peace. And the Kremlin has also signalled it is content to continue fighting until it gets the deal that Putin wants.In the meantime, Putin could avoid giving a hard yes or no on a deal with Ukraine, something that US officials say is the only way to end the war.“Ultimately the decisions have to be made, in the case of Russia, by Putin alone,” Rubio said. “Not his advisers, Putin only. Putin can end this war on the Russian side.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The source said an Israeli helicopter had also landed in the area.Israel’s military said on Sunday that it had killed more than 40 militants over the past week in operations targeting tunnels near Rafah.Multiple sources told AFP last week that negotiations were under way regarding the fate of the fighters still in south Gaza’s tunnel network. A prominent Hamas member in Gaza told AFP that the group estimated their number to be 60-80.Also on Wednesday, UN secretary generalAntónio Guterrestold Reuters there was something “fundamentally wrong” with how Israel conducted its military operation in the Gaza Strip and there were “strong reasons to believe” war crimes had been committed.“I think there was something fundamentally wrong in the way this operation was conducted, with total neglect in relation to the deaths of civilians and to the destruction of Gaza,” Guterres said.“The objective was to destroy Hamas. Gaza is destroyed, but Hamas is not yet destroyed. So there is something fundamentally wrong with the way this is conducted.”Israel’s mission to the UN in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guterres’s remarks.The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people.Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed at least 70,117 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable.The health ministry says that since the ceasefire came into effect, 360 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire. Israel’s military has reported three soldiers killed during the same period.Additional reportingby ReutersExplore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsAntónio GuterresIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Others on the list are director Sir Richard Eyre, artist Ai Weiwei, and billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson.Barghouti, 66, has spent 23 years in prison after what legal experts described as a flawed trial. An elected parliamentarian at the time of his arrest, he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, consistently topping polls as the people’s choice to lead.Israel’s persistent refusal to release him, including in the recent prisoner swap that followed an October ceasefire in the Gaza war, does not appear to be linked to any intelligence assessment that he would pose a threat to Israel’s security but instead to the influence he may wield in building unity and a momentum to a two state-solution.There is also concern that the Israeli government is willing to pass new laws that will allow Israel to impose the death penalty on Palestinian prisoners, a law that could include Barghouti.The recent passage of a UN resolution backing Washington’s call for the establishment of an international stabilisation force insideGazahas not led to a flood of nations willing to provide troops, partly because they fear the force will find itself locked into a conflict with Hamas over the decommissioning of its weapons, Israel’s precondition for leaving the strip.Most big Palestinian human rights groups have also rejected the UN resolution, something Barghouti would have to navigate if released.The campaign to release Barghouti intentionally echoes the cultural movement that was central to securing the freedom of Nelson Mandela and ending apartheid in South Africa. Mandela himself said in 2002: “What is happening to Barghouti is the same as what happened to me.”British musician Brian Eno said: “History shows us that cultural voices can shift the course of politics. Just as global solidarity helped free Nelson Mandela, we all have the power to accelerate the day that Marwan Barghouti walks free. His release would mark a turning point in this long struggle and bring much-needed hope to all of us.”Selma Dabbagh, a British-Palestinian novelist and lawyer, said: “Marwan Barghouti’s trial was widely recognised as a sham. The body that represents parliaments around the world - the Inter-Parliamentary Union – undertook their own assessment and concluded it was deeply flawed. Marwan’s release would be a critical step in allowing Palestinians to determine their own leadership, whatever shape that may take.”The full statement reads: “We express our grave concern at the continuing imprisonment of Marwan Barghouti, his violent mistreatment and denial of legal rights whilst imprisoned. We call upon the United Nations and the governments of the world to actively seek the release of Marwan Barghouti from Israeli prison.”The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is likely to resist his release unless there is strong pressure from the US.Donald Trumpthis week invited Netanyahu to the White House in the “near future”, a visit that, should it happen, would be the Israeli leader’s fifth since Trump returned to office in January.Explore more on these topicsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankIsraelGazanewsShareReuse this content"

That is the conclusion ofresearch by the Nuffield Trust thinktank, based on a survey of 2,108 family doctors by the Royal College of GPs about AI and on focus groups of GPs.Ministers hope that AI can help reduce the delays patients face in seeing a GP.The study found that more and more GPs were using AI to produce summaries of appointments with patients, assisting their diagnosis of the patient’s condition and routine administrative tasks.In all, 598 (28%) of the 2,108 survey respondents said they were already using AI. More male (33%) than female (25%) GPs have used it and far more use it in well-off than in poorer areas.It is moving quickly into more widespread use. However, large majorities of GPs, whether they use it or not, worry that practices that adopt it could face “professional liability and medico-legal issues”, and “risks of clinical errors” and problems of “patient privacy and data security” as a result, the Nuffield Trust’s report says.“The government is pinning its hopes on the potential of AI to transform theNHS. But there is a huge chasm between policy ambitions and the current disorganised reality of how AI is being rolled out and used in general practice”, said Dr Becks Fisher, a GP who is the thinktank’s director of research and policy.“It is very hard for GPs to feel confident about using AI when they’re faced with a wild west of tools which are unregulated at a national level in the NHS”, she added.While some NHS regional integrated care boards back GPs using AI, others ban it.In a blow to ministerial hopes, the survey also found that GPs use the time it saves them to recover from the stresses of their busy days rather than to see more patients. “While policymakers hope that this saved time will be used to offer more appointments, GPs reported using it primarily for self-care and rest, including reducing overtime working hours to prevent burnout”, the report adds.Aseparate studyof how family doctors in the UK are using AI published last month in the journal Digital Health involved similar findings. It found that the proportion using AI had risen from 20% to 25% over the previous year.“In just 12 months, generative AI has gone from taboo to tool in British medicine”, said Dr Charlotte Blease of Uppsala university in Sweden, the lead author of the research.Like the Nuffield Trust, she highlighted lack of regulation as a key concern, especially given the speed at which GPs are incorporating AI into their clinical practice. “The real risk isn’t that GPs are using AI. It’s that they’re doing it without training or oversight,” Blease said.“AI is already being used in everyday medicine. The challenge now is to ensure it’s deployed safely, ethically and openly.”Growing numbers of patients were also using AI to improve their healthcare, including when they could not get a GP appointment, Healthwatch England said.“Our recent research shows that while patients continue to trust the NHS for health information, around one in 10 (9%) are using AI tools for information on staying healthy”, said Chris McCann, the patient watchdog’s deputy chief executive.“There are various reasons people may turn to AI tools, including when they cannot access GP services. However, the quality of the advice from AI tools is inconsistent. For example, one person received advice from an AI tool that confused shingles with Lyme disease.”A commission launched by the government in September, on how to ensure that AI is used in a safe, effective and properly regulated way, will make recommendations when it reports.The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHealthArtificial intelligence (AI)GPsNHSDoctorsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

About 700 parents of children attending during the time Chan worked at the nursery in London, from 2017 to his arrest by 2024, have been contacted by police.His repeated offending while entrusted with vulnerable children was discovered by chance.He pleaded guilty on Wednesday to 26 offences from 2022 to 2024, including attacks on four young girls aged two to four, whom he sexually assaulted on nursery premises, and offences relating to more than 25,000 indecent images of children.View image in fullscreenVincent Chan filmed some of his sexual attacks on the girls, between two and four, with the nursery’s iPads.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAChan, of Finchley, north London, was employed at a now closed north London nursery run by Bright Horizons, one of Britain’s biggest providers of early-years care.A review will establish whether safeguarding procedures were followed. Some parents are considering legal action against the nursery and told the Guardian complaints they had made to the nursery about Chan’s behaviour before his offending came to light had been ignored. Bright Horizons declined comment on that aspect but pledged cooperation with the review.Chan’s attacks happened in broad daylight when the nursery was full of children and staff.About 20 parents of children at the now closed nursery were at Wood Green crown court as Chan pleaded guilty to all 26 charges. Some stared at him as he stood in the dock, speaking only to confirm his address and utter “guilty”, sometimes barely audibly, to every count.Cmdr Hayley Sewart said: “His responsibilities included feeding, clothing, cleaning and interacting with the children, tasks that required a high degree of trust and safeguarding.”In a statement, some of the families described Chan’s unmasking as an attacker of children as a “sickening discovery” and his abuse as “despicable” against “innocent victims who could not fight back”.But their statement also made clear the families’ anger at the nursery: “We feel that Bright Horizons has failed us, and we want answers. How was someone like Vincent Chan employed? Why did safeguarding systems fail completely? And how were such horrific crimes against children able to continue for so long without the staff responsible for safeguarding at Bright Horizons nursery acting?“We are concerned that failures in management and supervision at Bright Horizons allowed this abuse to go undetected, and we are committed to securing accountability for our children.”View image in fullscreenAlison Millar from Leigh Day, the solicitor for the families, said outside Wood Green crown court that there were ‘many questions that need to be answered’.Photograph: Lucy North/PAAlison Millar, a solicitor and partner at Leigh Day, said: “The families we are in contact with feel very strongly that there were major failings of safeguarding at Bright Horizons Finchley Road nursery. We look forward to the findings of the local child safeguarding practice review but there are many questions that need to be answered.”The court heard that two children Chan had admitted offences against were yet to be identified. The material he filmed himself, which was found on his devices, was crucial to his admissions of guilt.The Metropolitan police are working through pictures and video found on more than 60 digital devices seized when Chan was arrested to rule out fears he could have committed dozens more offences.The offences to which Chan, who was an early-years practitioner and nursery nurse, pleaded guilty include five sexual assaults by penetration of a child between two and four years, four sexual assaults, 11 counts of taking indecent photos, and six of making indecent images of children.He had passed enhanced vetting to get the job in 2017, had worked in a school previously and had no criminal record.Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the investigation, said: “Chan’s offending spanned years, revealing a calculated and predatory pattern of abuse. He infiltrated environments that should have been safe havens for children, exploiting the trust of families and the wider community to conceal his actions and prey on the most vulnerable.“Our investigation remains ongoing, and we are continuing to review digital devices and assess Chan’s conduct across all relevant settings.”It was by chance that the danger Chan posed was discovered. In 2024 he was reported over a safeguarding concern when it emerged he had made videos mocking the children in his care. He was arrested in June 2024, and suspended from his job.In September 2024 his electronic devices – phones, laptops and memory sticks, as well as 15 iPads from the nursery, 69 devices in total – were sent for digital examination. It was not until September 2025 that evidence on the devices of his sexual abuse of children was found. He was charged on 9 September 2025.Basford said: “We recognise the member of staff who raised their concerns, as without that first report of child cruelty Chan’s abuse could have continued unchecked, putting countless more children at risk. These appalling offences have caused deep shock and distress.”The Met said 700 parents of children who passed through the nursery from 2017 to 2024 had been contacted.Basford said for parents: “Uncertainty will remain as to whether their child may have been harmed.”Bright Horizons, which says it runs about 300 nurseries and preschools in the UK, said: “We are shocked and appalled by this individual’s horrific crimes.“This individual’s actions represent not only a violation of the victims, but also a profound betrayal of the trust placed in him by families and colleagues.“We have extensive safeguarding practices in place, designed to create safe environments for children to learn and grow. While this individual’s actions came to light after a colleague raised concerns and followed our whistleblowing procedures to report him, we fully accept that the evidence shows the individual was able to commit these crimes despite our safeguarding measures.“In light of this, we have commissioned an external expert in this field to undertake a full review of our safeguarding practices.”Sentencing will be on 23 January and the judge told Chan he faced a long time in prison. He was remanded in custody pending sentencing.A dedicated NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 0828 had been set up for all families whose children attended the nursery.Explore more on these topicsLondonChild protectionCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It contains a mix of famous old art deco hotels such as the Delano and Raleigh, both undergoing extensive upmarket refurbishments, and the construction of exclusive new residential tower blocks with high-end apartments running into the tens of millions.It is here on the sun-filled shores of South Beach, more than a thousand miles from the chills of a Manhattan winter, where realtors and developers are beginning to see the first shoots of what they call the “Mamdani effect”: the predictedexodus of wealthy New Yorkersin the wake of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor.Seniorreal estate execsandothers, includingDonald Trump, have dented the idea that Mamdani will drive rich New Yorkers to the Sunshine state. But Florida realtors claim they are seeing an “exponential” recent rise in inquiries and sales.The marketing agent for theRitz-Carlton Residences, an upcoming project of 30 “beach house” condos ranging from single-bedroom apartments below $10m to its stunning $125m penthouse, has logged a 166% spike in interest from prospective buyers in New York from this time last year.It is a pattern high-end realtors say is being reflected in other upscale developments across the city, from Miami Beach to the fashionable Brickell downtown financial district known as the Manhattan of the south, and the affluent, historic neighborhood of Coconut Grove with its yacht marinas and classy sidewalk eateries.Governor Ron DeSantis has jokingly proposed Mamdani for arealtor of the year award, and suggested the imposition of a sales entrance tax for fleeing hordes of high-net-worth New Yorkers.The Guardian took a tour of several of Miami’s newest – and priciest – developments to see what the Mamdani refugees will get for their money. Opulence, elegance and designer names abound in external architecture and internal fittings; expansive water views are de rigueur; and full-service attentiveness at luxurious spas and private restaurants with Michelin-starred chefs promise to melt stresses away in aNew Yorkminute.Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach“The second that the word on the street was that Mamdani was going to be elected we started getting phone calls,” said Pietro Belmonte, executive vice-president at Douglas Elliman, marketing agents for thestriking beach house towerthat blends the creativity of renowned South Florida architect Kobi Karp and extravagance of interior designer Alessandro Munge.View image in fullscreenPietro Belmonte, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman realtors, describes the layout and features of the forthcoming Ritz-Carlton Residences its South Beach sales office on 19 November 2025.Single-bedroom apartments start at 1,200 sq ft and slightly larger doubles kick in around $8.6m; three, four and five bedrooms on higher floors range from $10.5m to $22m and above; and the twin penthouses with rooftop private pools can be split for $69m and $55m respectively, or bundled for a cool $125m.Bathroom floors have pure brass inlays between tiles; floor-to-ceiling windows and wraparound balconies give unparalleled views of the Atlantic; and you can wander straight from one of a number ofJosé Andrésrestaurants on to the development’s 350ft frontage on what is arguably Florida’s most prestigious beach.Belmonte says the residences, which add to the footprint of the existing flagship Ritz-Carlton hotel at the ocean end of Miami Beach’s Lincoln Road shopping haven, will be ready for occupation in 2028. The timescale, he said, is perfect for those beginning to assess the impact of Mamdani’s election, and working toward taking the plunge.“I don’t see it as a mass exodus, I see it more as a thoughtful exodus,” he said.“It’s people thinking it through and making sure they’re making the right decision, and as time is going on they’re waiting to see if it’s true that all of this is going to happen, and when it will happen. So I think the second they start seeing things going not the right way, it’s going to be more of a final decision.View image in fullscreen‘The second that the word on the street was that Mamdani was going to be elected we started getting phone calls,’ Belmonte said.“They’re all second-home buyers. No one’s going to be here during the summer, they’ll be here for the six months and a day to make it their main residence then they’re going to be in St Tropez, they’ll be in Italy, in the Hamptons, in the Berkshires, wherever they are they’ll have the second home.”Four Seasons Private Residences, Coconut GroveNo other individual has changed the Miami skyline as much as Ugo Colombo in his almost 40 years as a developer-designer in the city. The Italian-born founder of CMC Group says hislatest projectin Coconut Grove is “the crown jewel” of his long career spanningnumerous luxury construction projects, and that it surpasses “everything I’ve done so far in terms of quality of details”.He has a flourish New Yorkers seem to like, with about 15% of new buyers hailing from the city and surrounding areas, and a further 10% rise in interest from the region in the weeks surrounding Mamdani’s election.“Most of these people already have second and third homes, right? So they’re not necessarily running to us and saying, ‘We’re escaping New York,’ and I can’t tell you there was this immediate peak,” said Christine Martinez de Castro, chief marketing and sales officer for CMC Group.“But we’ve been seeing a little bit of an increase for a while. During Covid, people saw an opportunity and everything happening from a tax situation, which is only being more emphasized now with what’s happening with the election.View image in fullscreenChristine Martinez de Castro, chief marketing and sales officer for CMC Group, stands for a portrait along Biscayne Bay on 19 November 2025.  CMC is one of the companies developing the Four Seasons Private Residences in Coconut Grove, alongside Fort Partners.“People buying $10-15m residences were already planning for this ahead of time.”Her buyers can choose from 70 condominiums spread over 20 floors, starting at $6m for two bedrooms, to $18m for larger units of about 4,000 sq ft. There’s a penthouse, of course, for which potential purchasers must sign a non-disclosure agreement before negotiations begin. You get a European-style spa, a signature restaurant with yet-to-be announced big-name chef, and the quieter, more laid back aura of “The Grove”.An army of private staff will cater to every need, because discerning buyers choose the Four Seasons for its hallmark service, Martinez de Castro said.“Maybe you forgot your daughter’s coming home from college and hasn’t had a really good home-cooked meal in a while,” she said.“‘Why don’t we get something already sent up for you?’ and you’re like, ‘Oh yeah, I didn’t think about that.’ You want the ‘Oh yeah, I didn’t think about that’ moment, right?”The Perigon, Miami BeachA “serene, private enclave designed by global icons” is howthe Perigon, an under-construction development of 73 exclusive residences contained within glass towers on the widest part of Miami Beach, is being marketed.“Activity at Perigon right now from the ultra, ultra high net worths is really staggering,” said Michael Patrizio, managing director of developers Mast Capital.View image in fullscreenGuests lounge at the pool at the Ritz-Carlton South Beach on 19 November 2025.“What really matters to them is that the offering is authentic, it’s got to be real, it’s got to resonate. It’s the overall offering of great food, great service, certainty of delivery, quality of finish. Our product is, we believe, leading the market.”The celebrity chef here is Australian Shaun Hergatt, who has two Michelin stars, and his restaurant will be open only to residents and their guests. In a nod to New York’s Prohibition-era past, a discreet, intimate speakeasy called FiftyThree will offer top-level mixology, while other amenities include a private cinema and children’s lounge.Mast has made the pretty solid gamble that New Yorkers accustomed to dark and dreary Manhattan days will be enlivened by a surfeit of sunshine and 360-degree views encompassing Atlantic sunrises and sunsets over Biscayne Bay.The least expensive condo is a two-bedroom unit starting at $12.5m, up to about $70m on higher floors with four bedrooms including primary and junior suites. Patrizio said the exclusivity of the complex appeals to “second, third, fourth, fifth, home buyers”.“New York has always been a primary market for southFlorida, particularly Miami, Miami Beach, and it feels like a lot of New Yorkers somehow tend to have ties to Miami in some fashion,” he said.View image in fullscreenA couple strolls along South Beach near various condominiums and hotels in Miami Beach on 19 November 2025.Construction at the Perigon is more advanced than at other sites and will reach its rooftop in February, Patrizio expects. “It gives certainty of delivery and shows [buyers] there’s a real timeline, there’s activity, there’s progress. I’d say that’s probably been one of our biggest drivers, people come in and say, “OK, well, you know it’s going up.’”Cipriani Residences, BrickellRising to 80 stories and 940ft (287 meters), the Cipriani building will become not only Miami’s tallest structure, but also one of its most populated, with almost 400 condominium residences filling more than 1.2m sq ft of space. But this is no inner city housing project: even the smallest, one-bedroom apartment here has an asking price of just under $2m.It is another Mast development and Patrizio says interest, inquiries and sales from New Yorkers in the high net worth range – opposed to the “ultras” – have all soared in the wake of the mayoral vote.“Inquiries have increased exponentially,” he said.“The day after he won the primary, we had a New York buyer who was kind of on the fence and decided to move forward, same thing the week of the election, one on the fence moved forward. Those are kind of direct deals that happened … It was the election, I can say that with certainty.”The pace of Cipriani’s construction has been breakneck, it recently reached its 54th floor at a rate of one floor about every four days, Patrizio said. Consideration to its design and interior of the apartments was a much slower and more thoughtful process, with the developers keen to capture the essence of European design.View image in fullscreenPeople make their way through the Brickell neighborhood in Miami on 19 November 2025.Floors 62 and higher feature the Canoletto Collection, 74 exclusive homes including six penthouses claiming the “highest level of Venetian hospitality” and featuring interiors by 1508 London, one of the world’s leading design agencies.The building is named for Giuseppe Cipriani, founder ofHarry’s Bar in Venicein 1931, an establishment famous for its hospitality.

What I see here in Miami is a sustainable market,” Patrizio said.“There’s the relocation of major businesses, Citadel, Blackstone, Starwood Capital.

When she was appointed by David Ellison, the president of CBS News’ parent company, Paramount Skydance,some journalists at the network expressed skepticismabout her ability to do the job, considering her lack of experience working in television.Weiss was influential in organizinga 10 October interviewof former secretaries of stateHillary ClintonandCondoleezza Riceconducted by the CBS News journalist Norah O’Donnell, but she did not personally participate in the program.While Weiss has not appeared on the network as part of her role,her sister Suzy Weiss has– to talk about a piece she did for the Free Press on artificial diamonds. Like CBS News, the Free Press – which was co-founded by Bari and Suzy Weiss – is owned by Paramount Skydance.ACBSNews spokesperson declined to comment on the event, which has not yet been announced.Those who request online to attend the Kirk town hall, are asked a series of questions. The first question is: “Do you consider yourself a conservative? If so, why?”There are also questions about whether potential attenders are “grieving the loss of a loved one”, whether they consider themselves to be evangelical Christians, and which religious figures they admire most.Since taking editorial control of the network in October, Weiss has said little publicly about her plan for CBS News – besides comments she made at the 2025 Jewish Leadership Conference last month andthen posted online about a week later.Weiss said that news consumers should not have to choose between political ideologues on both the right and the left.“This is an opportunity to speak for the 75%, for the people that are on the center-left and the center-right, that still believe in equality of opportunity, that still believe passionately in the American project, that still believe in all of the things that everyone in this room believes in, which is liberty and freedom and individual responsibility, and at the most basic level, the right to know what is actually going on in the world, not the world as propagandists and ideologues imagine it to be, but what’s actually going on in the world, and in your community, so you can make decisions about where to send your kids to school, about where to live, and about how to vote. That used to just be normal,” she said.“And the goal of what we’re trying to do at CBS is to get back to that normalcy, and I feel incredibly energized and enthusiastic, because I think that is where the vast majority of Americans actually are.”Since the murder of her husband on 10 September, Erika Kirk has emerged as a prominent – and public – voice in conservative politics and media. She spoke on Wednesday at the DealBook summit organized by the New York Times.“If you really want to heal this country … you’re going to have to do it by talking to each other,” she said. “You can’t keep cancelling one another thinking that’s going to resolve everything. And that’s what’s so beautiful about the first amendment too, is that you have the gift of communication. We’re speaking beings. And we need to get back to that as a country.”Explore more on these topicsCBSCharlie Kirk shootingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment rising by 10,000 jobs after a previously reported 42,000 rebound in October.US added 119,000 jobs in September in report delayed by federal shutdownRead moreThe ADP report is jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. The monthly estimate has historically diverged from the government’s private payrolls count produced by the labor department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).The BLS will release the closely watched employment report for November on 16 December. The report, originally due on 5 December, was delayed by the recently ended shutdown of the federal government. It will include non-farm payrolls for October. The unemployment rate for October will never be known as the longest federal government shutdown in history prevented the collection of data for the household survey from which the jobless rate is calculated.While the ADP has suggested a deterioration in labor market conditions, first-time applications for state unemployment benefits have been consistent with the “no hire, no fire” narrative. Economists say economic uncertainty stemming from tariffs has left the labor market in a state of paralysis.The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, with the unemployment rate rising to a four-year high of 4.4%.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment statisticsUS economyEconomicsUnemployment and employment statisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

They return back to what they know best: they return back to disinformation, pro-Trump propaganda and xenophobia. The election story and the election fraud claims was the perfect vehicle for them to get back on to their core messaging.”During oral arguments in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday afternoon, both sides pleaded with the judge to decide key aspects of the case – Smartmatic’s $2.7bn defamation lawsuit against Fox – in their favor before a potential trial next year.Connolly laid out the argument the company has been making since it filed the suit in early 2021: that Fox executives hatched a plan to “pivot” to embrace Trump’s claims of a stolen election in an effort to win back pro-Trump viewers who had grown frustrated with the network for calling the state of Arizona for Joe Biden on election night.K Winn Allen, a lawyer for Fox News, strongly contested Smartmatic’s claims about the Murdochs. “No disinformation campaign was ordered,” he said. “It is total bunk. It is not supported by the record. It is hogwash. It is made up by lawyers on the other side.”He said that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, who ultimately controlled the news network, serving as chair and executive chair of its parent, Fox Corporation, at the time, “didn’t give anyone any orders to cover Smartmatic or the election fraud allegations”.In depositions for the case, both Rupert Murdoch, whostepped down as chair of Foxtwo years ago, and Lachlan Murdoch, who remains the firm’s executive chair and CEO, denied they encouraged Fox News to air election fraud claims.To prevail in the case, Smartmatic will have to prove that key figures at Fox News knew the claims of election fraud being aired on the network – both by hosts and guests – were false but allowed them to be broadcast anyway.To help make their case for summary judgment,Smartmatic littered its motions with examplesof Fox employees expressing doubt about the fraud claims and talking dismissively about two figures who made many of the comments at issue, lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. In the motions, Smartmatic included internal communications showing that several Fox hosts – including Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo – expressed a desire to help Trump.Allen spent much of his 45-minute presentation arguing that Smartmatic has wildly inflated its value and made up improbable estimates of how much money it lost — and will lose in the future — because of Fox’s broadcasts.Fox has long argued that its hosts were merely discussing newsworthy allegations made by then-associates of the president, not endorsing them, or repeating them, out of a desire to harm Smartmatic’s business.“This suit really isn’t about Fox’s coverage of the 2020 election,” Allen said. “It’s about Smartmatic’s attempt to seize on comments made by the president’s lawyers to salvage its financial livelihood.”While Smartmatic asked the judge to make several pre-trial rulings in its favor, the company has said – and reiterated again on Tuesday – that it should be up to a jury to decide how much money the company should receive in damages.Cohen did not give any indications about which way he was leaning, but told Smartmatic’s lawyer that it would be a “hard sell” for him to grant summary judgment on the legal standard known as actual malice, which would mean he was convinced that Fox personnel knew the election claims were false, or had reason to believe they were very likely to be false.The judge said he planned to review all of the television broadcasts at issue in the case before issuing his rulings. “I think I have more than enough information, data, briefings, charts, graphs and everything I need to make my ruling,” he told the parties.The crux of the argument that Smartmatic has made mirrored the case made by another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, in its own defamation lawsuit against Fox. In that case, the judge’s ruling on similar motions for summary judgment proved critical. The Delaware superior court judge Eric M Davishad ruled that the statements made on Foxwere false and were defamatory per se, meaning obviously damaging to Dominion’s reputation.Viet D Dinh, who served as Fox’s chief legal and policy officer,later saidthat Davis’s pre-trial rulings had “hamstrung” the company and factored into its decision to pay $787.5m tosettle the case in April 2023and avert a trial.“We knew we were right in the law, [but] the trial judge put us in a situation increasingly where it was very obvious that we were not able to win the trial, but we were very confident we would prevail on appeal,” said Dinh.Explore more on these topicsMediaFox NewsUS elections 2020newsShareReuse this content"

Balaji, an Indian national, was previously the chief financial officer of Tata Motors, the Indian owner of JLR.Balaji was due to take over the reins of a business that was performing well, generating nearly three years of consecutive quarterly profits. However, any chance of a smooth transition was dashed by a crippling cyber-attack in August thatstopped all productionat JLR’s factories.JLR declined to comment on the departure and McGovern was still listed on the company’s website on Wednesday. Autocar India, which first reported on McGovern’s departure, said he had been removed with immediate effect.David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said the abrupt removal “has sent shock waves through the automotive world”. He said it would herald “much more than a routine management reshuffle” but rather “the symbolic end of an era” and was perhaps a sign that Tata was looking to exert more control.View image in fullscreenMcGovern at an event in LA in 2017.Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for JLRMcGovern returned to Land Rover in 2004 after an earlier stint and rose to be in charge of designing its key products, including its flagship Range Rover, its bestselling Range Rover Evoque and several other models.His stewardship includedhiring Victoria Beckhamas a creative design executive in 2010. In 2017, tensions emerged after Beckham said at the launch of a special VB Evoque: “I’ve designed a car that I want to drive, a car I think [her husband] David wants to drive.” McGovern latersaid: “She didn’t design the car … I’ve forgotten more than that woman will ever know about [car] designing – to be a car designer takes years.”McGovern was elevated to the role of JLR’s chief creative officer in 2021 by the then chief executive, Thierry Bolloré, giving him oversight of the struggling Jaguar brand as well. McGovern retained the role under Bolloré’s successor, Adrian Mardell.Bolloré had scrapped an advanced plan for an electric Jaguar that followed on from previous models, and McGovern was tasked with completely overhauling the brand in an effort to end years of weak sales.The product he came up with was amajor departurefrom previous, fairly traditional Jaguars. The Type 00 targeted wealthy, younger, international buyers rather than going head to head with BMW as another executive saloon car. It featured a large, angular design with no rear window, and the initial concept design was shown in pink and electric blue.The company faced a ferocious and at timeshate-filled backlashfrom some quarters after a teaser campaign featured several androgynous models. Elon Musk and Trump criticised whatTrump calleda “stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement”. McGovern, seen as assertive and sometimes combative by people with whom he has worked, said the car displayed “fearless creativity”.McGovern’s departure raises questions about how much of the concept car will survive into production, although prototype models were at a fairly advanced stage before the hack disrupted production plans. A person who has driven the car said it would wow drivers.The new electric Range Rover overseen by McGovern will also be a crucial car in JLR’s transition away from petrol and diesel. The design is nearly identical to the petrol version, but sales are expected to be delayed because of the cyber-attack. JLR hadinitially plannedto make the first deliveries by the end of this year.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.Red Baron frozen pizzas, listed on the shelf at $5, rang up at $7.65. Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture & consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits. But North Carolina law caps penalties at $5,000 per inspection, offering retailers little incentive to fix the problem. “Sometimes it is cheaper to pay the fines,” said Chad Parker, who runs the agency’s weights-and-measures program.View image in fullscreenChris Outlaw shops at Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina, on 24 November.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianThe dollar-store industry, including Family Dollar and its larger rival, Dollar General, promises everyday low prices for household essentials. But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.These overcharges are widespread.Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span, the review found.Among these thousands of failed inspections, some of the biggest flops include a 76% error rate in October 2022 at a Dollar General in Hamilton, Ohio; a 68% error rate in February 2023 at a Family Dollar in Bound Brook, New Jersey; and a 58% error rate three months ago at a Family Dollar in Lorain, Ohio.Many of the stores that failed state or local government checks were repeat violators. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.View image in fullscreenA price tag at Family Dollar on King Street in Windsor, North Carolina, on 24 November.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianThe chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney generalannounceda $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney generalsettledwith Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections. Dollar General has also settled withNew Jersey,VermontandWisconsin, and both companies have settled with Ohio.Linda Davis, a 64-year-old Family Dollar shopper in Dayton, Ohio, called the state attorney general’s office in February after walking home from the dollar store and discovering that 12 of her 23 purchases had rung up incorrectly. “I’m adding it up in my head as I’m shopping,” she told the Guardian. “But I was way off and I didn’t know why … I thought: where did I miscalculate? I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections. During the same period, Wisconsin’s Family Dollar stores failed 30% of their state inspections.View image in fullscreenA Dollar General store in Port Henry, New York, is one of two within a 5-mile radius.Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The GuardianAccording to industry watchers, employees and lawsuits, overcharges often stem from labor practices within the dollar-store sector. When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”‘The cheap stuff’When consumers feel economic pain,as they do nowthanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs,price gougingand other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores. These one-stop centers for inexpensive food, clothing and housewares tend to sell in small quantities, one $1 chicken-noodle-soup can at a time. And they are relatively easy to get to: 75% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Dollar General, according to the company.The industry’s largest player is flourishing. Todd Vasos, the CEO of Dollar General, told investors in August that his company’s quarterly sales had increased 5% over the same period last year. Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.View image in fullscreenChris Outlaw walks to his car after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianThose customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.View image in fullscreenThe King Street area of downtown Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianOne supermarket remains on the edge of town. Shopping for clothes often means driving to the next county, at least for those who drive. But Windsor does have three stores that help fill the gap: a Dollar General andtwoFamily Dollars.At the Family Dollar that failed multiple inspections, some regulars remain vigilant. Chris Outlaw, a 54-year-old hemodialysis technician, shops there because it’s near his house and workplace. Experience has taught him to buy only a few items at once and to examine his receipts. Not all his neighbors do the same. “I’ve seen people in there with baskets full,” he said. “You can just imagine how much of that stuff didn’t ring out right, and they had so much they couldn’t catch it.”‘Big old savings’Customers walking into Dollar General stores are often greeted by a bright yellow sign blaring “Hello, Low Prices”– and by as many as 10,000 items cramming shelves and, often, cluttering the aisles.“They will send you more than what you need of any product,” said Stephanie, a former lead sales associate in Louisiana. “Your shelf can only hold 10 Glade air fresheners, right? But they will send you 50.”Rarely is there enough staffing, current and former employees say, to complete all of the tasks expected of them, including stocking shelves, ringing up sales, looking out for shoplifters, mopping floors – and updating price changes and sales stickers.View image in fullscreenChris Outlaw squeezes through an aisle packed with merchandise inside Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianMore than two dozen current and former employees of the chain in 15 states interviewed by the Guardian agreed that price discrepancies are the byproduct of the company’s employment policies. (Most, including Stephanie, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.)Often there are only one or two people on duty. “You’re lucky if you get to work two to four hours of your eight- to 13-hour shift with another human being,” a former assistant manager in Illinois said.Every Tuesday, employees are supposed to print and post hundreds of shelf stickers representing price changes already updated in the computer system. On Saturdays, stacks of sales stickers arrive; often, workers are expected to remove all the previous week’s stickers by 5pm and put up new stickers – as many as 1,000 of them – before closing up that night. Stickers fail to get put up, they fall off easily, and they are confusing, with some sales instant and others linked to coupons. “I threw away tags sometimes, to keep me or a co-worker out of trouble,” Stephanie admitted.View image in fullscreenItems on shelves at the Mineville, New York, Dollar General that is 5 miles from the Port Henry location.Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The GuardianA former store manager at a Dollar General in Connecticut noted that many of his customers were poor or disabled enough that they got by on public assistance. “I didn’t want people to get screwed over, but I knew that it was happening,” he said. “If I’m in the store, I’m gonna try to do the best I can for them. But at the end of the day, they’re still probably gonna get overcharged for a few things.”Dollar General, in its statement, said it schedules time each week for “price change execution”, among other measures to ensure accuracy.Ten current and former employees in eight states claimed that – along with allowing pricing errors caused by understaffing and overstocking – some Dollar General stores engage in a tactic designed to fool customers: special sales that don’t actually lower the price of an item. A manager from Florida, for example, sent the Guardian two photos of price stickers for Café Bustelo ground coffee. In the first photo, a sticker said “SALE” in white block letters against a red background. It advertised a markdown from $7.95 to $6.50. In the second photo, the top sticker had been peeled away to show the original price: $6.50.A sales associate from Illinois sent photos showing cutlery with what he said was a fake original price of $8.50. “It’s trying to say that you’re making this big old savings by buying this item here,” explained the employee, “when it’s actually always been $6.95.”Dollar General declined to comment on these workers’ claims.‘We have little choice’When the Ohio attorney general, Dave Yost, sued Dollar General in 2022, he submitted 114 pages of customer complaints as part of the case.One of them came from Melanie Hutzler, who lives in Canton without a car and whose mobility is limited by arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Hutzler, 51, relies on government food assistance and said she was cautious about spending money. At the time of her complaint, she could reach two food stores on foot. Getting to the Save A Lot grocery required crossing a busy road, but getting to a Dollar General did not.“Every single time we went into that store, something would ring up wrong,” she told the Guardian. “They never had a manager there that would fix the prices.” Hutzler said she would walk the cashier over to the shelf and point out the listed price, only to be told, “There’s nothing we can do about it.”View image in fullscreenThe exterior of Family Dollar on King Street in Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianOther Ohioans expressed similar frustrations. “My 87-year-old mother and I have frequented Dollar General for years, and there have been innumerable times we have made purchases that were well higher than advertised,” wrote Robert Hevlin of Dayton. “My mother and I have literally lost thousands over the years with this company, but both of us being on social security, we have little choice in where we shop.”In September 2023, Yost reached a $1m settlement with Dollar General, which he said had error rates at some stores that ran as high as 88%. In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went tocharitable organizationsthat distribute food and personal-care items.Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.View image in fullscreenPrice tags and merchandise inside Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianDollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.‘This endless cycle’The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says onits website. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.View image in fullscreenKatelyn Miller at her home in Port Henry, New York, on 24 November.Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The GuardianOver the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%. One inspection yielded a 78% error rate, including overcharges on Flintstones vitamins, Peter Pan peanut butter and Prego pasta sauce.The Port Henry store is 5 miles from the Mineville Dollar General, which occupies a lonely stretch of country road across from an auto-repair shop with spare parts littering its lawn. Down the block, an abandoned church presides over a stretch of grass that looks like it hasn’t been mown for years.Aside from a whiskey warehousing operation and a health center, opportunities for employment are limited. The high-security prison built atop the iron mine for which Mineville is named closed in 2022, taking 100 jobs with it.The local playground is littered with trash, cigarette butts and the occasional syringe. The town “is nice from the outside”, said Katelyn Miller, a 26-year-old Port Henry resident who lives with her mother, six-year-old daughter and two-year-old son. But “you hear about a lot of crack-den places, like blowing up or getting busted.’” Drug use is rampant in the county, which is 92% white. “Everybody around here seems to be on pain meds or buying someone else’s, because they’re also working themselves to death.”When it comes to grocery shopping near Miller’s home, the choice is between the two Dollar Generals and a gas station/convenience store. “We live in a food desert,” she said, “even though you would think living in all this farmland, we would have more access.”View image in fullscreenAn abandoned church sits next door to the Mineville, New York, Dollar General store.Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The GuardianThere is a Walmart 30 minutes away, in Fort Ticonderoga. Miller said she recently bought salmon there only to arrive home and discover that the $20 piece of fish had gone bad. “So I had to go to Dollar General and get the Stouffer’s,” she said, adding that she feels “caught in this endless cycle of never having food that will nourish me and my family, and instead having to get 2,000 grams of sodium because at least it has meat”.The region’s economic straits put regulators in a bind when it comes to overcharges. Daniel Woods, the county’s director of weights and measures, said in 2023 that he didn’t always assess the full penalty on violators. “We’re not trying to put people out of business,” he told a local newspaper. “In some towns that’s their [only] store. I don’t want to pull that away from people, but at the same time, I’m trying to fix the problem.”On the way outWhen Coffield, the North Carolina inspector, visited the Windsor Family Dollar in April 2023, the pricing issues seemed to have abated. Of the 300 items he scanned, he only found five overcharges: incontinence pads, laundry sanitizer, two coffee products and, again, Red Baron pizza. With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.View image in fullscreenChris Outlaw looks at his receipt after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.Photograph: Cornell Watson/The GuardianDuring a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door. Two waiting customers said that they frequently paid prices higher than the shelf listing, including a cook whose nearby restaurant buys some of its ingredients there. “It is aggravating,” she said. “Very aggravating.”Workers reopened the doors after a few hours. Inside, carts of unshelved dog food and other merchandise blocked the aisles. The Guardian compared the prices of 15 items. Two of them rang up higher than advertised, including a frying pan set that was $10 on the shelf and $12 at the register. Though the cashier offered to honor the lower prices, that was still an error rate of 13% – more than six times the state’s standard.Explore more on these topicsUS newsThe price we payFoodSupermarketsNorth CarolinaRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is not the case now, and it is not what is proposed in the plan [ReSourceEU] but this is a wake up call, a strong wake up call,” said Séjourné.The EU said the strategy was designed to reduce the impact of “market shocks” such as the disruption to the car industry caused by the recent, now lifted, ban on exports of chips by Chinain response to the Dutch government taking control of the Chinese-owned chip firm Nexperia.The EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said Brussels remained committed to the concept of open access to its markets but that was being repeatedly exploited to the disadvantage of European industry, leaving it “fire fighting” a succession of crises.Séjourné said that “for the time being” the EU wanted to “remind” companies as part of the strategy, procurement bosses must communicate with their board of directors on “how they plan to diversify”.“This is a way for us to gently encourage them to diversify … if this were not the case … We reserve the right to use legislation to simply oblige companies to diversify a certain percentage of their supplies,” he said.Senior EU officials said that “while the direction is clear” there was a need to “accelerate the process” as China continued to “weaponise” its hold on raw materials for “geopolitical purposes”.To kickstart the implementation of the strategy, two projects, a molybdenum extraction in Greenland and a lithium mine in Germany will get immediate funding.The EU will also look at financial support to enable companies to buy from more expensive sources than China and it will set up a “raw materials platform” that will pool company orders and build joint stockpiles.New restrictions will be introduced on scrap exports in 2026 of the metal and of scrap copper if necessary.View image in fullscreenDemand for lithium is expected to increase nearly sixtyfold by 2050. More than 78% of the EU’s lithium needs in 2020 came from Chile.Photograph: Luis Bustamante/The GuardianIllustrating the scale of the reliance on Beijing, EU officials revealed that the bloc buys about 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year, used in everything from car and fridge doors to MRI machines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The eSafety Commissioner had previously warned it was closely monitoring the app for possible inclusion in the ban.Australia’s eSafety commissioner rejects US Republican’s assertion she is a ‘zealot for global takedowns’Read moreAhead of Wells’ address to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Google said it will begin signing out underage users from its platform from 10 December, but warned it would mean children and their parents would lose access to safety features.Googlehad strongly opposed YouTube’s inclusion in the ban, after initially being exempted from the framework. Google hadraised prospects of a legal challengeto the ban, but Wednesday’s statement did not elaborate on that potential, and Google sources declined to comment.Rachel Lord, Google’s senior manager for public policy in Australia, saidin a blog postthat users under 16s will still be able to watch YouTube videos in a signed-out state, but that children would lose access to “features that only work when you are signed into an account, including subscriptions, playlists and likes, and default wellbeing settings such as “Take a Break” and Bedtime Reminders”.She also warned that parents “will lose the ability to supervise their teen or tween’s account on YouTube”, such as content settings blocking specific channels.Lord wrote: “This rushed regulation misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it. Most importantly, this law will not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.”While not flagging any legal options, Lord added: “We are committed to finding a better path forward to keep kids safe online.”Speaking to the National Press Club, Wells said parents could set up control and safety settings on YouTube Kids, a separate platform not included in the ban.“I find it outright weird that YouTube is always at pains to remind us all how unsafe their platform is in a logged-out state. If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe and there’s content not appropriate for age-restricted users on their website, that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,” she said.View image in fullscreenAnika Wells speaks at the National Press Club on Wednesday.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPBut Wells also conceded the government’s plans to bar under-16s from social media might take “days or even weeks” to properly take effect.“We know it won’t be perfect from day one but we won’t give up – and we won’t let the platforms off the hook,” Wells said.Wells praised the advocacy of families of children who had ended their lives after online bullying and mental health issues, saying the changes would “protect generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms.” She claimed social media platforms deliberately targeted teenagers to maximise engagement and profits.“These companies wield an incredible power we willingly hand over to them because of the benefits the platform bring to us.

It will then seek data monthly.In a press conference in Adelaide on Tuesday, Wells foreshadowed more platforms being added to the under-16s ban if children migrated to sites not currently listed.She told media to “stay tuned” for news about Lemon8, an Instagram-style app not included in the ban. Guardian Australia understands the eSafety Commission has written to Lemon8 – owned by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance – to say the agency would monitor the platform for possible inclusion after the scheme begins.Guardian Australia can reveal Lemon8 has decided to restrict its users to those aged over 16 from 10 December.“If everybody ends up on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn becomes a place where there is online bullying, algorithms targeting 13-to-16-year-olds in a way that’s deteriorating their mental and physical health, then we will go after LinkedIn,” Wells said on Tuesday.“That’s why all platforms are on notice.

Anyone have the square marked “owner and star playeraccused of skirting the salary capthrough improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after thewee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”.Chris Paul ‘sent home’ by reeling LA Clippers in stunning late-night moveRead moreThe Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister.The decorated vet in question is 40-year-oldChris Paul, who posted via an Instagram story that the Clippers were sending him home from their ongoing road trip. Lawrence Frank, the Clippers’ president of basketball operations, confirmed the news in a statementto ESPN: “We are parting ways with Chris, and he will no longer be a part of the team.” Frank added of Paul, amidst bland platitudes of his status as a Clippers icon, “I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance.” Clearly.Paul joined the Clippers in 2011 and helped launch their long run of winning seasons before departing in 2017. (His eventual trade to Houston brought back seven players, a protected 2018 first-round pick and the better part of a million dollars.) In LA he averaged 18.8 points and 9.8 assists, made three All-NBA first teams and turned the franchise intoLob Citywith those feathered lobs to Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan – finally giving a long-moribund club both identity and excitement. He stole the ball so relentlessly he mangled his own fingers, his gnarled digits earninga feature in the New York Times. People called him the “Point God”. He’ll be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, all while standing just six feet tall. He never won a championship, making only the one NBA Finals appearance with the Phoenix Suns in 2021, but his Clippers years earned him enormous acclaim. Which is why returning in 2025clearly meant so much– Paul accepted a reserve role for one last season, and the fans embraced the homecoming just as deeply.View image in fullscreenThe Clippers introduce Chris Paul during a press conference in July at Intuit Dome in Los Angeles.Photograph: Juan Ocampo/NBAE/Getty ImagesThe honeymoon didn’t last very long. Time dulls even the sharpest skills, however intact the instincts remain. Paul averaged just over 14 minutes and three points a game in his return. And, according to ESPN’sstyle-challenged scoop machine Shams Charania, he had been “vocal in holding management, coaches and players accountable, which the team felt became disruptive”, even going weekswithout speaking to Tyronn Lue. Was Paul truly so irritating that exile was the only option, or is management flailing for answers amid a grisly run of results? For anyone who thought injury was the only potential snag in this feelgood reunion, consider this a reminder: losing opens every old wound. What began as a heartwarming final-season subplot has now ended abruptly and awkwardly.It only makes the Clippers – tied with the tragic Sacramento Kings for second-last in the West (thank god for the Pelicans, somehow worse than both) – look even more dysfunctional. Tell a new NBA fan, or an alien, that this team went life and death with Nikola Jokić’s imperious Denver Nuggets in last season’s playoffs and they’d stare back in confusion. Only the 4-17 Indiana Pacers, a game away from the NBA Finals trophy six months ago, have fallen harder. At least they can blame a brutal run of injuries.As for Paul? His career will remain broadly respected and fondly remembered, this unfortunate final chapter aside. The one lingering regret is the obvious one: the missing championship. Sentiment surely played a role in his decision to return, but so did the chance – however slim – to chase that elusive Larry O’Brien trophy with a team that looked strong last spring. He won’t be winning with the Clippers now. And unless their early-season collapse is some grand basketball mirage, they won’t be winning without him either.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles ClippersNBASteve BallmerBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the 94th minute and Federico Chiesa was waving his arms in front of Liverpool fans, rejoicing not in delivering a victory befitting his job as a striker but in saving thePremier Leaguechampions from certain defeat. Sunderland should consider their point at Anfield as an opportunity missed.Chiesa’s celebration followed his goalline clearance to denySunderlanda first win at Anfield since October 1983. Slot, though restrained in his technical area, must have been tempted to join in. His team were staring at a 10th defeat in 14 games when Wilson Isidor, on as a Sunderland substitute, raced through from goalkeeper Robin Roefs’s smart pass and rounded Alisson in the Liverpool goal. Chiesa, on as a substitute as Slot chased victory, had abandoned his attacking instincts to track back and produced a vital block. Liverpool were spared another inquest, just about.Liverpool 1-1 Sunderland: Premier League – liveRead more“In the final minutes I thought we were close to making it 2-1 because we had a few set pieces and were constantly around their box,” Slot said. “But then from one set piece their goalkeeper gets the ball and when I looked up I saw their player completely free on the halfway line. The good thing is Fede could have thought it had nothing to do with him but he kept sprinting back and made a good block. The draw was the minimum we deserved.”That was a positive take on proceedings by theLiverpoolhead coach. The Premier League champions were again subdued on home soil and, although they did put Sunderland under pressure late on, rarely threatened to cancel out Chemsdine Talbi’s deflected opener until Florian Wirtz forced Nordi Mukiele to unwittingly concede an 81st‑minute own goal. Roefs made only routine saves as Liverpool then pushed for what would have been a flattering victory. “The players are discovering a new league,” the Sunderland head coach, Régis Le Bris, said. “It is our debut in this league and I think we are learning fast.” Le Bris’s assessment was more accurate than his opposite number’s.Few could have predicted that the newly promoted Sunderland would be above the reigning champions in the table come December but they showed why in a high-tempo, confident opening. Brian Brobbey led the line impressively on his first Premier League start and engaged Ibrahima Konaté in a constant physical battle. Close support from Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée ensured the Liverpool defence were never comfortable in the first half.View image in fullscreenChemsdine Talbi’s shot flies beyond Alisson to give Sunderland the lead.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockDominik Szoboszlai presented the visitors with their first genuine opportunity. Trai Hume took possession of the Liverpool midfielder’s loose touch and let fly from 25 yards. Alisson could only push Hume’s effort on to his crossbar and was relieved to see the rebound bounce clear.Liverpool promised only in flashes. Wirtz and Alexander Isak looked to build on their improvements at West Ham on Sunday but received little service as carelessness characterised Liverpool’s play. Alexis Mac Allister did come close to opening the scoring but his free header from a Joe Gomez cross struck the base of a post.Mohamed Salah was left on the bench for the second game in succession, the first time that has happened in his phenomenal Liverpool career, but introduced at the start of the second half with Slot having seen enough aimless attacking play. Salah replaced the anonymous Cody Gakpo with Szoboszlai shifting into his favoured central role and Wirtz out to the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool were unable to capitalise on the let-off. Their performance was not good enough to do so.Five minutes after the defender’s warning shot Sunderland took the lead following an error by Virgil van Dijk. The Liverpool captain mis-controlled and misplaced an attempted clearance straight to Le Fée. The playmaker fed Talbi who, in space on the right, took aim with a shot that struck Van Dijk on the backside and sailed beyond Alisson into the far corner. It was the 11th time in the past 14 games that Liverpool had conceded first and the Anfield crowd did not hide its annoyance when Isak and Andy Robertson squandered possession cheaply in quick succession.This time there would be a response. Sunderland were holding out comfortably when a lapse in concentration by Talbi invited Curtis Jones to steal the ball off his toes. Wirtz took over inside the Sunderland box and weaved his way past Reinildo Mandava and Dan Ballard brilliantly before swiping at goal. His shot was sailing wide but struck Mukiele and diverted in.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was not even particularly memorable. There was an enterprising start fromArsenal, who delighted the Emirates Stadium when a lovely move ended with Merino scoring for the second time in four days, but their attacking flow faded after the opening 20 minutes and they ended up leaning on their resilience after the loss of Cristhian Mosquera to injury before half-time increased their issues at the back.A more fragile side would have wilted in those circumstances. Yet Arsenal coped without Mosquera – the unfamiliar partnership of Jurriën Timber and Piero Hincapié holding firm – and their 18-match unbeaten run in all competitions is testament to their steel, as well as how their deep squad is holding out despite the absence of key players in defence and attack.The leaders are, of course, being stretched as the weeks go by and the fixtures pile up. Declan Rice limped off with a calf problem during the closing stages – “We need to check on him,” Arteta said of the midfielder – and it will be tougher when Arsenal visit Aston Villa on Saturday. Losing Mosquera when Gabriel Magalhães and William Saliba are already missing in central defence is clearly not ideal and, coupled with the worries over Rice, left Arteta grumbling about the schedule after a draining period.“Give us another day [to prepare],” the manager said. “We’re all going to benefit. We’ve never had such schedule – not only in the Premier League but every competition internationally as well. It’s common sense. The players are not machines.”Although Arteta does not have a reputation for tinkering, part of his focus has to be on preserving energy levels during this slog of a season. He cannot overplay key assets and the benefit of freshening things up was evident during a start in which Arsenal did not appear to be carrying any extra weight after facing Tottenham, Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the space of a week.This is why Arteta invested so much in bolstering his resources last summer. Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard are still missing up front but what a luxury it is to be able to give Eberechi Eze a breather and bring in Martin Ødegaard. There was also a rest for Saka, whose place on the right went to Madueke, while Timber dropping to the bench meant Ben White came in for his second league start of the season.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka’s powerful strike makes sure for Arsenal.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAIt was not a surprise that Arteta singled out White for praise. The right‑back has had a terrible time with injuries but this bustling performance was a step in the right direction. “I’m very happy for him as a human being,” said Arteta, who loved both White’s powerful defending and how the 28-year-old’s overlapping runs ensured that his partnership with Madueke clicked early on.There were 11 minutes on the clock when they combined for the opening goal. White began the move with a lay-off to Madueke and confused Rico Henry by continuing his run. TheBrentfordwing-back was in clear danger. Henry watched for the dart inside from Madueke but that was a decoy. Madueke waited for help and then opened Brentford up with a drag‑back to White, who reached the byline and hung up a cross for Merino to head past Caoimhín Kelleher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Consistency is the key for the England player. He should have scored before half-time only to spurn three opportunities, and he faded before making way for Saka in the 61st minute.Brentford, who started with Nathan Collins, Jordan Henderson, Mikel Damsgaard and Igor Thiago on the bench, had forced their way back into the contest. They almost equalised when Kevin Schade met a corner from the right, only for David Raya to tip the forward’s header on to the bar. “We caused them problems,” Keith Andrews, Brentford’s manager, said. “We made it uncomfortable.”Arsenal were tense after an awkward fall led to Mosquera making way for Timber. Brentford could not make their physicality count. They forced a succession of set pieces but did not test Raya even after introducing Henderson, Damsgaard and Thiago. It grew tense. Riccardo Calafiori and Rice were denied by Kelleher and there were howls from the home fans when the fourth official’s board showed six added minutes.Not to worry. Moments later Merino released Saka, who squeezed a shot past Kelleher. Arsenal did enough again.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However the Olympic long‑jump champion, Miltiadis Tentoglou, described the proposal as “dog shit” because it took much of the skill out of the event, while the former track and field athlete Carl Lewis, who won four Olympic long‑jump medals, called it an “April fool’s joke”.“The athletes do not want to embrace it,” Ridgeon said. “So we’re not going to do it. Even though I would argue we identified a problem, and found a viable solution, if the athletes don’t want it, fine, we drop it. But I don’t regret looking at that. It’s our job as the governing body.”WorldAthleticstrialled the idea this year after research found that around a third of long jumps at championships were no-jumps and that reduced the interest of fans. “From the emotional reaction of the crowd, they lose energy with no‑jumps,” Ridgeon said.“We said: ‘Can we solve that exam question?’ And we created the concept of a wider takeoff zone. We trialled that solution and it trialled well.”View image in fullscreenNikola Horowska of Poland jumps with the takeoff zone at a test event in Berlin this year.Photograph: Maryam Majd/Getty ImagesWhen it wastested at two events, World Athletics found the number of no‑jumps dropped to 13% and spectators enjoyed the new format. Most of the athletes, however, remained implacably opposed – but Ridgeon said World Athletics did not lament attempting to improve the event. “We would be accused of being asleep at the wheel if we didn’t look for weaknesses,” he said.“The long jump’s a really exciting and vibrant part of our sport.

The pressure had been mounting after a run of four successive defeats that had dropped the side into the relegation zone, and left speculation swirling over Daniel Farke’s future at the club.Arsenal 2-0 Brentford, Leeds 3-1 Chelsea, and more: Premier League – liveRead moreHowever, this comprehensive and deserved victory againstChelseawas a performance that had all the hallmarks of Wilkinson’s great teams of the 1990s – aggression, energy and quality. Wilkinson was given a standing ovation at half-time when he was inducted into the National Football Hall of Fame.The result not only moved Leeds out of the bottom three, but perhaps alleviated some of the pressure on Farke in the process. He switched to a back three for the first time this season in a response to Leeds’s recent woes, and it paid off in some style. From minute one, the hosts were the superior team and Chelsea had little in the way of an answer on a night they will be keen to forget and move on from quite quickly.As for Leeds, this will be an occasion they will cherish and one they will hope to build upon with the stuttering champions, Liverpool, the visitors on Saturday.First-half goals from Jaka Bijol and Ao Tanaka put the hosts into a deserved two-goal lead by half-time and, while Chelsea responded with a Pedro Neto goal after the restart, Dominic Calvert-Lewin exploited a shambolic defensive error with 18 minutes to go to ensure there would be no doubt over the outcome.View image in fullscreenJaka Bijol heads Leeds into an early lead from a corner.Photograph: Chris Radburn/Reuters“It’s been a long time coming,” Farke said. “The players deserve to have a night like this because I can’t remember one poor home performance in the last 15 months.”Inspired by his tactical adjustment, Leeds were magnificent in the early exchanges. Bijol’s thunderous header from an Anton Stach corner broke the deadlock inside five minutes and a raft of chances came the hosts’ way thereafter, too. They finally took one of them as half‑time approached when Tanaka beat Robert Sánchez from long-range to double Leeds’s advantage.In response, Chelsea offered little. Whether they were jaded from theirexploits against Arsenalthree days earlier is unclear, but this was a performance way below the levels they have delivered this season, with not a single shot on target in the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea struggled to mount a meaningful threat for an equaliser and when Tosin Adarabioyo fumbled inside his own area, the ensuing scramble led to the excellent Calvert‑Lewin tapping into an empty net to spark jubilant scenes among the home support.By full time, all seemed well in this part of West Yorkshire as Farke celebrated with the home support.

The result moved Celtic level on points withHearts, who remain top of theScottish Premiershipon goal difference despite being held to a 1-1 draw at home againstKilmarnock.

He won the MLS Cup with Columbus Crew in 2023 and the Leagues Cup in 2024, when he was named MLS coach of the year. He also took the Crew to theConcacaf Champions Cup finallast year.Nancy said in a club statement: “I am so happy to be namedCelticmanager, it is a massive honour for myself and my family. Before I say anything else I want to do one thing – I want to thank the great Martin O’Neill and Shaun Maloney for all they have done in recent weeks with the team. The job they have done has been fantastic.“These guys have given so much to the club across so many years and I know our fans, likeme, all recognise the brilliant job they have done during this recent period. They have my total respect and my total gratitude.“I hope to meet them both very soon and thank them personally.

The Crew bowed out in round one of the MLS playoffs against Cincinnati.Celtic’s principal shareholder, Dermot Desmond – who issued a scathing statement on Rodgers after his exit – had far warmer words for the new manager. “We believe we have brought a hugely talented manager to the club,” he said in a statement.“He is a man who absolutely understands the demands at Celtic, he is a man of real humility but also someone with his own ideas, his own vision and such a personal drive and desire to do well for the club and our supporters.“Everyone at the club will unite strongly behind Wilfried as we move forward and we will ensure we will give him our unswerving support as we strive to achieve our objectives.”The Celtic chair, Peter Lawwell, said:“We are really pleased to welcome Wilfried to Celtic.

The organization said Crawford had not paid its required fees from that victory or from his previous bout in 2024, despite “multiple” attempts to contact him and his team.Terence Crawford’s career-defining win over Canelo Álvarez was a victory for substance over styleRead moreWith the title now vacant, the WBC has ordered its interim champion Christian Mbilli to face Sheeraz for the belt. The 26-year-old from Ilford made an explosive arrival to the division in July whenhe demolished local favorite Edgar Berlangaat the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. A win over Mbilli would make Sheeraz Britain’s newest world champion in one of boxing’s glamour divisions.Crawford’s situation reflects a familiar tension in the sport. Sanctioning bodies such as the WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO all charge fighters a percentage of their purse – typically around 3% – to compete for their belts. The fees have long been controversial, with critics arguing that the organizations wield significant power while operating with minimal oversight.In Crawford’s case, the WBC says it lowered the fee for his fight against Álvarez from 3% to 0.6% because of his reported $50m (£37.6m) purse – an amount believed to be roughly $300,000 – and planned to send most of that money to a charity fund that supports retired fighters. Still, the 38-year-old Nebraskan reportedly did not respond to any communication regarding the payments.“It’s very unfortunate,” WBC president Mauricio Sulaimán said as he announced the ruling at the governing body’s annual convention in Bangkok. He described the lack of reply as “a slap in the face”, though Crawford has not commented publicly and it remains unclear whether the missed payments were a deliberate choice or simply a case of a superstar with other priorities.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford defeated Canelo Álvarez in September to become the undisputed champion at 168lb.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesWhat is clear is that his reign as undisputed champion has ended almost as quickly as it began. Crawford still holds the WBO, IBF and WBA belts, but has hinted he may drop back down to middleweight for future fights.For Sheeraz, the backroom politics matter far less than the opportunity that has materialized before him. Mbilli, a French-Cameroonian based in Montreal who is unbeaten in 30 bouts, is a high-pressure, high-volume fighter, while the 6ft 3in Sheeraz brings physical advantages of 6½in in height and 3in in reach. Their meeting, yet to be formally scheduled, promises to be one of the most significant British fights of the first half of next year.Already the first man of the four-belt era to fully unify the titles in two different divisions, Crawford did it in a third when scaled two weight classes and won a dominant 12-round unanimous decision over Álvarez before a record crowd of 70,482 at Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium, an achievement without precedent in modern boxing. The 168lb title made him a five-weight champion, having previously captured belts from 135lb through 154lb.Two weeksafter the career-defining win, Crawfordwas involved in a contentious police stopin his hometown. Hours after Omaha held a parade in his honor, officers ordered him out of his car at gunpoint during a late-night traffic stop for alleged reckless driving. Video of the incident circulated widely and prompted the police chief to open an internal investigation.Crawford’s security chief said he feared for their safety, while the mayor called for a full review and stressed the importance of maintaining trust between police and the community. No arrests were made.Explore more on these topicsTerence CrawfordBoxingSport politicsUS sportsCanelo ÁlvareznewsShareReuse this content"

They’ll do so again in MLS Cup on SaturdayAlexander AbnosWed 3 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.21 ESTShareThis was the matchup Thomas Müller wanted.“My history with [Messi] forces me to hope for a final against Miami,” the former Bayern Munich and Germany startold Calen Carrin a recent interview previewing the MLS playoffs ahead for his new side, the Vancouver Whitecaps.And what a history it is. The two giants of world soccer have met 11 times for club and country at senior level, with Müller’s team coming out on top in eight of those contests. Muller has scored seven times to Messi’s three. No wonder, perhaps, that the German keeps getting asked for his secret to stopping Messi, and how much, if any of it, can be passed on to his Whitecaps teammates ahead of the pair’s 12th meeting – barring injury – inMLSCup this Saturday.Purists be damned: why title-deciding playoffs make soccer sing | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreMessi place in history is so often positioned in relation to Cristiano Ronaldo, helped in part by the near-constant meetings between the two during their times atBarcelonaand Real Madrid. Messi’s rivalry with Müller, such as it even exists, is a different animal. The two have not played against each other often, but when they have, it has usually meant a whole lot. Looking back over their past meetings, it’s striking how often a crushing defeat led to the end of one era or another, how a single goal shifted fortunes of the teams and teammates around them, and how through their matchups one can track the rise and fall of any number of players, coaches, and trends.Here, then, are all 11 instances where Messi met Müller, ranked from least to most consequential for the players, their teams, the fans, and the sport at large.11. Bayern Munich 2-0 Barcelona24 July 2013Uli Hoeness Cup (friendly) | Allianz Arena, Munich, GermanyIt’s a club friendly; practically the dictionary definition of an inconsequential match. Barcelona started with a full-strength side but made 11 changes at half-time. Bayern made 10 substitutions over the course of the match. The most interesting things here are for MLS heads: Ilie Sánchez played for Barcelona, years before turning out for Sporting KC, Los Angeles FC, and Austin FC. Another one specifically for Sporting KC fans: Jordi Quintilla, who scored the winning penalty in the 2015 US Open Cup final, played the second-half alongside Ilie for Barça. Neither Messi nor Müller did much of consequence.10. Germany 1-3 Argentina5 August 2012Friendly | Deutsche Bank Park, Frankfurt, GermanyMüller ended up exiting this one after just 32 minutes due to a tactical substitution, serving as the sacrifice after goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler was sent off. Messi’s future Barcelona teammate Marc-André ter Stegen came on in place of Müller and promptly saved Messi’s penalty. Messi would later score with a trademark low finish.1:20Lionel Messi just had the best season in MLS history. But does anyone care? – video9. Bayern Munich 3-2 Barcelona12 May 2015Champions League semi-final second leg | Allianz Arena, Munich, GermanyMüller scored the winner in this one, but it was about as hollow a winning goal as you’re likely to get in this matchup in the Champions League. Bayern’s 3-2 win still left them down 6-3 on aggregate after coming apart in the first leg, sending Barcelona into a Champions League final they would win. This was the peak of the Messi-Neymar-Luis Suárez trio, and on this night it was the latter two who shone brightest, with Neymar scoring twice on Suárez assists within 29 minutes.“This tie was already dead, buried and ceremonially despatched with half an hour gone,”wrote Barney Ronayfor the Guardian.8. Germany 0-1 Argentina3 March 2010Friendly | Allianz Arena, Munich, GermanyThe first-ever meeting between Müller and Messi was only mildly consequential at the time – it was just a friendly, after all. But it went on to be a reference point when the two sides met in that year’s World Cup quarter-finals – somethingArgentinamanager Diego Maradona seemed to have an inkling of.“This game had the character of a World Cup quarter-final,”he said after his side’s 1-0 win, presumably having watched it through a crystal ball (or maybe not, considering Argentina would go on to lose the quarter-final 4-0).Aside from setting the stage for the World Cup match to come, perhaps the most important thing to come out of this game is that it gave Müller, then just 20, his debut with the national team, in the stadium where he’d go on to be a fixture at club level for the next 15 years. Messi performed well (“I thank God that Messi is Argentinian,” Maradona quipped), but was kept off the scoresheet.7. PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich14 February 2023Champions League last-16 first leg | Parc Des Princes, Paris, FranceView image in fullscreenLionel Messi collects the ball from deep and tries in vain to beat half the Bayern Munich side at the Parc des Princes stadium.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesMessi’s first match against Bayern in PSG colors could have gone better for him, as the PSG academy product Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the game for the German side. Messi, paired with Neymar up top with Kylian Mbappé coming off the bench due to injury, was forced to drop deep in order to get anything going for the home side.“A Paris Saint-Germain team with Neymar and Messi installed as a walking-football front two produced a horribly constipated performance … that threatens to deadhead their season before the end of February,”wrote Barney Ronayfor the Guardian.Müller, in a rarity for him in these games, came off the bench in the victory.6. Bayern Munich 4-0 Barcelona23 April 2013Champions League semi-final first leg | Allianz Arena, Munich, GermanyMüller fizzed along with the rest ofBayern Munichin a complete domination of a Barcelona side seemingly in disarray in one of Tito Villanova’s last matches in charge before leaving the club for health reasons. Müller scored a header, provided an assist with another header, and capped off the result with a sliding finish to seal the result.Messi,wrote Daniel Taylor for the Guardian, “was peripheral, looking increasingly forlorn as the game went on, hands on hips and shaking his head. He had a stinker.” The hamstring injury that limited him for this game would keep him out of the second leg, which Bayern won 3-0 to secure their spot in the Champions League final, where they would claim the title.5.

It would be the last Champions League match of this era for the Parisian club, who subsequently hired Luis Enrique and became the European champions we know today.This match stands out for another reason: It was Messi’s last in European competition. Three months after this loss, Messi would announce he was leaving PSG, with an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia in the interim fueling rumors that would be his next stop. Instead, he landed in Miami, and immediately started serving up memorable moments again.But in this game,wrote Jonathan Liewin the Guardian, “Messi sank to his haunches, a thunderous look upon his face, a man perhaps realising the true scale of the farce to which he was devoting his last footballing years.”Müller started, teaming up with Leon Goretzka to provide the opening goal for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. Bayern would run into the Manchester City buzzsaw in the next round.As his career ends in MLS, Sergio Busquets’ small decisions remain perfectRead more4. Germany 4-0 Argentina3 July 2010World Cup quarter-final | Green Point Stadium, Cape Town, South AfricaThe buildup to this one was, in the words of the Guardian’s Paul Hayward, “enjoyably acrimonious.” Germany’s Bastian Schweinsteiger said of Argentina: “You see their body language, how they gesticulate, how they try to influence the referee. That is not part of the game. That is a lack of respect. It’s their mentality and character and we’ll have to adjust.”Germany adjusted plenty, tearing apart Argentina’s midfield en route to a dominant win. Müller opened the scoring, losing Nicolas Otamendi on a set piece and heading Schweinsteiger’s free-kick into the back of the net – his fourth international goal of what would become a haul of 45. Such was the dominance of Germany that Messi barely had any opportunities at all.3. Barcelona 3-0 Bayern Munich6 May 2015Champions League semi-final first leg | Camp Nou, Barcelona, SpainView image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Lionel Messi (L) vies with Bayern Munich’s forward Thomas Müller during the first leg of their Champions League semi-final in 2015.Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was a primary narrative heading into this one – Pep Guardiola’s return to Camp Nou as manager of Bayern – but it ended up becoming known for one of Messi’s finest performances. Messi contributed to all three goals on the night, assisting one and scoring two, one of which resulted in poor Jérôme Boatengfalling into meme-dom. Müller, meanwhile, hung tough with Bayern until Messi’s breakthrough in the 77th minute, then exited in favor of Mario Götze.As Sid Lowewrote for the Guardian: “Guardiola’s night became Messi’s night yet again, his name ringing round this stadium once more, the homage in Catalonia reserved for him and all else forgotten amid the euphoria.”Pitch Points: Pep’s next thousand games; will Messi drag Miami to glory?Read more2. Bayern Munich 8-2 Barcelona14 August 2020Champions League quarter-final | Estadio La Luz, Lisbon, PortugalIt’s one of those scorelines – like7-1, in another game involving Müller – that almost needs no further explanation. Utter humiliation behind closed doors in the Covid-19-era Champions League knockouts led Messi to send his first request to leave the club he had been at since childhood, sending English-speakers the world over Googling what a “burofax” is and the Barcelona hierarchy scrambling to keep him in place. Messi ended up staying for just one more season, but this defeat was the truest sign that the high times Messi and Barcelona enjoyed throughout the 2010s were well and truly over.“History will not be kind to the people who make the decisions at the Camp Nou. They deserve nothing but scorn for squandering Lionel Messi’s talent,”wrote Jacob Steinbergfor the Guardian.Müller was brilliant, along with the rest of Bayern, scoring twice and registering an assist. “He is a footballer who knows how to win,”wrote Barney Ronayfor the Guardian, “who understands the movements around him, the way the space opens and closes.”Beyond the scoreline, the match contains a number of other spots of intrigue: This would be Suárez’s last match as Messi’s teammate before joining him in Miami. Bayern’s head coach, Hansi Flick, is now in charge of Barcelona. In the lineup for Bayern that day was Alphonso Davies, having come through the academy of theVancouver Whitecaps, where Müller now plays.1.

Next to Götze’s winning goal, the match has been remembered for all the chances Argentina missed, including a confounding Messi opportunity he pulled wide in the second half. Müller went the full 120 minutes, helping Germany eke out a tense final that ended, strangely enough, with Messi receiving the Golden Ball for the tournament’s best player.“We deserved a bit more after the match we played,”Messi said afterward.The result capped an astonishing comeback story for German soccer, with Müller at the center of much of the on-field reinvention. It also increased Argentina’s desperation to make the most of the tail end of Messi’s prime and bring a long-awaited third star to the nation’s crest – something they’d have to wait until 2022 to accomplish.Explore more on these topicsLionel MessiGermanyArgentinaBarcelonaBayern MunichParis Saint-GermainInter MiamifeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Aston Villa manager believes he became a better coach after witnessing his Paris Saint-Germain side surrender a three-goal advantage against Barcelona in 2017 in the Champions League gamethat became known asLa Remontada. This time it was the Spaniard who had the last laugh as Villa hit back with two goals for Ollie Watkins on his recall to the side before Amadou Onana and Donyell Malen condemned Brighton to their first home defeat of the season.Fabian Hürzeler had talked up his side’s chances of challenging for the top four after three wins in their previous four matches. But having raced into a two-goal lead thanks to Jan Paul van Hecke’s controversial opener and an own goal from Pau Torres, his side showed they remain naive at the back despite Lewis Dunk making his 500th appearance for the club. Hürzeler was still a youth player at Bayern Munich when his captain made his first, in League One against Port Vale in 2010, and the German is still searching for consistency after a promising start to the season.Merino and Saka down Brentford to restore Arsenal’s five-point cushionRead more“The goals we conceded were out of nowhere. The small margins cost us,” said the disappointed Brighton manager.The same cannot be said for the effervescent Emery, who was in despair when his side found themselves 2-0 down but jumped for joy when the substitute Malen scrambled home the fourth goal. Villa have won their last six matches in all competitions – including four in thePremier League– and look genuine contenders to qualify for the Champions League again, having moved up to third.Emery’s best-laid plans suffered a major blow when for the second time this season the goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was injured in a warm-up. His replacement, Marco Bizot, did not have the most auspicious start when he conceded from a corner after nine minutes. But the Dutchman was Villa’s hero in injury time when he saved from Danny Welbeck after Van Hecke had briefly stirred hopes of a Brighton comeback with his second of the night.“We are showing resilience in every match,” said Emery, whose side face the league leaders, Arsenal, on Saturday. “How we reacted is like the season. We started poor but we are adding experiences and today was one more.”View image in fullscreenMarco Bizot makes an early error to allow Jan Paul van Hecke to open the scoring for Brighton.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockVan Hecke had made the most of his compatriot’s blunder to open the scoring when Bizot completely misjudged the flight of a corner and Van Hecke was eventually able to bundle the ball home.Emery’s mood was not improved when replays showed that the corner should never have been given in the first place, the ball having deflected off Brighton’s Stefanos Tzimas.Fifa announced plans this weekfor video assistant referees to intervene in the awarding of corners at next year’s World Cup, although there are no such plans to introduce this into domestic leagues.Villa’s recent run of victories has been largely built on defensive solidity. Yet they looked extremely vulnerable whenever Brighton poured forward in the first half an hour.Even a long delay when Tzimas was carried off after catching his knee in the turf could not halt their momentum and the hosts had another lucky break when a cross from his replacement, Jack Hinshelwood, deflected off Torres to double their lead.At that stage Emery looked as though he might explode. Having been denied a penalty for Carlos Baleba’s challenge on Ian Maatsen, Villa were handed a lifeline when Watkins was able to pull one back through sheer determination as he converted the Dutchman’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But having already seen Watkins – one of his rivals for a place in England’s World Cup squad – steal a march on him, the veteran could only watch in disbelief when he diverted a wayward shot goalwards and Bizot leapt to tip it over the crossbar.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was the fourth time this season that Burnley failed to score in sevenPremier Leaguehome games and they barely looked like they would. Palace’s three centre-backs kept everyone quiet with ease, allowing Marc Guéhi the freedom to wander up the pitch to create Daniel Muñoz’s winner with arguably the only quality piece of play of the night. The goalkeepers were more at risk of frostbite than being called into action for most of the match.Arsenal 2-0 Brentford, Leeds v Chelsea, and more: Premier League – liveRead moreTaking points off teams like Palace at home feels imperative. After averaging two shots on target in their first six home games, Scott Parker tried a more attacking lineup in the hope of putting the visitors under pressure. Considering Palace’s tired performance in defeat against Manchester United on Sunday, leading to Glasner’s demanding reinforcements, the home side may have arrived optimistic but their visitors battled through to victory.“The last 30 minutes was about surviving and we could see it,” Glasner said. “We didn’t have the legs any more, we made two subs after 60, we tried to impact the game but we need all 11 players to bring the win over the line and that’s what we did. That makes me really proud of the team today, of their resilience, of their commitment, of their togetherness and then fighting for each other and getting this win.”Unfortunately, Burnley’s lack of creativity continued to limit their chances, in every sense. The crowd lacked inspiration and the silence was punctuated by Glasner shouting instructions. By the break the hosts had produced an expected goals (xG) of 0.07 – their one chance being a first‑time shot from Jaidon Anthony which Dean Henderson read and easily palmed away.Palace were not much better but Guéhi, in his final season with the club, strode out of defence and chipped a cross to the back post. Muñoz showed desire, leaving a napping Anthony behind, allowing him to head home. Colliding with the upright was the worthwhile price he paid.With Palace comfortable, Parker sent on Hannibal Mejbri and Marcus Edwards to re-energise the forward line. They were there to pose questions not asked by the stagnant group that started. Turf Moor was encouraged and almost ecstatic when Jacob Bruun Larsen controlled a cross and smashed a shot which Henderson tipped on to the bar, but that was as good as it got.Parker needs to find a way to make his side more dangerous because no one fears the most organised side in the Premier League, and the answer is not internal. They were almost handed an injury-time equaliser when Henderson missed a looping cross, which hit an unwitting Armando Broja on the back, and it trickled towards goal before Chris Richards cleared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dyche had just finished giving his opinion on an excruciating delay of five and a half minutes for a video assistant referee review that culminated in the Brazil striker’s first-half header being disallowed.“For the fans, that for me is miles too long,” Dyche said. “If that decision is the final one, that can be made a lot quicker than that. I do feel for fans. I don’t understand the [referees] talking to the crowd … it’s already taken for ever, just call it and get on with it. Maybe I’m wrong, maybe fans want that, but it just takes more time. Why put them under more pressure? Why put that on their plate as well? But the professional side of me says my job might depend on those decisions. So, it’s a tough call.”Arsenal v Brentford, Leeds v Chelsea, and more: Premier League – liveRead moreUltimately Dyche could be satisfied with eking out victory from a low-rent contest that lurched between the laborious and the ludicrous.“It wasn’t a good game, your eyes must be hurting all you lot,” the Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, said. There was another VAR delay of almost three minutes in the second half to confirm Ryan Yates was about a yard offside amid a check for a penalty. “It’s not football any more,” bellowed the South Bank, though the locals have felt disillusioned with the game and their team for quite some time.Wolves, winless since April, have two points from 14 matches, the joint-worst record inPremier Leaguehistory at this stage, with Sheffield United in 2020-21. Jhon Arias spurned Wolves’s best chance, heading wide Jackson Tchatchoua’s cross after beating Nicolò Savona at the back post, and late on Jørgen Strand Larsen, such a success story last season, could not reach a through ball from the 18-year-old substitute Mateus Mané.Forest’s goalkeeper, Matz Sels, did not have to make a save until the fourth official indicated five minutes of second-half stoppage time. Even then it was weak, the substitutes Hwang Hee‑chan and Marshall Munetsi combining, the latter scooping a harmless effort into Sels’s gloves. Not for the first time, Edwards sank towards the turf, this a third straight defeat since taking charge.View image in fullscreenDavid Møller Wolfe and Jørgen Strand Larsen look dejected after Wolves’ 12th Premier League defeat of the season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“We’re in the position we’re in … we don’t want to die like that, so that’s probably going to be the message going forward. We don’t want to go out with a whimper. I’m really disappointed, compared to the levels we set on Sunday [in defeat at Aston Villa]. It was only three days ago but it was almost like the opposite. I asked the players at half-time: ‘Are you scared?’ It looked like we were afraid to make a mistake, maybe because of the [potential] reaction from the crowd. We were very passive.”When the match-winning moment arrived for Igor Jesus, he took his chance superbly, leaping above Emmanuel Agbadou and beating to the punch the Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone, who flew erratically from his goal to clear. The assist was a beauty, too, Omari Hutchinson, on his first league start for Forest, cutting inside on to his left foot and sending a delicious cross into the box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The defender was replaced on 54 minutes after United equalised and was seen looking disconsolate on the bench. When the team applauded their support at the end of the match, Yoro still appeared unhappy, with Mason Mount consoling him.A nine-goal thriller at Fulham and Romero rescues Spurs – Football WeeklyRead moreAmorim was asked what Mount’s support showed about the side’s culture. “It’s really important,” he said. “I also spoke with him [Yoro] because he thinks too much. He makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he’s too young and he wants to do everything so well. He’s growing with games and with setbacks; it’s not easy for him as a young guy.“He cannot give that [reaction] to the people, the way he came to the bench. He understands that, but he was really frustrated. It shows he cares. He knows it wasn’t his best game, but he did some things well and I showed him that. He’s fit and ready for the next challenge.”Amorim’s frankness regarding the defender follows similar honesty about Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot last week, when he said the former was anxious when receiving the ball and that both train better than they play.The head coach was again forthright when discussing Matheus Cunha, who is available for West Ham’s visit on Thursday after a head injury. “He has more levels to go. He is in a different club, different pressure, but I think he copes with that really well.”Cunha has scored once in 11 appearances sincesigning from Wolves for £62.5min the summer. Amorim, still without Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire, joked that the Brazilian has been stressed because of social media.“He was struggling because he was not scoring and because of social media views he was thinking too much about the numbers,” he said. “The influence he has in the team is so important for us but I think Cunha has so much to grow defensively and offensively.”Amorim acknowledged that he can be too honest on occasion. “I put my players in problems sometimes when I say things.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The perception and impression that you get is that Fifa is dragging itself into becoming part of a public relations tool to normalise an increasingly authoritarian US government. That is a real concern and we’re very troubled about that.”Daniel Norona, the Americas advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, said there was a “high possibility” of immigration raids being conducted during World Cup fixtures. “Attending a soccer match should never result in arbitrary detention or deportation,” Norona said.“The threat of excessive policing, including immigration enforcement, at World Cup venues are deeply troubling, and Fifa cannot be silent. Fifa must obtain binding guarantees from US authorities that the tournament will be a safe space for all, regardless of political stance, opinion or immigration status.”Ninety US civic organisations wrote a letter to Fifa in June urging the organisation to use its leverage as World Cup organisers to push the Trump administration into guaranteeing the safety of local people and visitors.“We call on Fifa to use its influence to encourage the US government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans who seek entry to the United States to attend the tournaments, and the constitutional rights of the many immigrants who already live, work, and contribute meaningfully to the cities selected to host them,” the letter read. Jennifer Li of Dignity 2026, one of the letter’s signatories, said no reply had been received to the correspondence.Under the general provisions of its statutes, Fifa insists it is “committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights”, and has been approached for further comment. As has the US State Department. Last week a department spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are doing everything we can to support a successful World Cup. At the same time, the Trump Administration will not waver in upholding American law and the highest standards of national security.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupFifaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

We need to build throughout time and make sure we’re tracking in the right direction.”England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, said excitement around the draw was “wonderful” and echoed Itoje on the objective for 2027, 24 years afterEngland dramatically defeated the Wallabiesin Sydney to become world champions for the first and only time.“We’ve been very clear in saying our aim is to win the World Cup and a number of other nations will be saying the same,” Borthwick said. “We are working towards it.“The team is progressing, it’s transitioned a lot since the last World Cup over the last 18 months … I want to make sure that our supporters in Australia in two years’ time have loads to cheer about.”Quick GuideRugby World Cup 2027 drawShowPool ANew Zealand, Australia, Chile, Hong KongPool BSouth Africa, Italy, Georgia, RomaniaPool CArgentina, Fiji, Spain, CanadaPool DIreland, Scotland, Uruguay, PortugalPool EFrance, Japan, USA, SamoaPool FEngland, Wales, Tonga, ZimbabweWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked for his memories of theWales victory against the hosts Englandat the 2015 tournament, Borthwick said: “As ever with every England v Wales game, it was very hard-fought and I am sure the game in Australia will be exactly the same: full of passion and full of spirit.”Itoje said he will relish the expectation that seems bound to grow as a buoyant England build towards the tournament. “The converse would not be ideal, if this England team had no expectation or you played for a team that had no hopes,” he said. “That’s a situation I don’t want to be in. If we want to go out and do what we want to do, we have to walk that line and welcome whatever comes. If that’s part of it we have to welcome that.”A Wales repeat of 2015 seems a remote prospect – they have slipped to 11th in the world and were humbled in a record73-0 home defeat by South Africalast Saturday – and pool-stage jeopardy is lessened with four third-placed teams qualifying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Tonga and Zimbabwe pose different challenges. Overall it is just unbelievably exciting and obviously most people will focus on the England game.”Scotland will again meet Ireland in the pool stage having been defeated by them atthe 2019 tournament in Japanand againin France four years later. “It would help massively if we got on the right side of the result for a change,” said Gregor Townsend, the Scotland head coach. “We know how tough it will be and we’ll be doing everything we can to win that game.”Asked if he would have preferred to avoid Ireland, whom Scotland last defeated in 2017 with 11 consecutive losses coming since then, Townsend said: “When you see the teams in the top six they’re all quality sides.

Los Angeles lost at Miami on Monday night to fall to 5-16 in a wildly disappointing start to the season.The 40-year-old Paul is playing his 21stNBAseason, and he strongly hinted last month that it will be his last. The 12-time All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist has earned four All-NBA first team selections, and he ranks second in NBA history with 12,552 assists. He was the first player to score at least 20,000 points while recording at least 10,000 assists.Cooper Flagg passes LeBron to become youngest player in NBA history to score 35 pointsRead moreHe became arguably the most accomplished player in Clippers franchise history while leading the team to six winning seasons from 2011-17, including the Clippers’ first two Pacific Division titles and three playoff series victories. Paulreturned to Los Angeles as a free agentlast July, rejoining a franchise where he is loved by fans while having an outside chance to contend for his first championship alongside Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.Lawrence Frank, the Clippers’ top basketball executive, issued a statement confirming Paul’s departure to several media outlets early Wednesday. He indicated the Clippers will attempt to trade Paul, who signed a $3.6m deal to return to LA.“We are parting ways with Chris, and he will no longer be a part of the team,” Frank said. “We will work with him on the next step of his career. Chris is a legendary Clipper who has had a historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance. I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we’ve struggled. We’re grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise.”Paul hasn’t spoken to reporters since he strongly hinted at retirement while the Clippers were back in his native North Carolina. But he acknowledged a video retrospective of his career played by the Clippers during a timeout at Intuit Dome last week. The video ended with “Congratulations, Point God” on the screen.Paul couldn’t really be blamed for the Clippers’ profound struggles this season because he hasn’t played much.He is averaging 2.6 points and 3.3 assists while playing just 14.3 minutes per game – all career lows – and he didn’t play at all in five straight games in mid-November. Paul had eight points and three assists while playing 15 minutes against the Heat in what turned out to be his final game with the team – a game in which Harden and other starters were effectively benched, in the latest sign of discord for coach Tyronn Lue’s team.The Clippers are on a five-game skid, and they’re tied with Sacramento for the second-worst record in the Western Conference heading into Wednesday’s games. Leonard has been limited to 10 games by injuries, and they’ve already lost guard Bradley Beal to season-ending hip surgery.The Clippers’ streak of 14 consecutive winning seasons is the longest active streak in the NBA, but owner Steve Ballmer’s club has yet to show signs of contention this season – and now they’re going forward without a historically talented point guard and franchise favorite.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles ClippersNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

More than 100m pieces of content are uploaded to the platform every day, indicating that labelled AI material is a small part of TikTok’s catalogue. TikTok is also giving users the option of reducing theamount of AI content they see.Of the accounts that posted content most frequently, half focused on content related to the female body. “These AI women are always stereotypically attractive, with sexualised attire or cleavage,” the report said.AI Forensics found the accounts did not label half of the content they posted and less than 2% carried the TikTok label for AI content – which the nonprofit warned could increase the material’s deceptive potential. Researchers added that the accounts sometimes escape TikTok’s moderation for months, despite posting content barred by its terms of service.Dozens of the accounts revealed in the study have subsequently been deleted, researchers said, indicating that some had been taken down by moderators.Some of the content took the form of fake broadcast news segments withanti-immigrant narrativesand material sexualising female bodies, including girls that appeared to be underage. The female body category accounted for half of the top 10 most active accounts, said AI Forensics, while some of the fake news pieces featured known broadcasting brands such as Sky News and ABC.Some of the posts have been taken down by TikTok after they were referred to the platform by the Guardian.TikTok said the report’s claims were “unsubstantiated” and the researchers had singled it out for an issue that was affecting multiple platforms. In August the Guardian revealed that nearly one in 10 of the fastest growing YouTube channels globally wereshowing only AI-generated content.“On TikTok, we remove harmful AIGC [artificial intelligence-generated content], block hundreds of millions of bot accounts from being created, invest in industry-leading AI-labelling technologies and empower people with tools and education to control how they experience this content on our platform,” a TikTok spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenAn example of AI ‘slop’, content that is nonsensical and designed to clutter social media feeds.Illustration: TikTokThe most popular accounts highlighted by AI Forensics in terms of views had posted “slop”, the term for AI-made content that is nonsensical, bizarre and designed to clutter up people’s social media feeds – such asanimals competing in an Olympic diving contestortalking babies. The researchers acknowledged that some of the slop content was “entertaining” and “cute”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the content attempts to make money from users, including pushing health supplements via fake influencers, promoting tools that help make viral AI content and seeking sponsorships for posts.AI Forensics, which has also highlighted the prevalence of AI content on Instagram, said it welcomed TikTok’s decision to let users limit the amount of AI content they see, but that labelling had to improve.“Given the structural and non-negligible amount of failure to identify such content, we remain sceptical regarding the success of this feature,” they said.The researchers added that TikTok should consider creating an AI-only feature on the app in order to separate AI-made content from human-created posts. “Platforms must go beyond weak or optional ‘AI content’ labels and consider segregating generative content from human-created material, or finding a fair system that enforces systematic and visible labelling of AI content,” they said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)TikTokSocial mediaComputingDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The eSafety Commissioner had previously warned it was closely monitoring the app for possible inclusion in the ban.Australia’s eSafety commissioner rejects US Republican’s assertion she is a ‘zealot for global takedowns’Read moreAhead of Wells’ address to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Google said it will begin signing out underage users from its platform from 10 December, but warned it would mean children and their parents would lose access to safety features.Googlehad strongly opposed YouTube’s inclusion in the ban, after initially being exempted from the framework. Google hadraised prospects of a legal challengeto the ban, but Wednesday’s statement did not elaborate on that potential, and Google sources declined to comment.Rachel Lord, Google’s senior manager for public policy in Australia, saidin a blog postthat users under 16s will still be able to watch YouTube videos in a signed-out state, but that children would lose access to “features that only work when you are signed into an account, including subscriptions, playlists and likes, and default wellbeing settings such as “Take a Break” and Bedtime Reminders”.She also warned that parents “will lose the ability to supervise their teen or tween’s account on YouTube”, such as content settings blocking specific channels.Lord wrote: “This rushed regulation misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it. Most importantly, this law will not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.”While not flagging any legal options, Lord added: “We are committed to finding a better path forward to keep kids safe online.”Speaking to the National Press Club, Wells said parents could set up control and safety settings on YouTube Kids, a separate platform not included in the ban.“I find it outright weird that YouTube is always at pains to remind us all how unsafe their platform is in a logged-out state. If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe and there’s content not appropriate for age-restricted users on their website, that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,” she said.View image in fullscreenAnika Wells speaks at the National Press Club on Wednesday.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPBut Wells also conceded the government’s plans to bar under-16s from social media might take “days or even weeks” to properly take effect.“We know it won’t be perfect from day one but we won’t give up – and we won’t let the platforms off the hook,” Wells said.Wells praised the advocacy of families of children who had ended their lives after online bullying and mental health issues, saying the changes would “protect generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms.” She claimed social media platforms deliberately targeted teenagers to maximise engagement and profits.“These companies wield an incredible power we willingly hand over to them because of the benefits the platform bring to us. From 10 December, we start to take that power back for young Australians,” Wells said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMeta hastold users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads what to expectfrom next week,as has Snapchat.

It will then seek data monthly.In a press conference in Adelaide on Tuesday, Wells foreshadowed more platforms being added to the under-16s ban if children migrated to sites not currently listed.She told media to “stay tuned” for news about Lemon8, an Instagram-style app not included in the ban. Guardian Australia understands the eSafety Commission has written to Lemon8 – owned by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance – to say the agency would monitor the platform for possible inclusion after the scheme begins.Guardian Australia can reveal Lemon8 has decided to restrict its users to those aged over 16 from 10 December.“If everybody ends up on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn becomes a place where there is online bullying, algorithms targeting 13-to-16-year-olds in a way that’s deteriorating their mental and physical health, then we will go after LinkedIn,” Wells said on Tuesday.“That’s why all platforms are on notice.

In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the government confirmed it had “decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers”.It emphasised that the app, which allows users to block and track lost or stolen mobile phones and report fraudulent calls, was “secure and purely meant to help citizens” against “bad actors”.Indian order to preload state-owned app on smartphones sparks political outcryRead moreThe initial order,given quietly to tech companies last week, landed the government in hot water after internet privacy groups and the political opposition raised concerns that the app could be used as a mass surveillance tool.Apple and Google anonymously briefed the media that tech companies would be pushing back against the order as the move raised privacy concerns for their operating systems and violated internal policies.Outcry erupted in parliament on Wednesday, with opposition MPs accusing the government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, of violating citizens’ basic right to privacy.Randeep Singh Surjewala, from the opposition Indian National Congress party, said the app “could be a possible kill switch” that could turn “every cell phone into a brick, which the government could use against journalists, opposition leaders and dissidents, if it so desires”.Parallels have been made with an order made by the Russian government in August foran app called Maxto be installed on all smartphones, sparking fears it was a mass surveillance tool.The communications minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, responded to criticism, saying the Sanchar Saathi app was voluntary and could be deleted, despite the initial order stating the opposite.He said: “I can delete it like any other app, as every citizen has this right in a democracy. Snooping is not possible through the app, nor will it ever be.”The decision by the government to revoke the order was celebrated by groups advocating for online rights and privacy. In a statement, the internet freedom foundation said: “For now, we should treat this as cautious optimism, not closure, until the formal legal direction is published and independently confirmed.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSmartphonesPrivacySurveillanceMobile phonesSouth and central AsiaTelecomsShareReuse this content"

The mandate forces increased sales of EVs each year, but new loopholes allowed carmakers to sell more petrol and diesel cars.Tesla recalls 10,500 Powerwall 2 battery systems in US over fire riskRead moreNew taxes on electric cars inlast week’s budgetcould further undermine demand, critics have said.Carmakers includingBMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Toyota– all of which have UK factories – claimed in their submissions to the consultation in spring that the mandate was damaging investment, because they were selling electric cars at a loss. However, environmental campaigners and brands that mainly manufacture electric vehicles said the rules were having the intended effect, andno carmakers are thought to have faced finesfor sales in 2024.Tesla argued it was “essential” for electric car sales that the government did not introduce new loopholes, known as “flexibilities”.Changes “will suppress battery electric vehicle (BEV) supply, carry a significant emissions impact and risk the UK missing its carbon budgets”, Tesla said.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, alarmed carmakers further at the budget with thepromised imposition of a “pay-per-mile” chargeon electric cars from 2028, which is likely to reduce their attractiveness relative to much more polluting petrol and diesel models. At the same time, she announced the extension of grants for new electric cars, which the sector has welcomed.Tom Riley, the author of the Fast Charge, said: “Just as the EV transition looked settled, the budget pulled it in two directions at once – effectively robbing Peter to pay Paul. If carmakers push again for a softer mandate, Labour only has itself to blame when climate targets slip.”Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Ford objected to their responses being shared, and were only obtained on appeal under freedom of information law. Several pages were heavily redacted, with one heading left showing Tesla called for “support for the used-car market”. Tesla declined to comment on whether that support would include grants.In contrast, the US carmaker Ford and Germany’s Mercedes-Benz lobbied against more stringent rules after 2030 that would have forced them to cut average carbon dioxide emissions further – potentially allowing them to sell more-polluting vehicles for longer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up hereKeith StuartWed 3 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTShareIt is hard to think of a more modern entertainment format than the open-world video game. These sprawling technological endeavours, which mix narrative, social connectivity and the complete freedom to explore, are uniquely immersive and potentially endless. But do they represent a whole new idea of storytelling?This week I met Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar and lead writer on Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, who has been in London to talk about his new company, Absurd Ventures. He’s working on a range of intriguing projects, including the novel and podcast seriesA Better Paradise(about a vast online game that goes tragically wrong), and a comedy-adventure set in an online world namedAbsurdaverse. He told me that, 15 years ago, he was doing press interviews for the Grand Theft Auto IV expansion packs when he had something of a revelation about the series.“I was talking to a journalist from Paris Match, a very cultured French guy – and he said, ‘Well, theGrand Theft Autogames are just like Dickens’. And I was like, God bless you for saying that! But I thought about it afterwards and, well, they’re not as good as Dickens, but they are similar in that he’s world-building. If you look at Dickens, Zola, Tolstoy or any of those authors, there’s that feeling of all the world is here – that’s what you’re trying to get in open world games. It’s a twisted prism, looking at a society that’s interesting in one way or another.”View image in fullscreenA whole new world … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd Ventures/XIt was fun to talk about this idea with Houser, because I share his view that there are striking similarities between Victorian literature and modern narrative video games. The vast amount of descriptive detail in those works was intended as a form of virtual reality, conjuring an exact image into the mind of the readers years before the invention of cinema. There is also that sense of complete immersion. The first time I read Jane Eyre a decade ago, I was amazed by the interiority of the writing, how much information we were given about the lead character’s thought processes and how much freedom we were given to explore them.Houser also saw a structural similarity in Grand Theft Auto. “There’s that same sense of slightly spread out storytelling that you get in those big 19th-century novels from Thackeray onwards,” he says. “They are kind of shaggy dog stories that come together at a point. Those books are also very realist, in a way. They’re not leaping backwards and forwards in time. They are quite physical in that sense, and games are very physical.”For Houser, this interplay between Victorian literature and game design came to a head with the production ofRed Dead Redemption2, Rockstar’s masterful, elegiac tale of revenge and redemption in the late 19th-century US. “I binged on Victorian novels for that,” he says. “I listened to the audiobook of Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it.” He’d had trouble finding the correct tone for the dialogue in the game, but by merging Middlemarch, Sherlock Holmes and cowboy pulp fiction, he found it.View image in fullscreen‘I listened to the audio book of Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day’, Dan Houser.Photograph: Chelsea Guglielmino/Getty Images“I wanted it to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic,” he told me. “I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up. We were trying to fill out the three-dimensional lives of the characters, and also to capture that 19th-century feeling of life and death, which was very different from ours.”I found it so pleasing that Victorian literature has had such a profound effect on Rockstar’s hugely successful adventures. The games industry can be so inward-looking, each new game a slight variation on a successful predecessor, each narrative a combination of the same fantasy and sci-fi set texts. There’s nothing wrong with drawing on Tolkien or Akira or Blade Runner, but it’s always worthwhile extending that literary gaze. I’m looking forward to seeing how Houser’s new ventures redefine the notion of open-world games for the second quarter of the 21st century, but part of me wishes he was going all out with a sprawling Victorian novel adventure.Forget Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, maybe it’s time for Middlemarch and Machine Guns?What to playView image in fullscreenGorgeously atmospheric … Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.Photograph: NintendoIt has been 18 years since the last Metroid Prime game. People have been born, started school, done their exams, and had their first hangovers in the time since I last viewed a mysterious planet through the visor of Samus Aran. So there’s quite a lot riding onMetroid Prime 4: Beyondfor fans of Nintendo’s most badass (and neglected) hero.I reviewed itthis week and am happy to say that it’s not a disaster. It’s uneven, old-fashioned and a bit awkward, but also gorgeously atmospheric, beautiful to look at and listen to, and very entertaining. It’s almost fascinatingly unconcerned with the conventions of modern game design, and I found it very charming.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:15-20 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While I adored Red Dead Redemption 2, it frustrated me that the only option to resolve most situations was with a firearm. I’ve seen plenty of amusing videos where players try to complete innately violent titles without bloodshed, so there seems to be an appetite for pacifism.”I have vivid memories of playing the originalSplinter Cellon Xbox as a pacifist: only knocking enemies out and hiding them, never killing them. It took meforever, but it was a legitimate option offered by the game. Steampunk masterpieceDishonoredand its sequel also famously let you finish the whole thing without killing anyone. You can use your supernatural powers to sneak around and manipulate people instead; if I recall correctly, though, the game is significantly harder if you shun violence.Most stealth games offer pacifist playthroughs, actually, though few specifically reward you for sparing lives. One exception to this is the superb comic adventureUndertale, the game that finally let you talk to the monsters. I’m also fairly sure that it was possible, if very challenging, to play both the originalFalloutgames (and possibly Fallout: New Vegas, too) without killing people, only mutants – if you’ve got a high enough charisma stat to talk your way out of every sticky situation.We’re still looking for your game of the year nominations for an end of year special – let us know yours byemailing us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterRed Dead RedemptionGrand Theft AutoGrand Theft Auto 5Dan HouserfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But here is an end-of-year curio: psychological horror game Sleep Awake serves us synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan stepping into what is perhaps the schlockiest role of his life – a gigantic floating head named Hypnos.This late-stage cameo is not quite indicative of the game as a whole; the handful of hours prior to Numan’s arrival are more mournful than madcap. Mostly, you explore the dilapidated, tumbledown streets of what is thought to be the last city on Earth. This setting is a magnificent work of imagination. You see it through the eyes of a young woman named Katja, who moves along rooftops, gazing out upon a barren, lifeless hinterland, into labyrinthine streets whose darkness and arcane logic recall the stirring subterranean etchings of Italian artist Piranesi.How has the planet become so inhospitable, so thoroughly wiped of life? That never really becomes clear. Rather, Katja must wrestle with a more pressing concern: should she fall asleep, our hero risks disappearing into a strange, inaccessible realm caused by a disease referred to as the Hush. Like every other perpetually exhausted person here, Katja plops a few drops of stay-awake serum into her eyes. Suddenly, she sees psychedelic visions and kaleidoscopic refractions of space. Katja seems to be losing the plot; everyone else certainly has. What remains of society has crumbled into the sleep-deprived paranoia of rival gangs.Driven initially by a desire to care for an elderly relative, you direct Katja in first-person through the game’s many grotty, decaying spaces. At one point you’re on the turf of a gas-masked cult, so you try to sneak past them, crouching against walls and under tables to avoid detection. Yet there is hardly any tension: the enemies follow rote patrol paths; their field of vision is preposterously generous. This is a rather dull, easy game of hide and seek.Sleep Awake betrays a further lack of gameplay imagination. You’re called on to short-circuit electricity breakers by rolling carts into them; you have to open doors by finding obviously placed keycards. Slowly, the lustre of the city also begins to dull: it becomes clear you are advancing along a lavishly art-directed tunnel – really, only a lightly interactive and not especially scary fairground ghost train.This is a shame because Sleep Awake is visually daring. The exploratory action is intercut with bleary yet beautiful FMV sequences: the eerie silhouette of trees against a blood-red sky; bubbling liquids shown in extreme closeup. Sometimes these unsettling images are layered over the actual 3D space to gorgeously odd, arthouse effect. This surrealism extends to the death screen: should you get clubbed on the head by one of your dimwitted foes, you must walk out of the dark towards a spectacular light-filled door; as you do, the space mutates in hallucinatory real-time, spitting you out at your last autosave.The death screen is a rare moment when Sleep Awake summons something between dream logic and the strange hazy moments between sleep states that can feel like dreaming. The rest of the time, this narcoleptic nightmare merely wears its psychedelic aesthetics – floating Numan included – without interrogating them interactively. It’s too straightforward, too legible, and not actually illogical enough where it matters.

He wants the glory of having brokered a deal anddoes not carewhether it is fair or not. As for Vladimir Putin, he only wants peace on terms that achieve things which the Russian army has failed to manage with force. The Kremlin demands territory not yet won on the battlefield and limitations to Ukraine’s capacity to act as a fully sovereign state.Mr Trump has never shown much natural aversion to giving Mr Putin what he wants. He has not applied serious pressure on the Kremlin to end its aggression, nor rebuked the Russian president for starting the war. He sees nothing wrong with a process that discusses the fate of a country, including de facto partition of its territory, without representatives of that country at the table.If Ukraine’s interests are factored into White House thinking at all, it is down to assiduous diplomacy by its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his European allies. Their interventions have so far prevented Mr Trump selling Kyiv out completely, much to the Kremlin’s frustration. This week’s trip to Moscow by the White House envoy, Steve Witkoff – usually a credulous audience for Russian negotiators – producedno breakthrough. Mr Putin attributes the impasse to “sabotage” of the process by Nato’s European members. He treats any recognition of Ukrainian interests as an attack on Russian national dignity.Russian propaganda often singles Britain out as a villain in this regard – something that Sir Keir Starmer should take as a compliment in recognition of his service to the cause of Ukrainian self-defence. The prime minister deserves credit for his part in the combined European effort to counteract White House pandering to Mr Putin and for his leading role in coordinating a “coalition of the willing” to show unwavering solidarity with Mr Zelenskyy.Correcting Mr Trump’s pro-Russian biases is a sisyphean task. The diplomatic effort must be constantly sustained. Meanwhile, European leaders must always be attentive to their duty to build autonomous capacity to protect the continent. On that front, Sir Keir is less consistent. He has agreed a European defence and security agreement in principle and, in recent weeks, he has spoken with growing conviction about the need for closer EU cooperation. In practice, the rapprochementhas stalled, in part for want of political impetus from Downing Street.In aspeechearlier this week, the prime minister restated his insistence that there is no dilemma when it comes to relations with Europe and the US. That view is either naive or disingenuous. Mr Trump is not a reliable ally to Europe or anyone else. He sometimes speaks of the EU withundiluted hostility. His trade policy recognises no mutual strategic interests, only clients and enemies. That prejudice is not unique to the current president. It is embedded in Republican ideology. It would be unwise for any European country to bet its national interest on transatlantic partnership.Mr Trump’s indulgence of Russian arguments overUkraineis a warning. In an even bigger security crisis, could Washington be counted on to take Europe’s side against the Kremlin? That the answer is uncertain should compel Sir Keir to accelerate his claimed ambition of restored closeness to Europe. Vague aspirations must now urgently become concrete deals.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After a decade in eerie command of the Republican party, with primary voters in his cult-like thrall and down-ballot elected officials feeling they have no choice – and often no inclination – to diverge from him,Donald Trumpsuddenly seems not quite in control of his own political machine.Fractures have emerged in the Maga coalition; Trump’s approval issinking; the Democrats, long anemic and risk-averse in the opposition, showed signs of life in elections last month; and the cumulative effect of a series of long-running scandals, most particularly the Epstein affair, seem to have alienated core components of the Trump faithful. Trump has faced some rebukes from a once largely compliant federal judiciary: his personal attorney, Alina Habba, wasrecently declared ineligibleto serve in the US attorney role Trump had appointed her to, and hissignature tariffs seem likelyto be struck down by a conservative supreme court majority.John Roberts has badly weakened our democracy. Will he ever stand up to Trump? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreTrump himself, meanwhile, is unfocused, losing his signature humor and charisma, and showing his age. In recent photos he looks pale, exhausted; he seems to havestruggled to keep his eyes openin front of cameras. Trump seems more interested in the construction of his oversized ballroom than in the work of policy. His advisers – the scheming group of frauds, racists, opportunists and swindlers who surround him in his second term – are evidently running the show, and they do not always see eye to eye. The old man won’t be around forever; Republicans are beginning to imagine what the country – and more importantly, their own careers – will look like without him.Is this how the Trump era in American politics ends – not with a bang, but with a whimper? It would be overstating the case, and speaking far too soon, to say that Trump has become a lame duck, or that the Republican party is moving on from the identity that he gave it. But the signals of his waning influence are everywhere.For one thing, more and more Republicans seem willing to break with Trump – something that would have been unthinkable for them, and a kind of career suicide, just a few months ago. While Trump was able to compel Republicans in the Texas state legislature to draw new congressional district mapswith just a command(an effort that is now facing anuphill battle in the courts), Republicans in Indiana are resisting Trump’s push to have them do the same, with one GOP legislator saying that she “will not cave” on redistricting even as she announced apipe bombthreat had been called into her house.Other signs are beginning to stir. Trump, with his typically casual relationship to the truth, has insisted that the economy is booming as a result of his ill-conceived tariff program. “Costs are way down,”he said, falsely, in a long 10 November interview with Fox’s Laura Ingraham. ButIngraham pushed back– rare for a Fox host – and soon, other rightwing mouthpieces were, too; weary of repeating the Biden administration’s 2024 mistake of projecting a sunnier picture of the economy than that reflected by consumer sentiment, and perhaps chastened by the sweeping victories of 2025 Democratic candidates who ran on messages of affordability. Soon, both JD Vance and Ben Shapiro were telling a different story on the economy. “When President Trump says things are becoming more affordable, people don’t believe that,”Shapiro said.Vance asked votersfor “patience”: “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do.”It’s a low bar, to be able to merely contradict or disagree with the president. Nevertheless, it is noticeable that more and moreRepublicansare clearing it; many of them have spent the better part of their careers, at this point, praising the emperor’s new clothes.A few are going further. Among the most damaging scandals of the Trump era is the slow drip of revelations about the depth of friendship between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the dead financier and pedophile, and the accumulation of documents both from Trump to Epstein and by Epstein about Trump that suggest that Trump, in Epstein’s parlance, “knew about the girls”. The Epstein saga, after all, had been a major fixture of the paranoid conspiracies in the far-right media ecosystem, whose podcasts, Discords, and YouTube channels helped drive Trump to victory in 2024. Those conspiracy-minded communities once viewed Trump as a quasi-messianic figure – as in QAnon, the pandemic-era viral sensation that posited Trump as the leader of a vast, secret effort to undermine a cabal of powerful pedophiles. But these same groups have begun to turn on Trump as the newly revealed documents from the Epstein estate – and the Trump administration’s efforts to repress them – have made this fantasy harder to maintain. The politicians who swept into office on the strength of the QAnon theory are taking note. Majorie Taylor Greene, an ambitious Georgia congresswoman and onetime conspiracy theorist,broke with Trump publiclyover the Epstein issue; soon after hedeclared her an enemy, she announced that she would beleaving Congress in January.She won’t be the last. As Republicans continue to face strong headwinds from anti-Trump sentiment going into 2026, and as Trump himself dwindles in popularity, accumulates liabilities, and proves unwilling to compromise on his demands or reward loyal Republicans, it is likely that more and more GOP representatives will be looking for the exits. Meanwhile, Maga has begun to eat its own, with infighting over Epstein, antisemitism and economics slowly beginning to turn Trump’s operatives against each other as they jockey for position. The Trump era is not over – far from it – but we may be seeing the beginning of its next phase: what is likely to be a bleak, bloody and belligerent battle of succession.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He had worked with the US government, including the CIA, and was evacuated to the US in 2021 after the American military withdrew from Afghanistan.The president lashed out at millions of immigrants, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and he pledged to “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens”. Trumpalso proclaimedthat US citizenship should be stripped from naturalized immigrants “who undermine domestic tranquility”, and called for deporting those he deemed “non-compatible with western civilization”.Within hours of the shooting on 26 November, it became clear that Trump and several of his top aides would use the tragedy not only to collectively punish thousands of Afghans in the US, but to further intensify the administration’scrackdown on immigrantcommunities across the country. After the Wall Street Journal warned inan editorialagainst blaming all Afghan refugees for the violent actions of one man, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s nativist immigration policy and White House deputy chief of staff,retorted on X: “This is the great lie of mass migration.” Miller added: “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies … At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.”Trump and Miller’s grandstanding obscures an inconvenient reality: it was the US that largely brokeAfghanistan, and destroyed the ability of many Afghans to live in their homeland – after the US invaded in 2001 following the 11 September terrorist attacks. In the generation since George W Bush’s administration unleashed its global war on terror – invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq, and carrying out repeated airstrikes in other countries – the US has failed to reckon with all the ways its legacy of violence abroad eventually comes home. Under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the US is also prone to shifting blame for its foreign policy disasters on to others, and to abandon any sense of moral responsibility for the local allies it leaves behind in places like Afghanistan and Iraq – and Vietnam before that.What we know so far about the suspect in last week’s shooting, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, fits the classic pattern of “blowback”, a term coined by intelligence officials to describe the unintended consequences of violence perpetuated by US military operations. Lakanwal,who has pleaded not guiltyto charges of murder and assault,was partof a CIA-backed Afghan military group known as a “Zero Unit”, which carried out missions to capture or kill suspected militants in southern Afghanistan. For years, these paramilitary units were dogged by accusations that they mainly functioned asCIA-sanctioned death squads. In 2019, a Human Rights Watchreport foundthat the Zero Units were “responsible for extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances, indiscriminate airstrikes, attacks on medical facilities, and other violations of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war”.Lakanwal entered the US in September 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program launched by Joe Biden’s administration to evacuate and resettle tens of thousands of Afghans, after the chaotic US military withdrawal in late August. Many of those evacuated had worked alongside US troops and diplomats, and would likely be branded as traitors by the Taliban if they had stayed in Afghanistan.But Lakanwal had trouble adjusting to life in the US, and his mental health seemed to be unraveling for years, according toemails obtainedby the Associated Press. He was unable to hold a steady job, and alternated between dark stretches of isolation and taking sudden cross-country drives that lasted for weeks. At times, according to the emails sent to a refugee service organization, he spent weeks in a “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids”.A childhood friend of Lakanwal, who wasinterviewed in Afghanistanlast week by the New York Times, said Lakanwal had struggled with mental health issues and was distressed by the casualties his unit had caused during its operations, especially night-time raids intended to capture Taliban members. “When he saw blood, bodies, and the wounded, he could not tolerate it, and it put a lot of pressure on his mind,” the friend said.It will take time to understand Lakanwal’s motivation for allegedly shooting two national guard members – and a potential trial could reveal new details about the CIA’s role in recruiting and training Afghans into paramilitary units that allegedly committedhuman rights abuses. But Trump and others in his administration seem eager to weaponize this attack as part of their foundational myth of US exceptionalism: foreigners import violence and chaos into the US from broken and bankrupt homelands. Without immigrants, Trump’s argument goes, the US would be safe and would thrive.In his second term, Trump has taken his message as a populist demagogue to a global stage, bragging about the US immigration crackdown in his unhingedhour-long speechto the UN general assembly in September. He called on European countries to emulate his policies, close their borders and expel migrants. “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now,” Trump lectured western leaders, adding casually: “Your countries are going to hell.”Trump is more open in his demagogy than other politicians, who prefer to stay quiet about their notions of national superiority and US exceptionalism.But Trump’s transactional worldview lays bare a core tenet of US foreign policy: America will always prioritize its short-term security and economic interests over promoting democracy and human rights – no matter what lofty rhetoric past presidents used to obscure US military interventions and foreign meddling.Even before the Bush administration invaded in 2001, Afghanistan had suffered from at least a decade of past US interference. In the 1980s, the CIA funneledbillions of dollars(mostly through Pakistan’s intelligence service) to arm and train thousands of Afghan mujahideen to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It was the last great cold war battle between the US and the Soviet Union – and someexperts arguethe Afghanistan war was a significant factor behind the Soviet empire’s collapse. After the Soviets withdrew in defeat in 1989, the US largely left the country to the mercy of Afghan warlords and neighboring Pakistan. Afghanistan suffered through years of civil war, until the Taliban emerged in 1994 and consolidated control over most of the country within a few years.Aside from driving out the Soviets, the CIA-financed jihad in the 1980s left another legacy: an estimated20,000 foreign volunteers, most of them Arabs, had joined the fight in Afghanistan over a decade.These so-called “Afghan Arabs” received military training, set up networks and gained battlefield experience that they were eager to use elsewhere. Among those who joined the anti-Soviet jihad was Osama bin Laden and the Egyptian militant Ayman al-Zawahiri, along with other founding members of al-Qaida.While there’s no public evidence that the CIA financed or trained foreign fighters in Afghanistan, the Afghan war produced enormous blowback that reverberated for decades. The foreign veterans fought in multiple conflicts in the 1990s, including Algeria, Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya. Other veterans went back to their home countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where they took leading roles in jihadist groups and sometimes carried out terrorist strikes. And of course, Bin Laden and Zawahiri planned the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington while they were sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan.Those attacks became the rationale for the US invasion of Afghanistan, which turned into America’s longest overseas war, stretching for two decades. That conflict has shaped a generation of Afghans, who have experienced the terror that US military power and its proxies can inflict. But rather than confront the devastation that Americans have wrought on Afghanistan, Trump and his acolytes are eager to demonize the people of a “broken” country – one the US helped destroy.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsAfghanistanOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationSouth and central AsiaUS politicsUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Of course he is. At least his solicitor-advocate, Zali Burrows, is urging us to see him that way because he inspires those who have been “wrongly accused”.That may confuse those who were thinking, up this point, that it was Bruce who was doing the accusing – accusing the people at Channel 10 and its former star presenter Lisa Wilkinson of getting it so wrong.Then accusing the trial judge, Michael Lee, of getting it utterly wrong, requiring Bruce to courageously try to retrieve, again, what’s left of his well-munched hat.In some special corners of the land and beyond, there could be people drawing inspiration from Bruce Lehrmann – people who are in Long Bay bravely maintaining their innocence or litigants whose cases have crashed and burned and can’t pay the costs.Bruce Lehrmann knew Brittany Higgins didn’t consent, federal court rules as it dismisses defamation appealRead moreVictims, all – just as Bruce is a victim. Even though he is a victim of his own folly that shouldn’t mean that he’s not an inspiration, in the same way as those who overcome terrible adversities or make marvellous life-enhancing scientific and artistic contributions.Bruce Lehrmann’s mission has been to expand the boundaries of inspiration-hood. He’s holding a torch for all of us.Certainly, Burrows’ pronouncement makes a nice change from herdescription last Augustwhen she said of her client, “He’s pretty much become the national joke ... Australia’s most hated man.”That is not to say that inspiring or even hated people aren’t capable of making stupid mistakes. One of Bruce’s mistakes was to embark on litigation in the first place. My hunch is that he thought Brittany Higgins would not get into the witness box because of her fragile mental state.She had been in and out of hospital after collapsing and her condition deteriorated after Linda Reynolds’ litigation cranked into gear.Lehrmann’s legal team was confident they would have a clear run to success without the respondents being able to prove a truth defence.However, once Higgins saw Lehrmann’s disastrous evidence, she put up her hand. Justice Lee later said, “To remark that Mr Lehrmann was a poor witness is an exercise in understatement.”While Lee disbelieved aspects of Higgins’ evidence he accepted the crucial elements, which allowed him to find that on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann had raped her on Senator Linda Reynolds’ ministerial couch.On that basis the justification (truth) defence succeeded. Thank you Brittany.In 2023, Bruce was feeling as though a rainbow had struck his posterior. He’d scooped up close to $500,000 in settlements with the ABC and News Corp – the price they paid for not wanting to get into the Colosseum.Large chunks of that would have kept his lawyers ready and willing.Actually, Bruce has little to no financial exposure to these courtroom misadventures. The Channel 10 people are out of pocket, and so too the lawyers who staked him at trial.Even though the appellant doesn’t have a brass razoo, in October last year Justice Wendy Abraham in the federal court said the poor lamb doesn’t have to provide security for costs before launching his appeal against Justice Lee’s findings.It’s a free home run, forget the $2m already on the meter and payable to Ten. Now another half-million for the appeal can be added to that unrecoverable pile of financial compost.It’s been remarked by people who closely observe the courts that the defamation game is running out of puff. After Ben Roberts-Smith, Bruce Lehrmann and Munjed Al Muderis, why would anyone think the courts are the best place to varnish their reputation?Even those who “win” are out of pocket. Linda Reynolds’ damages of $341,000, with costs most likely to be in excess of $1.5m, are unlikely to be satisfied by Higgins.Joe Hockey in his “Treasurer for Sale” case against the Sydney Morning Herald ended up underwater. He asked for $1m and was awarded $200,000 and only received 15% of his costs.Actor Geoffrey Rush was given a restorative $2.8m by Justice Michael Wigney in his action against the Daily Telegraph, yet that did little to enhance his glittering career.Little wonder those who the SMH and the Age recently described as “grasping defamation lawyers” have turned their attention to the new fertile uplands of serious invasions of privacy.Five takeaways from Bruce Lehrmann’s failed defamation case appealRead moreSome of Bruce’s ardent supporters have gone quiet, including the Presumption of Innocence Squad under the baton of Bettina Arndt.His old pals at News Corp, who insisted he should never have been prosecuted for rape, have moved on to lavishly advocate for another determined litigant, the guardian of the office couch, former senator Linda Reynolds.Yet Bruce has not completely run out of possibilities for providing further inspiration.A while ago he was hoping the ACT government would buy him a house, however the threatened litigation over his prosecution for rape seems to have disappeared.More recently, he wants court orders to get the commonwealth to pay for his defence in a Corruption Commission investigation into his use or misuse of government documents.And now there’s the possibility of a special leave application to the high court.Never say die for Australia’s most hated, inspirational man.Richard Ackland publishesJustinianandSpilled InkExplore more on these topicsAustralian lawOpinionAustralian mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Will the left just stand by?Neal LawsonIt’s time for a harsh reality check. A progressive bloc of parties refusing to see a common threat risks disasterNeal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassWed 3 Dec 2025 12.11 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.14 ESTShareThe right always does unity and solidarity better than the left. While real difference exists between liberals and social conservatives, or between globalisers and nationalists, the right has a stronger sense of self-interest. It is much less likely to allow perfect to be the enemy of good.It is by understanding this that you can see past Nigel Farage’s denial of comments that he expects Reform to do an election deal with the Conservatives,as reported by the Financial Times. Particularly since this denial is caveated by his statement that he won’t work with the Tories “as they are”. Likewise, reports in the Times that senior Reform figures are appealing to Farage to secure the defection of Robert Jenrick and appoint him as chancellor after an election victory may berejected by Jenrick. But whatever their individual ambitions, both will surely concede to the emerging consensus: to unite the right, at whatever cost.It is easy for Farage to deny these claims for now, riding high as Reform has been since the general election. But despite doubling its support, it has seemingly hit a ceiling in the low 30s in the polls. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have stabilised in the mid-teens.With no knockout blow looking likely from either side, there is immense pressure from party funders and the rightwing press,the Daily Mail in particular, which wrotea strident leadercolumn in September calling on “all the talents on the Right to come together to sweep away this lamentable excuse for a government”.It is not hard to see why. Analysis conducted by my organisationCompassshows that at the last general election the combined vote of Reform and the Tories should have won them 202 extra seats but they cancelled each other out. Avoiding this in 2029 could take many forms, from an outright merger, an alliance or simply whatLabour and the Liberal Democrats did before the last election, which is to agree in private which party went for which seat. This last arrangement has the benefit of being deniable and doesn’t require any detailed public negotiations.But progressives will probably not have the easier luxury of strategic integration. While the regressive bloc is divided in two, the progressive side splinters into four in England if Your Party gets itself election-ready, alongsideLabour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, but not forgetting assorted independents. That number rises to five in Scotland and Wales with the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. This potentially disastrous fragmentation of the party-political scene has been a long time coming. A world of two polarised upper and lower classes and two TV channels, BBC and ITV, has given way to far more nuanced identities and multiple options and platforms in almost every aspect of life. A two-party politics was never going to survive this huge culture shift.As in 2019 and 2024, a party can be handed a majority if there is a polarising issue of the day such as Brexit or the desire to be rid of the Tories. But the underlying fragmentation means that even with respective majorities of 80 then and 180 in 2024, governments have no electoral and civil society foundations for the long-term management of the country on a single-party basis. Labour’s 2024 victory was the lowest in terms of quantity of vote and arguably quality of support. It is little wonder chaos has ensued.Labour strategists know all this. But their answer isn’t to embrace the fragmentation and the pluralist politics such differences demandbut double down on control and coercion. They will try to frame the next election as a clear choice between whoever is the Labour prime minister andNigel Farage. In this it mirrors the strategy of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who keeps pushing to the centre right to build the non-far right majority in the belief that voters have nowhere else to go.But the harsh truth is that this strategy is doomed to fail. First because progressive voters are increasingly unprepared to hold their noses and vote for what they perceive as a non-progressive option, even if it’s the least bad. France saw the rise of theNew Popular Front, while in theUK voters are backing the clearest progressive alternative to Reform, like they did in the recent Caerphilly byelection to the Senedd where Plaid Cymru won, and Labour went from first to a very distant third.But more importantly, this coercive strategy simply papers over the cracks of a politics in which the Overton window moves steadily towards the hard right and the likely big victory of the party that represents a full-fat rather than semi-skimmed version of national populism.Cold electoral logic suggests the right will unite in some shape or form. On the left the ball is in Labour’s court in two crucial respects. First it must become once again a clearly progressive choice for progressive voters. Waging war on asylum seekers and stripping back the jury system are the very opposite of what’s needed. Instead, what’s needed is a fundamentally different fully throated economic approach to re-making Britain in the interests of greater equality, such as wealth taxes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are back to spending at pre-Covid-19 levels:If the graph does not display click hereGreat size, how about the shape?Well, if you were told that more than half (55%) of the increase in household spending during the September quarter was on electricity and gas, health costs and insurance, would that seem so good? Especially given we usually only spend about 17% of our annual income on those items?We’re spending more on essentials and less on things we can do without.Shape matters.And so, before we go any further, I want to remind you of a couple ofgreenhouse gas emissionsfigures released last week.Right now, electricity is the biggest contributor to Australia’s annual emissions. The good news is, because our use of renewables – such as rooftop solar – is growing, electricity has also had the biggest drop in emissions since 2005:If the graph does not display click hereThen we have the projected emissions to 2035, by which time the government wants to reduce emissions by between 62% and 70% below 2005 levels. Alas their projections suggest we will be nowhere near that:If the graph does not display click hereOne major reason we will fall short is the government projects increased demand for electricity.OK, let’s just keep those two things in our heads and now get back to the GDP figures.The figures had two major revisions to household income. The first was a nerdy data change for how the Australian Bureau of Statistics measures superannuation investment income. The second occurred from the ABS including the income from electricity generationfrom household solar panels.The ABS estimates that “rooftop solar electricity saved households over $3bn in 2024-25”.This, combined with better measure of superannuation incomes, means that households are doing a lot better than previously thought.In the June figures, living standards were essentially at the same level they were in March 2020; now the ABS estimates they are much improved:If the graph does not display click hereIt rather destroys the opposition’s line about a collapse in living standards. Once you ignore the abnormal impacts of the Covid-19 payments and stimulus, living standards are about 3% above what they were in March 2020 and have grown strongly over the past 15 months.A key reason is that lower interest rates mean households are on average paying 10% less on their mortgage than they were at the end of last year.So the shape of the economy is improved due to stronger household incomes from falling interest rates, and households being better off because they have invested in solar panels.Not only is renewable energy the cheapest from of electricity generation, it is now clearly leading to a more prosperous Australia.What else do the GDP figures tell us? The major driver of growth in the September quarter was private investment in machinery and equipment:If the graph does not display click hereThe ABS head of national accounts, Grace Kim,notedthat this “reflects the ongoing expansions of datacentres. This is likely due to firms looking to support growth in artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities.”This is very clear from theprivate investment figuresreleased last week:If the graph does not display click hereSo investment in datacentres is driving economic growth.Sounds great. But how about the shape?Guardian Australia’s Petra Stock and Josh Taylor reported this week thatdatacentres could account for 11% and 8% of electricity demandin New South Wales and Victoria respectively by 2030.Under the national AI plan, datacentres will need to “offset” their emissions. The federal industry minister, Tim Ayres,told Sky Newson Tuesday that the increased energy requirements from datacentres could be met with “low-cost renewables, storage, hydro [and], gas peaking”.The latest inflation figures offer no joy – except to the gas producers whose windfall profits remain largely untouched | Greg JerichoRead moreAt this point we need to return to those greenhouse gas emissions figures, because the government itself has told us they don’t think the offsets will do much, and instead datacentres will increase emissions.The government’sprojections of emissions report, released last week, states that “after 2030, electricity sector emissions are projected to decline to 2040 albeit at a much slower rate … as increasing electricity demand from electrification and data centres is being met by a combination of coal, gas, and renewable generation.”This brings us back to the shape.These GDP figures indicate households are now better off due to investing in solar panels and this has also driven a drop in greenhouse gas emissions. And yet at the same time the government is fully committed to encouraging investment in datacentres which will consume masses of energy that will, in turn, increase emissions.Both solar panels and datacentres might drive the size of the economy but they deliver a much different shape.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

It was one of the most urgent questions asked in 2021 when a serving police officer, PC Wayne Couzens, was charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. In thefirst reportof Elish Angiolini’s inquiry into this dreadful sequence of events, published in February last year, she made the eminently sensible recommendation that any individual with a caution or conviction for a sexual offence should be rejected during police vetting.It seemed the very least that should happen, yet we’ve learned from Lady Angiolini’ssecond report this weekthat the recommendation has yet to be implemented. She reveals that it took 18 months after publication for police chiefs to agree a blanket ban on recruits who have convictions, and even then it wasn’t included in draft Home Office regulations issued in September this year.The Home Office has now told Angiolini that a ban will be included, but it won’t be retrospective. The delay is all the more astonishing because her first report highlighted a series of “lamentable and repeated” missed opportunities to stop Couzens, who was a heavy user of violent pornography and had a history of exposing himself in public. Couzens should never have been a police officer and neither shouldDavid Carrick, who was sent to prison for life in 2023 for committing sexual offences against more than a dozen women while serving in the same force.Angiolini’s latest report offers an insight into the extent of the problem, revealing that checks against the police national database in 2023-24 led to 461 police officers, staff and volunteers being referred to “an appropriate authority”. Nine cases triggered further criminal investigations and 88 disciplinary investigations.As Angiolini reminds us, all sorts of promises were made after Everard’s murder. Yet here we are, more than four years later, reading another report that is basically a catalogue of repeated and preventable failures. A quarter of police forces in England and Wales have yet to implement “basic policies for investigating sexual offences”. Neither police nor government ministers know the scale ofattacks on womenin public spaces by strangers. Efforts to reduce violence against women are “fragmented, underfunded and overly reliant on short-term solutions”. Apromise in 2023to give violence against women and girls (VAWG) the same status in crime prevention as terrorism hasn’t been met.The truth is that it isn’t a priority at all. “Too often prevention in this space remains just words,” Angiolini says bluntly. Labour won an election almost 18 months ago with an eye-catching promise tocut VAWG by half within a decade, but Angiolini points out that the government’s strategy for delivering on the promise has yet to be revealed.No one should be surprised. Violence against women is a more reliable producer of reports than measures that might give sexual predators pause. There is a familiar pattern here, beginning with uproar in the media when a particularly egregious offender is finally exposed, followed by the panicked commissioning of yet another report. The conviction in2009 of John Worboys, the taxi driver who drugged and raped women who got into his cab, was rapidly followed by theStern review.The then home secretary, Theresa May, gave the Stern report aneffusive welcome. “Our comprehensive and detailed action plan sets out how we are going to tackle these crimes – supporting those at risk, helping victims and ensuring offenders are brought to justice”, she declared. I don’t doubt she was sincere, but by 2021 a sharp drop in the number of rape prosecutions prompted the then government to set up an “end-to-end rape review”. Three years later, things were even worse, leading Labour to describe the number of prosecutions as “shamefully low” in its 2024 election manifesto.So many reviews, so much hand-wringing, yet impunity remains the norm for the vast majority of rapists. The reason is not hard to find: sexual violence is a crime that prompts more scrutiny of the victim than the offender. Until very recently, traumatised women were told an investigation could not go ahead unless they signed a formgiving detectives accessto their work and home computers, school and medical records since birth, and handed over their mobile phones. No such demands were made of suspects, even though text messages and habitual use of violent porn might be relevant to building a case.Disbelief is at the heart of this scandalous situation. Not just disbelief of individual women, although that’s bad enough, but an underlying attitude among some officers that rape doesn’t really exist – and a reluctance by police chiefs and ministers to make it grounds for dismissal. Three years ago, a report for the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the Home Office admitted that investigations were being hampered by officers whodismissed rape reportsas “regretful sex”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the quality of investigations is undeniably affected by the calibre of the officers carrying them out, some of whom inhabit a culture (like that alleged atCharing Cross in central London) where misogyny and racism is rife.That’s why Angiolini’s insistence that “perpetrators must be the focus” could not be more timely or welcome. So is David Lammy’s announcement on Tuesday that rape victims willno longer be portrayed as serial liarsin courtrooms. Victim blaming has been allowed to flourish in the criminal justice system for far too long, encouraged by a failure to root out police officers who share the mindset of perpetrators.Joan Smith was co-chair of the mayor of London’s Violence Against Women and Girls Board from 2013-2021Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For terminally ill people, the assisted dying bill must not create further obstaclesWed 3 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 03.38 ESTShareThree years ago, I sat in a hotel inZurich, awaiting my flight home, wondering how I was going to get through the next few weeks and months. Having been with my wife, Christy, atDignitasthe day before, I was hoping I would avoid prosecution. That day had been the most profound day of my life, full of great sadness, but also great love, and a sense of peace that Christy had been able to die as she wished, without going through the inevitable pain and difficulty that she dreaded. A month earlier, she had written in her diary: “I don’t feel particularly frightened of the death itself. I am frightened about having to let go of life. I feel I have lived life to the absolute full … But … I’m not prepared to go on living this painful and difficult life as it continues to worsen.”Don’t let anyone tell you that it’s an easy process to go to Dignitas. It is not. Christy had six months of covert bureaucracy and constant stress that someone might find out and stop her from going, as well as anxiety about the legal jeopardy I would face.Why should anyone have to go through all that additional trauma at the most vulnerable time of their life? After first contacting Dignitas, she wrote: “Feeling an enormous sense of relief at the possibility of assisted dying. Realise I have been … living under a cloud of fear for two years now. There seem to be new symptoms every week. I’ve been independent all my life. It’s the loss of this that is hardest to bear.”Back in London, I had no thought that a change in the law might be imminent, and the last thing on my mind was to campaign for change. Yet I now find myself on the board of the campaign groupMy Death, My Decision, horrified at the behaviour of asmall group of peerswho appear to be prepared to go to any lengths to derail theassisted dying bill. After watching the second day of the committee debate, I wanted to scream at the TV: “What about terminally ill people? Why is no one talking about them? Where is the empathy?”View image in fullscreenDave Sowry and his wife, Christy.Photograph: Dave Sowry/The GuardianImagine you’ve got weeks or months left to live. How would you want to spend that time? Perhaps visiting family, friends and places, spending time reflecting, doing those things you’ve always been meaning to do while you still can. The last thing you’d want is to be ensnared in a web of bureaucracy that is your only way to get the comfort that the option of an assisted death can provide.Watching theHouse of Lordsdebate, it would be easy to forget who the bill is about. Terminally ill people should be the focus of all the deliberations. Instead, what we’ve been seeing is a series of speeches about almost anything except how to enable the intent of the bill. This bill will ensure there are safeguards to protect vulnerable people. However, it exists to provide an option at the end of life for those people who want to live the best last weeks or months of their life that they can.Ahead of the next committee debateon Friday, I would ask everyone in the Lords the same question: if we had perfect palliative care, and fully funded hospices, and all the possible safeguards included, would you still be against the bill in principle? I suspect that for the people who have submitted the vast majority of the amendments, the honest answer would be “yes”.Everyone agrees the current system is unsafe and the status quo is unacceptable. Peers need to be honest with themselves and honest with those people for whom they intend to deny the option of an assisted death. They must stop hiding behind the pretence that only 1,000-plus amendments willmake the bill workable, while going as slowly as possible to frustrate progress.I’ve listened to every single minute of the debate. I’ve looked at all 1,127 (and still counting) amendments, and frankly, it is depressing to think that this is the level of discussion that goes on in the House of Lords.To those members of the House of Lords who imply that they occupy the moral high ground, I would say this: there’s plenty of room on the moral high ground. Your moral framework is no more valid than mine is. I don’t want to impose my moral framework on you, and if the bill goes through, then you won’t have to do anything that you feel uncomfortable with. You don’t have to take up the option of an assisted death, but I really resent having that option denied to me and to those, like my wife, who had to suffer under the current system.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among this year’s Christmas movie releases are Zootropolis 2 (the first Zootropolis came out in 2016), Avatar: Fire and Ash (third in a series that began in 2009), and Wicked: For Good (part two of the adaptation of a musical that premiered in 2003).New stories are risky. It is safer to retell old ones. British politics feels similarly afflicted by paralysis of the imagination, intimidated by change, stuck in a narrative loop.After much pre-publicity, last week finally saw the release of the Rachel Reeves fiscal blockbuster,Budget II: the Quest for More Headroom.The plot was not very different from 2024’sBudget I: Filling a Black Hole.Both times the chancellor was under pressure to consolidate public finances without starving state services or breaking an election pledge not to use the Treasury’s biggest revenue-raising levers. Both times she hiked other taxes, clinging to the letter of the manifesto while shredding it in spirit.Reviews for the sequelwere bad, but Labour MPs are happy that action has been taken toalleviate child poverty. Bond markets stayed calm, which the Treasury chalks up as a win.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, denounced Reeves for presenting “a budget for Benefits Street, paid for by working people”.No marks for originalitythere.Benefits Streetwas a documentary that aired in 2014. The charge that social spending siphons cash from dutiful taxpayers to scrounging layabouts has been in the Tory repertoire for generations.As Badenoch’s leadership has faltered, she has become ever more reliant on her party’s rhetorical back catalogue. In the early months, she toyed with novel arguments, trying to make Conservatism relevant to the 2020s. There was an elaborate critique of modern liberalism having been “hacked” by authoritarian leftists. There was a theory of economic decline caused by wokecivil servantsand a glut of human resources managers.Those weird diagnoses, mostly convoluted restatements of small-state Conservative orthodoxy, didn’t catch on. Badenoch came under growing pressure to say something that her shrinking base could cheer (or even understand). So she kept it simple and ran repeats of classic Tory favourites: cut taxes, welfare and immigration; build a bonfire of red tape; down with Europeans and their meddlesome human rights; all hail Mrs Thatcher, the last truly Conservative prime minister.In the marketplace of lazy political sequels, Badenoch can’t compete withNigel Farage. The Reform UK leader is always on screen, plugging the umpteenth iteration of his anti-foreigner franchise. The script for his next general election campaign is already written. Brexit II: Take Maximum Control.The opposition would find it harder to repackage and sell the past in this way if Labour had a governing agenda that described the future in compelling terms. ButKeir Starmercame to office light on policy, with a campaign strategy cribbed from a 1997 Tony Blair playbook which itself had been drafted in reaction to Labour’s traumatic defeat in 1992. For want of the courage to win a difficult argument over taxes, Starmer and his shadow chancellor bound themselves with pledges best suited to help Neil Kinnock beat John Major in a hypothetical rerun of an election 32 years previously.In opposition, Reeves had attempted some renewal of centre-left economic doctrine. She called it “securonomics”. The argument was that markets could no longer be relied on to drive prosperity. That era was over. In the new volatile times, the state could facilitate wealth creation by underwriting economic security at national and individual level – promoting social protection, restoring labour rights and funding infrastructure investment.If you hold Reeves’s budgets up to the light at a favourable angle, you can still see the outline of that idea. If the money now being spent does somehow generate collective wellbeing in excess of all current forecasts, the chancellor will be vindicated.But per-capita disposable incomes are set to rise by just0.5% per yearover the rest of the parliament. There is no secret growth-stimulating sauce. Without one, “securonomics” is reduced to an exercise in buying time with concessions to restive Labour MPs and hoping to avoid economic accidents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two flaws stand out. First, the government doesn’t look stable. Second, domestic conditions are vulnerable to external shocks in a turbulent world. With Donald Trump in the White House, some kind of crisis looks probable.Starmer spends enough time jetting around the globe in response to international volatility to be aware of the problem. In a foreign policy speech on Monday at the Lady Mayor’s Banquet in London, the prime minister offered a rare window on to his geopolitical perspective. He identified the US, the EU and China as “three global giants … all interacting with each other” and predicted that Britain’s future “will be determined by how we navigate this dynamic”.He set out his navigational principles. Britain should build alliancesanddo unilateral deals. The national interest is best secured through engagement with “like-minded nations” on the basis of “democracy, freedom, the rule of law”, but thatshouldn’t preventdeeper business links with China. Apparently there is no contradiction there. Some kind of firewall will prevent commercial entanglement compromising national security.Starmer dismisses any notion of a strategic choice between Europe and the US. He doesn’t expect that Washington and Brussels will make incompatible claims on Britain’s allegiance in matters of trade or security. (They surely will.) It is unclear how this policy ofequidistancesits with the Trump administration’s indulgence of Kremlin positions on Ukraine.Maybe the US constitution will withstand assault by Maga authoritarianism and a reliable transatlantic partnership can be restored. Maybe the model of rules-based, globalised free trade that suited Britain’s economy isn’t lost for ever. Just maybe. But also maybe the fall of American democracy is a looming geopolitical shock equivalent in scale to the collapse of the USSR.It would be reassuring to think the prime minister is measuring that risk. It feels likelier he is just hoping bad things won’t happen. In that respect, Starmer’s foreign policy and Reeves’s budgets do form a doctrine of sorts. They are as one in claiming todeal with the world as it is, while their actions plead in vain for restoration of the world as it once was.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudget 2025Rachel ReevesKeir StarmerNigel FarageKemi BadenochForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Now, at 96, she’s stealing the show in Eleanor the Great. What’s her secret? ‘Be a looker-ahead’Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTShareIt is surely a comfort to anyone still awaiting mega-success to know that June Squibb was in her mid-80s before she hit the big time. Her role as a foul-mouthed matriarch in the 2013 film Nebraska brought her an Oscar nomination, and she had her first leading role in last year’s action comedy, Thelma. Now she’s playing the lead again, in the new film Eleanor the Greatandshe’s currently in rehearsals for a show on Broadway. Is Squibb, who has just turned 96, sick of talking about her late-peaking success? “I think people are interested, so no, it’s not a bad thing,” she says. “But it is funny, because when I first came to New York – it was the 50s – I did The Boy Friend, a musical, and I was a big hit.” But it was theatre, she concedes. “The film thing is so different.”In Eleanor the Great, Scarlett Johansson’s directorial debut, Squibb plays Eleanor Morgenstein, a 94-year-old woman who, mourning the loss of her best friend Bessie, moves from Florida to New York to be near her daughter. Encouraged to make new friends, Eleanor goes to the local Jewish community centre to join a choir, but the woman belting out Stephen Sondheim is enough to make anyone rush for the door. “Oh god,” mutters Eleanor, backing away, before being scooped up by the Holocaust survivors group, meeting at the same time, who erroneously assume she’s one of them. Lonely and grieving, US-born Eleanor finds herself passing off Bessie’s survival story as her own.I spent a whole day in bed with a guy.  We started laughing. We didn’t even know each other!“I just loved her from the beginning,” she says, speaking via Zoom from the rented New York apartment she stays in for theatre rehearsals. “All the quirks. She’s just so full of everything. I mean, she’s not very nice sometimes, and I like that because it gives you something.” Eleanor’s awful lie gets dangerously out of control when Nina – a young journalism student she befriends, played by British actor Erin Kellyman – wants to bring her story to a wider audience.View image in fullscreen‘She’s wonderful, very honest, very open’ … with Scarlett Johansson at Cannes this year.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageIt was a lovely shoot, says Squibb. Johansson was “wonderful. She’s very honest, very open.” Squibb and Kellyman became real-life friends, put up in the same apartment building by the production. Squibb would invite Kellyman to dinner at her place, or to dinner parties Squibb gave at the Joe Allen brasserie, the theatre district institution. “Erin met a lot of my friends from New York, people that I’ve known for years.” Does Squibb have lots of younger friends too? “I do,” she says. “Well, at my age, everybody’s pretty much younger.”Squibb is great company, funny and wise, the sort of person you could ask anything: sex, politics and religion are not off-limits. “Everyone thinks older people aren’t sexual but I think about sex,” Eleanor tells Erin. What about Squibb? “I think so, sure,” she says with a smile. “If I see a handsome young man, I recognise that this is a handsome young man. I don’t think I dwell on it maybe the way I did when I was younger, but we’re still thinking about it.”How does she feel about the political situation in the US, and other parts of the world? “It worries me – and I’ve been through a lot. I’ve seen a lot. I think the world is in a really scary place. I’m just appalled. Now people are brazenly showing the swastika all over. I mean, that’s scary.”Johansson cast real-lifeHolocaustsurvivors in the support group, including Sami Steigmann, a prominent speaker and educator. And Rita Zohar, who plays Bessie, was born in a concentration camp in what is now Ukraine. Steigmann especially, Squibb says, “was so dear. He was welcoming me, rather than me saying, ‘I’m here and you’re coming in [to my film].’ That I loved. It was a wonderful experience, not at all what I thought it would be. There’s no doom and gloom. We were there, we worked together and did our jobs.”Squibb was a teenager when the second world war ended. She remembers seeing photographs in news magazines of concentration camps being liberated. They would stay with her all her life. “It was horrifying.”Some critics feel that to fake a Holocaust experience is an especially dreadful kind of lie and morally irredeemable. Squibb is more understanding. “I do think that Eleanor’s need was to be close to Bessie and [the support group is] where she needs to do this. I can understand that. It does bring her closer.” The idea would seem to have its critics in the film industry too –Johansson said this week that one of the project’s financial backers pulled out when she refused to drop the Holocaust elements.Grief is a big theme of the film – not just Eleanor’s, but also that of Erin, who has recently lost her mother. At the age of 96, Squibb must have had to learn a lot about dealing with grief, not just the loss of friends and colleagues, but her husband of 40 years. “Well, I am a great looker-ahead,” she says. “I always think, ‘What’s going to happen tomorrow?’ I don’t say it’s easy. I don’t mean that at all, but I think that’s what I do. When my husband died, I was more interested in protecting my son, who was in his 20s. He wasn’t a child, but it affected him tremendously. So rather than suffering grief, I was trying to help him get through it.”View image in fullscreenDinner at her place … with Erin Kellyman and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Eleanor the Great.Photograph: PRSquibb grew up in Vandalia, the small city in Illinois, where her father ran a clothing shop, before joining the navy during the war and later setting up a successful insurance company. Her mother had played the piano at a cinema showing silent movies, then stayed at home to look after Squibb, an only child. She felt, she says, “from the time I had any thoughts, that I was an actress. It never occurred to me that I was anything else. I have no idea where it came from.” She took any drama or dance classes she could, then joined the Cleveland Play House. Her parents weren’t that happy. “My father was rather proud of me, but my mother always hated it. I think she would have loved it if I had just stayed in Vandalia my whole life and did the usual, gotten married, had children. That’s what she wanted.”View image in fullscreenTheatre trouper … Squibb in the 1950s.Photograph: Courtesy: June SquibbSquibb did get married in her early 20s, and converted toJudaism– something she says felt important to her, not because her new Jewish husband or his family expected it. It was “a wonderful experience”. The marriage only lasted for seven years, but Squibb’s faith remained, even though her second husband, Charles Kakatsakis, an acting teacher, was not Jewish. “I’m very pleased and proud to be able to say I’m Jewish.”By her late 20s, she had moved to New York and was working in the theatre, including in Gypsy on Broadway in 1959, in which she played the stripper Electra. “I had seen it early on, and it just knocked me out. I loved Ethel Merman in it. She was a force of nature. I loved the show, and to be going into it – wow! That number, You Gotta Get a Gimmick, every night it just blew the house away.”She made extra money with modelling, for trade shows. “Like automobile shows – I would be the host with shorts and the low-cut top and fishnet hose.” With a laugh, she says she also did photographs for true-life confessions in magazines. That sounds quite racy. “Well, it was. It was funny. I remember one day this guy and I spent the whole day in bed together and we started laughing. We don’t even know each other.”For a young woman working in the 50s and 60s, sexual harassment was somewhat inevitable. “But I also was rather naive, and I think I didn’t see a lot of it. But of course, there was. I was a dancer, too, so it was always no clothes – just the legs out all the time!” When the #MeToo movement started, she remembers talking to a friend who had been a dancer at the same time. “I said, ‘How did we handle it?’ We both agreed that we – and other women we knew – knew what the line was, and you didn’t go over it.”View image in fullscreenHer first lead role …  with Richard Roundtree in 2024’s Thelma.Photograph: NBC UniversalSquibb was in her early 60s when she got her first film role, in Woody Allen’s Alice, and soon she was racking up small roles in big films – working with Martin Scorsese in The Age of Innocence, with Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman, with Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt. Did she feel nervous going on to film sets with such names? “No, it was always just work,” she says. “I had the script. I learned it and I was ready to go.” It helped, she laughs, that “I always feel my role is the leading role, no matter what it is. I have that ego that whatever I’m doing is the important thing in this film.”Now Squibb is in the leading film roles, and long may it continue. She seems to have that theatre trouper resilience and work ethic, ingrained since her early training. While shooting Eleanor the Great, Squibb came down with bronchitis but, in Johansson’s words, “powered through”. She says: “I have always had a stamina and energy, and I don’t think I’ve lost that, not completely anyway. When I was working, I always managed to find the stamina to keep going, whether it was a matinee into an evening or whatever.” She has, she adds, always had a feeling “that I can do anything”.Eleanor the Great is in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmScarlett JohanssonAgeingHolocaustJudaisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Hold on to your musical memories and reclaim ownership of your tasteWed 3 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTShareIlike year-end list season. I like an opportunity to remember and reflect on the records that stuck with me over the course of a year – especially when there is a chance to recommend something that others may have overlooked. I like looking through friends’ favourites for albums that I missed completely, and making a big listening queue. I like following along as critics attempt to determine the year’s “best”, even when I end up yelling into a group chat about how wrong they all are. I like it because it all requires looking back, racking your brain and processing your year in listening. It requires thinking.This year, asSpotifyWrapped takes over social media feeds again, I am struck by how the whole concept seems to discourage that critical practice for something more passive. It nudges listeners away from deep consideration and towards accepting a corporate-branded scorecard reflecting a very specific perspective on musical value. It encourages music fans to believe that the records they streamed the most must be the ones they liked the most, which is surely not always the case.What’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our yearsWhat is lost when we entrust Spotify’s systems of data collection and interpretation to do our year-end reflections for us? What ideas and recaps are we not writing and sharing when we hand over that labour to tech companies who would prefer to automate our thinking? What playlist are you not making when you share the one Spotify has made for you?As with other ways in which convenience culture infects music – from personalised playlists to prompt-based audio generation and beyond – it makes sense that some fans would receive their results, see the “share” button, and dutifully comply. But what’s at stake is a sense of our own musical memories, and our own personal archives of our years. When our own thoughts and recollections aren’t written down they can simply get lost. When we just accept that what a streaming service tells us about our music taste is true, there is much that we arenotremembering, learning or celebrating about the music of our years and lives.Mood Machine by Liz Pelly review – a savage indictment of SpotifyRead moreSpotify Wrapped now feels like just another example of something personal and precious that is being automated away from us; another example of a supposedly unbearable task of thinking and writing being “offloaded” in order to make life more frictionless. It is an especially urgent consideration in 2025, a landmark year for consumers being sold on this sort of cognitive offloading via consumer-facing AI. It can feel as though every day there is some new start-up prompt-based surveillance product claiming to ease the daily burdens of reading, writing, researching, summarising or brainstorming – but this is the work that helps shape how we think, how we make connections, what we remember and what we forget. It may sometimes feel unpleasant and it may require friction, but friction is where connections get made, and working through that process is a part of staying sharp and curious and in relationship with the world around us. Without those points of friction, the degeneration of critical thinking just continues.There is much to be said about how corporate decision-making shapes public memory when it comes to music – not just because marketing budgets often determine what becomes popular but because corporate strategy decides the very metrics that dictate what has value. But Wrapped does not just use corporate metrics to communicate what’s important to the market – it uses the same logic to make claims about what’s important toyou. It reinforces its own logic into not just taste but one’s sense of self.View image in fullscreenSpotify Wrapped takes over a digital art space in London.Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for SpotifyAnd there are other reasons to find the whole Wrapped idea generally troubling – and not just Wrapped but the similar year-end recap campaigns that other streaming services have launched to mimic it. These are essentially meme-like advertising campaigns for companies that notoriously pay musicians penny fractions. And they are only possible due to user-surveillance practices. As for Spotify specifically, in a year in which the biggest music streaming company has made headlines for its outgoing CEO’s investment in military AI technology and thesubsequent artist boycotts, its deals with major labelsto build generative AI products, big changes in its leadership and its running of ICE recruitment ads, there will likely be much Wrapped-synchronised commentary on the state of streaming – and the varied reasons users will find for opting out this year.‘One minute it’s “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved’: can anyone escape Spotify?Read moreSo what will we opt into instead? This year, rather than letting a streaming service tell you what records were important to you simply because you played them the most on one app, consider taking the time to write a list based on what you actually connected with. Share it if you feel like it – even if it’s just a notes app screenshot or a scribbled, handwritten list that you photograph and share with a caption. Even if you only text or email it to some friends. Or if you prefer, write it in a notebook just for yourself and your archives.I can already hear some of the defeatist replies this idea is likely to receive: “But the people who post their Wrapped were never going to make their own lists anyway!” To which I say: “Why not?” It may require some research but at least you can determine the parameters for yourself. I would suggest a list of records you feel may have been overlooked, or a list of your favourite local releases. Or how about a list of the most exciting live shows you saw, or the most surprising new-to-you music from the past? The possibilities are limitless.

They asked me to photograph the country’sleading athletesbefore the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. I probably covered 30 different people over three days – I’m a quick shooter. I started out photographing on film, which is still my preferred medium. Even when I’m shooting digitally, I’m very selective and take care with every click.On a logistical level, it was much easier for me to work in a studio, though that was something I don’t usually choose to do. I’m more of an outside photographer: I like to go on location or shoot people in a park.For me, photography is a way to learn more about subjects. I use the camera to unlock new things that interest me. I’m informing myself rather than trying to inform the viewer. I photographed therave scenein the 90s because I was excited by it and wanted to get closer to it. And I photographed my home town ofRovigolong after I’d moved away, in an attempt to get to know more about the place I’d left behind.In this case, I didn’t know these people, but I always asked for half an hour just to talk with each subject first. I didn’t discuss the pictures – I just wanted to know where the person was coming from. I’d ask simple questions like: “What did you do yesterday? Are you married? What’s the last TV series you enjoyed? Which football team do you support?” Portraying someone is a sort of collaboration, but I didn’t discuss with each sitter how they wanted to be photographed. They trusted me to do my thing.Photography has to be spontaneous and instinctive – I feel more like a thief than a painterDonato Telesca, the subject of this picture, is a powerlifter who went on to win bronze at theParalympics. I’d been shooting him sitting against a vertical background, some more straightforward images, but while we were taking a break, and I was having a coffee, I noticed him leaning back on the floor and resting. There was also, by chance, a ladder in the studio, so I said: “Donato, please don’t move!” I took the ladder, jumped on it and photographed him from above.For me, photography has to be like that – spontaneous and instinctive. Something catches my eye and I want to capture it. I feel more like a thief than a painter, if you see what I mean. Here, I wanted to keep a reportage photographer type of approach, so I was shooting with the continuous light rather than using flash. When I go on location, I never arrive with an idea. I want to be able to improvise. That’s the method I took for this series.Some photographers who shoot in studios try to hide the fact, but I wanted to make it obvious that’s where we were. For example, I deliberately included things like the metal wheel of the ladder and that Scotch tape on the floor in the shape of an arrow. The Olympic Committee were wary of this approach but gave me complete creative freedom, and they were happy when they saw the results.I don’t really like explaining my pictures. I think that demeans them in a way, like trying to explain a song or a poem. But I do love to hear other people’s interpretations. Some people seeing this image for the first time didn’t immediately realise Donato has no legs – they thought he might just be sitting in a weird position. The orientation of the photograph adds another layer of ambiguity. Until you realise it’s taken from above, you might imagine Donato is defying gravity. But the most important thing is that when I showed him the picture, Donato was over the moon.View image in fullscreenMattia Zoppellaro.Photograph: Courtesy Mattia ZoppellaroMattia Zoppellaro’s CVBorn: Rovigo, Italy, 1980High point:“Beside shooting stars such as Lou Reed, Bono and Patti Smith, working on my current project on the Arabic world in northern Italy.”Top tip:“Travel light, sell the tripod – and don’t show the images to your subject before making your selection.”This image is part of theTaylor Wessing Portrait Photo prize exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 8 February.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyParalympicsParis Paralympic Games 2024Disability and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were building a theatre that wasn’t meant to exist in Belarus. Tom replied almost instantly: “You can count on my support. But what else can I do for you?” Our request was both audacious and simple: we asked him to come to Belarus.He agreed, asking only for some time to finish the final edit ofRock’n’Roll. When he arrived, he didn’t give the classes we had asked for. Instead he listened, he asked questions. We took him to meet the whole underground resistance movement: artists, underground theatre-makers, the wives of friends who had been kidnapped and murdered, political prisoners, youth activists, journalists and human rights defenders. Sitting with us in the “London” bar in Minsk, he said something that captured everything we felt but had not yet found the words for: “A dictatorship is not a political category, it is a moral one.”Tom became Belarus Free Theatre’s lifelong patron and our mentor. He told us, with a directness that always cut through the noise, that if we wanted to influence politics, we had to write great plays and stage great productions, because people only listen to those who know what they’re doing.He proved that point at the Brussels Forum, one of the world’s most prominent political gatherings, where we had asked him to speak. For days afterwards, the corridors were ringing with praise for the playwright who understood the dangers of rising authoritarianism in Europe and beyond, more clearly than many politicians. He explained it simply, through the prism of his own childhood.Tom was our guardian angel and dear friend. We will miss his love, his humanity, the moral clarity and steadiness he taught us to carry into the world. Thank you, dear Tom. We love you.‘His face cracked up with that devilish smile’Carrie Cracknell,directing Arcadia at the Old Vic in London next yearView image in fullscreenGenuine enthusiasm … Stoppard in 2023.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianI can thank Tom for many things, not least for ending my very uninspiring early acting career. Cast as Annie in a student production of The Real Thing, I was simply no match for his dazzling dialogue, speed of thought or emotional depths. It was a moment of utter clarity about my own limits, and one that sent me headlong down a path to a career as a director. I told him this on one of our recent Zoom calls, and his face cracked up with that devilish smile that seemed to make the room change temperature.It has been a great honour to have conversations with Tom over the past few months. His work ethic remained resolutely undimmed – engaging in each casting decision and wanting to discuss his beautiful, complex and multilayered play. At points he would pause for thought, cigarette in hand, and I would feel as though I was gazing through the screen at a living portrait, a precious moment in time. Aside from his profound intellect Tom seemed defined by a rare humility and genuine enthusiasm. As we begin rehearsals forArcadianext week, his loss will be felt keenly by the whole company.‘He suggested we stage the crowded bar scene on a table’Nina Raine, director of Rock’n’Roll at Hampstead theatre, London, in2023View image in fullscreenCharming, brutal … Tom Stoppard and Nina Raine in rehearsals for Rock’n’Roll.Photograph: Manuel HarlanTom was a weird mixture of contradictions. He was very charming. He was also brutal and blunt in the service of his plays. In Moscow, watching rehearsals of The Coast of Utopia, he once turned to me and whispered “I wish that actor would stop grinning like Father Christmas in a Coca-Cola commercial.”Part of Tom was very literal. And part of him was delighted by the liberties, departure and flights of imagination taken by the director.In Rock’n’Roll, Tom envisaged a totally realistic Cambridge house with a conservatory and garden (as seen in the first Trevor Nunn production in 2006). I saw an empty space, in the round, with a table. I could see Tom was uncertain about this bold move. The set designer Anna Reid and I had a terrifying afternoon in Tom’s Notting Hill flat. Talking him through the model box, we couldn’t eat the sandwiches he’d bought us. At last, Tom seemed persuaded.‘We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard!’ – actors salute the great playwrightRead moreWe then auditioned many tables (I texted him photographs). Was this too small? Did that look enough like agardentable? Could this also serve as a desk in Prague? I felt a huge pride, near the end of rehearsals, when Tom rang me to suggest we stage a crowded bar sceneon the table.Finally, he was more radical than I was. Unfortunately, the table couldn’t take the weight of the actors.In the hyper-naturalistic Nunn production, there were long blackouts with music. We, on the other hand, would go to a half-light, and non-verbal balletic “action” to music – as I explained to Tom often, feeling more pretentious each time. I absolutely dreaded him watching the process, so I cunningly arranged his afternoons off for our movement sessions. But I’ll never forget Tom deciding, unbidden, to stay on and watch. The actors were leaping about, jumping, skipping, primal-screaming – preparatory work. I was in agony. Tom watched, utterly fascinated, and then turned to the wonderful choreographer, Jane Gibson: “I’d like to do that.”Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreBelarus Free TheatreCarrie CracknellPolitical theatreOld Vic TheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

These sprawling technological endeavours, which mix narrative, social connectivity and the complete freedom to explore, are uniquely immersive and potentially endless. But do they represent a whole new idea of storytelling?This week I met Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar and lead writer on Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, who has been in London to talk about his new company, Absurd Ventures. He’s working on a range of intriguing projects, including the novel and podcast seriesA Better Paradise(about a vast online game that goes tragically wrong), and a comedy-adventure set in an online world namedAbsurdaverse. He told me that, 15 years ago, he was doing press interviews for the Grand Theft Auto IV expansion packs when he had something of a revelation about the series.“I was talking to a journalist from Paris Match, a very cultured French guy – and he said, ‘Well, theGrand Theft Autogames are just like Dickens’. And I was like, God bless you for saying that! But I thought about it afterwards and, well, they’re not as good as Dickens, but they are similar in that he’s world-building. If you look at Dickens, Zola, Tolstoy or any of those authors, there’s that feeling of all the world is here – that’s what you’re trying to get in open world games. It’s a twisted prism, looking at a society that’s interesting in one way or another.”View image in fullscreenA whole new world … Absurdaverse.Photograph: Absurd Ventures/XIt was fun to talk about this idea with Houser, because I share his view that there are striking similarities between Victorian literature and modern narrative video games. The vast amount of descriptive detail in those works was intended as a form of virtual reality, conjuring an exact image into the mind of the readers years before the invention of cinema. There is also that sense of complete immersion. The first time I read Jane Eyre a decade ago, I was amazed by the interiority of the writing, how much information we were given about the lead character’s thought processes and how much freedom we were given to explore them.Houser also saw a structural similarity in Grand Theft Auto. “There’s that same sense of slightly spread out storytelling that you get in those big 19th-century novels from Thackeray onwards,” he says. “They are kind of shaggy dog stories that come together at a point. Those books are also very realist, in a way. They’re not leaping backwards and forwards in time. They are quite physical in that sense, and games are very physical.”For Houser, this interplay between Victorian literature and game design came to a head with the production ofRed Dead Redemption2, Rockstar’s masterful, elegiac tale of revenge and redemption in the late 19th-century US. “I binged on Victorian novels for that,” he says. “I listened to the audiobook of Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it.” He’d had trouble finding the correct tone for the dialogue in the game, but by merging Middlemarch, Sherlock Holmes and cowboy pulp fiction, he found it.View image in fullscreen‘I listened to the audio book of Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day’, Dan Houser.Photograph: Chelsea Guglielmino/Getty Images“I wanted it to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic,” he told me. “I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up. We were trying to fill out the three-dimensional lives of the characters, and also to capture that 19th-century feeling of life and death, which was very different from ours.”I found it so pleasing that Victorian literature has had such a profound effect on Rockstar’s hugely successful adventures. The games industry can be so inward-looking, each new game a slight variation on a successful predecessor, each narrative a combination of the same fantasy and sci-fi set texts. There’s nothing wrong with drawing on Tolkien or Akira or Blade Runner, but it’s always worthwhile extending that literary gaze. I’m looking forward to seeing how Houser’s new ventures redefine the notion of open-world games for the second quarter of the 21st century, but part of me wishes he was going all out with a sprawling Victorian novel adventure.Forget Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, maybe it’s time for Middlemarch and Machine Guns?What to playView image in fullscreenGorgeously atmospheric … Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.Photograph: NintendoIt has been 18 years since the last Metroid Prime game. People have been born, started school, done their exams, and had their first hangovers in the time since I last viewed a mysterious planet through the visor of Samus Aran. So there’s quite a lot riding onMetroid Prime 4: Beyondfor fans of Nintendo’s most badass (and neglected) hero.I reviewed itthis week and am happy to say that it’s not a disaster. It’s uneven, old-fashioned and a bit awkward, but also gorgeously atmospheric, beautiful to look at and listen to, and very entertaining. It’s almost fascinatingly unconcerned with the conventions of modern game design, and I found it very charming.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:15-20 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While I adored Red Dead Redemption 2, it frustrated me that the only option to resolve most situations was with a firearm. I’ve seen plenty of amusing videos where players try to complete innately violent titles without bloodshed, so there seems to be an appetite for pacifism.”I have vivid memories of playing the originalSplinter Cellon Xbox as a pacifist: only knocking enemies out and hiding them, never killing them. It took meforever, but it was a legitimate option offered by the game. Steampunk masterpieceDishonoredand its sequel also famously let you finish the whole thing without killing anyone. You can use your supernatural powers to sneak around and manipulate people instead; if I recall correctly, though, the game is significantly harder if you shun violence.Most stealth games offer pacifist playthroughs, actually, though few specifically reward you for sparing lives. One exception to this is the superb comic adventureUndertale, the game that finally let you talk to the monsters.

Fun. review – Michelle Pfeiffer leads Amazon’s underbaked Christmas turkeyStarry cast, including Felicity Jones and Chloë Grace Moretz, can’t save misfiring cross between Home Alone and The Family StoneBenjamin LeeWed 3 Dec 2025 09.58 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.15 ESTShareIf you’ve already over-indulged in Netflix’s brand of cheap and, overwhelmingly, cheerless Christmas movies this season, then Amazon has something a little meatier to add to your plate. Like Netflix, it also has more than enough tinnily made Hallmark ripoffs (step forward,Tyler Perry’s Finding Joy), but it’s also aiming a little higher with Oh. What. Fun. It’s a more robustly made attempt to recall something we used to see on the big rather than small screen with a cast to match, a starry cross between Home Alone and The Family Stone with an all-new soundtrack from some unusually upper-tier artists.Given the low budget and even lower ambition of the genre, it’s easy to be blinded by the names attached. The film is directed by Michael Showalter, the trusted hand behind films like The Big Sick, Wet Hot American Summer and The Idea of You! It stars Michelle Pfeiffer, Felicity Jones, Jason Schwartzman, Danielle Brooks and Chloë Grace Moretz! There are new songs from Fleet Foxes, Gwen Stefani and Sharon Van Etten, among others! Enough experience might have shown us that even the most talented people do not tend to make the greatest films, but there’s something about the sheer effort being poured into this one that feels notable as others have seemingly given up trying. Could actual fun be on the Christmas cards?Jingle Bell Heist review – Netflix comedy is slight cut above standard festive fillerRead moreWell … no is the short answer. It doesn’t take long to realise that the packaging of Oh. What. Fun. is ultimately less about the creation of an even mildly entertaining festive film and more about the marketing of a soulless Q4 Amazon product. The film, with its easily recognisable cast and easily explainable set-up (what if a family at Christmas), seems to exist mostly to promote the retail side of the business (hard-to-escape ads are already pushing the film alongside adjacent seasonal products). Maybe it will help sell some extra tinsel because it’s otherwise a non-starter as a movie.It’s a shame, as the core idea at its centre is a nifty one. As explained by Pfeiffer’s matriarch Claire, mums get shortchanged at Christmas, both in real life and on film. It’s the aim of both her character and writer Chandler Baker to try to fix this, but the ways they both go about it take a resonant idea and hammer it into mush. Claire is obsessed with daytime TV personality Zazzi Tims (Eva Longoria) and fixated on her annual contest for the best Christmas mum, pleading with her demanding yet ungrateful children (played by Jones, Moretz and The Holdovers breakout Dominic Sessa) to nominate her. When she starts to realise that they haven’t and after they accidentally leave her behind while heading to a Christmas Eve concert she booked tickets for, she decides to make a run for it, heading to a place where she will be treated more like, as a character says later on, “a boss bitch” rather than “everybody’s bitch”.The anger of a mother unfairly undervalued during the holiday season is enough to fuel a violent action thriller, let alone a sparky comedy, but Baker and Showalter, who co-writes, waste it all on an unravelling premise of mounting, and increasingly alienating, silliness. Claire’s feelings of injustice are substantial and relatable enough without her bizarre insistence on winning a TV contest, a strange obsession that quickly turns her into an oddball of the size the film never really wants to reckon with (at one point, someone says, “I can’t decide if she’s an icon or a train wreck,” and, well, neither can the film). There’s a darker, more interestingly deranged story about the realities of whothatcharacter really is but, here, she’s totally out of place in a comedy that tries, and considerably fails, to go for more earnest sentimentality (I was reminded ofa far briefer, and far more successful, SNL sketchthat stars Kristen Wiig as a mother given a discounted robe while her family, including the dog, receive more and more gifts).It also makes it hard for Pfeiffer to really know how to play her, leaving the actor a little lost as she tries to add gravitas to her baffling request (a mother expecting her children to respect and assist her during the busiest time of the year would be more than enough for us to care). Her quest is thin and uninvolving and, unlike, say, Planes, Trains and Automobiles (a film she references early on), devoid of much in the way of humour and conflict. Along the way she meets an underused Brooks, who plays a delivery driver working on Christmas who, get this, loves her job and the opportunities it gives her to travel! (See, Amazon isn’t all that bad after all!) Distractions come in the shape of an Andy Cohen cameo, an obligatory dance-in-a-bar number (like many things in The Family Stone it copies, it is a pale imitation), Jones awkwardly struggling with an American accent and a welcome yet one-note role for Joan Chen.But nothing can distract us from a script that just doesn’t work, family dynamics we don’t believe, jokes we don’t laugh at and characters we don’t care about.

Assume the crash position before watchingLucy ManganWed 3 Dec 2025 07.23 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 12.29 ESTShareIn the top corner of the screen as With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration opens is its age rating: “U – no material likely to offend or harm.” This may be true in the traditional sense. But I would advise any viewers who are British, not in the acting profession and/or not married to the Duchess of Sussex to take as many anti-emetics as medically advisable, then assume the crash position.We open with Meghan literally skipping through aChristmastree farm. “Once a year you get to do the tree thing!” She then decorates it, which she loves because it allows you to “encapsulate your family’s story!”. She likes to position the baubles “so they find their light”. Once she has done that, it’s time to fill a 24-pocketed Advent calendar with – no, not chocolates, you fat English pleb, but “small gestures” and “little findings” for your children. “I’m writing notes that say ‘I love you because you are so kind!’ and ‘I love you because you are so brave!’” Do the children leave notes in return, I wonder? “Should we give up hope of the occasional Freddo here?” “Morning trans fats are the tradition to start, Mother.”“Small moments create the energy you want for the holidays,” and you can achieve them by hand-painting cookies. Many things are “elevated” – gift-wrapping with wax seals foremost among them, though I think attaching them with a hot glue gun is … not? Many more things are “darling” or “absolutely darling”, and this I find difficult.Meghan has the usual array of guests; one who meets her on her own turf, some billed as friends, and a couple of celebrities she has been worshipping since she was born or whatever. I cannot be expected to listen to everything.View image in fullscreenWell played, sir … Will Guidara manages to out-drivel Meghan.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix/PAAnyway. The one to meet her on the same emetic turf is restaurateur Will Guidara. She makes himcacio e pepe gougèresand “reindeer chow” to take home to his wife, who, Meghan informs us, “loves sweet, nostalgic treats”. I hope she likes them when they look like actual animal droppings, because that’s what she’s getting.She and Will make crackers and compete to out-drivel each other. The holidays are all about “connecting”, says Meghan. He sees this and raises her by not remembering what he’s eaten at the best dinner parties but “remembering that I left with my heart feeling full”. A few feeble jabs from Meghan, then he delivers the knockout blow: “What’s really going to attach it,” he says as she sticks one of the damn crackers together, “is the love we feel for the person we’re making it for.” Oh sir. Well played.The friends are Lindsay and Kelly. The three of them have known each other for years. Photographs of them as teenagers and twentysomethings are shown as proof. They eat a cinnamon pastry star, quiche cups and baked pears, drink “bubbles” with pomegranate syrup and make Christmas wreaths. “I’m curious to see how they all look different!” says Meghan, which is such an odd thing to say that I have not stopped thinking about it since.Naomi Osaka, the tennis player and Meghan’s first celebrity, is like a cool plunge bath after an overheated sauna. I’ve never seen anyone more desperate to get home. She spends most of the holidays not relaxing but “chasing after my daughter”. “But that is so soul-filling,” says Meghan, squeezing her eyes shut. Naomi looks at her in polite bemusement. She paints a plate very badly and leaves. I pledge undying allegiance to her.View image in fullscreenI pledge my undying allegiance to her … Naomi Osaka on With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/Netflix/PASecond celebrity up is Top Chef’s top chef Tom Colicchio, but who cares because as he makes his family’s traditional festive beet, olive, fennel, pickles and anchovy salad and salted cod, who should turn up but H! Or, as we used to know him, Prince Harry. Balder than ever but still charmingly at ease and blessedly calm. He hates beets, olives, fennel, pickles, anchovies and fish, which almost makes you proud to be British. So it’s just as well Meghan has made her mum’s chicken gumbo too, although it’s so spicy it makes him sweat. Come home, Harry. Just come home.And that, mercifully, is the end. I feel both offended and harmed, but in the spirit of goodwill I will add a star to my rating in gratitude for the fact that at least we are safe now until next year.

They also want to make sure the amped-up, usually drunk crowd stays hydrated. Without water, a mosher might feel sick, faint or pass out. “You don’t want anyone to get injured or hurt,” frontman Pele Uriel said.Most of the spaces Uriel plays or visits have water stations where customers can easily fill up. But some do not. The worst offenders sell bottles of water at astronomical prices, from $5 to $10. “There have been times when I asked for water, but they charged a lot, so I went to the store next door to buy some,” Uriel said.When things do happen, free water makes it not as bad for that personBrian HackelThese venues are not breaking any rules. The city of New York,hometo more than 25,000 bars, clubs and other nightlife venues, does not require them to supply free water to patrons. While a majority do – and most bartenders are trained to look out for signs of an inebriated customer – this most basic safety precaution is not accepted by all.Brian Hackel, an EMT who works at local festivals and events, often finds himself treating partygoers suffering from heatstroke brought on by high temperatures, close crowds and dehydration. “When things do happen, free water makes it not as bad for that person,” he said. “It absolutely makes a difference between someone getting an Uber and only having to go to urgent care, as opposed to needing an ambulance to a hospital where an IV drip can cost between $700 and 800.”View image in fullscreenPartygoers dance at Paragon in Brooklyn, New York, in the early morning hours of 7 December 2024.Photograph: Marissa Alper/The GuardianIn other locales, partygoers have better luck. In San Francisco, any venue with a dancefloor mustprovide“free, cool drinking water”. The same goes for businesses in Connecticut that serve alcohol. As of this year, Minnesotarequiresticketed events with more than 100 attenders to make free water available and allow guests to bring in their own factory-sealed water bottles. And after years of grumbling from tourists to the longtime party capital of the world, Ibiza, Spain, where somesaidplaces charged €10 for a water bottle, clubs must offer free water on demand.The most Hackel has seen water go for in New York is $12. In November he started apetitiondemanding the city put regulations in place requiring alcohol-serving venues and large gatherings to provide free water stations. More than 500 people have signed on, and Hackel wants to work with harm reduction non-profits, which campaign to minimize the risk that comes with drug use, to spread the word further and hopefully catch the attention of elected officials.Clubbing has changed dramatically in the past 25 years: is the party over, or just getting started?Read moreA long battle was fought in the UK to ensure all establishments selling liquor must provide free, cold tap water to customers. It started in Manchester during the city’s storied rave era, said Fiona Measham, chair of the criminology department at the University of Liverpool and founder of the harm reduction organization the Loop. The legendary nightclub the Hacienda was the center of “Madchester”, a scene known for its club-oriented musical acts such as Happy Mondays and New Order. But in 1989, the party dimmed when a 16-year-old girl collapsed and died in the club. It was the UK’s first widely publicizedecstasy death, and experts wanted to know exactly how it happened.Despite scary headlines and slogans like “one pill can kill,” ecstasy deaths arerare. But John Henry, a London toxicologist, made the connection between MDMA, whichcausesa rise in body temperature, and overheating while partying. Measham’s colleagueRussell Newcombe, a drug researcher, pushed for greater awareness of harm reduction at clubs, which could look as simple as telling revelers to drink water – half a pint an hour isrecommendedwhen taking MDMA – to combat the sweltering effects of drug use (made worse by the physical exertion that comes from dancing all night).In 1994, Newcombe published themanifesto“Safer Dancing”, in which he urged venues to provide “free, cold water … at the very least in the toilets, at best by providing water on the bars”. After that, Measham said it became “good practice” for Manchester clubs to do so, though it was not legally required. Venue owners knew that club kids were unlikely to order alcohol, as it lessens the effect of MDMA. Some started upselling water to take the place of booze sales.“It definitely became a point of contention,” Measham said. She remembers Mixmag, an electronic music magazine, publishing a list of rave clubs with symbols of water taps next to each that had hydration stations. “It was known that you wanted to pick the place with the tap symbol,” she said.Measham and others continued to publish studies and reports on the importance of staying hydrated during a night out. It took more than 15 years for the UK to legally catch up, with a 2010 update to the country’s liquor licensing rules. “I say half-jokingly that getting free drinking water to be a legal obligation in all UK licensed premises is my greatest achievement, and I want it written on my tombstone,” she said.View image in fullscreenAttenders at Bossa Nova Civic Club in Brooklyn, New York.Photograph: Marissa Alper/The GuardianStill, the law is vague, and there are many ways venues can interpret it. Measham points to the London club Fabric, which features an ice water bar, as a good example. “But I can think of other places that only have one [water] bar, as far as possible from where all the action is, and there’s always a massive queue, and they only give you a tiny little cup of it,” she said. “Some festivals in the UK won’t provide tap water at the proper bar that serves alcohol, but they’ll have a standpipe in a field that’s three-quarters of an hour’s walk from where all the entertainment is.”Security staff at concert venues usually have bottled water on hand, in case of health emergencies. In fact, it is not uncommon for artists to stop concerts when they see a fan who needs assistance in the crowd. (Billie Eilishhanded out waterto a Swedish crowd while performing in 2018, after one fan said: “We’re all just passing out.”)Cutting corners with community safety can really kill an event or venueRichard HartnellRichard Gallo, a 31-year-old publicist who lives in New York, goes out often and wonders why it has to get to that point. “If they have cases of water on hand in case anyone’s going to have a reaction, it blows my mind,” he said. “That could be alleviated by having multiple water stations around venues.” Gallo noted that he had seen friends drink straight out of clubs’ bathroom sinks as a (gross) last resort.Harm reduction advocates argue that taking care of patrons is a good investment. People do not want to go somewhere they feel is stingy with water.“In my experience, doing the right thing is profitable, and cutting corners with community safety can really kill an event or venue,” said Richard Hartnell, an organizer and director of outreach for DanceSafe, the non-profit best known for handing out free drug-testing kits at raves and festivals in North America. “If people know that you care, and don’t want anyone to potentially get brain damage from dancing five hours in a sweaty box with no water, then they’ll take your venue over the sketchy one.”‘I get to do whatever I want in the moment’: why more people are going to gigs, festivals and clubs aloneRead morePeter Kerre, a New York DJ and community activist, recalls visiting Brooklyn Mirage, a since-shuttered megaclub popular among fans of electronic dance music. “I would stand by the bar and see people order water, and I remember being baffled by the price,” Kerre said. “It cost almost as much as a beer. I chatted with one of the staff, and they told me: ‘Oh yeah, this is more of a pill crowd,’ [meaning] they could make some money off of selling water.”(The Brooklyn Mirage shuttered after failing to secure properpermitsafter a long renovation. The club did have water refill stations, but those were not by the bar and patrons needed to buy a bottle first. Representatives for Avant Gardner, which operated the venue, did not respond to a request for comment.)If New York does amend its rules about free water, Kerre hopes the regulations are specific enough to prevent venues from easily flaunting them. “Not only should there be stations, but those should be clearly illuminated,” he said. “If there’s an emergency, you want to know where the water is. There are exit signs in case of fire. There should be blue signs for water. Fire codes for the buildings, water codes for the bodies.”Explore more on these topicsClub cultureBars, pubs and clubsClubbingDance musicNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But will it really vanish?Stuart HeritageWed 3 Dec 2025 06.32 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 06.38 ESTShareIf you have noticed a heightened sense of millennial angst in the air recently, it is likely to be because Friends is leavingNetflixthis month. And, reader, the fans have not taken it well.“Absolutely raging,” one viewer tweeted upon hearing the news. “I’m cancelling my Netflix subscription,” raged another. A third, simultaneously managing to capture the mood of the nation while retaining a healthy sense of perspective, wrote: “FUCK OFF FRIENDS IS LEAVING NETFLIX IN THE UK WHAT THE FUCK WILL I DO TO RELAX WTF THIS HAS BEEN THE SHOW TO GET ME TO SLEEP SINCE I WAS A BABY WHAT DO U MEAN ITS COMING OFF NEFLIX IM SORRY BUT NO.”Alas, it is true. On 30 December,Friendswill leave Netflix, where it has been streaming since 2015. Which shouldn’t really be a surprise, because shows have a habit of bouncing around the streaming services. I remember trying to rewatch Mad Men a few years ago, a pursuit which ended up as a game of prestige Whack-a-Mole as it flicked from Sky to Netflix to goodness knows where. It’s just a part of the modern landscape.However, the fact that Friends, of all shows, has been the one to tip people over the edge says a lot about television in 2025. For one thing, Friends is absolutely deathless. The finale aired 21 years ago, and yet despite everything – changing tastes, fresher writing, increased choice – it is still such a go-to that the Independent recently called it “Netflix’s most rewatched series”.View image in fullscreenUproar … Courteney Cox (left) and Jennifer Aniston in Friends.Photograph: NetflixThis, of course, means that it is highly valuable. In 2018, Netflix had to renegotiate to keep Friends in its global lineup, and had to shell out $80m-$100m to do so. This was for a one-year deal. In fairness, this still represented a good deal for all involved; even at the higher end, that sum was less than 1% of Netflix’s revenue in 2018, and Friends ended up becoming themost-watched show on any streaming servicein the UK that year.But now we live in an era of streaming wars, with multiple platforms fighting tooth and claw for every subscriber they can get. And this is why Friends is really leaving Netflix. Friends is a Warner Bros show. Warner Bros is about to launchHBO Max in the UKfor the first time. Arguably no show in existence will be able to pull in subscribers like Friends. It makes perfect business sense, then, for HBO Max to claim Friends as its own.Aside from this, the uproar also provides a little insight into how people actually watch television. You’ll notice that very few fans are upset because Friends is a good show; instead, they’re broken-hearted because their routine has been disrupted. To them, Friends is a comforting piece of background noise they can put on while they do other things. Spend any time on X and you’ll see people talk about watching Friends while they eat, or study, or do jobs around the house. It’s a show people use to manage their ADHD. It’s a sleep aid.And this makes a lot of sense, because one of the most startling things about Friends has always been its efficiency. This wasn’t a show that ever took risks or played with the form. It’s a show where six attractive people machine-gun gags with a very specific cadence for 20-plus minutes. The studio audience laughs. Every few minutes there’s a blast of interstitial music. There’s a pattern to it, a comforting rhythm that you can set your body clock to.But, look, this has happened before. You might remember the days where Friends was an E4 mainstay, with episodes showing more or less around the clock. Friends left E4 in 2011, and there was a similar outcry back then too. “E4 is dead!” people wailed on forums. “Are Channel 4 burning all their bridges?”. In a very 2011 move, there was even an online petition to save it from moving to Comedy Central. “I’m so utterly disgusted, like, majorly,” it said. In an even more 2011 move,the petition received 81 signatures.The point is that everyone survived that. E4 kept going. Friends moved. The fans found it again. Just because it’s leaving Netflix, it doesn’t mean that this is the end of the world. And besides, we live in an age of such aggressive media consolidation that Netflix may well end up owning thestreaming side of Warner Bros, which it submitted a bid for last month; if it succeeds, it will probably own Friends again by Christmas. Maybe don’t cancel that subscription just yet.Explore more on these topicsFriendsTelevisionNetflixTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have to say [there are] issues of life and death explored in this film, because this little boy is going to die on film and you’re going to see him dead in a coffin and you’re going to freak out every child in America!’”View image in fullscreen‘They released thousands of bees on me’ … Macaulay Culkin in My Girl.Photograph: Snap/ShutterstockIn the film, Curtis plays the mortician at the funeral home owned by the family of a young girl played by Anna Chlumsky. She befriends an unpopular bespectacled boy played by Culkin, who was then 10 and already a household name due to the success of Home Alone, which was released the previous year.Culkin’s character has a number of allergies and, shortly after the children share a first kiss, is fatally attacked by a swarm of bees. Last week, the actor revealed that the scene was shot using hundreds of real bees.Speaking on theOn Film … with Kevin McCarthypodcast, Culkin said: “They put this stuff on my fingertips that smells like the queen bee so [the bees] were actually attracted to my hands and I wasn’t a threat.“They actually released thousands of bees on me, imagine that! I’m not joking, those are real bees. That would not fly today.”He added that he was instructed to “wave my hands in front of my face so the bees can get in front of my face and it looks good for the camera”. As soon as they stopped filming, he was advised to “soap my hands in hot water and then dart into the woods.“The bee handler gave me a piece of advice, he said: ‘Human beings run faster than bees fly.’ I was like, ‘but I’m 10. How fast do you think I am?’”The film, which was rated PG, was a huge box office success, making $121m worldwide and spawning a sequel.Goldberg alluded to the trauma inflicted on some of the audience, saying: “That’s not to say they didn’t freak the kids out.” Curtis agreed, adding: “I think today it would have had a warning label.”Explore more on these topicsFilmJamie Lee CurtisMacaulay CulkinMy GirlnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chew Valley Hoard represents a turning point in our nation’s story.View image in fullscreenThe coins were on display at the British Museum.Photograph: British Museum“But as well as evoking the turmoil after the [Norman] conquest, there’s a contemporary significance we’re seeking as well. I think we will ask our visitors to imagine what it must have felt like in 1066 and 1067 when the ruling class had been abolished and there was essentially no government. Obviously, they will draw on their own perspectives and ideas in responding.”The hoard was discovered by seven detectorists south of Bath in 2019. Last year the coins were acquired for the nation and went on display at theBritish Museumin London, where they were seen by thousands of visitors. The hoard is now in storage at the museum.On WednesdaySouth West Heritage Trustannounced a £993,345 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to deliver a two-year engagement project to celebrate the hoard and mark the 1,000th anniversary of William the Conqueror’s birth, in 1028.The coins will be shown at the Roman Baths Museum, Bath, from January to March 2027. They will then be moved to a temporary exhibition space atthe Museum of Somerset in Tauntonwhile a permanent gallery for them is built there. There will be other activities, learning opportunities and events centred on the coins.It is believed the hoard was buried for safekeeping in 1067 or 1068, a time of rebellions in the south-west against William the Conqueror.Represented on just under half the coins is Harold II, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, who was killed at the Battle of Hastings. A little over half feature William the Conqueror. There is one coin that features Edward the Confessor.About 100 moneyers – the individuals in charge of producing coins – from 46 mints including Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Hastings, Ipswich, London and York are represented. The coins of Harold II are mainly from mints in south-east England, perhaps suggesting financial preparation for the Norman invasion.Astill said that while many people had a concept of 1066 and the Battle of Hastings, they know less about what happened afterwards. “There was a long transition to full-blown Norman rule and there and there were periods of turmoil and rebellion particularly here in the south-west.”Exeter, 70 miles south-west of where the hoard was buried, was a centre of resistance to the Normans and was besieged by William in 1068. “It may be that the coins were deposited for safe keeping during that period,” Astill said.Federica Smith-Roberts, a councillor atSomersetcouncil and the executive member for communities, housing and culture, said: “The Chew Valley Hoard is a hugely significant treasure in every sense of the word and we cannot wait to welcome it back home to Somerset.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageArchaeologySomersetBritish MuseumnewsShareReuse this content"

And the Iranian authorities, tensely and hypocritically aware of world scrutiny and indeed the soft-power prestige still to be accrued from Panahi’s eminence, appear (almost) to tolerate it.Now Panahi has come to Cannes with what might be his most emotionally explicit film yet: a film about state violence and revenge, about the pain of tyranny that co-exists with ostensible everyday normality. There are macabre stabs of satire, black comedy and horror-farce, and the movie almost looks like an Iranian dissident tribute to Weekend at Bernie’s or even Hitchcock’s The Trouble With Harry.A man (Ebrahim Azizi) is driving at night with his heavily pregnant wife and young daughter in the car and suffers the time-honoured suspense thriller shock-premise of hitting something in the darkness: a dog. This simple accident causes his car to break down after just five minutes back on the road, and he finds himself pulling over at random at a garage belonging to Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), nicknamed “Jughead” because of his habit of holding his painful kidneys with one hand, his arm like a jug handle.The driver has a disability too, a limp, and Vahid is stunned, scared and angry to realise that he knows this man; and it sets in train a bizarre series of events that reunites a disparate cohort of Vahid’s acquaintances who have all suffered at the hands of the state. These include bookseller Salar, wedding photographer Shiva (Mariam Afshari), the couple whose wedding photos she is taking, bride Goli (Hadis Pakbaten) and groom Ali (Majid Panahi), and local hothead Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr).‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead moreA grotesque, almost dreamlike sequence of scenes takes us to various locations, including a remote desert with a tree that Hamid says looks a stage-set for Waiting for Godot. The plot twists and turns are startling, almost unreal; can it be true that normal people like this can countenance violence? But if that seems implausible, perhaps that is because we don’t grasp the violence through which they have already lived. The narrative jolts and shunts us around like Vahid and his contemporaries in the back of his van; so do the shifts in tone from tragedy to comedy and back. But these storytelling chicanes never quite get us to the shark-jumping point of facetiousness or absurdity that they might in another, Anglo-Hollywood type of movie.There is some acid satire on Iranian officialdom’s addiction to bribes. A hospital nurse asks Vahid if he knows how to give a “present” or just make a scandal – and she wants a box of pastries to go with the money. A couple of shifty, dodgy security guards ask for a “present” in exchange for not making a fuss about the suspicious behaviour in the van, and not having cash doesn’t let Vahid off; these uniformed guys grinningly produce a debit card reader. They take bribes in the form of contactless payments.Perhaps Joe Orton might have enjoyed this tough, cynical movie, especially the group scenes in which Goli has to participate in the mayhem wearing her wedding dress. It’s another very impressive serio-comic film from one of the most distinctive and courageous figures in world cinema.It Was Just an Accident screened at theCannes film festival, and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekJafar PanahiIranFestivalsCannes film festivalDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a leatherwoman, I thought it was absolutely brilliant. I loved the tension, and it’s funny as hell. It’s also incredibly hot.There isn’t a single consent conversation in the film, perhaps because that could be boring. I think it’s perfectly ethical not to include what may have been a lengthy negotiation between Colin and Ray but, on the flipside, sometimes there isn’t a conversation, and people decide to take risks. I’m all for people making their own decisions about taking those risks, as long as they’re able to assess them.View image in fullscreenOn the leash … Melling in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentAs a psychologist, I can see what psychological conflicts they were trying to pull away from. Ray may need to be in control because that’s how he manages emotion. When he loses control, it doesn’t feel safe to him. It’s harder to tell with Colin. He gains the ability to speak more about what he wants, now that he understands what’s being asked of him. It’s important people are made clear that a relationship of this kind can be very healthy.The sex in this movie is so impressive. It looked incredibly real.

Representations of BDSM or fetish are very often reduced on celluloid to thriller and horror-genre psychopathic sadists, or the much-maligned stereotypical gimp in the basement. With Pillion, we observe human emotions and reactions where love and BDSM interact, and which many of us in the kink community can relate to.I see this film as the ultimate homage to the origin story of leather BDSM. Gay leather culture originated in San Francisco in the late 1940s, ostensibly as a response to post-second world war motorcycle clubs, such as the one Marlon Brando belongs to in The Wild One (1953).There are nods to the wider fetish community: latex, rubber, pup and sports gear. There was plenty of diverse fetish representation – steel chain chokers and key holding, indicative of ownership, feature prominently. But oddly, a complete omission of leather BLUF (Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub), the more prevalent iteration of leather in modern-day fetish. Perhaps the producers wanted it to be as representative as possible of fetish, but felt uneasy over the visual aesthetic of some BLUF uniforms, as many in the kink community do?Nonetheless, Pillion is a film overdue about a community well used to stigmatisation from both the mainstream and the LGBTQ+ community.KrugerAfterDark is a fetish community journal on Instagram.‘It nailed that BDSM experimentation isn’t just in the bedroom’Luca, 29, Oxford‘I think my mum’s going to like it’: Alexander Skarsgård on his gay biker ‘dom-com’ PillionRead moreI’ve rarely seen a film so excruciatingly British, with the tiny princess dog along for the date, the Christmas pub singing, and the full-tilt awkwardness. The fumbling but genuine support from Colin’s parents crystallised the complications of trying to overlap two (or more) very different social spheres. The film had fun with the classic quandary of being brattish against control, but also not being prepared to take that control on.View image in fullscreenRay on the date … Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThe most interesting part was Colin and Ray’s experimentation. We get to see Colin take chances to explore something – an act, a date, a lifestyle, a self-description – and not nail it on the first try, yet keep going. I expected that the film might crush their relationship at the first sign of pushback or discontent from Colin, and the fact that they didn’t makes it much more complex. We get to see him walk willingly, if fumblingly, into unknown situations, discover that he does indeed enjoy parts of it, as well as realise that he doesn’t have to keep the parts he doesn’t or can’t work with. He is happy; he could just be a bit happier. Pillionnailed the idea of BDSM/kink being about experimentation and self-exploration, and not just strictly in bed.‘I cried four times’Max Hovey, 26, AshfordView image in fullscreenMax HoveyI was pretty blown away by Pillion. It was great to see something that showcased the less sanitised parts of queer culture. So often, representation is either really traumatic, or this polished romantic fantasy of queerness. To see the grittier, more raw and realistic parts of queer culture, specifically kink culture, was refreshing. There’s a lot that I related to. I think I cried four times.Pillion is a very striking portrait of loneliness, and it highlights how challenging dating can be for queer people. I’m someone who lives in a small town, and dating is very hard. It can feel very lonely, and the film really highlights that.View image in fullscreenLonely at the bottom … Melling in Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentIn terms of Ray and Colin’s sexual dynamic, it felt like a lot of their love story was a metaphor for how we can accept way less than what we want and way less than what we feel we’re owed. Throughout the film, Colin is accepting less than what he wants. He’s yearning for something with more of a connection. You can see in the New Year’s scene, he clearly feels lonely and isolated, so he’s settling for any form of connection, even if it is purely sexual. It’s something a lot of queer people can relate to. When you’re experiencing that loneliness, you do just go along with things to feel any form of connection.Max Hovey is aqueer intimacy educator.‘Heartstopper is sweet but I’ve never seen myself in it. Pillion was different’Talia, 33, OxfordPillion rides off with top prize at British independent film awardsRead moreI remember the first time I attended a kink party. It was euphoric. The rules that chafed me in my day-to-day life were turned on their head. When I left, I literally felt high. I remember the person who had invited me said, “Welcome to the new way of the world.” I carried that other “world” with me for days. I sat there on the tube, looking at people with this feeling that they had no clue what was happening around them. I was the keeper of a magnificent secret, and none of the confines of my old life seemed to have power over me any more. Pillion captured this feeling perfectly. I’m not sure how people will react to Colin’s decision to tolerate (or even revel) in Ray’s treatment of him, but to me, his motivations were crystal clear.View image in fullscreen‘Some of us are perverts, and that’s ok’ … Pillion.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentThe problem with the other world is that you can’t live in it all the time. There is lots of talk and fantasising in the kink community about 24/7 BDSM relationships – and I’m sure some people do engage in them – but at some point, someone has to file the taxes. Pillion isn’t afraid to sit in that uncomfortable juncture where fantasy meets reality.As a lesbian, I think one of my favourite things about Pillion is that it’s a queer film, but everyone in it is a little fucked up. Some of us are perverts, and that’s OK. Shows like Heartstopper are sweet, but I’ve never seen myself in them. I’m human, I’m flawed, and I’ve been in some terrible relationships. While my ex was not a leather daddy – although I did ride pillion on a motorcycle with her once – there were beats in this film that were relatable not because they were kinky, but because they encapsulated that desperate feeling of a toxic first love.‘The kink community has an authenticity absent elsewhere’HommedeCuir,55, ShropshireView image in fullscreenHomme de CuirI take my hat off to [director] Harry [Lighton] for having the balls to make this film. I think it’s funny, really thought-provoking, and it sheds a lot of light on the way relationships in our leather community work. There are so many moments in the film that touched my heart. I see so much of my own mum and dad in Colin’s parents.The kink community, for me, is the one place where you have a collection of people who are all together and showing off all their vulnerabilities. They’re their most authentic selves because you are seeing them as they really want to be seen. Obviously, they’re not going to walk around in it 24 hours a day, though some probably might. But I think it’s very rare that you encounter that level of authenticity and vulnerability in a world that is full of lies and bullshit.View image in fullscreenA real treasure … Pillion.Photograph: Courtesy of Picturehouse EntertainmentAwkward clapping, no-sand beaches and Alexander Skarsgård’s thigh-high boots: a trip to Cannes to see my filmRead moreTo actually immerse yourself in that community is a real treasure. I’ve made some of the most incredibly strong, loyal friendships through the kink community, simply because I know more about that person than some of their best friends or family do. It’s really special to be part of that authenticity, as you don’t see it in many other areas of life. I treasure that.I really do love this film, and I hope it can dispel myths about the community.

Opinions are like arseholes? Arseholes like opinions? Anyway: Quentin Tarantino went on TheBret Easton EllisPodcast this week to announce his 20 favourite films of the 21st century – a list that starts with Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down at No 1 and finishes on Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story at 20, by way of a few surprises (Toy Story 3 in second spot, Midnight in Paris at 10).But the wildest of wild takes was revealed in his No 5 pick,There Will Be Blood, when Tarantino declared Paul Dano was the film’s “giant flaw”.“There Will Be Blood would stand a good chance at being No 1 or 2 if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it … and the flaw isPaul Dano,” Tarantino said, comparing Dano’s performance as twins Paul and Eli Sunday with that of Daniel Day-Lewis as oilman Daniel Plainview. “Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander, but it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He’s a weak sister.”Best films of the noughties No 1: There Will Be Blood | Peter BradshawRead moreThe film-maker shared his ideal casting: Austin Butler, who was 16 when the film was made. “Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role,” Tarantino said. “[Dano] is just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.”Again, opinions, arseholes, etc – but it’s hard not to feel a bit outraged for Dano, who is both astounding and pitiful as Eli Sunday, the sanctimonious young preacher whose barely disguised greed is overshadowed by the rapacious Daniel Plainview. In fact, Dano is outstanding and transformative in pretty much everything he is in – Love and Mercy, Little Miss Sunshine, Prisoners – and is frequently touted as the best actor to have never even got an Oscar nomination. He can do unhinged (The Batman), he can do gentle humanity (The Fabelmans); his distinctive, claylike face has a strange amorphous quality that means he will probably rarely get to play a hero but will land interesting roles for the rest of his life.There is also important background to Dano’s casting in There Will Be Blood: he was originally only set to play the brother Paul, but took over both the twin roles two weeks after filming began when the actor originally cast as Eli, Kel O’Neill, was fired because director Paul Thomas Anderson decided he “wasn’t the right fit”.Dano was also 23 years old, early in his career and suddenly squaring up against an actor widely agreed to be among the best in cinema – a point Ellis made in his defence.“Daniel Day-Lewis also makes it impossible to make it a two-hander because there are aspects of that performance that are so gargantuan,” the American Psycho author said.“So you put him with the weakest male actor in SAG?” Tarantino replied, somehow forgetting he isprobably the weakest male actor in the Screen Actors Guild. When Ellis asked if Tarantino had ever enjoyed Dano in any project, he replied: “I don’t care for him. I don’t care for him, I don’t care for Owen Wilson, and I don’t care for Matthew Lillard.” What does he have against twitchy white guys?“I’m not saying [Dano]’s giving a terrible performance. I’m saying he’s giving a non-entity performance,” Tarantino clarified, which – again opinions, arseholes, but was he watching the same film as the rest of us?Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoPaul DanoThere Will Be BloodBret Easton ElliscommentShareReuse this content"

This documentary watches him at work: dogged, nonconformist and combativePeter BradshawWed 3 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 07.07 ESTShareRenowned investigative journalist Seymour Hersh was never played in a film by Robert Redford or Dustin Hoffman, like the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. But as this documentary portrait argues, he’s probably more important than either. Hersh has a longer record of breaking big stories, from the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to torture by US army personnel at Abu Ghraib prison inIraq– the latter a historic scoop underscored by the stomach-turning photos which Hersh brought to light. Hersh is asked if Abu Ghraib would have been the story it was without those pictures and replies: “No pictures, no story.” Well, maybe. But his other scoops had no pictures of this kind. One incidental thing Abu Ghraib showed was how ubiquitous digital photography became at the beginning of the century; how easy it was to take and share photos. Now, in the new era of AI, photos are ceasing to be the smoking gun of truth.The title of this movie speaks for itself. Hersh is always on the hunt for things that powerful people would prefer to stay hidden – although a paradox of the film is that Hersh has to protect his sources, cover them up as it were. Secrecy plays a part in his own professional life, and when it appears as if film-makersLaura Poitrasand Mark Obenhaus have sensitive names in the notes that he has turned over to them, Hersh becomes agitated and appears ready to back out of the documentary entirely.From My Lai onwards, the authorities’ MO and Hersh’s MO are pretty plain. The government will deny and stonewall, until faced with something flagrant and undeniable, when it will claim that it’s a one-off and a bad apple. But Hersh tends to see that these aren’t single, shocking events; it’s just the only time you’ve become aware of one. With an old-fashioned reporter’s dogged “shoe leather” instincts, Hersh goes to see the people involved, talks to them, spends time on a story, and doesn’t take no for an answer.Reporter: A Memoir by Seymour Hersh – reviewRead moreHersh emerges as a tough, combative, peppery personality from this movie. We only get a taste of the volcanic temper he can deploy when he needs to tongue-lash some cringing editor into giving him the resources he needs. It’s how you have to be. Hersh is pretty candid about his chagrin at missing out on the Watergate story (though he made some of the running later on), and almost being duped by fake letters between John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. He is also very derisive about those centrist pushovers in mainstream journalism who just print the press release and become complicit in abuse – although his attempts to investigate the corporate behemoth Gulf + Western were hampered by the realisation that his corporate employers at theNew York Timeswere themselves not above criticism. Hersh is a true freelancer who is happy enough writing on Substack: an independent and a nonconformist.Cover-Up is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December, and on Netflix from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsInvestigative journalismLaura PoitrasNew York TimesWatergateIraqUS press and publishingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the ultimate film about how the screenwriter is always the loser and the chump. You can tell that Norma Desmond (Swanson) is washed up because she has actually written a screenplay – which is, however, more than Joe (Holden) ever achieves in the course of this film.Sunset Boulevard’s own script, co-written by Wilder with Charles Brackett and DM Marshman Jr, is of course superb. And after 75 years, we can appreciate the movie’s sober judgment about the dangers of cinephilia and Hollywood ancestor worship. The street name itself, with its dying fall, is an occult omen of the eerie and macabre things that happen here. David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive had the same chill. The street name is about the final ending, and this is one of the very few films of any sort with a really satisfying ending: the way in which the delusional old celebrity, her eyes pinwheeling, is finally induced to come placidly down the stairs to surrender to the authorities. She grimaces and gurns directly into the lens at the very last, rather like Anthony Perkins in Psycho – a film that incidentally was very much influenced by this one.Holden, with a rumpled slouch, plays Joe Gillis, a former copy boy on the Dayton Evening Post in his Ohio home town, who has come to Los Angeles to make it in pictures, but none of his scripts are selling any more. Chased by repo men who want his car back, he blows a tyre (an impressive stunt) and pulls in desperately to a creepy old house on Sunset belonging to Norma, who thinks he is the vet undertaker who is going to bury her deceased chimp. A strange musical wailing sound is revealed to be not part of the soundtrack but the wind whistling in the pipes of an organ in one corner of Norma’s dusty, ornate parlour, a clever “diegetic” gag.After clearing up the confusion, and having discovered his profession, Miss Desmond thinks that this smart-alec young fellow could be just the man to polish up her epic handwritten script for a film about Salome, to star herself, and soon the penniless Joe is staying at her house, with clothes and gold cigarette cases and watches bought for him by her as she plots her return (she detests the word “comeback”). But Joe finds himself working on another woman’s script: that of production assistant Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) who has a genuinely good idea. They are falling for each other … to Norma’s very considerable chagrin.Twenty-six years later, in fact, Swanson would marry her final husband in real life: a ghostwriter and former journalist. Her hilarious performance as Norma is crazed, intense but never entirely absurd, and also very sensual and witty. The film is quite clear that she and Joe are having sex, and that the experience is a sentimental education for Joe, who flourishes and matures in spite of himself under Norma’s tutelage.View image in fullscreenHilarious, crazed, intense … Swanson as Desmond, ready for her closeup in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Ronald GrantSwanson, a veteran of the silent era, brilliantly suggests a performer who has learned the extravagant mannerisms of early cinema at an impressionable age and can never unlearn them; the kabuki mask of silent movies has eaten into Norma’s face. Swanson executes the film’s many showstopper lines with absolute aplomb (“I am big; it’s the pictures that got small”; “We didn’t need dialogue, we had faces!”) and also does a very good impression of Charlie Chaplin.Sunset Boulevard is a self-referential film about Hollywood, with as-themselves cameos for Cecil B DeMille, Buster Keaton and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. And this is the heart of its terrible warning. Of course movie professionals should be aware of and inspired by Hollywood’s glorious past – but they must not, like Joe with Norma, be held captive by it. The style and mannerisms of silent cinema were not that way because people wanted them to be quaint and picturesque. Silent movies were thrillingly innovative and new, a staggering leap forward from vaudeville and nickelodeon. Movies were and are pure innovation.Finally, Norma finds herself at Paramount studios under the impression that DeMille actually wants to make this bizarre script of hers, where she irritably brushes away a microphone that strays too close to her face – that irritating talkie gadget. Perhaps the unspoken tragedy of Sunset Boulevard is that no one after this film had the intelligence to use Swanson’s undimmed style and comic flair. She really had transitioned to the talkies but only featured in three more films afterwards. This was her masterpiece.Sunset Boulevard is in UK cinemas from 5 December, and in Australian cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsFilmBilly WilderDrama filmsComedy filmsSilent filmComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A couple of years ago,Midnight Moleburrowed through a Chekhov-inspired cherry orchard. Back in 2019, the irresistibly nutty yet chicSquirrel, which returns toLondon’s Unicornnext month, was sheer perfection. But the Egg’s most enduring Christmas critter is Snow Mouse, the puppet star of a popular early years show. It’s now been multiplied for this new hourlong adventure aimed at slightly older audiences, aged three to nine.After a trio of mice fly in like Mary Poppins, clinging on to brollies with their tails swinging, we meet three children who have reluctantly moved from the city to the countryside. The reason is unspoken – perhaps a divorce, as the eldest child, Megan (Nikki Warwick), speaks of her embarrassment. Her sister Juliette (Linda Scaramella) is a bookworm seeking everyday excitement to rival her novels while the youngest, Timmy (Martin Bonger), is a slightly fragile bundle of excitement.These town mice learn to love their new home thanks to the resident rodents who appear to them in turn and encourage them to find wonder in their surroundings. In doing so, the kids learn to stop griping and work as a team of equals, regardless of their ages. But the show is gratifyingly neither didactic nor schmaltzy – there’s a whisker of danger when Megan goes missing and Juliette relishes the potential tragedy with grotesque glee.View image in fullscreenMystery and mischief … Martin Bonger and Linda Scaramella in Snow Mice!Photograph: Mark DawsonUnder a glacier-like cloud, Zoe Squire’s set features a doll’s house that turns into bunk beds and when snow falls the whole auditorium is transformed into a cosy den.

It’s a great fit for the daredevil mice in dungarees who do a jig when promised cheese on toast and have a habit of disappearing. The theatre is intimate enough for everyone to get a good look at the puppets, made by Marc Parrett based on Edwina Bridgeman’s design, and directed by Chris Pirie.The cast are dab hands at improvising with the audience and also share a realistic sibling dynamic – there’s a clever parallel to the brothers and sisters in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, read by Megan.

This queer drama from debut playwright Jess Edwards (director ofHotterandFitter) spirals a chance encounter into an abusive relationship. Shortlisted for numerous playwriting awards, Private View reaches for a physical manifestation of entanglement theory, where two separate particles become inextricably linked. But there is little romance here. Our unnamed women wind around each other until one of them can no longer breathe, as codependence quickly gives way to coercion.Our entangled pair are Sex Education’s Patricia Allison and The Gold’s Stefanie Martini. From their first meeting of jolting dialogue, Martini’s character – a rich, 39-year-old artist and recovering alcoholic – is intense. Off-puttingly so. Her overly sincere flirtation seems to push Allison’s character – a 23-year-old physics PhD student – away rather than pulling her close. This pattern recurs, with the surprise not in the artist’s descent into needy manipulator, but in the student’s more grounded desire to be with her.Rightly or wrongly, queer women are said to move fast in relationships. This chaotic couple’s romance includes a midnight lab invasion to see Allison’s physicist’s quantum experiment, beautifully realised by Catja Hamilton’s pulsing lights and Josh Anio Grigg’s fizzing sound. But their actions don’t have lasting consequences. This supposedly career-threatening incident quickly falls away, taking the story’s stakes with it.View image in fullscreenPulsing, heady … Patricia Allison (left) and Stefanie Martini in Private View, with lighting from Catja Hamilton.Photograph: Ciara RobinsonThe pair play with their power dynamics in bed (and public toilets), with Annie Kershaw’s direction and Hamilton’s lights creating brief, heady moments of seduction, like the after-image of a photographer’s flash, bodies silhouetted against thick blocks of club-night colour. Here, Allison’s character grows – yet again – wary. She likes being told what to do, but doesn’t want that to extend beyond how they touch each other. For Martini’s artist, the shaky feeling of control becomes her whole world.A stumbling attempt is made at a Stoppardian twirling of love and science, with earnest explanations of scientific theories shoehorned into conversation and laid out as grand metaphors. For London, for love, for the future. But the compression of their separate lives plays out as the pair frantically tell each other they are the same person, rather than making us feel it’s true. Private View is an aesthetically slick exploration of an unhealthy relationship, but it’s hard to really root for – or worry about – a couple you don’t believe in.AtSoho theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

He’s joined by Kiwi tap dancer Bayley Graham of America’s Got Talent, YouTube, Insta etc. One of the songs is the sea shanty that went viral on TikTok. You get the idea. Every number has the forceful energy of a 30-second clip.The setup is vaguely as if we’re all in a bar, dancers chugging shots and having friendly dance-offs, adding a commercial edge to the straight-up Irish step led by Lord of theDancealum Olivia Graydon going hyperspeed. In comes a stranger from out of town, Bayley Graham. A terrific tap dancer, he’s loose and rangy in the body, feet jumping from hot coals, powering out those beats with charisma and megawatt showmanship. (Slight niggle: from some stalls you can’t see the feet because of the footlights.)View image in fullscreenHaving a great time … Hayden Woodcock, Olivia Grainge and Lizzie Pitt in Emerald Storm.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianEmerald Storm is cheesy as a Wicklow cheddar; but it’s not cynical, so it’s hard to be cynical about the performers. There’s a big cast having a great time up there and they really want us to have a great time too. Ball ramps up the hits in the second half with Beyoncé’s Halo in the style of Bublé. Does it get a bit overblown? Sure. But he delivers a tune.The find of the night is Graham, a star on the rise. A telling moment comes during a solo turn, beats building up a head of steam, when he sees someone in the front row filming. While his feet are firing like a funky machine gun, Graham dances over, takes the phone, films himself, shouts “C’mon London!” into the camera and gives it back without dropping a beat. Then he spins, jumps and slams his feet on the stage. Mic drop. More people will probably see that video than ever see him dance live. That’s showbiz circa 2025.AtEmerald theatre, London, until 14 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Why is she so grumpy and where is her Alice band? The Alice (Elian Mai West) before us, in a grey skirt suit, is behaving like a thoroughly boring grownup. Then again, she is no longer in Wonderland: this is postwar Cardiff and she is a single mother facing up to some serious issues: a bombed out home, a husband lost to war and a free-spirited daughter, Carys (Mari Fflur), on the brink of adulthood, who wants to remain a child, and play.All the wonder has left Alice Liddell (who has the full name ofthe child-friend on whom Lewis Carroll may have based his books). She is a town planner for Cardiff council, heading up an unpopular project to turn a street on which children play into a multistorey car park. But the Queen of Hearts, the tyrant ruler of Wonderland, wants a rematch to a croquet game. So the White Rabbit (Keiron Self) skitters into Alice’s life and sweeps her back into a Wonderland populated by characters of the classic tale. All are given new storylines, rather like the errant fairytale cast of Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods.Hannah McPake’s eccentric new Christmas musical conjures Carroll’s kaleidoscope of fantasy, hallucination and dream (with the help of Elin Steele’s skewed set design), adds its own heady mix of children’s games and analogies to power and tyranny, and infuses it all with intelligent humour.There is a five-piece band on the stage with actor-musicians dressed like Wonderlanders. The songs are strong (lyrics by McPake, music by Lucy Rivers) – some are rather too wordy but there are plenty of belters. Red is a catchy power ballad sung by the Red Queen (Caitlin Lavagna). Out of My Box/Life on the Edge, by Humpty Dumpty (Oliver Wood) respun as an Elvis impersonator, is amusing. And there is an infectious number in Guess Who’s Back, sung by Alice, the Unicorn (Emily Ivana Hawkins) and the Hatter (Max James).View image in fullscreenAlice is behaving like a thoroughly boring grownup before she returns to Wonderland.Photograph: Mark DouetCarroll’s Alice stories are arguably coded searches for identity (“Who in the world am I?” says Alice, again and again). This musical incorporates that existentialism, such as in Hatter’s song Who Are You? She discover who she is – or rediscovers it – by the end.Steele’s costumes are wondrous, while her puppets range from sweet to stunning: the dreaded Jabberwock, when it appears, is breathtaking.This is an imaginative and playful way of reworking an old story about the importance of the imagination, and pleasure of play. You don’t stop playing because you grow up, you grow up because you stop playing, Wonderland’s characters tell Alice. It is through play that she learns to cherish her inner child. A lesson for us all.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsSherman theatreLewis CarrollChildren and teenagersChristmas showsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But here is an end-of-year curio: psychological horror game Sleep Awake serves us synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan stepping into what is perhaps the schlockiest role of his life – a gigantic floating head named Hypnos.This late-stage cameo is not quite indicative of the game as a whole; the handful of hours prior to Numan’s arrival are more mournful than madcap. Mostly, you explore the dilapidated, tumbledown streets of what is thought to be the last city on Earth. This setting is a magnificent work of imagination. You see it through the eyes of a young woman named Katja, who moves along rooftops, gazing out upon a barren, lifeless hinterland, into labyrinthine streets whose darkness and arcane logic recall the stirring subterranean etchings of Italian artist Piranesi.How has the planet become so inhospitable, so thoroughly wiped of life? That never really becomes clear. Rather, Katja must wrestle with a more pressing concern: should she fall asleep, our hero risks disappearing into a strange, inaccessible realm caused by a disease referred to as the Hush. Like every other perpetually exhausted person here, Katja plops a few drops of stay-awake serum into her eyes. Suddenly, she sees psychedelic visions and kaleidoscopic refractions of space. Katja seems to be losing the plot; everyone else certainly has. What remains of society has crumbled into the sleep-deprived paranoia of rival gangs.Driven initially by a desire to care for an elderly relative, you direct Katja in first-person through the game’s many grotty, decaying spaces. At one point you’re on the turf of a gas-masked cult, so you try to sneak past them, crouching against walls and under tables to avoid detection. Yet there is hardly any tension: the enemies follow rote patrol paths; their field of vision is preposterously generous. This is a rather dull, easy game of hide and seek.Sleep Awake betrays a further lack of gameplay imagination. You’re called on to short-circuit electricity breakers by rolling carts into them; you have to open doors by finding obviously placed keycards. Slowly, the lustre of the city also begins to dull: it becomes clear you are advancing along a lavishly art-directed tunnel – really, only a lightly interactive and not especially scary fairground ghost train.This is a shame because Sleep Awake is visually daring. The exploratory action is intercut with bleary yet beautiful FMV sequences: the eerie silhouette of trees against a blood-red sky; bubbling liquids shown in extreme closeup. Sometimes these unsettling images are layered over the actual 3D space to gorgeously odd, arthouse effect. This surrealism extends to the death screen: should you get clubbed on the head by one of your dimwitted foes, you must walk out of the dark towards a spectacular light-filled door; as you do, the space mutates in hallucinatory real-time, spitting you out at your last autosave.The death screen is a rare moment when Sleep Awake summons something between dream logic and the strange hazy moments between sleep states that can feel like dreaming. The rest of the time, this narcoleptic nightmare merely wears its psychedelic aesthetics – floating Numan included – without interrogating them interactively. It’s too straightforward, too legible, and not actually illogical enough where it matters.

If this colossus is just the first of a new breed of bulky supertalls, is Britain next?Oliver WainwrightWed 3 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.18 ESTShareAmong the slender needles and elegant spires of the Manhattan skyline, a mountainous lump has reared into view. It galumphs its way up above the others, climbing in bulky steps with the look of several towers strapped together, forming a dark, looming mass. From some angles it forms the silhouette of a hulking bar chart. From others, it glowers like a coffin, ready to swallow the dainty Chrysler building that trembles in its shadow. It is New York’s final boss, a brawny, bronzed behemoth that now lords it over the city with a brutish swagger.Fittingly, this is the new global headquarters of JP Morgan, the world’s biggest bank. The firm enjoys a market capitalisation of $855bn (£645bn), more than Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup’s combined, and it looks as if it might have swallowed all three inside its tinted glass envelope. Last year, for the first time, it made more than $1bn a week in profits. Chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon likes to boast of its “fortress balance sheet”, and he now has an actual fortress to go with it – built at a cost, he revealed at the opening, of around $4bn. He has certainly made his mark. It would be hard to design a more menacing building if you tried.This is a machine to crush the hybrid-working movement once and for allThe Brobdingnagian pile is the work of Foster+Partners, led by the 90-year-old Norman Foster, who is no stranger to penning extravagant bank headquarters. His HSBC tower in Hong Kong was the world’s most expensive building when it opened in 1986, standing as a costly essay in structural redundancy, with a stack of steel suspension bridges bolted to its facade. It wasdescribed by one former partneras “a sledgehammer to crack a nut”. In comparison, the JP Morgan tower is like using a bronze-plated bulldozer to puree a pea.View image in fullscreenExploding … steel columns at street level.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + PartnersThe sheer amount of structural steel – 95,000 tonnes in total – is obscene for a building that contains just 60 storeys in its 423-metre height, half the number of floors you might expect in such a colossus. It uses 60% more steel than the Empire State Building, which is taller and has more square footage. One leading engineer calculated that if the steel was flattened into a belt (30mm wide by 5mm thick), it would wrap the world twice – an apt symbol of the bank’s throttling global domination.If the building is a bullying affront to the skyline, it is just as domineering at street level. It erupts from the sidewalk with gargantuan bunches of steel columns that fan out at each corner, clutching the base of the tower like Nosferatu fingers. Positioned to dodge train tracks below, the columns splay out to hold the building’s swollen mass ominously above new strips of privately owned “public space”, where shallow steps and planters look designed to deter lingering. To the west, on Madison Avenue, the building greets the street with an incongruous cliff face of carved granite boulders. This, it turns out, is an artwork by Maya Lin, who has achieved the impressive feat of making real stone look like fibreglass scenery from Disney’s Frontierland, complete with morsels of mossy garnish clinging to the cracks.On the other side of the block, along Park Avenue, the security guards will let you peer through the windows to admire a US flag hanging from a 12-metre high bronze flagpole at the top of a staircase in the lobby, which, in another surreal twist, flutters in an artificial indoor breeze. It is a rare artwork by Lord Foster himself, who intended the flag’s movement to reflect the wind conditions outside. On the calm, still day of my visit, it was billowing at a stiff clip. In this “city within a city”, JP Morgan gets to dictate the weather it wants.Inside, everything is colossal. Great walls of fluted travertine, sourced from a single quarry in Italy, rise up through the 24-metre-high lobby, flanking a grand travertine staircase framed by a pair of hugeGerhard Richterpaintings. Banks of elevators shuttle the 10,000 workers up into a vertical office-wellness universe, complete with a 19-restaurant food court (with kitchen-to-desk delivery), a hair salon, meditation rooms, fitness centre, medical clinic and a pub. The column-free office floors are fitted with circadian rhythm lighting, creating a carefully calibrated environment, detached from the outside world in the manner of a Las Vegas casino, in the hope that employees might never leave their desks. Dimon is serious about getting everyone back to the office full-time,despite the pleas of his staff. This is his machine to crush the hybrid-working movement once and for all.View image in fullscreenSurreal twist … the lobby flag that blows in an artificial breeze.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + PartnersThe ceiling heights may be lofty (adding many more cubic metres of air to heat and cool), but when an image of the new trading floors was posted on social media,condemnation was swift. Comparisons were made to factory-farmed chickens, Chinese sweatshops, and the very 1950s cellular office space that open-plan layouts are intended to avoid. A conspicuous steel truss zigzagging through the space somewhat undermines the “column-free” claims, and raises questions over the building’s structural logic. One engineer who has studied the plans notes that adding a few more columns and reducing the spans by a couple of metres could have reduced the building’s carbon footprint by 20-30%. But then Foster and Dimon wouldn’t have got the heroic, protein-fuelled steelwork they so desired, slicing its way through the building in monumental Vs.Beyond the structural braggadocio, they were also keen to dial up the theatrics by night. Every evening, for miles around, New Yorkers can now gaze in wonder and horror as the tower’s summit transforms into a glittering crown, bubbling with twinkling lights that rise up the facade like a supersized flute of champagne. It is the work of Leo Villareal, whorecently illuminated the Thames bridges. Sometimes, the throbbing diamond shape adds an inescapable Eye of Sauron vibe. At other moments, it appears to shift into a pulsating yonic void.Vajazzled steeple aside, what makes the tower’s pumped-up extravagance so galling is that it saw a perfectly good office building needlessly bulldozed. The 52-storeyUnion Carbide headquarters, built in 1960 as the celebrated work of Natalie de Blois at SOM, stood as a sleek, Miesian monolith. It had even undergone a full refurbishment and environmental upgrade in 2012 – trumpeted by JP Morganat the timeas “the largest green renovation of a headquarters building in the world”. Just seven years later, at the hands of the same ruthless bank, it became the tallest building ever to be intentionally demolished. To be replaced by something almost twice the height, but with just eight extra floors.View image in fullscreenA touch of Vegas casino … a carefully calibrated environment detaches employees from the outside world.Photograph: Nigel Young/Nigel Young/Foster + Partners.The reason this happened, beyond ego and greed, can be traced to a 2017 zoning change. There had been a growing fear among landlords in East Midtown that the area was losing its lustre as the world’s pre-eminent business address. Office tenants were flocking west, to theglistening new shafts of Hudson Yards, in what is known, in real estate lingo, as the “flight to quality”. The city’s solution, in a shortsighted act of self-sabotage, was to allow Midtown to shape itself after the soulless corporate wasteland of Hudson Yards. Incentives were introduced to encourage demolition, including allowing the sale of unused “air rights” from landmarked buildings within the 78-block area. This means that historical structures that didn’t fill the maximum bulk allowed on their plots could sell their unused potential to others. JP Morganacquired 65,000 square metres of air rightsfrom Grand Central station, and 5,000 square metresfrom St Bartholomew’s church nearby, allowing it to inflate its size far beyond the usual limits.What few might have predicted is the cumulative effect that unleashing this scale of development might have. The JP Morgan tower is not a one-off, but merely the first of a whole new breed of steroidal supertalls. An even bigger 487-metre high, 62-storey tower wasrecently granted permissionat 350 Park Avenue nearby, also designed by Foster+Partners as another bunch of towers strapped together, with the look of a discount bulk-buy. SOM won permission for asimilarly sized monsterat 175 Park Avenue, set to pierce the ground with more fans of columns converging to a point. This part of Midtown will soon resemble a huddle of bloated bankers squeezed into stilettos, casting ever longer shadows down the canyons of Manhattan and obliterating views of the city’s cherished peaks, while crushing a generation of handsome, usable buildings beneath them.For those viewing it from a distance, you may care little about the fate of New York. It is a place long shaped by the forces of unbridled capital, where form follows finance and landowners get to build “as of right”, citizens be damned. But Foster’s bronze goliath is a prelude of what may soon be built in London, on an even bigger scale. Last week, JP Morgan announced that it will begin work ona 280,000 square metre European headquarters in Canary Wharf– by far the biggest office building in the capital, containing more space than the Shard, Gherkin and Walkie-Talkie combined. The design, also by Foster+Partners, has only been teased with a glimpse of a ground-level corner, showing some curved bronze fins wrapping a bulging glass drum. Brace yourselves for what’s out of shot.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureDesignNew YorkNorman FosterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our waiter carefully ladles the sugary, egg-yolk elixir,zabaglione,into two bowls for dunking warmpansaroledoughnuts. Our conversation stops, a silent competition to nab the last one. We are literally livingla dolce vita.This dessert is a tradition in Apricale, a fairytale-like village in Liguria, Italy’s crescent-shaped region that hugs the Mediterranean. It’s a far cry from crowded Cinque Terre and posh Portofino to the east. This western edge, on France’s south-eastern border, feels more authentic and calmer in the winter, with more local people than tourists. Unburdened from competing with others for reservations, you are free to live in the present. Let spontaneity be your guide – or, in my family’s case, our appetites.Map for western Liguria, ItalyI came to Liguria with my twin, her husband, and their 11- and 14-year-old kids, inspired by my sister’s studies in Italy and our shared passion for the country’s comforting, kid-friendly cuisine. Our road trip meandered from the coastal Riviera dei Fiori to a constellation of medieval hilltop villages. In just 30 sq miles, we journeyed back in time.My Sicilian ex had introduced me to Liguria one January. Though it rained, the Maritime and Ligurian Alps block the wind, creating a microclimate with relatively mild temperatures that average 13C. My family’s December trip was bathed in the most sublime winter light, apt for alfresco meals.Heading east from Nice, the motorway is punctuated by a series of hair-raising turns and tunnels. Our first stop was a 45-minute drive away, just over the French border. Ventimiglia is divided into two parts: the bustling new town and the historical upper town,cittàalta, suspended between sea and sky. OnÜ Funtanin’ssun-soaked terrace, we tucked into fried calamari paired with Mediterranean views. The kids made like pirates in front of a statue of the Black Corsair, the star ofEmilio Salgari’s famous swashbuckling novel.View image in fullscreenThe Ponte Vecchio in Dolceacqua, painted by Claude Monet, with Castello dei Doria behind.Photograph: Stevan ZZ/AlamyWe entered the winding maze of the old town via the medieval Porta Nizza arch. Laundry hung from pastel facades, their beautiful patina born from centuries of wear. Two churches on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi have intriguing features: the hyperrealisticCristo Morto(dead Christ) statue at Oratorio dei Neri and the baptistery basin at the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta.Back in the car, we drove 20 minutes north to the riverside village of Dolceacqua. An impromptu search for “hotels with bathtubs” led us toTalking Stones(doubles from €67.50). Set in the 19th-century Borgo district, its cosy stone rooms are juxtaposed by modern whirlpool baths. The medieval Terra quarter sits across the Nervia river via the picturesquePonte Vecchiothat Claude Monet captured in paintings, as witnessed by his wooden cut-out next to the river.On Via Castello, my niece and nephew felt “hugged by the stone buildings” that leaned towards each other. We climbed the narrow Liguriancaruggi(alleyways) to theCastello dei Doria. Named for the prominent family of the 12th-17th centuries, Dolceacqua’s grand dame is now an open-air vestige of soaring arches, a history lesson that is ideal for hide and seek.We entered the winding maze of the old town where laundry hung from pastel facades, their beautiful patina born from centuries of wearBack in town for aperitivo atRe Maggiore, every drink came with a free plate of bites – “How it should be,” said my brother-in-law. Our waiter atLa Pasta di Üassured us: “Everything is amazing. If you don’t like it, I’ll eat it.” We tucked into local specialties,trofie(short, thin, twisted) pasta with pesto, potatoes and green beans, andbarbajuan(chard and ricotta-stuffed fritters). All paired with Rossese di Dolceacqua, an earthy red wine that’s rarely exported due to the steep, terraced vineyard’s small production.The next day, we motored 15 minutes north-east to one of “the most beautiful villages in Italy”, Apricale. The red-roofed village clings to green hills, seemingly defying gravity. Known as an artists’ town, Apricale’s labyrinthine alleys are lined with murals. We got a private showing, with stray cats the only sign of life on the empty streets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The home to the aforementioned egg-yolk dessert serves heartyconiglio(local rabbit) and pork stew with polenta andfarinata(crispy chickpea fritters). En route back to the hotel, we popped into Perinaldo, another picture-postcard village, for a digestivepasseggiata– the traditional Italian leisurely evening stroll.View image in fullscreenA mural in the picturesque streets of artists’ town Apricale.Photograph: Travelbild Italy/AlamyBack on the coast, Sanremo felt like a bustling metropolis compared with the hilltop hamlets. The city of 53,000 became a tourism hotspot in the 19th century, when elite Europeans, particularly Britons, decamped to the Mediterranean for its curative winter climate. Ornate belle epoque hotels, casinos and villas (including the must-seeAlfred Nobel’s former home) are testaments to this era, their faded splendour like a starlet in her twilight years.The city’s Mercato Annonario was laden with gargantuan parmesan wheels, cured meats, and Liguria’s renowned Taggiasca olive oil. After a snack stop atCantine Sanremesiforsardenaira(a tomato, olive and anchovy focaccia) we windowshopped along the main drag, Via Giacomo Matteotti. Later, the Pista Ciclabile, a 15-mile (24km)coastal bike pathon former train tracks, was a highlight. Atop rented ebikes fromNoloBici, we whizzed through tunnels and past the turquoise sea.About 5 miles away in Arma di Taggia, atOsteria 1808we feasted on housemade 30-egg-yolktagliolinipasta, fresh-caught langoustines and fried anchovies, served with professional gusto by the owner, Francesco. He sold us bottles of Taggiasca olive oil to take home. It was the first time the future had crossed our minds. For Liguria is a place to live firmly in the moment.Explore more on these topicsItaly holidaysGenoa holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysCultural tripsRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which will make me feel festive?From a cranberry katsu curry to a dozen thickly glazed doughnuts, the biggest chains are getting Christmassy. I found out which seasonal meals will leave you carolling and carousing – and which will leave you coldZoe WilliamsWed 3 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 11.13 ESTShareBy now, most major fast food outlets will have launched their festive special. There is no established framework for what “festive” means, and no recognised metrics of Christmassyness. It could be indicated by a lurid green/angry red colour in a place you’re not expecting it (McDonald’s Grumble Pie, I’m looking at you); or an existing thing, made into a more seasonal shape, or the introduction of a quintessentialChristmasingredient, such as a brussels sprout (though seriously, food giants, get over yourself if you think it’s cinnamon – this is an autumn spice).I am not here to critique the essentials of fast food (I love it). If you want someone who will come over like the critic inRatatouille, you’re just going to have to go and rewatch Ratatouille. I am merely here to eat six festive specials, and ask myself: do I feel Christmassy, punk?The Chicken Cranberry Katsu, Wagamama, £15.30View image in fullscreen‘Impressive’ … Wagamama chicken cranberry katsu curry.Photograph: WagamamaWe all know what a katsu curry looks like, right? A mound of rice; simple, breaded fried chicken sliced along each side; with a sweet thick sauce of miso, soy, ginger, honey and other stuff over the whole lot, to create a plate that is defiantly beige and homogenous, a gauntlet to all norms of food presentation. The sheer audacity of tweaking that for Christmas effect, plus the simplicity of the fix – exactly the same curry, with cranberries – were both impressive. My son ate a regular katsu as a control, because he’s a good boy. He said the limited edition was exactly right: they’re trying to convey Christmas spirit, not recreate Christmas dinner. The difference was subtle, unless you don’t like cranberries, in which case it’s like a siren. I do like cranberries. It was fractionally more calorific than the regular version, whereas technically, in order to be festive, a dish has to be 10 times more energy dense, and only 30p more expensive. So you might knock a couple of points off for that, but then give them back, because the first oath of festive variation is “do no harm”.Festive rating: 4/5The Festive Bake, Greggs, £2.10View image in fullscreen‘A bit grey’ … Greggs’ Festive BakePhotograph: GreggsOne time my dog found a pristine sausage roll on the pavement, and now every time he sees a Greggs’ bag he gets wildly excited, which I used to laugh at, the eternity of his springing hope, until I realised that I am the same, and ever since the steak bake, I can’t see a lattice pastry pattern without thinking, mmm, I’ll try that. The festive bake is a version of the chicken bake, and, praise be, refrains from substituting in turkey, which unlike every other meat tastes more like itself when it’s mass produced, becoming weirdly disgusting in the process. There are a load of adds: a herb dusting over the top, sage and onion stuffing, bacon, then more sage and cranberry in the white sauce, which sends it a bit grey, but I don’t mind that as much as you’d think. With my back against the wall, I’d say bacon is only Christmassy when proximal to sausage, which would also make the stuffing taste more like stuffing. There’s also no getting around the fact that the steak original is richer and more luxurious.Festive rating: 3/5Double Big Tasty meal, £9.49, Grumble Pie, £2.39, both McDonald’sView image in fullscreen‘Hard recommend’ … McDonald’s Grumble Pie.Photograph: McDonald’sGuys, the Double Big Tasty meal is a Big Mac! OK, it has a smoky sauce. But it’s a Big Mac! The brass neck of you, McDonald’s. Grumble pie, meanwhile, is green enough that there will be kids who think it’s made of spinach, so good luck with that. This is very close to the classic apple pie format, which is mysteriously good: somehow the gluey, atomically hot fruit never penetrates the crunchy pastry, to create an utterly reliable contrasting mouthfeel, which delights every sense except the ones that are on fire. So now just imagine that with cranberries and custard. And wait for it to cool down a bit, idiot. It does really throw itself into the season with those cranberries, while remaining as delicious as the original apple version. Hard recommend. Would eat again.Festive rating: The Double Big Tasty is delicious, but 1/5 for Christmas spirit. The Grumble Pie is much better, 4/5Stuffing Tower Burger Meal, KFC, £9.49View image in fullscreen‘Excellent’ … KFC’s Stuffing Tower Burger.Photograph: KFCOK, I’m gonna lay this out: the word “stuffing” is not festive of itself, and the flavours sage and onion are in no way automatically reminiscent of Christmas, instead conjuring school dinners and institutions and the depressing feminist 30s novels set in coastal towns. If you want to yell Yule, have you considered a chestnut? I know they’re a bugger to peel, but you’re the Colonel, I believe in you. Having said all that, if you remove the stuffing, this leaves you with a classic tower burger with a cranberry twist, and to refer you back to the Wagamama katsu, that’s exactly where you want to be: in the spirit. An excellent burger. They also do a festive bucket, in which the chief festivity is that it’s massive. Full marks.Festive rating: 3.5/5The Total Sleigh Burger, Nando’s, £10.95View image in fullscreen‘Vandalised by two bubble and squeak croquettes’ … Nando’s Total Sleigh Burger.Photograph: Nando’sIt’s very hard to figure out what went on in this development kitchen, unless there were two separate departments, one to do the burger, the other to do the seasonal wordplay – and hats off, you guys, this is fun to say out loud while punching the air. But that’s where Christmas ends. Maybe it’s unfair to single out Nando’s, as you could say the same for almost everyone, but chicken joints are pretty much anti-Christmas. Any other non-turkey joint, you could say, “Oh, we’re doing beef this year,” and people would reply, “How interesting and unusual,” but if you said “We’re doing a chicken,” it would sound as though you’d forgotten until half an hour ago that Jesus was born at all. What would taste like a perfectly serviceable burger with a really nice hot churrasco mayonnaise is vandalised by two bubble and squeak croquettes, in which the sage is overpronounced and the symbolism completely opaque. At a pinch, you could say it had a Boxing Day theme, but realistically, when did you ever associate bubble and squeak with anything, except your dad when he had a hangover?Festive rating: 1/5Festive Dozen, Krispy Kreme, £21.99View image in fullscreen‘Early caveman wreath’ … Krispy Kreme Christmas doughnuts.Photograph: Krispy KremeKrispy Kreme spoils us with their seasonal commitment, since they also launched Quality Street spin-offs last month, in which the caramel swirl was so sweet it made your ears ring (a real thing that happens) and the purple one was actually pretty successful. This festive dozen is more generic Christmas signifiers: a snowman, a Santa tummy, a Christmas tree in which the trunk is a tiny Flake, a classic ring doughnut with a chocolate topping that I guess is some early caveman wreath. You cannot critique them at the level of the filling, since indeterminate buttercream and cream cheese are evergreen. You really have to just look at them as an ensemble and, yup, that’s Christmas alright.Festive rating: 5/5Explore more on these topicsFast foodTaste testChristmasFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This make-ahead semifreddo, jewelled with dried fruits, might just fit the bill …Tom HuntWed 3 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 3 Dec 2025 08.02 ESTShareLastChristmaswe visited my in-laws in Cape Town, where, at over 30C, a traditional Christmas pudding just didn’t feel quite right. But my mother-in-law and her friend created the most delicious feast: a South Africanbraai(barbecue) followed by an incredible ice-cream Christmas pudding made by mashing vanilla ice-cream with a mix of tutti frutti, candied peel, raisins and cherries. This semifreddo is a take on that dessert: a light frozen custard that still carries all the festive flavours.Tutti frutti semifreddo Christmas puddingWe stopped using clingfilm in our kitchen 15 years ago now, because it’s not easily recycled and because of health concerns about the possible transfer ofmicroplastics into our food. Most semifreddo recipes tell you to line the freezer container with clingfilm, but I suggest using no liner at all, or silicone-free, unbleached baking paper instead.If, like me, you don’t love traditional Christmas pudding, then this ice-cream alternative might be just the ticket. It’s easy to make in advance, a little decadent and delivers festive cheer.Anna Jonesis one of the best food writers of our generation – her recipes are wholesome, adventurous and always easy to cook – and this recipe is adapted fromher original, but tweaked to incorporate the flavours of Christmas pudding. I like how she skips the usual ribboning process, when you’d normally whisk the yolks and sugar over a bain-marie, simply by adding creme fraiche or mascarpone. I’ve slightly increased the amount of creme fraiche to use up a whole pot and made the ingredients flexible, so you can use up whatever nuts, candied peel or spices you have in your cupboard.Serves8200g mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit(eg, glacé cherries, raisins or chopped apricots); even a few crushed biscuits are tastyFinely grated zest and juice of ¼ lemon or orange2 tbsp brandy, whisky, rum or marsala1 tsp ground mixed spices(eg, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom or allspice)3 large eggs, separated120g icing sugar300ml double cream200g creme fraiche, or 200ml extra double cream100g mixed nuts(eg, almonds, pistachios or hazelnuts), roughly chopped, plus extra to finish50g dark chocolate, finely chopped (optional), plus extra to finishLine a large pudding basin or loaf tin with baking paper. In a small bowl, macerate the mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit with the citrus zest and juice, the alcohol and your chosen spices.Separate the eggs into two clean bowls. Whisk the whites until firm. To the yolks, add the icing sugar, whisk until thick and pale, then beat in the macerated fruit.In another bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks, then whisk in the creme fraiche (or more double cream) until just combined. Gently fold this through the egg yolk mixture, then gently fold in the egg whites – use a large metal spoon to keep the mix airy. Finally, stir in the roughly chopped mixed nuts and finely chopped dark chocolate, if using.Spoon into the lined basin, cover with a plate or baking paper, and freeze for at least six hours or overnight. For the best results, move the semifreddo to the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to serve. Turn out on to a plate, top with extra nuts and grated chocolate, then slice and serve.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWaste notFoodFood wasteChristmasIce-cream and sorbetFruitNuts and seedsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Agenerous ham on the table makes myChristmasevery year. Whether you prefer green or smoked, free-range or organic, the humble ham is a cornerstone of the festive feast. If you can, go as large as possible, because bigger joints roll and tie more easily, and have a more even layer of fat that results in a better, more generous ham. And, of course, those Boxing Day leftovers are pure joy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A good layer of fat matters, because it adds flavour and, when glazed, a delicious, gelatinous crust – in fact, that’s my favourite bit. Smooth, tender, brine-cured hams are perfect for cold cuts sliced like classic supermarket-style ham. Coarser, organic, nitrite- and nitrate-free joints are ideal for slow roasting, which gives them a much deeper, richer flavour. Nitrates and nitrites have been used for centuries to preserve meat, and help create that familiar blushed pink colour and recognisable flavour, but we’ve becomemore aware of the health risks they pose in the past decade or so. If you’re trying to avoid these additives, there are nitrate- and nitrite-free hams out there that are delicious, albeit darker and coarser.Animal welfare matters, too, of course. Free-range and organic gammon is frustratingly hard to find in supermarkets, and even from independent butchers, it seems – I’ve been told by organic butcheries that there is a shortage of organic pork. So for this taste test, I’ve broken the mould and done my shopping online, seeking out butchers with high welfare standards and nationwide delivery. Many have minimum orders and limited delivery days, so if you fancy going down this route, make sure you order early; many offer sign-up incentives such as free delivery or 10% off, making this a smart way to secure top-quality, high-welfare meat for Christmas. Your local butcher is also one of the best options. Just remember to order in advance – Christmas is just around the corner!Look for organic, free-range or outdoor-reared pigs that have had access to the outdoors for their whole lives, and check outFarms Not Factories’ label guide to help demystify welfare standards. Farmers who breed pigs outdoors often choose heritage breeds such as gloucestershire old spots or large blacks, because they’re better suited to outdoor living. By choosing hams fromheritage breedsraised outdoors, you’re not only supporting traditional farming methods but also contributing to the preservation of biodiversity and more sustainable agriculture.For this tasting, I brought each gammon to a boil, replenished the water, then simmered based on weight: 30 minutes per 500g, plus 30 minutes extra. I didn’t glaze the hams, because I wanted a clear taste of the meat, and the tasting was done warm and cold so as to fully appreciate texture and flavour.

I do enjoyangels and devils on horseback,devilled eggs, little sausages wrapped in bacon, mince tarts crowned with goose liver, fried breads and cheesy pizzette, buffalo wings, paté en croute, crab beignets, oysters Rockefeller, shrimp tostadas and richtamales, but, for the most part, I save these for the parties earlier in December. For Christmas day itself, I start with lighter bites, as better preparation for the rich meal ahead. A trio of dainty, grazing canapes served alongside sparklingAlta Langa…Chilled prawns with brandy mayonnaiseMy grandmother, Ginny, knew how to entertain. She would spike her mayonnaise with brandy, and so do I – at home and at my restaurantPlaquemine Lock. Ginny used to boil her own shrimp, but the shell-on cooked frozen Atlantic prawns we have (the ones that come by the pint in the pub) are excellent, too.Prep10 minCook10 min, plus coolingServes5 as a starter, 10 as a canape1kg sustainably-sourced cooked frozen shell-on prawns, or cooked Atlantic, raw vannamei or other tiger/king prawns150g mayonnaise(homemade or shop-bought)1-2tbsp brandyA couple of gratings of lemon zest(optional)For the court-bouillon (if cooking the prawns from scratch)3 celery sticks, trimmed and cut into chunks1 large orange or lemon, skin on, cut into chunks1 head fennel, trimmed and cut into chunks1 small onion, peeled and halved300ml white wine3 litres water60g saltDefrost the prawns.

At that restaurant, and many others in the region, they specialise in 40-yolktajarin(tagliolini), for which a kilo of flour is mixed withthose yolks for the dough. This makes very rich pasta (particularly good with white truffles) – and a lot of leftover egg whites. Therefore, the thin, delicate and ethereal onion frittata they serve as an appetiser is made predominantly with egg whites, and a very different beast from the rich, thick omelettes I had known until this point – in fact, not a beast at all, but dainty, homely and elegant all in one go.Prep10 minCook25 minServes2 as a starter,or6 to nibble on2 medium artichokes, cleaned, trimmed, tough leaves pared, chokes removed, or ½ small head of radicchio, or 2 celery sticks4 egg whites2 whole eggs20g gratedparmesan35g butterSalt and black pepper1tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, or any vegetable oilSlice the artichoke or radicchio extremely thinly lengthways (about 1-2mm thick); if you’re using celery, slice it across or on the bias. In a bowl, beat the egg whites, whole eggs and parmesan with a fork until completely smooth.Melt 25g butter in a 28cm nonstick frying pan on a medium heat until it starts to foam, then add the vegetables and season – enough also for the egg that is to follow. Saute for three minutes, until tender but with a little bite, then add the beaten egg mixture, distributing it evenly; use the back of a spoon to fill in any gaps. Fry for four minutes, or until the egg is almost set.Grease a plate with the oil and turn out the omelette on to it. Add the last 10g butter to the frying pan and, when it foams, slide the omelette back in and fry for two to three minutes more, until delicately coloured. Turn out on to a clean plate and serve after it has cooled to room temperature.Jacob Kenedy is chef-patron of Bocca di Lupo restaurant in London.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkSnacksFoodStarterChristmasSeafoodShellfishrecipesShareReuse this content"
