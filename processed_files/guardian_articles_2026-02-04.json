Mirrors distort. Perspectives shift. And nothing is quite what it seems. It is an apposite metaphor for theseWinter Olympics, which officially open in Italy on Friday.Over the following 16 days, the world will be enraptured by the dazzle and spin of these Games: downhill skiers bombing down mountains at 95mph, snowboarders twirling like gyroscopes, the balletic grace of the world’s best skaters. But in Milano Cortina a fresh cold war is also brewing amid global political chaos.The Joy of Six: unlikely Winter Olympics starsRead moreThis week the IOC president, Kirsty Coventry,called for sport “to be a neutral ground”, separate from politics and the actions of governments. It was a worthy sentiment. But she might as well have been singing kumbaya in a warzone.While Coventry was speaking, US Olympic officials changed the name of an athlete hospitality space in Milan from “Ice House” to “Winter House”, following protests over the fatal shootings by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.It was a move welcomed by the American figure skater Amber Glenn, who told reporters: “It’s unfortunate that the term ‘ice’ isn’t something we can embrace because of what is happening, and the implications of what some people are doing.”Less than 24 hours later, Italy’s foreign minister revealed that the country had thwarted a series of cyberattacks “of Russian origin” targeting websites linked to the Winter Olympics.That revelation was even more noteworthy for another reason. Because over the past few days there has been strong momentum in Milan for Russian teams, who are banned because of the war on Ukraine, to be allowed back into the sporting fold.And while there are just 13 Russian competitors at these Games – under the banner of Authorised Neutral Athletes – there is hope in Moscow that the country’s new stars, such as the 18-year-old Russian skating champion Adelia Petrosian, can make their mark.As Irina Rodnina, a state Duma deputy and three-time Olympic champion, put it: “It’s already encouraging that Russian athletes will be competing at these Olympics. Literally the entire country will be rooting for them and cheering for them.”However it has also raised eyebrows here that Petrosian is being coached in Milan by the controversial Georgian, Eteri Tutberidze, who was condemned by the IOC four years ago for her “tremendous coldness” after she was seen screaming at the then 15-year-old skater Kamila Valieva.View image in fullscreenThe presence of Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag has angered Ukrainian competitors.Photograph: John Locher/APValieva, who was under pressure havingtested positive for a banned drug, fell twice in her routine, leaving the then IOC president Thomas Bach to describe Tutberidze’s behaviour as “chilling”. Expect there to be more questions about why the Georgian is here in the days ahead.Meanwhile on the Ukrainian side, there is ongoing outrage that the Russians are here at all. And they are expressed most eloquently by the skeleton star Vladyslav Heraskevych, who made global headlines in Beijing when he held up a sign saying “No War In Ukraine”.“There is war fatigue, which makes people start to forget that Russia is a terrorist state,” he told the Guardian. “We see them more often in sports arenas. We see them more in the cinema. Everywhere in the world. But Ukrainians are getting bombed every day. We are sitting in houses without water, without heating, and it’s minus 20 degrees outside.”Heraskevych is back competing again in Italy. However, he says he has been warned by the IOC not to protest. “I don’t want to really jump into the details but I was contacted after our junior team protested at the Europa Cup,” he says. “It was the first competition where neutral athletes in our sport were allowed to compete. And so our team, together with Latvia and Sweden, made a protest.“After that, the Ukrainian side was contacted by the IOC, and we were warned. They also mentioned protesting at the Olympics. There were some warnings. And a pretty serious one.”There are plenty more potential flashpoints that lie ahead. On Thursday, for instance, pro-Palestinian activists are planning a demonstration when the Olympic flame arrives in Milan to protest against Israel’s participation in the Games. While later in the week, environmental groups also intend to march.On Wednesday evening the IOC also had to fend off questions about the head of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, Casey Wasserman, who is in the Epstein files, as well as the election of the first Iranian women, Soraya Aghaei, to the IOC just weeks after protests in the country were violently put down.On Valentine’s Day, Denmark will face USA at ice hockey – a match that has significantly more riding on it after the US president, Donald Trump, started making ominous threats against Greenland.View image in fullscreenThe streets of Milan are prepared for a global celebration of winter sports.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA recent poll found that only 17% of Danes see the US as an ally – while 60% of them see them as an adversary. That is not an outlier, and on Wednesday, the IOC president was asked if she expected the USA team to be booed at the opening ceremony.“I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as an opportunity to be respectful towards each other,” she said. “I hope for everyone watching I hope it will be a really good showcase of possibilities and inspiration – and a nice reminder of how we could act towards each other, and how we can do that respectfully. I think that is what the Olympic Games represent.”The ceremony on Friday at San Siro will feature stars such as Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli and Snoop Dogg – while, according to Marco Balich, the creative lead, it will feature harmony as its core message. It was a theme that Coventry picked up when asked if she had a message for those planning to protest in the coming days.“The Games are a place where people can be reminded of the best of humanity,” she insisted. “And I hope that more and more people will feel that magic as we head towards the opening ceremony.”Although given everything that is bubbling away here in Milan, that may prove to be a forlorn hope.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even though many Americans have an obsession with the minutiae of the monarchy and all its works – despite proudly revolting against the institution themselves 250 years ago – their concerns have understandably focused more on their own big beasts, Donald Trump and the Clintons, than ours. It’s as if King Charles and his brother, the artist now known asAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, are some quaint curlicue, a baroque adornment to the main event. Which, of course, is how they see the British monarchy anyway.Kings and queens have always been susceptible to men with money and power. In the past they were able to bestow both on their loyal followers. Now it is more transactional. It is evident that what appealed to Epstein was access to class and status: the chance to sit jokily on the throne in Buckingham Palace or have a weekend in Balmoral or Sandringham and thereby tie a susceptible royal into his web of contacts and obligations. What appealed to Andrew and his importunate and permanently hard-up former wife, Sarah, was access to cash and the luxuries that went with it. Hard to believe given the royal family’s wealth, but what probably appealed most was cosying up to the sort of money that has brownstone mansions in Manhattan to stay in and private islands for holidays in the Caribbean.There is no evidence that King Charles or his heir knew of, or even met, the egregious Epstein but, more than six years after the American’s death, he still sticks to and smears the institution. The king may have gone as far as he can in distancing the family from his brother, removing his titles,kicking him out of his grace-and-favour homein Windsor Great Park and moving him to the agreeable wilds of Norfolk, but the malady lingers on. Humiliation isn’t enough – what kills the monarchy is entitlement. The entertaining royal soap opera has reached a bitter stage.Will we see Mountbatten-Windsor testifying in court, oreven to Congress? Despite years ago professing a wish to be helpful to the inquiry in Washington, he has shown absolutely no sign of being willing to do so, even by video link, and it is hard to know how he can be made to comply as a foreign national. Judging byhis interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019, he would make an unimpressive witness and perhaps that has finally been brought home to him, but his continuing absence and refusal to testify say nothing for the honour he was so proud to claim to the BBC. Perhaps our abiding image of him will be from that photograph released late last week of a glistening (so he does sweat), startled, plump middle-aged man looming over the body of a recumbent woman at some shadowy party somewhere, sometime.But even without Andrew – who of course denies all wrongdoing and doesn’t even properly express contrition or disgust at his former friend’s apparent industrial-scale sex trafficking of underage girls – the royal family is in a mess.The king, in his late 70s, is hobbled by his cancer diagnosis and ongoing treatment, realising that his reign may be short. Meanwhile,Prince Williamis not on speaking terms with his younger brother, with little sign of reconciliation – if that is even possible after all the disobliging things Harry said about his relatives in his book and intermittent interviews. It’s hard to remember now, but a decade ago the brothers, riding a tide of goodwill, were the bright hope of the institution: the pair who would take over the bulk of royal duties from their granny and their ageing relatives and conduct the endless round of visits and events that are meant to maintain the royals’ visibility and public popularity. The longevity that used to be part of the institution’s strength is on the wane and it will be at least 15 years before the next generation of royals – George, Charlotte and Louis – can step up. That’s even if they want to do so.Some of the sins of the current institution lie with the late queen, who followed her parents in comfortable complacency. It was not her fault that she lived too long, but it was that she did not rein in the excesses of her second son, who had been known to be a liability for at least 20 years. The monarchy must change now, radically. But will it? To do so would go against its nature.Stephen Bates is a former royal correspondent of the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their feelgood Greek Job is like a holiday with your two most outrageous matesMichael HoganWed 4 Feb 2026 10.41 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 10.43 ESTShareIt might have aired on 5 January but it was instantly hailed as a contender for TV moment of the year. Egged on by his palAmanda Holden, the reluctant Alan Carr braved a huge slide at a water park in Corfu called the Black Hole. “It’s pitch black,” warned Holden. “You won’t see a thing.” “Sounds awful,” said the nervous comedian, asking the lifeguard to “Pray for me.”He proceeded to fall out of his rubber ring and scream all the way down a long, dark tunnel before hurtling head first into the pool. Holden just about recovered from her hysterical mirth to wrap the traumatised Carr in a towel, noting that he looked like “ET on the bike”. Welcome to Amanda & Alan’s Greek Job – the most feelgood guilty pleasure on air.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

You might well think there is already enough of both genres clogging up the schedules. You would be correct – but this total riot of a show proves an exception. The pitch might sound suspiciously like daytime ITV trash, rather than primetime BBC fodder, but it’s elevated by the high-wattage charisma of its stars and their downright adorable friendship.The ultimate hun and the chatty man have been close friends for 20 years and have chemistry to burn. They get stuck into the ouzo. They visit a spa together and get told off for laughing too much in the Jacuzzi. Holden shamelessly attempts to matchmake Carr with every eligible male they meet. In her quest to land him “a Greek god”, she signs Carr up for a gay dating app and has to guess some crucial measurements. “This is an eye-opener!” she gasps delightedly. “They’re very detailed on these apps.”They wear matching Elvis-style white jumpsuits, for reasons never made entirely clear. Holden’s role is the glamourpuss with designer tastes and an exacting moodboard. Carr plays the hapless sidekick who doesn’t quite understand her vision but is happy to give it a go, provided he can roll his eyes to camera a lot.Riding high after his triumphant stint in The Celebrity Traitors, Carr is one of the most infectiously funny presences on TV. He is professionally hilarious but the under-appreciated Holden is a hoot, too: a force of nature who is enjoyably sweary and self-deprecating with a scene-stealing filthy laugh.The eight-parter isn’t just a source of interiors and holiday inspo. It’s a proper grower. You might begrudgingly catch an episode while waiting for something else to start on BBC One. Before you know it, you’re hooked. The sea, sun and lush landscapes are built in a lab for banishing the winter blues. With episodes clocking in at a snackable 28 minutes, it’s fiendishly watchable in a wallpaper way.This is actually the A-team’s fourth Mediterranean DIY series together. The mini-franchise began with Amanda & Alan’s Italian Job, which saw them snap up two run-down apartments in rural Sicily for one euro apiece and spend the summer renovating them. A second season took them across to the mainland, where they spruced up a 17th-century house in Tuscany.Like a lifestyle version ofThe Trip, the format has since been rolled out to different destinations. In Amanda and Alan’s Spanish Job they worked their chaotic magic on a crumblingcasain Andalucía. They returned there for a Christmas special, complete with lethal sherry trifle and skinny-dipping in Santa hats.Feliz Navidadindeed.Now they’re on the idyllic Ionian island of Corfu for “a big fat Greek renovation”. In the hillside village of Kokkini (NB: plenty of innuendo potential), they tackle their most run-down property yet. When they first visit the derelict wreck, they’re horrified to find mushrooms growing on the ceiling and a human turd on the floor. Room by room, they set about transforming this money pit into a high-spec family holiday home.Having bought it for £30,000, they end up putting it on the market for £585,000. Don’t worry. They’re not flipping houses to line their own jumpsuit pockets. All profits go to Comic Relief and Children in Need. The show has a pleasing side-effect of boosting tourism in the areas visited too.After mucking in with the construction work during the day, they meet locals and explore Corfu’s culture by night. In one standout sequence, Alan is taught to cook traditional dishes by a Greek grandmother, oryiayia, who has absolutely no time for his nonsense. Inspired by the author and conservationistGerald Durrell’s Corfu Trilogy, they volunteer at an animal sanctuary. As Alan bonds with rescue donkeys, Amanda feeds the street cats and ends up agreeing to take two of them home to the UK.Amid the jolly jaunts and sunkissed japes, they share surprisingly intimate moments. Over Aperol spritz sundowners and a bowl of “Greek Quavers”, they have poignant heart-to-hearts about ageing, Alan’s divorce and Amanda’s stillborn son. They also rip the piss out of each other in the sort of amusingly brutal ways only proper best friends can. When Alan points out that Amanda’s breasts have mysteriously grown since the previous series, she laughs along gamely, pretending that she hasn’t been under the knife and it’s simply down to eating more saganaki cheese.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

You’ll wonder why you’re watching something your mum probably dismisses as too downmarket. Complete with Demis Roussos soundtrack, it’s like a midlife gap year with Shirley Valentine vibes – an immersive Mamma Mia! cinema experience without leaving your sofa.Carr is set to capitalise on this success – and his Ardross-based Traitors win – with a stately home version. The upcoming Disney+ series Castle Man will document his search for his dream historic home as he approaches his 50th birthday. “Some men buy a Lamborghini or grow a ponytail when they have amidlife crisis,” he says. “Not me. All I want is a turret to call my own. Get me over that drawbridge!” In an unexpected career pivot, he is becoming a sort of camp Kevin McCloud. Or Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen with more rosé and fewer flouncy sleeves.In the meantime, there’s Greek Job, which climaxes with a double bill on Friday. Holden finally gets the circular bath she has been wanging on about all series, while Alan flirts with a builder actually called Adonis. The pair throw a farewell party for local people and end up boozily dancing around their olive tree. Watching this shiny, happy show is like going on holiday with your two most outrageous mates.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When our bodies crave something nourishing, few things fit the bill better than a bowl of thrifty, healthy and comforting homemade soup. Having a few soup recipes in your back pocket is an affordable and easy way to up your vegetable intake.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, homemade soups can be time-consuming to make – what with having to saute the veg, stand over the pan as you add liquid and simmer, before you finally blend into the finished soup. Not so with a snazzy soup maker, which will handle much of that faff with the press of a single button. And most of them take less than half an hour to run the programme from start to finish.So, if healthy home-cooked lunches and dinners are on the cards for 2026, a soup-making machine could be a useful investment. I’ve spent months testing a range of the best soup makers to find out if they’re worth it, and I can attest that most of them are – particularly when you consider that some models start at £30.At a glanceBest soup maker overall:Tefal Easy Soup£109.99 at TefalBest budget soup maker:Aldi Ambiano soup maker£29.99 at Aldi (in store only)Best multifunctional soup maker:Ninja Foodi blender and soup maker£149.99 at John LewisBest compact soup maker:Lakeland compact soup maker£59.99 at LakelandBest premium-feeling soup maker:Panasonic blender and soup maker£129.99 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’ve been trialling kitchen appliances – from coffee machines to pizza ovens – along with recipes, food and drink for a decade, for a range of national and consumer media outlets. As a keen home cook, I appreciate gadgets that can reduce prep and cooking time, but with cupboard and worktop space at a premium for many of us, these have to work hard for their place in the kitchen.How I testedView image in fullscreenSouper duper? One of the soup makers has its temperature taken.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianI picked two soup recipes from the Guardian’s archives:Rukmini Iyer’s carrot soup with fennel, chilli and crab, andThomasina Miers’ potato, leek and wild mushroom soup with chipotle oil and creme fraiche. Both make use of various root veg, with one smooth and the other chunky, to test the machines’ different soup-making programmes.I assessed how easy the machines were to assemble and use, then I timed the duration of the smooth and chunky soup functions. I recorded the final soup temperature using a thermometer probe, along with the temperature of the handle and the exterior body of the machine at the end of a single cook cycle. While the soup was being made, I noted the noise the machine made during the blending cycle, and finally measured the power draw of a single smooth soup programme.View image in fullscreenWhether the vegetables we fully cooked through in the chunky soups was a key factor in rating the soup makers.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianThe resulting soups were all rated for texture and taste, with attention paid to whether the vegetables in the chunky soup were cooked through. Finally, I considered how easy each machine was to clean, and, if there was one, how well the self-clean function worked.After testing, the soup makers were either returned to the brand or retailer, or donated toGratitude Upcycle, a charitable organisation in Barnet, north London, that gives items to worthy recipients, uses the equipment in its community kitchens, or resells them in its store, with profits going to the charity.The best soup makers in 2026View image in fullscreenBowled over: four of the soup makers from our group test.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianBest soup maker overall:Tefal Easy SoupTefalEasy Soup£109.99£109.99 at TefalWhat we loveEverythingWhat we don’t loveIt’s on the small side for families£109.99 at TefalThis medium-size soup maker from Tefal arrives with four settings plus a self-cleaning cycle. It sports a standard jug design with a clear, simple-looking control panel. It’s double-walled and includes a 40-minute keep-warm function that runs from the point the soup programme ends. Plus, there’s a recipe book in the box for inspiration.Why we love itIt’s a soup maker that does everything right; it’s a good-quality machine that proved easy to use, quiet and effective. While none of the featured soup makers were particularly noisy, this was the second quietest (about washing machine level), and it’s unlikely to disturb you if you’re on a Teams call in the same room. The noise isn’t constant, either – kicking in for short bursts only for the blending cycle. The resulting soup was properly cooked through in the chunky programme and smooth and velvety in the smooth programme. Cleanup was a doddle, too.It’s a shame that …while there’s little to criticise this machine for, I do question whether a 1.2-litre capacity is large enough for a four-person serving of soup, as it suggests.Dimensions:22.5 x 15.5 x 36.7cm (WDH)Capacity:1.2 litresPower draw:0.165KwHTime:23min smooth/25min chunkyLiquid temperature:96CExternal body temperature:45CHandle temperature:20CTop noise level:69dBTefalEasy Soup£109.99£109.99 at TefalWhat we loveEverythingWhat we don’t loveIt’s on the small side for familiesBest budget soup maker:Aldi Ambiano soup makerAldiAmbiano soup maker£29.99£29.99 at Aldi (in store only)What we loveThe amazing price for a quick, quiet and capacious machineWhat we don’t loveIts relatively high power drawPhotograph: Joanne Gould/The Guardian£29.99 at Aldi (in store only)Aldi’s sell-out middle-aisle soup maker features a 1.6-litre capacity and comes with fivepresets – smooth soup, chunky soup, smoothie, compote and blend – along with a keep-warm function.

To use, just add your ingredients up to the max fill line and press start on your choice of programme – in just 25 minutes, I was slurping some of the smoothest soup I’d ever tried. There’s no self-clean function here, though adding a little water with a drop of washing-up liquid and running a quick blend cycle is effectively the same thing. It’s also quiet in use; if you spot one in store, grab it.It’s a shame that …it uses more power than other models, but that’s the price of chef-level smooth soup, I guess.

With 10 preset programmes (chunky soup, smooth soup, sauces, jams, smoothies, frozen drinks, milkshakes, desserts, chop, saute), six manual settings, a keep-warm and a self-clean function, there’s a lot you can do with this machine. Thankfully, it comes with a 25-recipe book to get you started.Why we love itThis is an impressive machine, with powerful and sharp blending blades that make for silky soups; it can even handle ice. It’s sturdy, well made and easy to use because of the generous number of one-touch programmes. I liked that the glass jug allows you to keep an eye on whatever you’re cooking – although with blades this powerful, no chunk will be left unblended. Its large capacity makes it even more versatile for families and batch cooking.It’s a shame that …it’s significantly more expensive than standard soup makers, so think carefully about whether you need this level of power and functionality. It’s also heavy, and its height makes it a little awkward to add ingredients into the jug once it’s on top of the base. It’s not small to store, either.Dimensions:21.5 x 20 x 45cm (WDH)Capacity:1.4 litres hot/1.7 litres coldPower draw:0.221KwHTime:30min smooth or chunkyLiquid temperature:98CExternal body temperature:84CHandle temperature:22CTop noise level:88.9dBNinjaFoodi blender and soup makerfrom£149.99£149.99 at John Lewis£149.99 at NinjaWhat we loveIts power, versatility and buildWhat we don’t loveThe priceBest compact soup maker:Lakeland compact soup makerLakelandCompact soup makerfrom£59.99£59.99 at Lakeland£59.99 at AmazonWhat we loveHow compact and portable it isWhat we don’t loveIt struggles to make root veg super smooth£59.99 at Lakeland£59.99 at AmazonSmaller in size than many soup makers, this standard-design one-litre capacity Lakeland model has four functions (smooth, chunky, drinks, blend) plus self-clean. It is sufficiently lightweight to be portable and is ideal for one to two people.Why we love itIt’s compact, so well suited for small spaces and fewer portions (some larger models have a two- to three-portion minimum capacity). That also means the soup maker uses less power, making it an economical way of knocking up lunch in as little as 23 minutes. At a top level of 75dB, noise output during blending cycles is the equivalent of a noisy conversation – but, thankfully, these are short and sharp.It’s a shame that …the soup isn’t the smoothest – there was a bittiness to the texture of the carrot soup, which wasn’t remedied by further blending, but it still tasted good.

It also includes a “quiet cover” to muffle some of the noise of blending. There are nine automatic programmes – smooth soup, chunky soup, smoothie, frozen drink, fruit puree, baby puree warm, sauce, nut drink and jam – along with keep-warm and cleaning cycles. Here, you also have the ability to make adjustments to temperature and blending speed, for example.Why we love itIt looks and feels so premium that you’ll likely want it on display on your worktop. Functionality is as impressive as the Ninja machine, and it’s almost as easy to use; it certainly looks daunting, but once you’re familiar, you’ll be hot- and cold-blending all day long in no time. At 22 minutes from start to finish, it was also the quickest to deliver a bowl of soup this smooth. The quiet cover is a nice add-on, and muted blending noise significantly. However, given that the machine blends for only brief moments in any cycle, I don’t know how necessary it is.It’s a shame that …it looks so complicated; you’ll need to read the instructions carefully and experiment to get the most out of this cooking blender, whereas other machines are more plug in and go.Dimensions:20.6 x 24.7 x 39.9cm (WDH)Capacity:one litre hot/1.2 litres coldPower draw:0.133kWhTime:22min smooth/20min chunkyLiquid temperature:92CExternal body temperature:77CHandle temperature:21CTop noise level:80dB (71bB when using quiet cover)PanasonicBlender and soup makerfrom£129.99£129.99 at John Lewis£129.99 at CurrysWhat we loveIts premium build and multifunctionalityWhat we don’t loveThe capacity is fairly limited given its sizeThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Produces great smooth soups’: the Salter KuroSalter Kuro digital soup makerSalterKuro digital soup makerfrom£49.99£49.99 at Salter£49.99 at AmazonWhat we loveAn affordable, solid choice for familiesWhat we don’t loveIt can be quite loud during blend cycles£49.99 at Salter£49.99 at AmazonBest for:busy familiesThis Salter model offers good looks, a large capacity, quick runtime and fairly quiet operation for a reasonable price.

The Saute and Soup used less power and was quieter than most of the others – which may go some way to explain the less desirable texture of its “smooth” soup. Nevertheless, it’s a decent model that produces a tasty chunky soup, and the low running costs make it a decent investment in the long run.It didn’t make the final cut because…the texture of the smooth soup was too grainy compared with others – especially for the price – and some mixture bubbled out of the spout during the cook.Dimensions:22.4 x 17 x 31cm (WDH);capacity:1.6 litres;power draw:0.145kWh;time:21min smooth/28min chunky;liquid temperature:94C;external body temperature:couldn’t record, but too hot to touch;handle temperature:25.5C;top noise level:75dBMorphy RichardsSaute and Soupfrom£76.11£77 at AO£76.11 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s very economicalWhat we don’t loveIt’s not great for smooth soupsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenConsider how many people you’ll be feeding when buying a soup maker.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianHow much should I spend?If you’re looking for an everyday soup maker into which you can simply throw some veg and stock to work its magic, then spending as little as £30 to £40 will bag you a good enough model, if you shop around for deals. Obviously, multifunction models cost more, but you’re paying for superior blending performance alongside added flexibility and functionality; think about whether you need all those options. If you already have a high-powered blender, stick to a small, basic soup maker.What features should I look out for?First, think about capacity: if you have many mouths to feed, opt for one that’s 1.6 litres and above, but for a smaller household that doesn’t like eating repeat meals, a more compact model without a two- or three-portion minimum fill level will be better.Some pricier soup makers double as ice-crushing blenders, allowing you to whip up milkshakes, cocktails and the like; but, again, ask yourself whether you need such functionality. Even the cheapest soup makers have a non-heating blending function that may be all you require for other non-soup functions.Finally, be aware that a machine may look like a soup maker and advertise soup functionality heavily, but it could be no such thing. Check that it actually comes with a heating plate!For more:The best rice cookers, testedThe best blenders for smoothies and soupsThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade mealsJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

And where are the music stands?Wed 4 Feb 2026 09.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 10.42 ESTShareEvents in the United States of Trumpland continue to reveal staggering new dimensions to the possibilities of orchestral music. Trump’s announcement that his “Trump Kennedy Center” isto be shut for a refitis a brilliantly cynical way to stop the noise when artists try to cancel their appearances during the rest of his presidential tenure: it’s shut already!Biglylosers, all of you!But that’s not the new dawn for the artform I’m talking about. I mean the inspirational painting unveiled by the maestro of Trumpian kitsch, Jon McNaughton (and stamped with the presidential seal of approval – ie a post onTruth Social).Tucker Carlson is cheerleading on the cymbals and Elon Musk? He’s on electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral packMaga Symphonydepicts Trump as a conductor of the politicians and cultural figures who are Making the Orchestra Great Again. Who’s in this Maga fever dream of an orchestra? Marco Rubio leads the violins, JD Vance takes the cellos (Melania is relegated to the second desk), his sons and Roger Stone are on double basses, the foundation of the orchestra’s ideological soundworld. A bizarrely configured woodwind and brass lineup features four flutes and no oboes – mind you, there are no violas either, those shape-shifting probable Democrats! – plus Tom Homan on horn, with Tucker Carlson cheerleading on the cymbals. Where’s Elon Musk, you ask? On electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral pack.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s Truth Social post showing the painting.Photograph: @realDonaldTrumpAs McNaughton describes this image, “you can feel it – the music is coming together – rising and stirring something deep inside … When Americans pull together and trust a shared vision, they create something strong, lasting, and bigger than any one person.”And that’s the cultural trope that this ludicrous image burnishes: the idea of the all-powerful conductor, inspiring total command and obedience from their musicians, which has been inspirational catnip for dictators from Hitler to Stalin to Mussolini. As Elias Canetti wrote in his bookCrowds and Power: “There is no more obvious expression of power than the performance of a conductor … He has the power of life and death over the voices of the instruments.”Orchestras can represent an ideal society – if, that is, you’re a wannabe despot. Imagine: one hundred musicians, working in perfect togetherness to realise your vision, with no possibility of dissent, criticism or disagreement. Every tiny movement of your arms and facial expressions is magicked through the force of pure will into the sounds of your deepest desires. Which self-respecting autocrat wouldn’t want that kind of social control?McNaughton’s Maga orchestra takes the idea a stage further. There are no music stands in front of the players – they are performing through Trumpian telepathy, a connection as mystical as it’s musical. It’s not so much a Maga symphony as a political seance turned into sound.This concept of the orchestra didn’t only take hold of the fevered imaginations of dictators in the 1930s and presidents in the 2020s. Words such as McNaughton’s are routinely used in less obviously politically inflamed contexts to describe the potential social good that orchestras can do, from apologists for Venezuela’s El Sistema – its “system” of music education, and its satellites all over the world – to many leaders of orchestral culture here in the UK. If society worked more like orchestras, the story goes, our lives would all be better, because in orchestras everyone’s giving up their individuality for the greater good.An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collectiveBut that’s a deeply problematic idea, because orchestras never work in absolute harmony. An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collective. The best orchestras do not function like well-oiled machines, drilled to the finest margins of unanimity. Instead, they’re models of a controlled chaos of human emotions, desires and virtuosities that are held in tension, balance and friction in the moment of performance. They’re made from the transfigured experience of listening to each other. When orchestras really fly, the conductor isn’t an all-powerful musical despot, instead, he or she is an inspirer of a dynamic culture in which everyone responds to where the musical discourse is going, recognising when they’ve got the tune or the accompaniment, creating a permanent state of flux, volatility, and creative negotiation.The Trump image is comic, and troubling, because it reinstates the idea of the relationship between conductors and orchestras as populist shorthands for autocracy and demagoguery. No doubt the Association of British Orchestras’ annual conference,convening in London this week, will inspire a more genuinely collective vision for the future of the orchestra in this country. Or maybe an enterprisingly craven orchestra will sign up Trump as their next music director. Stranger things have happened. And probably will by next week.This week Tom has been listening to:Kevin Puts’s Emily: No Prisoner Be, Joyce DiDonato’s collaboration with Time for Three. It is communicative and urgently powerful in recording and performance.

I’m personally not sure I could trust myself to back the prime minister in a confidence vote.”“The most terminal mood is among the super-loyal,” an MP from the 2024 intake noted.MPs said that Starmer’s admission at prime minister’s questions that he had known about Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein before his appointment was a clarifying moment.“You could feel the atmosphere change; it was dark,” one MP who had previously been close to Starmer said. No 10 said afterwards that the prime minister was only aware of what was already in the public domain.“It’s just indefensible,” said one backbencher. “They knew all about Peter’s relationship with Epstein but gave him the job anyway.“It’s like Chris Pincher on steroids,” they added, referring to the scandal that eventually brought down Boris Johnson. “The moment Keir admitted it then that was it – it’s over.”Another former minister said: “We were meant to be the ones who didn’t do this stuff. It’s time for a fresh start, the sooner the better.”Several MPs said the prime minister’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who had been close to Mandelson, should take responsibility for the failures and resign. “The government is on the run,” another MP said. “Goodness knows what will come out – there could be a lot of red faces and departures off the back of it.”Last chance, Keir? MPs in despair as crisis engulfs Downing StreetRead moreNo 10 had said it hoped the documents would prove that Mandelson had lied about the depth of his relationship with the disgraced financier. But on Wednesday night, the Metropolitan police said it had blocked the release of certain documents in case they prejudiced a criminal investigation in Mandelson’s apparent sharing of confidential government documents with Epstein.Earlier Downing Street attempted to mitigate the Conservatives’ bid to trigger the release of the documents by adding exemptions for national security and to protect international relations. MPs called the move a “cover-up” and demanded the judgment be made by the intelligence and security committee of MPs – rather than the cabinet secretary – over what to release.Whips were warned they were on the brink of losing the vote as Hillier and Rayner rose in the Commons to argue for the role of the select committee – and were forced to draft a second amendment to appease MPs.Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, is understood not to have been planning to speak in the debate, but cancelled a lunch meeting when she realised intervention was needed to stop a potential government defeat.After her speech in the chamber, she spoke to the chief whip and leader of the house to broker the amendment, along with Hillier. “Yet again the prime minister has to thank Angela Rayner’s swift political judgment to save this government from itself,” said one MP, referring back to the concessions brokered by Rayner before the welfare reform vote.Backing Rayner for a leadership bid, they said: “The sooner the day comes that she’s making the original decisions, the better.”Another MP said: “If Angela didn’t have her tax investigation ongoing, she’d be getting numbers [for a leadership challenge] offered to her tonight.”OneLabourbackbencher called the day’s events a “bin fire”, but said that while there was a lot of heat and noise behind the scene few Labour MPs and no ministers were yet willing to put their heads above the parapet. “I think if Ange had said something it would be game over,” they said. “The PM is safe for now.”Cabinet ministers expressed annoyance at the handling of the amendments, with one saying it had been “frustrating”. Another said they had warned the Cabinet Office over how it would look to attempt to mitigate the Tory motion – and said the priority should have been to avoid any move that could be interpreted as a cover-up.Several MPs told the Guardian that it would be “ironic” if Starmer was forced out over Mandelson’s links to Epstein, as they were convinced of his personal commitment to tackling violence against women and girls. “We’ve never had a PM that cares so much about it,” said one. “It would be mad if another man being mates with a paedophile brought him down, but it’s totally possible.”The motion to release the documents relating to Mandelson’s appointment passed on Wednesday night and No 10 said it would comply as soon as possible, in accordance with police advice. “We will comply with the motion, including publishing documents relating to Peter Mandelson’s appointment, which will show the lies he told,” a spokesperson said.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

We therefore asked them not to release certain documents at this time.“Going forward as material is made available to us, and if we identify further documents that we believe could prejudice our investigation, we will continue to ask the government to pause their release until such time as the risk of prejudice no longer exists. The integrity of our investigation is paramount to securing justice.”Starmer said at PMQs that he would soon move legislation to make it easier to strip peers of their titles – including Mandelson. He said he had also asked King Charles to remove him from the list of privy counsellors.But he admitted during the exchanges that he had been aware of Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein, suggesting the peer had lied during the first stage of the vetting process about the depth of the friendship.No 10 said Starmer was referring only to what was in the public domain. “This was looked into as part of the appointment process as the prime minister referenced today,” the source said. “Peter Mandelson lied to the prime minister, hid information that has since come to light and presented Epstein as someone he barely knew.”Starmer will attempt to move back on to his domestic agenda on Thursday in a speech about the government’s “Pride in Place” scheme, intended as a replacement to the Conservatives’ levelling up agenda.Starmer believes the plan to invest £5bn over 10 years in more than 300 deprived areas will help dent the threat from Reform UK. The fund is meant to pay for regeneration efforts such as patching up derelict shops, pubs and libraries.The prime minister will announce on Thursday an extra £800m for the scheme, which will allow an additional 40 places to access funding, saying: “If you want to know where hope lives in Britain – it is in our communities, that is where people come together.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerPeter MandelsonLabourJeffrey EpsteinAngela RaynerLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of the one put forward this week, the government has added an amendment stating that all documents would be published “except papers prejudicial to UK national security or international relations”.If agreed, humble addresses are understood to be binding on the house.What is their history?Humble addresses have rarely been used over the past 200 years, but were deployed as far back as 1715, during the first parliament of George I, to address what its proponents viewed as national security fears “abetted and encouraged by treasonable practices at home, in favour of a Popish Pretender”.John Stuart Mill, a liberal philosopher and MP, used a humble address in 1866 as part of the campaign to extend votes to women.Have they become more frequent?While originally regarded as a polite, ceremonial message, one view is that they have been politically weaponised in recent years by opposition parties looking for procedural back doors to force the release of sensitive documents.A key moment came in 2017when the Tory-led government conceded that it had to share dozens of previously confidential documents assessing the economic impact of Brexit after Labour used a humble address demanding their release.Its use resulted in criticism that Labour was trying to drag the queen into the Brexit debate, but humble addresses were used again on occasions in 2018 and 2019, again for Brexit-related reasons.In opposition, Keir Starmer used one in 2022 to force the publication of security advice relating to Evgeny Lebedev’s peerage, humiliating the government by attracting the support of Tory rebels.How powerful are they?Starmer, who was Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary when he tabled a humble address in November 2017 seeking the release of economic impact assessments, told the House of Commons debate at the time: “We believe this is a binding motion.”The former Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg noted that Erskine May – the guide to parliamentary practice – does not use the word “binding” but states that each House of Commons member has the power to call for the production of papers by means of a motion for a return. “Power is something pretty forceful, and is much more than just an expression of will,” he added.The then speaker, John Bercow, concluded: “Motions of this kind have traditionally been regarded as binding or effective. Consistent with that established pattern, I would expect the vice-chamberlain of the household to present the humble address in the usual way.”The passing of a motion for a return also raises the prospect of the government being held in contempt of parliament if it does not abide by the resolution.A November 2017 blog postby Andrew Defty of the University of Lincoln noted Labour’s repeated use of the procedure, and how the government at the time sought to place pressure on Labour’s tactic by writing to the privileges committee to ask it to consider whether it was appropriate. Now in opposition, it is the Tories themselves who are turning to the procedure.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPeter MandelsonKemi BadenochKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsexplainersShareReuse this content"

That email was never sent. The email is false,” Gates said.“﻿I don’t know what his thinking was there. Was he trying to attack me in some way? Every minute I spent with him, I regret, and I apologize that I did that.”His interview followed comments made by his ex-wife to NPR on Tuesday, in which she made clear her disapproval of his friendship with Epstein.“For me, it’s personally hard whenever those details come up, right? Because it brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage,” French Gates told the radio network’sWild Card podcast.“Whatever questions remain there of what - I can’t even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me.”The public airing of some of the lowest points in the Gateses’ 27-year marriage, which ended in a2021 divorce, epitomizes the fallout still being felt from the Epstein scandal, more than six years after his August 2019death by suicidein New York’s Metropolitan correctional center as he awaited trial on sexual abuse trafficking charges.Gates told 9News he met Epstein in 2011 and had dinner with him on several occasions to discuss investing in proposed scientific ventures. He insisted he never went to Epstein’s private Caribbean island, where countless girls and young women are alleged to have been abused, and did not have any relations with any women.“The focus was always, he knew a lot of very rich people, and he was saying he could get them to give money to global health. In retrospect, that was a dead end,” Gates said.“I was foolish to spend time with him. I was one of many people who regret ever knowing him. The more that comes out, the more clear it will be that, although the time was a mistake, it has nothing to do with that kind of behaviour﻿.”The interview with Gates French, meanwhile, will be released in full by NPR on Thursday. The network released snippets, and athree-minute video clip, on Wednesday, in which the 61-year-old spoke of the Epstein files’ release and scrutiny as a “reckoning as a society”.Talking about Epstein’s numerous victims, she said: “No girl should ever be put in the situation they were put in by Epstein and whatever was going on with all of the various people around him. It’s beyond heartbreaking.“I remember being those ages the girls were, I remember my daughters being those ages.”She said she had “moved on” from a marriage she said she had to get away from, and was now “in a really unexpected, beautiful place in my life. I’m so happy to be away from all the muck that was there.”Asked about her emotions at learning of the claims against her ex-husband, particularly that he tried to secretly procure her antibiotics, she said she felt “just unbelievable sadness”.She added: “I’m able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, ‘My God, how did that happen to those girls?’ I hope there’s some justice for those now women. What they went through is unimaginable.”On Wednesday, the Republican South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace, said she supported French Gates’s position that her husband had questions to answer, and had written to James Comer, chair of the House oversight committee that is investigating Epstein’s activities.“Last night, I watched Melinda Gates interview. I immediately asked the chairman of oversight, James Comer, to subpoena, Bill Gates. I have questions for Bill Gates about Epstein,” Mace wrote in apost on X.On Monday, Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose names also feature in the Epstein files, said they hadagreed to testifyto the committee, days before the chamber was expected to vote to hold them in contempt for originally refusing to do so.Explore more on these topicsBill GatesMelinda French GatesJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

The optics of his public appearances this week have not been good.Photograph: ShutterstockAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorAnalysisKing must feel vindicated for cutting off Andrew by latest Epstein files releaseCaroline DaviesPosition of Mountbatten-Windsor now appears even more grave, and the shadow cast over his family even darkerWed 4 Feb 2026 11.43 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 14.51 ESTShareWhen King Charlesstripped Andrew Mountbatten-Windsorof his titles and announced he would be booted out of Royal Lodge, Buckingham Palace said the “censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him”.Four months andmore than 3m documents later, Charles must surely feel vindicated on his tough approach. For while there is nothing to suggest the king nor any other senior royals knew then what was to come in the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, what has emerged has been truly shocking.The position of Mountbatten-Windsor, and that of his ex-wife,Sarah Ferguson, appears even more grave, and the shadow cast over the royal family and institution even darker.With governmentpressure mountingon the former prince to testify to the US Congress on what he knew about Epstein, royal sources can only indicate that it is “ultimately a matter for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his conscience”.From Mountbatten-Windsor himself, we have heard nothing. He has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein; in particular he has denied the allegation he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 and was trafficked by the US financier.Nothing in the documents recently disgorged by the US Department of Justice shows legal wrongdoing on the part of the ex-prince. But they can be said to raise questions over his judgment at a time when he was a working royal and UK trade envoy globe-trotting to represent the nation’s interests.Recently released undated imagesappearing to show him crouching on all foursover an unidentified clothed woman and touching her abdomen are disturbing given they were taken at Epstein’s New York City mansion.His unequivocal assertion that he broke off his friendship with Epstein in New York in December 2010 is challenged. After that trip, he appears to have written to Epstein: “It was great to spend time with my US family. Looking forward to joining you all again soon.”In January 2011, he appears to thank Epstein for sorting out a financial problem for his ex-wife and reveals he is going on his annual retreat. “This week is all about me. Time to put something back into me before the rest of the world starts sucking it out in all their greed and demands,” an account named “The Duke” writes.One particularly grubby allegation, contained in a 2011 legal document, is that Epstein and the then prince asked an exotic dancer for a threesome at the financier’s Florida home in “early 2006”, with the woman’s lawyer accusing the two of having “prevailed upon her to engage in various sex acts” during the alleged encounter. Lawyers also claimed the party at Epstein’s West Palm Beach home had included girls “as young as 14 years old” who were “dressed provocatively”.The unnamed woman claimed “she was hired to dance, not to have sex” and “she was working as an exotic dancer, but she was treated like a prostitute”. “After the men had satisfied themselves, they invted [sic] my client to take a trip with them to the Virgin Islands. She declined their invitation. She was then chauffeured back to the strip club,” the legal letter continues. It says the woman would be content to keep the alleged encounter confidential “in exchange for a payment of 250,000 dollars”.In tandem, Thames Valley police, which covers Windsor, are assessingclaims made by a US lawyerthat a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor. It allegedly occurred at the former prince’s residence,Royal Lodge, in 2010, with the woman described as not British and in her 20s at the time. The force said on Tuesday: “We take any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward.”These are untested allegations to which Mountbatten-Windsor has yet to respond. Even so, they are discomfiting for the royal family. The only senior royal to have commented so far is the Duke of Edinburgh, who, when asked about the documents by a journalist, said: “I think it’s all really important, always, to remember the victims and who are the victims in all this.”As for the former Duchess of York, also now titleless, the emails suggest a relationship with Epstein in which she often appears to have been in need of money – including £20,000 for rent on one occasion. She called him her “pillar”, offered to “organise your houses”, and jokingly told him “just marry me”, the documents suggest.She appears to have had lunch with him, and her daughters, in July 2009, days after he was released from prison, where he was serving a sentence for child sex offences. She appears to have been bereft on finally concluding in 2011 it was “crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply [sic]. More than you will know.”The timing of Mountbatten-Windsor’s move from Royal Lodge, under the cover of darkness on Monday night to the king’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, may have been coincidence. He will temporarily stay at Wood Farm Cottage – where his father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, retired to – before moving permanently to the five-bedroom Marsh Farm, still undergoing renovation, it is understood.The optics of him horse riding in Windsor Great Park or cheerily waving to passersby as he drove around this week were not good. He may still be seen at Windsor on occasion, it is understood, as the full move may take some time to complete. But, by and large, he will be geographically distanced from the royal hub, from where the rest of his family will attempt to carry on business as usual.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorKing Charles IIIJeffrey EpsteinSarah FergusonMonarchyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Of the 2.7 million people tracked, 2.8% were diagnosed with autism between the ages of two and 37.They found that by the age of 20, diagnosis rates of men and women were almost equal, challenging previous assumptions that autism is more common among males.“Our findings suggest that the gender difference in autism prevalence is much lower than previously thought, due to women and girls being underdiagnosed or diagnosed late,” said the lead author, Dr Caroline Fyfe.The research calculated that in childhood, boys were diagnosed on average nearly three years earlier than girls – the median age at diagnosis was 15.9 for girls, but 13.1 for boys. Overall, boys were three to four times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism under the age of 10, although girls were found to “catch up” by the time they were 20, owing to a rapid increase in autism diagnosis during adolescence.“These observations highlight the need to investigate why female individuals receive diagnoses later than male individuals,” the authors conclude.The study, published in the BMJ, also found that while gender disparities in diagnosis rates remained pretty consistent over the last three decades for children under 10, they decreased rapidly for all other age groups.“Findings indicate that the male to female ratio for autism spectrum disorder has decreased over time and with increasing age at diagnosis,” the authors observe.“This male to female ratio may therefore be substantially lower than previously thought, to the extent that, inSweden, it may no longer be distinguishable by adulthood.”Patient and patient advocate Anne Cary, writing in a linked editorial, said the research supported arguments that it was “systemic biases in diagnosis, rather than a true gap in incidence” that were behind the discrepancy in diagnosis rates.While the onset of symptoms could be delayed and masking was undoubtedly a factor, the methods and tools to diagnose autism might be biased and need refining, she said. “These biases have meant that a girl who would ultimately have a diagnosis of autism would have a less than third of a chance of receiving a diagnosis before the age of 10 years,” Cary added.“As autistic girls and women await proper diagnosis, they are likely to be (mis)diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, especially mood and personality disorders, and they are forced to self-advocate to be seen and treated appropriately: as autistic patients, just as autistic as their male counterparts.”Responding to the findings, autism charities said much more needed to be done to tackle gender stereotypes.Dr Judith Brown, head of evidence and research at the National Autistic Society, said: “Gender should never be a barrier to receiving an autism diagnosis and access to the right support.“Historically, it was wrongly assumed that autistic people were mostly men and boys, but we now know that women and girls are more likely to ‘mask’ what [are] traditionally thought of as signs of autism, making it harder to identify the challenges they face.“Misdiagnosed autistic women can develop coexisting mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression, as a result of a lack of support and the exhaustion of masking. This is why it’s so vital that the experiences of autistic women and girls are not overlooked, and outdated stereotypes and incorrect assumptions are finally put to rest.”Jolanta Lasota, chief executive of Ambitious aboutAutism, said: “Autistic girls have different experiences to autistic boys and have slipped under the radar for far too long.”By having their needs misunderstood or explained away as something else, “they have missed out on vital support, and in some cases, reached crisis point with theirmental health”, she added.“It is crucial researchers and diagnostic services continue to build understanding of the different presentations of autism in girls and women, and that our support services adapt to accommodate the increasing number of people who we now know need them.”Dr Conor Davidson, former Royal College of Psychiatrists’ autism champion and clinical lead for Leeds autism diagnostic service, said: “Autism in girls is more likely to go undetected during childhood and signs of the condition might only surface during adolescence or even early adulthood.“Psychiatrists working in adult neurodevelopmental clinics in the UK have started to see higher numbers of women coming forward than men in recent years. Unfortunately, waiting lists for both child and adult autism assessments are unacceptably long.“There are many autistic women who have not received a diagnosis, and it is vital that they are able to access a timely assessment and care if they need it.“Psychiatrists must also be aware of the possibility of autism when they are assessing patients with mental health problems. This can be particularly important for women, whose autism may not have been picked up in childhood.”Explore more on these topicsAutismChildrenHealthNeurodiversityMental healthSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

The doctors’ unioncondemned that figure as “indefensible”and “an insult” when the Department of Health and Social Carefirst proposed it in evidenceto theNHS pay review body and doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration body.The search for a resolution has become more urgent since theBMA announced on Mondaythat resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, had voted overwhelmingly to keep on striking for another six months in pursuit of their demands for a 26% pay rise over the next several years, along with more places for doctors to start training in their chosen medical speciality.Thefive-day walkoutresident doctors staged just before Christmas was their 14th strike since March 2023. Each of the three five-day stoppages they have held since Labour took power in July 2024 has cost the NHS an estimated £250m.Streeting is also looking at introducing a system of financial penalties for hospitals that do not do enough to improve resident doctors’ working lives. That could lead to NHS trusts being fined if they do not give those medics access to rest areas and hot food during their shifts, including overnight – a longstanding complaint by the BMA.He is also drawing up plans to address another major grievance among resident doctors, namely that those who do extra work outside their contracted hours should receive payment for that or time off in lieu.Jim Mackey, NHS England’s chief executive,last year set out a 10-point planfor hospitals to improve resident doctors’ working lives. However, the BMA and Mackey are both frustrated that some NHS trusts have been slow to make enough progress on issues like access to rest and food, as well as payroll errors and management of doctors’ rotas.In a sign that Streeting’s talks with the BMA appear hopeful, Dr Arjan Singh, the deputy chair of the union’s resident doctors committee,told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesdaythat it is unlikely to call further strikes in the near future, despite their new legal mandate to do so, because progress is being made.“There is no intention to go on strike. It is a negotiating tool, but we’ve got no intention of actually using it.“We can pull the trigger and go on strike whenever we want, but that’s not the aim of the game. The aim is to get good pay and good conditions, without strike action, hopefully,” he said.Singh added: “We’ve been on strike 14 [or] 15 times, quite a lot, over the last two years. Ideally we can get this done without any further action.”New polling on Wednesday showed that a majority of the public oppose strikes by resident doctors over their demands. YouGov found that 52% of people in Britain do not support walkouts – down from 53% in a similar survey in December – and that 38% do support them, a figure which has not changed.YouGov asked 4,592 adults in Britain if they supported or opposed resident doctors going on strike over pay and job insecurity. The survey was undertaken on Tuesday, after the BMA’s ballot result.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care denied the story and said: “We won’t be giving a running commentary on what have so far been constructive talks.”Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingTrade unionsIndustrial actionDoctorsLabourHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will take place amid a massive buildup of US naval and airpower in the region and appear to be a last chance for Tehran to avert a US strike against the country’s leadership and nuclear programme.The talks had collapsed earlier on Wednesday as Iran vowed they would be confined to its nuclear programme only. The US had demanded the talks also address Tehran’s ballistic missile programme, which Iran had ruled out.Asked whether Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should be worried after reports of the collapse of negotiations, Trump responded: “I would say he should be very worried, yeah, he should be.”It is not clear whether the dispute has been fully resolved. Axios reported that the talks had been reinstated after the US was approached by a number of Arab and Muslim countries urging it not to abandon negotiations with Iran.Despite its relatively weak negotiating hand, Iran has said the only issue on the agenda can be the assurances that Tehran is willing to provide that its nuclear programme has no military purpose or objective. It says the talks must be held in Oman, where most of the previous rounds of talks were held.Iran had thought it had forced businessman Jared Kushner, who is also Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, to agree to these terms and drop the plans for the talks in Turkey. Instead, it has been reported that Witkoff will travel to Doha on Thursday and then return to Washington without meeting the Iranians. The US has a large naval fleet in the region that Trump has said he is willing to use to force the Iranians to back down.Explaining US thinking before news of the apparent collapse started to circulate, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said: “We thought we had an established forum that had been agreed to in Turkey that was put together by a number of partners who wanted to attend and be a part of it. I saw conflicting reports yesterday from the Iranian side saying that they had not agreed to that, so that’s still being worked through.”He added: “At the end of the day, the United States is prepared to engage, and has always been prepared to engage, with Iran. In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include certain things, and that includes the range of their ballistic missiles.“That includes their sponsorship of terrorist organisations across the region. That includes the nuclear programme. And that includes the treatment of their own people.”His remarks, diplomats said, did not preclude the discussions on these topics being sequenced, as Turkey had recommended, and left an ambiguity as to what other issues might be discussed if the nuclear file is initially addressed.Iran had been hoping that the opening of the talks in Oman might lead to a broad statement by both sides to agree to negotiate and to de-escalate tensions. This would allow direct talks to start. But the US appears to be determined that its agenda and format, one that appeared to have the support of some Arab states, should prevail. The US believes that Iran is in a weak negotiating position and Tehran has badly overreached itself.No guarantee existed that the nuclear file can be resolved since Iran insists it must retain its right to enrich uranium inside Iran and that there is no need for its existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium to be transferred out of the country to a third party such as Russia. On Thursday, Russia said its proposal to take the Iranian uranium stockpile still stood.Rubio added: “Iran has only shown willingness to discuss its nuclear programme, albeit not on the terms demanded by the US – for the Islamic Republic to agree not to enrich uranium on its own territory and export all of its already enriched stockpiles out of the country.” He added that the US did not see agreeing to meet the Iranians as a concession or an act of legitimisation.Tensions within Iran about its negotiating stance were reflected in criticism made by some Iranians of the aggressive posture being adopted by Ali Shamkhani, the former secretary of the supreme national security council of Iran from 2013 to 2023. He has warned that war is likely and said Iran need only reduce the purity of its uranium stock.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaOmanNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bomb craters can be seen around the cemetery, but in this area the destruction appears to have been more systematic.Rows of gravestones have been removed, the topsoil has been churned up and a substantial earth berm can be seen running across the middle of the affected area. It is of a size that suggests the use of heavy equipment.There was no sign of the earthworks in March last year, but they are clearly visible in a satellite picture from 8 August. The disturbed area is even more apparent in an image of the cemetery from 13 December. Vegetation has regrown among the ranks of gravestones covering the rest of the cemetery, but the southwestern corner remains bare, with the earth berm casting a substantial shadow over the sandy soil.A series of satellite images of the Gaza War CemeteryEssam Jaradah, the graveyard’s former caretaker, whose home is close by, said: “Two bulldozing operations took place at the cemetery. The first bulldozing occurred outside the cemetery walls, extending approximately 12 metres around all sides of the cemetery. These areas were entirely planted with olive trees.“Later on, an area of slightly less than 1 dunum [1,000 sq metres] was bulldozed inside the cemetery walls, specifically in the corner of the cemetery, which contains graves of Australian soldiers. The bulldozing covered the area from the bench where foreign visitors used to sit up to the memorial monument. Bulldozers also created sand mounds that were used as earth barriers.“I witnessed this bulldozing after the Israeli army withdrew from the area, around late April or early May.”After being shown satellite images of the cemetery, the Israel Defense Forces said it had been forced to take defensive measures in the heat of battle.“At the relevant time, the area in question was an active combat zone,” an army spokesperson said. “During IDF operations in the area, terrorists attempted to attack IDF troops and took cover in structures close to the cemetery. In response, to ensure the safety of IDF troops operating on the ground, operational measures were taken in the area to neutralise identified threats.”The spokesperson added: “We emphasise that underground terrorist infrastructure was identified within the cemetery and in its surrounding area, which the IDF located and dismantled. IDF activity in sensitive areas is approved by senior ranks in the army and handled with the required sensitivity needed.”Plan of the cemeteryA spokesperson for the Royal British Legion said: “We are saddened to hear that graves of British and allied personnel who bravely served in the first and second world wars have been damaged. War graves honour the memory of every member of the armed forces who has made the ultimate sacrifice and deserve to be treated with the utmost respect.”Since a ceasefire agreement in October, Gaza has been split by a “yellow line” marking the boundary between Israeli and Hamas-controlled parts of the territory, which originally ran through the cemetery but has more recently been pushed westward by Israeli forces. Despite the official proclamation of a ceasefire, Israeli troops have continued to fire on the Palestinian population, particularly anyone approaching the yellow line. More than 500 Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire declaration, a quarter of whom have been children.The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which is responsible for the upkeep of the Gaza cemetery and many like it around the world, last commented on the state of the graveyard on 11 December.“As a result of the conflict the cemetery has suffered extensive damage to headstones, memorials, boundary walls, staff facilities and storage areas,” the CWGC said. It reported damage to a memorial to the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division of the British army, as well as to the Indian UN memorial and the Hindu, Muslim and Turkish sections.The satellite photos show the extent of the destruction to be even greater. There is no visible trace left of a plot just outside the main cemetery set aside for Canadian UN peacekeepers. Inside the main graveyard two whole sections of graves have been razed, of more than 100 allied soldiers killed in the second world war, the majority of them Australians, with a few British and Polish service personnel. Most had been stationed inPalestine, as it was then, with some serving in field hospitals in Gaza.Four sections of the dead from the first world war have also been flattened. CWGC records show the affected graves are almost all British, of soldiers drawn from regiments from across the UK, killed as British divisions wrested control of Palestine from Ottoman Turkish troops, suffering high casualties particularly in Gaza.Prof Peter Stanley, a military historian at the University of NSW Canberra, told the Guardian Australians had “not forgotten” their soldiers’ service in the Middle East.Have you been affected?If you think the grave of a family member might have been affected please share any details in the form below or by messaging us.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But for Australians, a serious consequence of this conflict is the desecration of the graves of Australian soldiers. That might not be major in the global scheme of things, but it is definitely something Australians should be concerned about.”Jaradah tended to the graves for 45 years: 35 as an assistant to his father, Ibrahim, and then 10 years in charge. He passed on the responsibility to his son before the start of the current conflict.“The cemetery was considered one of the most beautiful archaeological sites in Gaza. It contained diverse and beautiful trees and served as a living public space for the people of the Gaza Strip,” Jaradah said.“I feel a sorrow like that of a child who has lost his mother. Pain and bitterness grip my heart over the cemetery, just as deeply as the pain of losing my home entirely.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaFirst world warSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

However, until now there has been limited evidence of how it might affect the risk of all forms of stroke.The study, published in Neurology Open Access, a journal of the American Academy of Neurology, shows an association but does not prove the Mediterranean diet causes a lower risk of stroke.However, experts not involved with the research welcomed the findings, and said there was “huge potential” to reduce a person’s chances of experiencing a stroke. Globally, more than 15 million people experience a stroke every year. Of those, 5 million die and another 5 million are left permanently disabled.In the study led by researchers from the US and Greece, the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of stroke overall, as well as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.Ischemic stroke is caused when blood flow is blocked to part of the brain, and is the most common type of stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain.“Our findings support the mounting evidence that a healthy diet is critical to stroke prevention,” said study author Sophia Wang, of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Duarte, California. “We were especially interested to see that this finding applies to hemorrhagic stroke, as few large studies have looked at this type of stroke.”The study involved 105,614 women in California with an average age of 53 at the start of the study, who had no history of stroke.Participants were given a score of zero to nine based on how closely they followed the Mediterranean diet. They received points for consuming above the overall population average in specific categories – wholegrain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil and fish – and if they drank a moderate amount of alcohol.They also received points for consuming a below-average amount of red meat and dairy products. In total, 30% of participants had scores of six to nine, the highest group, and 13% had scores of zero to two, the lowest group.Participants were followed for an average of 21 years. After adjusting for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity and high blood pressure, those in the highest group were 18% less likely to have a stroke than those in the lowest group.They were also 16% less likely to have an ischemic stroke and 25% less likely to have a hemorrhagic stroke,according to the study.“Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, so it’s exciting to think that improving our diets could lessen our risk for this devastating disease,” said Wang. “Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to help us understand the mechanisms behind them so we could identify new ways to prevent stroke.”The study had limitations – it looked only at women, and participants reported their own diet data – but independent experts suggested the findings were significant.Nine out of 10 strokes were preventable, said Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association, a charity, so there was “huge potential” to reduce the chances of a person experiencing one.“It’s long been known that eating a Mediterranean diet can help to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke,” she said. “We welcome how this has now been shown to reduce the risk of total, ischemic, and haemorrhagic strokes.“Haemorrhagic strokes, while less frequent, are much more severe, so it’s reassuring that this study sheds light on this critical yet understudied subtype.”Explore more on these topicsHealthStrokenewsShareReuse this content"

So how was the teenager able to save the day, and is there any precedent for it?Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhat happened to Austin Appelbee’s family?Austin and his family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (124 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon.His mother, Joanne Appelbee, told him to swim ashore to seek help,telling the ABC: “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it.”Initially setting off in a kayak, Austin had to abandon the vessel after it took on too much water in the rough conditions. About two hours into his four-hour swim, he ditched the lifejacket he was wearing.“I was very puffed out but I couldn’t feel how tired I was,” he said.“I just keep swimming, I do breaststroke, I do freestyle, I do survival backstroke.”Once he had swum the 4km (2.49 miles) to shore in fading light, the teenager ran 2km (1.24 miles) to his family’s accommodation, using his mother’s phone to call emergency services at about 6pm.Map of WA“I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.”After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital. His family was rescued floating about 14km (8.7 miles) offshore. Austin was given crutches to help his sore legs bear his weight, the ABC reported.How did the 13-year-old swim and run that far?Prof David Bishop, a muscle exercise physiologist at Victoria University, said fight-or-flight situations can enable athletes – and ordinary people – “to go beyond what their perceived limits are”.There have been other reports of preternatural strength. In 2013, two teenage girls in Oregon reportedly lifted a1,360kg tractoroff their father’s chest; in 2016,another US teenagerwas said to have lifted a car to save her father, while a16-year-oldreportedly did the same for a neighbour in 2019.The phenomenon has sometimes been referred to as “hysterical strength”, though the origins of the term is unclear.Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’Read moreIn a1961 study, researchers found that people were immediately stronger at a forearm flexion task when frightened, after shooting a starting pistol next to participants’ ears without warning.Anthony Blazevich, a professor of biomechanics at Edith Cowan University, said the release of fight-or-flight hormones had an impact.“If you get highly motivated, if you have some fear, you’re going to be releasing adrenaline, noradrenaline, other stress hormones like cortisol, which dump a whole bunch of sugar into your blood,” he said.“These things really help you do somewhat brief activity, from seconds up to minutes or potentially even tens of minutes.”But for activities lasting hours – in the case of Austin’s swim – “eventually these systems do get depleted”, Blazevich said. The periods of recovery afforded by survival backstroke–a swimming style aimed at conserving energy–may have been critical, particularly in saltwater, where floating was relatively feasible.Some experts argue that endurance is an issue ofmind over matter. Prof Samuele Maria Marcora, an exercise scientist at the University of Bologna, has shownmental fatigue can impair physical performance, whileother researchhas found endurance performance is improved by using imagery, self-talk and goal setting.“I was just thinking in my head: I was going to make it through, but I was also thinking about all my friends,” Austin said of his swim. “I have to keep on going.”0:33Teenage boy’s 4km swim to shore to save family captured in aerial footage – videoBishop said: “[Austin] had a base of swimming fitness and physiology that allowed his strong mind to go beyond the limits”“It’s an amazing feat.”Was age a factor?Blazevich’s research has shown that children can perform as well as highly trained adult endurance athletes. In astudycomparing 10-year-old boys with 21-year-old men during high-intensity cycling, he found the children outperformed most adults.“What kids do is recover incredibly rapidly, as good as elite endurance athletes,” he said.However, adults have larger hearts and lungs, and central nervous systems that do “not seem to fatigue as fast”, he said.“This is probably why kids play on an intermittent basis … They run, stop, run, stop, but they do it all day,” Blazevich said.Austin told the ABC he had started swimming lessons when he was four – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without a break.Are there similar feats of survival at sea?Other incidents of unintended aquatic endurance have previously made headlines around the world.In 2013, South African manBrett Archibaldwas found after falling overboard a surf charter in the Indian Ocean and treading water for more than 28 hours.Austin’s remarkable swim has parallels with the story of the Syrian refugeeYusra Mardini, who as a teenager in 2015 swam for over three hours to reach the island of Lesbos – pulling with two others their migrant boat, after the dinghy began to take on water in the Aegean Sea.And in 2024, a Chinese woman was rescued80km off the Japanese coast, buoyed up by a rubber ring, after being swept out to sea and spending two nights in the ocean.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaSwimmingFitnessexplainersShareReuse this content"

Michael Jackson: The Trial isn’t as stylised nor as groundbreaking – many of the people here have been telling their stories for decades, be it in books, podcasts, blogs or otherwise. Yet where Channel 4’s latest series triumphs is in collating these accounts from both sides, and letting you decide what is more plausible, as well as spotlighting details that can’t easily be explained away. And, of course, there are the tapes: recordings of Jackson from 2000 and 2001, many of which have never been heard before. They’re not definitive proof of any wrongdoing, but they’re certainly alarming. In one clip, Jackson declares: “If you told me right now … ‘Michael, you could never see another child’ … I would kill myself.”Over four episodes, the series charts the events leading up to and surrounding Jackson’s 2005 trial, at which he was accused of molesting 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo (he was later found not guilty on all 10 counts). Many viewers will already be aware of that case, and of how Jackson’s admission during an interview with Martin Bashir that he allowed Arvizo to sleep in his bed, kickstarted a police investigation (Jackson had also previously been accused of sexual assault by another boy, Jordan Chandler, in 1993).View image in fullscreenLouise Palanker, a friend of the Arvizo family whose 13-year-old son, Gavin, was at the centre of the trial.Photograph: Channel 4They may be less aware of how deep the Arvizo family were in with Jackson, as shown in an unreleased video they made supporting him after the broadcast ofBashir’s documentary. We also see the seeming pain and confusion in the family’s faces – particularly Gavin’s – when the cameras stopped rolling. Christian Robinson, a videographer who worked with Jackson in the 00s, remembers thinking Arvizo’s mother, Janet, was “the type of person who might take money to say Michael Jackson molested my kid”. Elsewhere, Louise Palanker, a friend of the family, recalls a struggling mother who was divorcing her allegedly abusive husband and whose son, Gavin, was recovering from cancer. “What you’re seeing in Janet here, she just truly wants this all to be true,” says Palanker. “Because this is just a godsend, that there would be a male influence in her children’s lives who was kind and caring.”Even as they protested Jackson’s innocence, some of those around him clearly knew how it lookedWhether Robinson is correct is still under debate. But the ideas his opinions are built on aren’t unhelpful for abusers hiding in plain sight. People looked at Jackson, he says, “not just as a man, but as a god”. The Trial does well to find people who acknowledge the grey areas that abound here. They include Shmuley Boteach, a rabbi and former spiritual adviser to Jackson. He doesn’t believe Jackson abused children, but says his mouth was “agape” at the revelation of him sharing a bed with other people’s children. Even as they protest his innocence, some of those around him clearly know how it looked, and just how easily Occam’s Razor might be applied.As for the things that cannot be glossed over, these include what the police describe as “grooming materials” found at Neverland. Vincent Amen, a former publicist for Jackson, says he found a naturist magazine with videos of naked children circled (a copy of which is shown in the series). The psychological wound of his discovery, he says, “will always affect me”. His emotion is palpable, as is that of Ruby Wolff of the Santa Barbara sheriff’s office, who breaks down as she recalls the “intensity” of the case after all these years.The Trial leans hard on discussion of and archive footage from Leaving Neverland in its conclusion – perhaps to justify its own existence, or perhaps to salute that documentary for having the impact it did. Really, though, this series makes its own points, and makes them well. “I don’t know why I get so protective,” says Robinson towards the end, as he continues to defend his former employer, before turning the question back to the faceless interviewer, and – by extension – us at home. “Do you think he’s innocent, after everything you’ve seen?”Michael Jackson: The Trial is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichael JacksonreviewsShareReuse this content"

We hate to think about death, so we cordon it off from all recognisable signs of life – particularly warmth and comedy. Enter Butterflies Rising Funeral Care, the subject of new Channel 4 documentary The Fabulous Funeral Parlour, which is shaking things up.Our introduction to this funeral home, founded by Liverpudlian Hayley McCaughran, is seeing a casket with a gold plaque that reads “FUCK OFF”. McCaughran tells us that when making nameplates they always ask families whether the deceased had a favourite saying: “We don’t do it a traditional way.”Telling us the story of the funeral home itself, and following a few families’ experiences, The Fabulous Funeral Parlour tries to make us feel something new about the most universal experience there is. And it succeeds – there are numerous moments when I think: “How did they come up with that?” or laugh guiltily, wondering if something is inappropriate.With pillarbox red curls and full beat makeup, McCaughran potters around the spa-like funeral home chatting to the bodies. “Morning, sir. How are we today? Still looking good, aren’t we?” she says to one man, splashing him with aftershave before a family visit. “Your tea’s on the side,” she tells another deceased person as she slips out of the room. “Just because they’re asleep it doesn’t mean that they don’t deserve the same respect as you or I.”Of the families’ journeys with Butterflies Rising, the most live (quite literally) is Marion’s. She has just weeks to live, due to kidney failure, and wants to plan her own funeral to take the pressure off her young daughters. She reels off a list of things she wants for her last hurrah: a singer, a disco, a rave. You wonder how Marion keeps such a sense of humour at a time like this – she and her family joke that she’s a “real-life Barbie girl” – because she’s had an operation called an abdominoperineal resection “where they sew your bottom up”.View image in fullscreen‘Does a good job with the heavy lifting of conveying grief’ … The Fabulous Funeral Parlour on Channel 4.Photograph: Channel 4The parlour reminds us how important aesthetics are to so many of us in life. They take presentation very seriously – it’s not all blue eyeshadow and blush. Marion has come in with her makeup done so the funeral directors can see how she likes to present herself; the only thing she can’t do is cat’s-eye liquid eyeliner, but she’d like to have it at the funeral. McCaughran’s own glamour gives you the sense that Marion is in safe hands. In another instance, funeral co-director Neil Irons explains the importance of one client having his fleece zipped three-quarters of the way up.The documentary’s lightness and camp are punctuated with tears, and it does a good job with the heavy lifting of conveying grief. McCaughran has her own reasons for coming to this work: her mother died of cancer at the age of 59. At the time McCaughran was a botox and filler technician and felt it was too late to retrain as a doctor or nurse. Instead she went into the funeral business. She claims she never properly grieved, which certainly comes up when she cries with Marion’s daughters: “It’s your mum – you only get one of them.”Bauhaus urns and Scrabble-themed coffins: UK embraces new funeral trendsRead moreOne family is grappling with intense shock after the death of Margie, who was found dead in her home. She had struggled repeatedly to get sober from alcohol and died during a final relapse. Her daughter Mel never got to say goodbye, and we watch her go round and round in the recognisable circles in which grief tends to take you: “It’s not real; it can’t be real.” In another kind of documentary, these moments could easily feel voyeuristic or hammy – but Mel and all the families who appear are given the space for both vulnerability and dignity.The Fabulous Funeral Parlour feels very Liverpudlian in the wit, strength and glam of its subjects. However, Liverpool and the cultural context that has produced such a unique business are rarely mentioned. Perhaps film director Lydia Noakes was cautious about how the city’s residents tend to get portrayed in the media, wanting to avoid cliches about Liverpudlian fashion or resilience. Or maybe she just felt that this story worked best on the level of human experience. But I want to know more about why Butterflies Rising came about where it did, whether it’s one of a kind and how it exists in relation to broader trends in the funeral industry.Regardless of the answers to these questions, I am left with the surprising thought that I wouldn’t mind going somewhere like Butterflies Rising myself. We close out with McCaughran at her mum’s grave, marking the fifth anniversary of her death: “1,827 days since I heard your beautiful, unique voice.” She’s drinking a tin of Strongbow Dark Fruit on a patio chair. This moment perfectly captures the spirit of the taboo-busting Fabulous Funeral Parlour. If it’s not inappropriate in life, why should it be in death?The Fabulous Funeral Parlour is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDeath and dyingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some huts sit along the popular Milford and Routeburn tracks, others are perched in remote valleys in the wilderness, with views ranging from snowy peaks to flourishing bush.But the publicly owned network is too vast for the government to maintain, so ordinary people in New Zealand are filling their backpacks with cleaning supplies and hiking into the hills to clean and maintain the huts.Among them is Suzie Bell, who moved from the UK to New Zealand in 2010. She soon discovered “tramping” – or hiking – and recalls her amazement at coming across the huts for the first time.“The fact that there are these epic huts in the middle of nowhere that you can go and stay in for next to nothing, I was just blown away,” she says.Most of the huts are accessible only on foot. Trampers carry in food, and take out their rubbish. The smaller huts, with four or fewer bunk beds, are free to use.“I love the honesty box payment system in huts, the fact that everyone clears up after themselves and the total strangers that you meet, have dinner, play cards with and chat to,” Bell says.Bell wanted to give something back and joined the “Love our Huts” cleaning campaign with her family.Theinitiative was started by New Zealand outdoor recreation advocacy group Federated Mountain Club (FMC). More than 300 people have signed up for the campaign, FMC says.“People really value our huts, they’re part of our cultural heritage, and we want them to last for ever,” FMC executive committee member and keen tramper Liz Wightwick says. “This campaign shows people are prepared to care for their huts.”View image in fullscreenThe Clark family spruces up the Horseshoe Flat Hut.Photograph: Jo ClarkThere are more than 950 huts across New Zealand. The first huts, built in the late 1800s, were used for gold mining, surveying and mustering. Later, they were used for conservation purposes, as shelters for deer hunters and forestry workers. The huts were brought under one national network in the late 1980s, managed by the Department of Conservation.So far this summer, more than 500 huts have been spruced up by volunteers. Loaded with rubber gloves, a newspaper to wipe windows, and dissolvable sachets of cleaning products, psychologist Jo Clark and her two daughters hiked for five hours to help clean Clark Hut in Fiordland national park.View image in fullscreenThe hike in to clean Horseshoe Flat Hut.Photograph: Jo ClarkFreda Clark, 13, says she and her sister Ada, 11, wiped down mattresses, cleaned windows and pulled out surrounding weeds. “The huts don’t really get cleaned unless people like us do it.”Sustaining the hut network is challenging due to its size, remoteness and the threat of severe weather, says the conservation department’s acting director of heritage and visitors, Eamonn Whitham.“We could not maintain our network without the enthusiastic New Zealanders giving their energy and labour to keep our special, much-loved huts and tracks safe and maintained.”View image in fullscreenLiam, 5, and James Bell, 7, wipe down mattresses at the A-Frame Hut.Photograph: Susie BellMany huts are isolated and visited only a few times a year, likeTop Otoroh Bivvy, which Wightwick cleaned after an eight-hour hike up into the Kelly Ranges. For some helpers, like Bell, the initiative is about more than hut maintenance; it’s time carved out to reconnect with her family.Reaching A-Frame Hut, in the Hakatere Conservation Park, after four hours of tramping through rolling tussock hills – an ambitious feat for little legs – Bell and her children, Liam, five, and James, seven, got to tidying.“I’m always trying to teach the kids to leave things better than you find them, and do something nice for the next person.”Bell says it reflects the Māori concept of kaitiakitanga, where, as guardians of the environment, we must protect it for future generations.“Many horrendous things are going on around the world, and it feels overwhelming. But I’m a big believer in finding stuff you can fix within your circle of control,” she says. “Like we can take care of the huts in our backyard.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The singercanceled the US portion of his tour last yearout of fear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would target his fans.There has been a frenzy online of people posting about Bad Bunny lyrics, including Puerto Ricans explaining slang used by the singer and non-Spanish speakers documenting their journey to learn Spanish.Anticipation forhis half-time performancehas only intensified since last weekend, when his album Debí Tirar Más Fotos became the first Spanish-language album to win the Grammy for album of the year. He did not shy away from addressing targeted federal immigration operations at the awards.Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big in Grammys ceremony filled with anti-ICE sentimentRead more“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said in English after winning his first Grammy for música urbana album. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”‘Like a form of protest’Niklaus Miller, 29, has been buckling down on learning Bad Bunny lyrics since the singer’s SNL appearance months ago.“I am delusional enough to be like ‘this would be easy. I could pick it up pretty quickly,’” Miller said.The fervor to learn a new language within a short time span highlights the powerful impact of Latino culture in the US despite the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions.“It felt like a form of protest,” Miller said. “What can I do right now besides what everyone is doing that is trying to help? It just feels good.”Miller said he has got messages from people who watch his videos with their parents since he started posting about the process of learning Spanish. They say they feel seen and appreciated.While Miller has not learned Bad Bunny’s entire discography, he has learned portions of six songs that he feels will be part of the half-time show, including Tití Me Preguntó, DtMF and Baile Inolvidable.The day after Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act, O’Neil Thomas, 28, a New York City actor and content creator, started learning the singer’s catalog.“I was just so excited because he wasn’t an artist that I expected,” Thomas said. “And given how we are right now with the state of the country I think he is the perfect person to headline such a humongous stage.”The response to his TikTok videos – showing Thomas learning NUEVAYoL and other tracks – have been really positive, Thomas added. Many Puerto Rican people have reached out, saying they are proud that someone outside the community is attempting to learn about their culture.Latin culture intensifies interest in Spanish“People were already starting to make the effort with learning Spanish as a result of their interest in Latin music,” said Vanessa Díaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University. “The Super Bowl itself is an additional push for a trend that was already happening.”Díaz, who is the co-author of P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance, says the rise of Latin music over the past decade has pushed non-Spanish speakers to learn the language. Bad Bunny’s clear messaging in his lyrics, videos and performances amplifies that interest, Díaz said.Spanish is the most spoken language at home behind English in the US – except in three states, according to US census data. More than 13% of residents age five and older speak it.View image in fullscreenNiklaus Miller has been learning Bad Bunny lyrics since the singer’s SNL appearance.Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/APBut Bad Bunny’s booking at the Super Bowl has been divisive from the start.Trump called the selection “ridiculous.”Conservatives have called it anti-American – even though native-born Puerto Ricans are also US citizens. Turning Point USA is putting on analternative “All-American Halftime Show”with a lineup led by Kid Rock.This all comes against the backdrop of Latinos and Spanish-speaking communities being targeted in Trump’s immigration crackdowns. His executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.Díaz doesn’t think his performance will necessarily shift how Latinos are perceived in the US but she says it will create an interesting conversation depending on “how people are going to grapple with the magnitude of having someone like Bad Bunny on the stage.”At a time when “the US is targeting Latinos and migrants and Spanish speakers or even those who are just perceived to be any of those things in a way that we haven’t seen in our lifetimes”, his visibility is powerful, Diaz said.For Thomas, Bad Bunny’s music offered the perfect opportunity to take on the challenge of learning a new language.Donald Trump will not attend Super Bowl because it’s ‘too far away’Read more“I love Spanish and I always wanted to learn it,” Thomas said. “So, this has been a fun introduction for me to finally hone in.”Both Miller and Thomas said that learning Spanish, specifically Puerto Rican Spanish, in a short period of time has been a unique challenge.Thomas said listening to Bad Bunny’s music casually is a different experience than learning the lyrics.“Listening to his music is really fun,” Thomas said. “The amount of times I’ve pressed rewind just to get a phrase, I can’t even count.”Miller said the hard part about learning the songs is that the Puerto Rican dialect tends to chop some words and it is very fast. Miller said if he hasn’t worked on understanding a song for days, he might forget the pronunciation and it’s hard to come back to it.“It’s fun but then stressful because I am a type-A person, so that’s been hard, honestly,” Miller said. “I’m firing on all cylinders.”Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyPuerto RiconewsShareReuse this content"

But can the star now go where Beyoncé and Harry Styles stumbled – and smash the silver screen?Simran HansWed 4 Feb 2026 11.53 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 12.49 ESTShareIn the back of a cab, Charli xcx drags a makeup wipe across her face. A closeup of that face, with its distinctive halo of dark hair, the lipstick-smeared pout and lush, overgrown eyebrows, is perhaps the most striking scene in her new filmThe Moment. Charli peels a strip of ugly stick-on gems from her lower lash line, regret and shame flashing across her face. It’s a rare raw few seconds in Aidan Zamiri’s clever and knowing satire of 21st-century pop stardom, which wonders what would have happened if the singer had lost her head after the success of her 2024 album Brat. The film is billed as a mockumentary, but its ambitionto be taken seriously is no joke.The Moment is already being positioned as Charli’s pivot from pop to the silver screen, after a buzzy premiere at the Sundance film festival last month. Charli was there to promote it, alongside two other films she’s starring in. I Want Your Sex, a dark romp of a comedy from new queer cinema pioneerGregg Arakiwas mostly warmly received, though early consensus has declared The Gallerist, which stars Natalie Portman,something of a dud.The real Charli probably wouldn't let a guy in prayer beads direct a documentary about herWhen Peter Ohs’sindie drama Erupcjapremiered at the Toronto film festival last year, the New Yorker praised the “classical canniness” of Charli’s onscreen presence, singling out her “energetic yet poised performance” as emotionally avoidant party girl Bethany. She has a small but significant role in this week’s new release100 Nights of Hero, Julia Jackman’s charming feminist fairytale, and will also appear on the soundtrack for Emerald Fennell’s adaptation ofWuthering Heights. According to IMDb, Charli the actor has roles in nine feature films and counting (other forthcoming ones include Dakota Johnson’s directorial debutA Tree Is Blue, and a remake of the 1978 mondo shockerFaces of Death). Why is she suddenly in everything, everywhere, apparently all at once?Other pop musicians intrigued by Hollywood tend to begin by dipping a toe in the water. A bit part in Christopher Nolan’s 2017 second world war drama Dunkirk proved Harry Styles could be compelling in closeup, but did not provide the training necessary for carrying a feature-length film. When he appeared in leading roles in two movies in 2022,Don’t Worry DarlingandMy Policeman, there was a sense of the singer breaking into a sprint before he had learned to walk. His performance in the former is particularly vacant and one-dimensional and his acting career seems to have since petered out.Charli’s approach to film may seem maximalist by comparison but, really, she’s starting small. As a pop star she commands the stage with main character energy, but on screen, at least so far, she seems quite happy in a supporting role. Her parts in The Gallerist, as the girlfriend of an art influencer, and as Mother Nature in Romain Gavras’s celebrity satire Sacrifice have been described as cameos. She is not top billed in I Want Your Sex either, although early reviews have praised her for playing against type – she stars as the prudish girlfriend of a young man drawn into an affair with a kinky performance artist twice his age.View image in fullscreenEffortlessly selling it … from left: Olivia D’Lima, Charli xcx and Kerena Jagpal in 100 Nights of Hero.Photograph: Vue Lumiere/PA100 Nights of Hero is set in a medieval fantasy world operating under strict patriarchal rule. Charli’s scenes are confined to a story within a story. As Rosa, she comes across as cute; unselfconscious, stripped of her usual vampy makeup and projecting a purity of spirit before she has even said a word. There is an unexpected softness to Rosa’s gestures, as when she runs a brush through her sister’s hair or lays her head on her father’s chest. A smiling storybook heroine forced to pretend she doesn’t know how to read is a million miles from Charli’s scowling, stomping, cigarette-smoking persona. But she sells it effortlessly.The Moment, in which she has her first proper leading role, takes that all-powerful pop persona and gamely attempts to skewer it. She takes the piss out of her hair, her brand deals and even her old songs. She is the star but also the butt of the joke. The actual Charli probably wouldn’t be talked into letting a guy who wears prayer beads direct her concert documentary because Kylie Jenner said it was a good idea.A hilarious (if not quite plausible) plotline featuring an ill-advised branded credit card is an example of the script’s typically tongue-in-cheek tone, but Charli’s performance as an artist under pressure is nuanced. At an event to promote the credit card, a fan enthusiastically tells Charli her music stopped him from killing himself. Charli looks stressed and caught off-guard, playing her reaction for real instead of for an easy laugh.View image in fullscreenCameo ... from left: Jenna Ortega, Natalie Portman, Cathy Yan and Charli xcx at The Gallerist premiere.Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty ImagesHer ability to manipulate her face is one of her greatest gifts as an actor. In Benito Skinner’s TV comedyOvercompensating, she mines it for comedy. Deadpan micro eye-rolls and an insincere close-mouthed smile are deployed as she plays a parody version of herself who begrudgingly performs at a college concert. “ARE YOU JO-KING?” she shouts at her hapless tour manager, exaggerating her vocal fry to brilliantly droll effect. During the concert, closeted college student Benny imagines a gleeful Charli leading the crowd in a humiliating chant. “Benny. Likes. Boys!” she yells, her eyes widening like a crazed and goofy demon.If these roles don’t necessarily showcase a huge range, they do reveal her canniness. So far, Charli has been drawn to independent films that are playful and in line with her tastes, and to directors with a strong point of view. A lot of musicians turned actors go wrong by assuming their charisma will automatically translate to a different medium, and shooting straight for “prestige” movies. Beyoncé’s stiff turns inDreamgirlsandCadillac Recordsare two classic examples of a star who exudes charm but hasn’t quite honed her on-screen craft.The right roles are as important as the right collaborators. In A Star is Born, Lady Gaga ascends from club singer to arena headliner, a story that dovetails satisfyingly with her own. In the trashyHouse of Gucci, she is somehow still plausible, though she couldn’t quite transcend the dourJoker: Folie à Deux. Elsewhere, Ariana Grande was a perfect fit for the peppy but fragile Glinda inWicked, and Tyler, the Creator’s natural exuberance was harnessed brilliantly by Josh Safdie inMarty Supreme. The musicians who are having success in the film world are the ones who seem as if they actually watch movies. Just look at A$AP Rocky, who recently gave two great performances in Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest and in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, the new film from Safdie brothers collaborator Mary Bronstein.View image in fullscreenAvoidant party girl ... in Erupcja, one of the films Charli is starring in.Photograph: Courtesy of TIFFCharli’s taste is her secret weapon. The singer’s love of movies has been well documented onher Letterboxd account, which went viral for its eclectic, cine-literate watchlist (Jacques Rivette’s fabulously surrealCeline and Julie Go Boatingremains in her top four films). In an interview on the Deeper Into Movies podcast, she told the host that watching films “is all I do, if I’m not partying or working”. Still, it’s one thing to be a fan of movies and another to make them.“I always prefer when the initial spark is coming from me and my fellow collaborators rather than … outsourcing,” Charli told Variety when asked how she chooses her roles. In 2014, Charli cast Rose McGowan, star of Araki’s The Doom Generation, in the music video forBreak the Rules, so it feels like a full-circle moment to see Charli landing a part in an Araki film.Many of the films she has lined up seem to have come directly via her social circle rather than from the brain of a clever casting director who knows her presence will generate buzz. Charli met Ohs through their mutual friend, the playwright Jeremy O Harris. Zamiri had directed several of Charli’s music videos before they decided to make The Moment together, and Skinner said he initially connected with her at a party.View image in fullscreenNext stop on the route to screen domination … Charli, far right, with the stars of the film at the Wuthering Heights premiere.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesInSacrifice, which received lukewarm reviews after its Toronto film festival premiere, she has a self-declared “tiny part” alongside her “baby brother”, the Swedish rapper Yung Lean. These smaller, low-stakes acting roles seem to be more about her having fun with her friends than shoring up her standing in Hollywood. My sense is that this attitude will take her far.The next stop on Charli’s route to screen domination is Fennell’sWuthering Heights. The divisive director of Promising Young Woman and Saltburn blends twisted humour with blunt, girl-boss feminism. Her glossy studio adaptation of the beloved Emily Brontë novel doesn’t, at least to my mind, seem like an obvious fit for Charli, but attaching herself to the project via its soundtrack makes sense. It allows Charli to flirt with Brontë’s brooding gothic aesthetic (and to ride the coattails of the film’s hype), while remaining safely adjacent to its director. The deft, even genius move suggests that Charli the movie star may turn out to be an auteur, rather than a vessel.The Moment is released in UK cinemas on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmCharli xcxWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellGregg ArakiMusic documentaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have. I went to watch it on Friday morning. The idea was to interview other people watching the movie: to get a sense of why they wanted to see it, how they felt about Melania, how weird they were, etc.It didn’t really work that well in the end, because most of the crowd at the AMC in midtown Manhattan were journalists trying to do the exact same thing as me. As far as I could tell, three non-reporters attended our showing. Of the two who agreed to talk to me, one was there because he had a monthly movie theater pass, and the other was a man who, without wanting to be too unkind,had a very low bar for compelling drama. (“I think it’s interesting just to kind of see, you know, how her life really is, at least to some extent,” this person told me.)Notwithstanding my sparsely attended screening and photos of empty theaters on social media, a surprising number of other people watched the film. Melania earned $7m over its opening weekend. (Amazon spent $75m making and promoting the film.)Melania also managed to record those numbers despite being demonstrably bad. Like, really rubbish.Regrettably for the subject of a documentary,Melania Trumpis not an interesting person. There are no real insights to take away from the movie because she doesn’t seem to do anything. In a scripted voiceover which rears up throughout the movie, Melania describes herself as “a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend”, but based on the evidence of her film, she has no friends. She moves from one stilted, awkward conversation with her staff to another, all parties seeming uncomfortable with each other as they discuss how tightly a scarf should fit and whether a hat is big enough.There is little to be seen of Donald Trump in the movie, although in one of the few compelling scenes, we hear him on the phone to Melania, talking to his wife like he talks to Fox News, all “big” numbers and “record” wins. Unlike Fox News hosts, Melania gives her husband short shrift, umming and ah-ing her way through the call before essentially hanging up.Ahead of its release, Donald Trump described the movie as“unforgettable”and“a must watch”– two easily debunked claims – but the president having poor taste in movies is hardly surprising, given his approach to the arts mostly seems to involve shutting them down.View image in fullscreenDonald and Melania Trump at the Melania film premiere in Washington DC on 29 January 2026 at the Kennedy Center.Photograph: Laura Thompson/ShutterstockThe White House held the premiere for Melania at the Kennedy Center on Thursday. Rather than being a who’s who, the guestlist wasa veritable “Who Is That?”, with invitees including Pete Anthony Sciarrino III (described in news reports as a “social media magician”), a slew of Florida-based socialites, and reality TV stars turned convicted fraudsters Todd and Julie Chrisley (Trumppardonedthe pair last year).Also bumping up the numbers at the premiere: almost all of Trump’s cabinet, presumably attending because they were really keen to watch a 1 hour and 48 minute movie about how their boss’s wife unsettles almost everyone she encounters, rather than attending out of obligation.For all Trump’s love of the movie – he claims to have watched it twice – it doesn’t seem to have altered his slash-and-burn approach to arts patronage and funding. Three days after the screening, heannouncedthat he would close down the Kennedy Center for two years, in order to bring it to the “highest level of success, beauty, and grandeur”, which presumably means adding gold leaf and putting his name on the front.Curiously, Trump’s announcement came after many performers cancelled planned shows in response to the president’s government and his takeover of the Kennedy Center – which saw it rebranded the Trump-Kennedy Center and led toticket sales plunging.If that move seems to have been born out of a fit of pique, perhaps it shouldn’t have come as a surprise, given Trump has assailed the arts since taking office.He hascanceled more than 1,000grants to arts groups while cutting funding to some museums and attempting toreshape the tone of others. He has sued television networks, and tried to get themto cancelthe shows of hosts such as Jimmy Kimmel, a critic of the Trump administration. Just this week, Trumpclaimedhe would sue Trevor Noah after the comedian made a joke about the president at the Grammys.Architecture hasn’t escaped the president either: he has bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a big ballroom, prompting preservationists to sue out of concern the new structure could clash with the original building. Inside the White House, Trump has slathered the Oval Office with gold, while down the road he is hoping to builda gigantic arch.Is it any surprise that in a movie that’s as bland as one of Trump’s well-done steaks, as insipid as one of his soliloquies abouthow he washes his hair, the president has finally found a piece of art he doesn’t want to destroy?Explore more on these topicsUS newsThis Week in TrumplandUS politicsMelaniaMelania TrumpnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The one on the minds of practically every person in the country. No need for anything tricksy. No try-hard rhetorical flourishes. Just keep it simple. Play it straight.And in an unusually unshouty prime minister’s questions – always a sign that MPs realise there is something important at stake – Kemi Badenoch did just that. Told it as it was. Channelled the nation’s anger.She focused on just one fact: that Keir Starmer, the intelligence services and just about everyone else knew that Peter Mandelson was still mates withJeffrey Epsteinlong after the financier had been convicted of child prostitution.The looks on the faces of the entireLabourfrontbench said it all. They may have all long ago deleted their social media posts from last year calling Mandy an inspired Washington appointment, but their consciences weren’t so easily cleared. They all had the air of quiet desperation. People whose memories had come back to haunt them like a curse. They stared into the middle distance, trying not to catch anyone’s eye. Anything to get through the next half hour.Starmer had nothing. Just a jumble of excuses. Mandelson had lied about the depth and extent of his relationship with Epstein. Well, maybe he had but that’s hardly the point.You knew he had been hanging out with himlong after his conviction and you weren’t bothered.The vetting process had been totally rigorous. Pull the other one. What had it consisted of? The cabinet secretary asking Petey if he had ever really liked Epstein and Mandy saying no, he had always hated him? Was that it? Keir tried throwing a bit of red meat. He had removed Mandelson as privy councillor. Far too late. The whole country had priced that in on Monday.This one was on Keir and Keir alone. It was his judgment on the line. And his judgment that was found wanting. Starmer might think it unfair. Last year almost no one – least of all the Tories – had raised any questions about Mandelson’s links to Epstein. Michael Gove had even described it as a brilliant appointment.Now there was a pile on. Keir had reckoned that with an amoral slimeball in the White House there was something to be said for having an amoral slimeball as ambassador. A meeting of minds. Peter would have been happy telling Donald Trump how marvellous he was for years. But this had blown up in Starmer’s face.There has always been a disconnect between the Labour establishment’s relationship with Mandelson and that with the rest of us. Peter has been idolised and indulged by Labour for decades. As if he was some kind of svengali with special powers. Gordon Brown may feel betrayed but he was the one who made him a lord and brought him back into cabinet after he’d already been sacked twice by Tony Blair. Some of this is on you, Gordon.The establishment was charmed by Mandy, inviting him into their dining rooms. Offering him sinecures and baubles. As for the rest of the country? We could all see what everyone else had missed. From the start, we knew he was untrustworthy. A wrong ’un. And we were right.Kemi kept at it. There again, the Tories have more experience than most in appointing shady characters. They were the ones who gave us Boris Johnson. A man who never knowingly recognised the truth. Kemi moved on to thehumble addressthat would follow PMQs, in which she hoped to get the government to reveal as much information on Mandelson’s vetting process and his six months in Washington.Keir tried to fight back. He would hand over some documents. But not ones that related to security matters or might damage relations with the US or other countries. Given the nature of Mandy’s job, you could see only dross ending up in parliament’s hands.It took Ed Davey to make the most telling moral point. Had, at any time during the Mandelson saga, any consideration been given to Epstein’s victims? The silence was telling. The victims had been nowhere in this. All that had mattered was what was in the best interests of HM Government. Everything else had just been for show. The Lib Dem leader also observed that the Poles believed Epstein had been working for Vladimir Putin. In which case, so had Mandelson … Starmer didn’t dare go anywhere near that.Once PMQs had been wrapped up, the Commons began its debate on the humble address that was extended from 4pm to 7pm. Partly because many MPs wanted to speak, partly to allow the government to reach a point of compromise. Because this wasn’t a debate between the government and opposition. It was one between absolutely everyone in the chamber and Nick Thomas-Symonds, paymaster general, who had drawn the short straw of answering for the government.The shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Alex Burghart, could scarcely believe his eyes. He had expected resistance, not some kind of love-in with Labour backbenchers. But Labour MPs have just about had enough of a leadership with a seemingly unerring instinct for the wrong move. They could sense the mood of the nation. Anything that had even the look of a government cover-up was out of the question. Now was the time for complete transparency. Not just to save Labour, but to save their souls.Even so,there was an edge of genuine jeopardy– borderline menace – in the interventions of Angela Rayner, Meg Hillier and Clive Efford. Refer all sensitive Mandelson documents to the intelligence and security committee rather than get the cabinet secretary to mark his own homework or you’ve got a major rebellion. And, by the way, once we’ve finished looking at the prime minister’s judgment on Mandy we might start to look at his judgment on other areas. Understand?Thomas-Symonds looked like he had got the message. Another government climbdown was imminent.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonThe politics sketchLabourHouse of CommonsKeir StarmerJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

Welsh and Croatian, by contrast, are never caught short when something fragrant gets right up your noseWed 4 Feb 2026 11.16 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 13.54 ESTShareIremember the first time I remembered a smell. This was remembering to the extent that it stopped me in my tracks, taking me back to a specific moment, a specific place and a specific feeling. The smell was that of a bike shop. Mainly rubber, with notes of oil and plastic and a strong hint of sheer excitement. In that instant I was about 10 years old, in Bache Brothers Cycles at Lye Cross, near Stourbridge, in the West Midlands. My grandad was next to me, with the shop man. I was getting a bike for my birthday.When I was talking about the power of smell on the radio, Speth, a Welsh speaker from Manchester, got in touch to say that in Welsh you can hear a smell as well as smell it. At first this sounded charming, if far-fetched. But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. While I can’t – in English, anyway – exactly hear the smell of that Black Country bike shop in 1977, I can smell, hear and see it very clearly. I can feel it too. I can feel the shop man’s grip as he lifts me into the saddle. And I can hear him saying to my grandad: “Blimey, he’s a lump, isn’t he?” Ever sensitive about my weight, that was a sour note. But I’ll let it pass, because all I can feel, then and now, is the general joy.As my wisest Welsh friends have explained it to me, the verb in question,clywed, means to feel or to sense, as in sensing/feeling the smell or the sound of something. And also occasionally its touch or taste. So, every sense but sight. If sight was included, it would work perfectly for me in that bike shop, because I can see it all in HD.I wonder if our language might be a bit short in the smell department. We lack a verb to express smelling something nice. We have plenty to suggest the opposite – it stinks, it pongs, it reeks etc – but nothing to imply that the smell is nice. For me, the verb to smell feels at best neutral but erring towards the stinkier side of life.View image in fullscreenSmelling is believing …Photograph: Posed by model; Klaus Vedfelt/Getty ImagesHaving Croatian heritage, I am proud to say that we have the verbmirišitithat you’d only use in the context of a pleasant smell. Its opposing partner issmrditi,which you can’t even say out loud without wrinkling your nose. These two verbs allow for one of my favourite expressions in Croatian which, frustratingly, doesn’t really work in English. If – a mite unkindly – you’re describing a person as OK, not good or bad, neither one thing nor another, a bit vanilla, you’d sayni miriši ni smrdi. This translates into English no better than: “It neither smells nor stinks.” Doesn’t work. Our smell lets us down, so to speak.A listener who had lost their sense of smell 30 years ago was quite sure they could still smell cut grass, melting butter, and bacon cookingVanilla, by the way, like lavender, is a scent that reliably elicits strong emotional responses from prisoners. I learned this from Michael O’Shaugnessy, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, who has run workshops in prisons using scent to engage learners with the aim of nurturing creative skills. Vanilla and lavender work well because they are, or were, found in soaps and perfumes evoking powerful memories of grandmothers’ bathrooms.I had an eye-opening experience in the queue for a pub toilet | Adrian ChilesRead moreOn that radio show, I asked whether you can smell a smell without physically smelling it. A listener who had lost their sense of smell 30 years ago was quite sure that they could still smell cut grass, melting butter, and bacon cooking. Other listeners’ texts streamed in: privet blossom for ever evoking a holiday a lifetime ago in Weymouth when Sue was five, playing on a putting green surrounded by hedges; for June, it was the smell of the canal in West Bromwich on a hot summer’s day; with wonderful specificity, Chaz can summon the smell of an 80s snooker hall – featuring stale smoke, cheap cleaning fluids, freshly ironed baize.I love all this. Bache Brothers Cycles, to my delight, is still there. I’m going to pop in this weekend for the first time since 1977 to check whether it smells as I remember it.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionHealth & wellbeingBiologyPsychologyLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

A mere 25 years after Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beechammergedto form GSK, the share price on Wednesday got back to where the combo started life – a shade over £20. It has been a very long wait.A quarter of a century ago, the bosses of the day spoke about creating a “Microsoft of the pharmaceutical world” that would develop new medicines in never-seen-before quantities at faster speeds. A vast new head office in west London was opened by Tony Blair in 2002 to mirror the ambition. By then, however, the share price had already halved as investors twigged that, for all the fanfare, the mega-mergerwas really about bulking up defensively. The first decade was a blur of expiring patents, clashing egos, quarrels over executive pay and yet more promises of jam tomorrow.The second decade was marginally better but, from about 2013,GSKwas wholly eclipsed by AstraZeneca, which became the real model of a modern science-led pharma operation under Sir Pascal Soriot (still in post today). AZ hit its revenue targets every time and added a growth-enhancing injection of promising drugs from buzzy biotech firms. These days, AstraZeneca’s stock market value is more than twice that of GSK’s, an outcome nobody would have predicted at the turn of the century.The legacy of GSK’s years of underperformance is deep suspicion of every financial promise the company makes. Investors have witnessed too many false dawns. Yet something else is also happening. There is a growing sense that a humbler GSK is closer – finally – to fulfilling its potential. It is why the share price had accelerated from £14 a year ago before Wednesday’s 7% jump to £20.80.Emma Walmsley,who departed as chief executiveat the end of last year, gets credit for ending the indecision over the consumer goods division –she demerged it as Haleonin 2022. In her eight years or so, she also bit the bullet by cutting an unsustainable dividend, recognising that the only route to salvation for a mis-firing pharma company is to spend more on research and development to improve the pipeline of new medicines and vaccines. Walmsley was unlucky to run into US litigationover a heartburn drug from the 1990s, but she signalled confidence by setting a long-term target for revenues that was beyond City forecasts: £40bn-plus by 2031.View image in fullscreenThe 2025 financial results was Luke Miels’s first big outing as the new chief executive of GSK.Photograph: GSK/ReutersSince she wasn’t going to be in post that long, a big open question was whether successor Luke Miels would share the confidence down to the precise billion. After all, the size of GSK’s credibility deficit is the fact that most of the sector analysts think £35bn is more realistic because a big-selling HIV drug will lose its patent on the way.Miels’s first big outing – GSK’s financial figures for 2025 – was therefore an opportunity for him to hedge or qualify if he wished. Well, he didn’t. He expressed full confidence in the big number and in GSK’s strategy – as one would hope, given that he has been the chief commercial officer since 2017. For good measure, though, he did a passable impression of his old mentor from his AZ days, Soriot, in giving a sermon on “scientific courage”, backing your best bets sooner, being agile and generally showing more market nous.Rah-rah words merely create good initial vibes, of course. But, since outsiders’ real visibility into the quality of research effort is virtually nil, full-throated bullishness from the new boss was the most shareholders could expect at this stage. Miels, like everybody else, knows the corporate history and the perils of overpromising. It’s still early days because pharma is the ultimate long-term business. But GSK, take two, is clearly sounding healthier.Explore more on these topicsGSKNils Pratley on financePharmaceuticals industryAnnual resultscommentShareReuse this content"

The 1997 Labour and Conservative manifestos both included pledges to connect schools to something they called “the information superhighway”.That metaphor soon fell out of use, unmourned, although it contains an interesting policy implication. Roads need rules to prevent accidents. Superhighways do not sound like the kind of places where children should play.The comparison falls short because the hazards in a flow of information traffic are harder to define than reckless driving. Legal restrictions on what can be published online are a more contentious constraint on freedom than speed bumps and breathalyser tests.Every society recognises that words and images, in certain contexts, do harm and that incitement to commit crime can be a criminal act. There is a spectrum of tolerance and enforcement. Repression of free speech is a symptom of tyranny, but all governments regulate it to some degree.The threshold for intervention is lower when children are involved. That is why the idea of banning under-16s from social media, alreadyoperational in Australia, is catching on elsewhere. Spain this week announced it would do the same. The French parliamentvoted for a banlast week. The UK government isconsidering one.Even Kemi Badenoch, a self-styled crusader for freedom of expression,suspends her routine horrorat state interference when it comes to shielding malleable young minds from “violence, pornography and extremist content”. Such material is “optimised to capture attention and maximise engagement”. The result is “rising anxiety, poor sleep [and] reduced concentration”.The Conservative leader doesn’t think those effects are harmful to over-16s. Quite the opposite. She argues that keeping young people away from social media would mean “more freedoms to adults online”. There would be no need for infantilising moderation. Let the kids play outside while the grownups imbibe as much sex, violence and fanaticism as their anxious, sleep-deprived brains can take.Badenoch reasons herself into this muddle by conflating content, volume and rate of consumption. It is not controversial to want to protect children from hardcore pornography. In analogue times it was assumed there would also be limits for adults. The new element identified by the Tory leader, although she doesn’t pursue the thought, is unconscious manipulation and short-circuiting of critical faculties. The digital delivery apparatus – the combination of phones, apps and algorithms – turns us into compulsive consumers.There is a political dimension to this phenomenon that is subtly but crucially different from the discussion of whether to ban what, before there was an information superhighway, used to be called “video nasties”.Lurid images are more compelling than reasoned arguments. Aroused emotions drive engagement. The most shocking sight is the most shareable content. Outrage is addictive. By that mechanism, social-media platforms resemble engines of radicalisation, accelerating any opinion towards its most extreme iteration, shrinking the pool of agreed facts, atrophying a society’s capacity to empathise with alternative perspectives.That disruption to the democratic operating system isn’t addressed by arguments about free speech. Free speech is the lens that tech companies apply because it gives a democratic inflection to their commercial interests as oligopolists in an under-regulated digital realm. Far-right politicians adopt that frame because they are in the business of undermining the norms and institutions of liberal democracy. That agenda is well served by communications infrastructure that privileges frenzied intolerance.Hatred promoted as heroic defiance of censorship, daring to say the unsayable, is a poisoned arrow aimed at the achilles heel of liberalism – its dutiful tolerance of illiberal opinion.These issues would be hard enough to navigate if it were just a challenge of balancing state control, public interest and private enterprise in a single jurisdiction with clear lines of democratic accountability. It is far from that.The concentration of digital power is an ocean away, wielded by companies whose bosses are, at best, quietly complicit in Donald Trump’s assault on the US constitution and, in the case of X’s Elon Musk and Palantir’s Peter Thiel,vigorous advocates and enablersof the new US despotism.The alliance of Maga politics and Silicon Valley oligarchy has a double influence on British politics. First, it dictates terms of debate in the windowless chambers where formerly mainstream politicians on the right hallucinate the nation’s collapse into criminality and Islamification. Second, it feeds into Trump’s trade policy as pressure not to implement existing online harms legislation or do anything else that may impede US business interests, under threat of tariffs. Such imperial coercion is, of course, expressed by Washington as part of a global crusade in defence of free speech.How the left can win back the internet – and rise again | Robert TopinkaRead moreTo see the cynical dishonesty in that formulation is not to dismiss the need for liberal vigilance whenever the state takes an interest in rules governing information. Laws drafted with good intent and the promise of a light touch can form a suffocating grip in the wrong hands. But coding the question of tech regulation exclusively in terms of that risk is a wilful misdirection. It steers attention away from the question of who controls the digital plumbing on which British democracy depends and whose interests they serve.Is it a problem that Musk, the world’s richest man, uses his personal social-media megaphone to promote racist conspiracy theories andboost far-right insurrectionacross Europe? Is it relevant, when Palantir is awarded contracts to develop IT systems for the NHS and MoD, that the company hasbuilt apps for ICE, Trump’s anti-immigration militia; that it feeds them federal data to locate potential targets? Does it matter how much leverage an elected prime minister has if those tech behemoths take against him? Those are not questions of free speech but sovereignty, which is something Conservatives used to care about.The current debate around social-media bans for under-16s barely skims the surface of these issues. More optimistically, it indicates growing awareness that the mass migration of human activity online is an epoch-defining political event and the default settings on the tools and platforms involved may not be designed with citizens’ best interests in mind. The implications for democracy cannot be reduced to a facile equation of regulation with censorship.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat is Labour from both the Green party and Reform and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour party?

But it’s fuzzy on the bits in betweenWed 4 Feb 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 14.18 ESTShareAs we all know from history and the current news cycle, autocracy is bad. But it can also be boring. For every explosive confrontation in Minneapolis, there is a quieter, less tangible threat in the form of Kash Patel’s FBIseizing voting recordsfrom Fulton county, Georgia – a state Donald Trump lost by fewer than 12,000 votes in 2020 – or the steady implementation of900-page manifestoby the influential rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation, neither of which lend themselves to blockbuster treatment. And so we have a problem: how to animate the quiet part of what’s happening in the US to reflect a dangerous but tedious reality – namely, that this thing ends not with a bang, but a combination of voter manipulation and federal electoral interference that undermines faith in the democratic process.I bring this up after a week of watching popular movies that resonate in Trump’s US, most of which go heavy on the firefights and light on the details of how we arrive at them. The latest, Anniversary, which launched this week onNetflix– a streamer increasingly uninterested in the subtleties of any situation, let alone this one – depicts a US in which an evil rightwing genius in the shape of a beautiful young woman talks the country into ditching democracy via the medium of (I love this detail; the sheer optimism of it) a stirring book of essays.Actually, I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film, in which Diane Lane plays a centrist mom and political scientist at Georgetown University, trying to keep her family and the discourse together. In essence, it’s a domestic drama with some autocracy for dummies around the edges. But what’s clever is its presentation of an Orwellian-style assault on democracy via language that sells plurality as hostile to “togetherness” and “unity” – very credible in today’s landscape.The book of essays, meanwhile, is entitled The Change and is a nod, possibly, toProject 2025, the shadowy rightwing playbook published by the Heritage Foundation that is now enjoying realisation on Capitol Hill. What the film doesn’t have patience for is the finer detail of how a New York Times bestseller leads to the collapse of the electoral system, and a new order in which subversive comedians are chased across bodies of water by paramilitaries in speed boats and drones threaten citizens in their own gardens after curfew.View image in fullscreenCailee Spaeny (left) and Kirsten Dunst in Alex Garland’s 2024 film Civil War.Photograph: A24If I sound like a killjoy, I apologise. It’s not the job of our creative industries to act as political shills (though we do have the Melania documentary for that). But this failure, to me, seems imaginative rather than political. Consider the impact of Hulu’s adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, in which the full horror of Gilead hits home precisely because the show (or rather, Margaret Atwood’s source material) meticulously joins the dots about the bureaucracy of how the US got there.With this in mind, after suffering through the second half of Anniversary, I returned to Alex Garland’s 2024 movie Civil War, which imagines a US in which three states have seceded against a strongman president in his illegal third term. I wasquite criticalabout this movie when it came out; the supreme court was hearing arguments about the January 6 riot that week and, despite the film’s delicious touches – the on-brand randomness of Florida joining a secessionist cause for reasons wholly unrelated to the broader popular uprising – its apolitical landscape seemed to me like a dodge.You could, I felt, sense the deep, can’t-be-arsed energy of the film’s creative team when they got to the political science part and it’s a fatigue to which we as American voters are vulnerable. It is easier, always, to pay attention only to the parts with explosions.What does that leave us with? There is Paul Thomas Anderson’s multi-Oscar nominatedOne Battle After Another, a slightly different beast to the other two movies in that it shows the US in the grip of a brutal military establishment hell-bent on chasing down “illegals” – in other words, the country as it is now rather than in some future dystopia. I’ve never got on with Anderson’s movies but I loved this, particularly the perfection of Sean Penn as Colonel Steven J Lockjaw, the psychopathic rogue officer who absolutely anticipated the border patrol official Greg Bovino. By reflecting back to us the seriousness of our present situation, the film makes a future reign of terror easier to imagine.View image in fullscreenTeyana Taylor as Perfidia and Sean Penn as Col Steven J Lockjaw in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. PicturesHere’s the weird thing, though. Of everything I watched this week it was Civil War, a far inferior movie to One Battle After Another, that really affected me. The movie occupies a quaint, pre-ICE symbolic order in which, even as civil war rages, the main external reference is to “Charlottesville” and a time when the biggest threat to the US was a bunch of tiki-torch-bearing dickheads, marching for fascism and armed by Bed Bath & Beyond. On first release, Civil War, so sketchy on details, made it easy to sit back and conclude “couldn’t happen here”. But the country has changed since then and, despite the film’s limitations, this time the violence on screen seemed to me suddenly, upsettingly closer.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionProject 2025NetflixUS constitution and civil libertiesICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)One Battle After AnotherAlex GarlandcommentShareReuse this content"

As Ms Bloom, who represents 11 of Jeffrey Epstein’s dogged and brave victims, drily notes: “That’s not the way the justice system is supposed to work.”From the outset, the Epstein affair has offered a textbook example of the ability of the influential and well-connected toavoidscrutiny and intimidate those who would exert it. A ruthless pursuit of transparency, both institutional and personal, is the only way to combat such tactics and hold power to account. In the extraordinary days following thereleaseof further Epstein files last week, the wheels of justice in Britain are belatedly beginning to turn on that basis.Allegations that Peter Mandelson leaked Downing Street emails and market-sensitive information to Epstein, a convicted sex offender, following the financial crash, have now led to a criminalinvestigation. Wednesday’seventsin the House of Commons showed that they have also unleashed a Westminster scandal which threatens to engulf Sir Keir Starmer’s premiership. The prime minister’s political future may rest on his ability to convince MPs that he is being transparent over the fateful decision to make Peter Mandelson the UK’s ambassador in Washington.In the US too, an overdue “reckoning” may be taking place, toquoteMelinda French Gates, the former wife of Bill Gates. Mr Gates has vehementlydismissedlurid claims about him in the latest tranche of files as false. But the broader significance of the drop has been to confirm the extent to which a wealthy, powerfulelitechose self-interestedly to associate with Epstein long after his conviction.The billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, for example, was incontactwith Epstein, and reportedly an investment firm he co-founded accepted $40m from him. Howard Lutnick, the US secretary of state for commerce, visited Epstein’s private island with his wife and children in 2012. In a friendly email exchange in 2013, Richard Branson wrote in execrable taste: “Any time you’re in the area, would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” In Silicon Valley, the financier’s moneyfundedsalon-style dinners with the likes of Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The leftwing philosopher Noam Chomskyemergesin the emails as a sympathetic counsellor, advising Epstein on how to deal with “hysteria” over the abuse of women and his “horrible” treatment in the press.Such ties have been minimised, and publicly regretted, following Epstein’s arrest and death in prison. But the gilded circles that gave him a free pass into networks of influence conferred, by doing so, an aura of untouchability, even as survivors battled to expose Epstein’s depravity. They owe it to those victims to account more fully for their actions.Bill and Hillary Clinton, who willtestifyin the congressional investigation into Epstein this month, have expressed the hope that their appearance will set a precedent. His victims, who are demanding that the department of justice fully release the heavily redacted files, will not hold their breath. Immensely powerful people have had an interest in closing the book on the Epstein scandal. After a week that has felt like a potential tipping point, the moral imperative is for full disclosure.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Welsh men’s recent record has been abysmal. They have won twice in their past 22 matches – both narrow victories against Japan. Wales’s most recent defeat was a 73-0hammeringat home to South Africa in November. For a proud rugby nation, one that has in many ways articulated its identity through rugby, this was embarrassing, intolerable even.On Saturday, Wales face England. If Wales manage to lose in London by fewer than 25 points, they will have exceeded expectations. The gap between the teams saps the fixture’s appeal. Wales’s vertiginous decline over the past five years – they were Six Nations champions as recently as 2021 – is undermining international rugby in the UK. Formerly bitter rivals now feel sorry for Wales, and pity is the most painful reaction of all. Why has this sudden decline occurred? Some attribute it to infighting in Welsh rugby. The game is in a parlous financial state in Wales and the Welsh rugby union wants to cutone of the fourregional teams – Cardiff, Scarlets, Ospreys or Dragons. The Ospreys, based in Swansea, look the most likely fall guys, amovethat, not surprisingly, is being fiercely resisted in west Wales.Yet these bureaucratic wrangles disguise a deeper malaise. Rugby is losing its place in the cultural mainstream in Wales. Welsh rugby in its pomp – the 1960s and 70s in particular – was a vivid representation of a way of life. The game was played primarily in south Wales; the great clubs hailed from Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Llanelli, Neath, Pontypool, Pontypridd and Bridgend (plus a star-studded exiles team atLondon Welsh). It was a largely amateur game and encapsulated the bleak but passionate industrial life of the valleys. It gave voice, literally, to a world founded on coal, iron and steel.It is tempting to romanticise that world, and there were significant downsides, but there was a deep sense of community that foundexpression in rugby. The collapse of that industrial world in the 1980s, followed by rugby’s professionalisation in the mid-1990s, stripped the sport in Wales of its cultural foundations. Town-based clubs gave way to diffuse regional sides, players lost their intimate ties to place, and a way of life became just another game. The contortions of the bureaucrats reflect the fact that rugby is no longer sure of its place in the Welsh cultural landscape. By 2022,footballwas the number one sport in Wales, with cycling coming up fast.Women’s rugbyin Wales is also stumbling.To revive the sport, the authorities in Wales must bring rugby back into schools,stop selling playing fields, re-establish club-based pathways into the elite game, raise coaching standards and determine once and for all how many professional clubs the sport can support. But they also need to answer more profound questions: what does rugby represent in modern Wales; what culture does it now encapsulate; will it feed off its glorious past or reinvent itself for an uncertain future? Rugby union is not always an aesthetically pleasing sport, but the unique beauty of the Six Nations lies in the passion and pride it arouses. Rugby in Wales has never been just a game. In a post-industrial nation, its meaning is unresolved.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While the marine ecosystems of the Chagos are relatively pristine, the terrestrial environments are not, as the islands were used as major coconut plantations for a couple of centuries before being forcibly depopulated in the 1970s.Aside from Diego Garcia, they have been effectively rewilded through neglect, so the vegetation is secondary forest, good but not “virgin”, and does support important seabird colonies. As for the marine environment, the now-displaced islanders fished the waters during those 200 years, also exporting some fish toMauritius.As I understand it, the Mauritian plan is to retain much of the current marine conservation zone for limited “artisanal” fishing only – the wider seas have been plundered by large-scale international fishing operations for decades, and in the 19th century for the industrial harvesting of sperm whales.From their first settlement in the late 1700s, the islands were administered from Mauritius until detached as the British Indian Ocean Territory on Mauritius becoming independent in 1968. The displaced inhabitants, employees of the monopolist Chagos Agalega Company, were Mauritian and Seychellois citizens. The islands’ return to Mauritius is thus both legally and morally correct. There is no evidence that it will cause the “irreversible destruction” that Hambler claims.Anthony ChekeCo-author, Lost Land of the Dodo: The Ecological History of Mauritius, Réunion & RodriguesClive Hambler notes that theChagos Islandsis the best protected tropical ecosystem on Earth and that Mauritius’s plans for fishing after regaining sovereignty threaten this. We need to recognise the reasons why the Chagos Islands are a “last great tropical wilderness” area.The UK exiled thousands of British subjects in the 1960s and 1970s from the Chagos Islands to make way for an American military base. Declassified archival documents show that various legal mechanisms were used, including claiming that the Chagos Islanders were merely Mauritian “contract labourers”, to “clear” the islands to make way for the American inhabitation of the archipelago.The UK imposed environmental protections more recently to counter Chagossians’ claims to their homeland, not out of concern for the environment. We must be careful not to repeat this logic by equating Mauritian sovereignty and the Chagossians’ return home with the notion that the islands’ biodiversity will be undercut. To do so is to repeat the narrative used by the UK to exile its own citizens decades ago.Dr Tom FrostSenior lecturer,Loughborough Law SchoolChagos is not “pristine” – it has been ravaged by widespread bleaching and coral death. Its remarkable ecosystem is due to its geography and controversial history. It is remote, with nearly 200 years of low-impact plantations, banishment of about 1,500 Chagossians in the 1970s by Britain, a licensed tuna and inshore fishery for over 20 years, and 15 years as a no-take marine protected area (MPA).The licensed fishery was well regulated, with no evidence that fish stocks were depleted, nor that a no-take regime was needed. In 2015, the MPA was found to be in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and is no longer recognised by world authorities. No longer legitimate, in due course it would become unenforceable.The future no longer lies in failed fortress conservation but in the Mauritius MPA, announced in 2022, which will permit Chagossians to return to their homeland while protecting the islands and seas from exploitation. Where fishing will be permitted, there is to be “an agreed sustainable quota for artisanal, traditional, ceremonial and subsistence purposes”. No commercial fishing will be allowed. Under the treaty, the UK has agreed to provide assistance to Mauritius.Richard DunneLead author,The Creation of the Chagos Marine Protected Area: A Fisheries Perspective(Advances in Marine Biology volume 69, 2014)Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsBiodiversityBritish empireMauritiusSeychellesFishingForeign policylettersShareReuse this content"

Before the Serious And Organised Crime Agency and the National Crime Agency, we had a National Crime Squad, and before that a National Criminal Intelligence Service.The new NPS may have too wide a remit to be manageable. Many Met police commissioners end their time badly because of the extent of their responsibilities – public order, counter-terrorism, mid-range organised crime, street crime, drunks, knives, road traffic, domestic disturbances, dealing with the mentally unwell, and the vetting and personnel problems of police and civilian staff.The head of the NPS will deal with counter-terrorism, take over the existing regional crime units, address fraud in all its forms and will also cover cybercrime, large-scale sexual exploitation and people-trafficking, as the NationalCrimeAgency does now.These are all different skills, and staff will have to be transferred from their existing positions. Much frontline work, including cyber and fraud, is carried out by constables and sergeants; in the police, higher ranks and better salaries go to managers and administrators. , Because of poor career progression, the National Crime Agency and other elite units have a staff retention problem, which needs resolving.

I’m not surprised, 27 January) highlights the grave risks identified in the UK government’s reportGlobal biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and national security.However, it overlooks a key factor highlighted in the report – that population growth is a major indirect driver of global biodiversity loss. “As the global population grows, reaching 9.7 billion by 2050, the impact of food production on natural systems will intensify and it will become even more challenging to produce sufficient food sustainably,” it says.Mass-scale expansion of agriculture driven by global population growth risks sacrificing sustainability: forests cleared for farmland, pesticides polluting waterways, and ecosystems pushed beyond recovery accelerating biodiversity loss. It is a concern echoed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whichidentifiedpopulation growth and GDP per capita as the strongest drivers of carbon emissions.We must end the taboo of discussing population growth and address the underlying causes of it. Currently, there are121m unintended pregnancieseach year, and globally onlyone in 10women feel able to make decisions about using contraception. By addressing the drivers of global population growth, we also curb rising demand for food production, resolving one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. In addition, more people transitioning to a plant-based diet is essential, as livestock farming occupies more thanthree-quartersof agricultural land and produces twice theemissionsof crop farming.The UK government must urgently act on its own report’s findings by addressing the causes and effects of global population growth and unsustainable consumption patterns as intertwined challenges.Biodiversityloss cannot be ignored, as it poses an existential risk to geopolitical security and any hope for a peaceful and sustainable future.Amy JankiewiczCEO, Population MattersExplore more on these topicsPopulationConservationBiodiversityPregnancyContraception and family planningHealthParents and parentinglettersShareReuse this content"

Inevitably, the 2024 datarevealedanother rise in the percentage of adults in England who were obese or overweight – reaching 66%, compared with 53% in 1993. About 30% of adults were obese. The survey again illustrated the links between deprivation, obesity and ill-health.As the survey noted, it is estimated that obesity and related illnesses cost theNHS£6.5bn in 2022. However, the economic and social costs are much greater than that. It is a significant factor in the surging health/disability-related benefits bill as people leave the workforce early – distorting local labour markets and shrinking the tax base needed to meet those rising welfare costs.

Yet immediately the home rearguard was bisected as Anthony Gordon curved the ball left to Joe Willock before James Trafford, running out, killed the danger.City’s deputy keeper did the same when this time Gordon had the chance – Trafford narrowed the angle expertly, a corner was conceded and Newcastle failed to profit.Before this Rayan Aït-Nouri had fed Reijnders in on City’s left but the Dutchman blazed wide, and later in a crowded Newcastle penalty area Antoine Semenyo whipped the ball across goal from the right but no teammate could apply a touch.The contest was open – particularly now as Newcastle needed three goals merely to achieve parity.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush doubles Manchester City’s lead on the night from close range.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockGuardiola made four changes from thefirst-leg win on Tynesidethree weeks ago, the star name to miss out being Erling Haaland, though Phil Foden was in the XI for a first time in four games.The manager’s configuration was a 4-2-2-2 that had Semenyo and Marmoush up top while Howe’s side, featuring six different players from the defeat at St James’ Park, played a 3-5-2.Yet how Newcastle set up was cast as all but superfluous just after the half‑hour. By then City were 3-0 up on the night, 5-0 overall, and headed for a Wembley date with the Gunners in mid-March.First the ubiquitous Reijnders passed to Semenyo, who crossed from the left: Kieran Trippier hashed his clearance, the ball popped up and Marmoush headed his second.This was in the 29th minute. Three minutes later Reijnders had registered: the midfielder relayed to Semenyo, this time in Newcastle’s area along the right, he pivoted, the hapless Burn stuck a leg out, inadvertently serving the ball to Reijnders, who stroked home.Howe’s gameplan was in tatters. A wing-back system is supposed to offer a defensive foundation but if those in the back five underperform, as Burn (twice) and Trippier had, the system is immaterial.Manchester City produce little big plan to bamboozle Newcastle | Will UnwinRead moreIn first-half stoppage time Sven Botman forced Trafford into another save but with Gordon having to be replaced by Harvey Barnes moments before – he is an injury concern due to a hamstring problem – this was an anguished period for Newcastle.Yoane Wissa, one of three Newcastle second-half changes, ran through moments after Tony Harrington restarted but the striker scooped wide. The 29‑year‑old, who replaced Nick Woltemade, was joined by Elanga – for Willock – and Jacob Murphy, who took over from Lewis Hall as the left wing-back.Guardiola substituted Nathan Aké for Max Alleyne and when Ramsdale skewered a clearance out for a City throw, this suggested the young defender might not be too busy.But he did have a coming together with Wissa that had Howe furious when no penalty was awarded, and as Newcastle’s manager complained City moved the ball near Ramsdale’s goal where Reijnders missed a gilded chance, steering wide.Soon after Elanga slalomed in from the right, beating him, Aït‑Nouri and Nico O’Reilly before finding the back of the net off the left post. “We’re going to win 6-5” was regaled by the travelling faithful, yet when Barnes scored soon after it seemed more serious until the goal was ruled offside.Haaland, coming on after 71 minutes, hit a post before drawing a latest blank. But on Wednesday night progression was all.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupManchester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Friday will host the 6 v 6 and 3 v 3 fixtures, Saturday the 5 v 5 and 2 v 2 matches and Sunday the 4 v 4 and 1 v 1 finals.Spectators will be “buying blind” because it is unlikely the identity of the teams contesting the finals will be known until the weekend before, with results from three July Tests and three regular fixtures in November determining the standings.Still, the most expensive tickets to watch the 4 v 4 and 1 v 1 finals will stretch to £279.90. That allows supporters to watch two matches but it is in effect the top price for the final because tickets cannot be bought for a single match.Those buying tickets for multiple days will receive a discount, however, and it is understood that there will be a resale market for spectators to effectively “swap” tickets if their teams are playing on different days.While the matches take place at Twickenham, prices are set by the Six Nations organisers and Sanzaar who run theNations Championshipas a joint venture. The cheapest standard tickets for the day of the final are £125, £100 for the Saturday and £60 for the Friday. All junior tickets for finals day cost £50 and £20 for the Friday.Well-placed sources believe their pricing strategy caters for all types of spectators, compares well with other major sporting and music events and that the Nations Championship showcases elite teams at cheaper prices than the 2027 World Cup.England’s three home Nations Championship matches in the autumn in the weeks before finals day are against New Zealand, Australia and Japan, and prices for those are set by the RFU. Premium tickets for the match against the All Blacks will cost £238.Interest in tickets for the finals weekend is said to be tracking at a similar rate to that of England versus New Zealand, with a significant share coming from the United States. Organisers can also expect a late surge in interest for the most expensive tickets on the Sunday should England reach the final.Steve Borthwick’s side begin their campaign in July with a mouthwateringfixture againstSouth Africa in Johannesburg before locking horns with Fiji. As the Guardian exclusively revealed last week, that fixture could take place atEverton’s new Hill Dickinson Stadiumbefore England head to Argentina.Borthwick is weighing up fielding a second-string side against Fiji for logistical reasons but he may wish to reconsider if England pull off a Six Nations grand slam and defeat the Springboks, because the match against the Pacific Islanders would offer the chance of a world record-equalling 18th consecutive victory. The appeal of taking the Fiji fixture away from Twickenham is to steer clear of the “neutral” venue for finals day.Explore more on these topicsNations ChampionshipRugby unionEngland rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Between 17 October 2021, the start of the tournament in the United Arab Emirates, and 8 March 2026, the date of this year’s final, four T20 World Cups will have been squeezed into four years, four months and 19 days.If they come along more regularly even than British general elections – to whichBrenda produced her timeless reaction in 2017– they at least have more interesting results: the past five have had five different winners and the past three six different finalists. What’s more, though not much time has passed since the last one ended withIndia beating South Africa in Barbados, it seems to have been long enough for the game to shift into a fresh and exhilarating new gear.Australia fall to worst T20 defeat in final World Cup warmup in PakistanRead moreIt is too soon to be drawing conclusions about the state of the game in 2026, but in 21 T20 internationals in the first month of this year 6,960 runs were scored at 9.13 an over – a massively higher scoring rate than any previous year. England scored at 9.91 an over in 2025, their best figure, and of the Test-playing nations only Bangladesh, who arenot at the tournament, Australia and West Indies did not either break their run-scoring record in 2025 or set themselves on course to do so this year.The record for batting strike rates in the Indian Premier League was broken in 2023, again in 2024 and again in 2025. The figure for this year’s Big Bash was down slightly on last year’s record, but still above every other year. The 2025 tournaments sit second in the rankings for Pakistan’s PSL and the Caribbean Premier League in the West Indies, and first in Bangladesh’s BPL and England’s Blast.Not counting 2005 and 2006, when hardly any were played, in the first six years of T20 internationals, three teams successfully chased more than 200 to win games. It has happened twice this year and in matches between Test-playing nations three times in 2025 (while a few rungs down the ladder Gibraltar and Bulgaria managed to do it three times in four days in Sofia in August).Six of the seven highest T20 international totals have been scored since the last World Cup, with England’s epic304 for two against South Africa at Old Traffordin September only good enough for third on the list. Before June 2025, there was only one series when a scoring rate above 11 an over was sustained throughout; in the past eight months there have been four, all but one between teams big enough to be at this World Cup. In short, the past 13 months have produced a sustained acceleration in scoring speed, in domestic and international fixtures.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler sweeps against Sri Lanka in the third T20, which England won to complete a series sweep.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesSo there is every reason to expect the action coming over the next five weeks to be faster, more furious, more epically senseless than ever. The only problem with the format, so long as you like your sport epically senseless, is that one team has simply become too good at it.No side have defended the T20 World Cup nor won it at home. But India have every possible advantage: they will play every game at home, after Pakistan were ordered by their governmentnot to play the fixturethat would have forced them to travel to Sri Lanka on 15 February, and they are unfathomably good.This format is wildly unpredictable, with games prone to being decided in a couple of key moments, and often by little more than chance, but India have such an abundance of quality they have almost taken luck out of it. Since the last World Cup final they have played 41 T20s and lost six, winning 31. At home they have won 14 out of 17.When they played the June 2024 final Abhishek Sharma was yet to make his international debut, and as they go into this tournament he is the world No 1 batter, the hottest property in the game.In January, despite being dismissed for a duck in two of his five innings, Sharma scored 182 runs and averaged 45.5. He faced 73 balls. Against New Zealand in Guwahati he scored a 14-ball half-century.Bangladesh boycott brings a sad reality to T20 World Cup countdown | Taha HashimRead moreHis teammate Shivam Dube scored a 15-ball half-century against the same opponents three days later, which means five of the sixfastest T20 half-centuriesin India’s history have been scored in the past year, three of them in the past two months. To take that global, of the 246 T20 international half-centuries to have been scored off 23 balls or fewer, 57 – very nearly a quarter – have come since the start of 2025.After India and a giant chasm of complete emptiness where a genuine rival might be, the next most impressive major nation since the start of last year – a feat all the more remarkable because it has somehow been achieved really quite unimpressively – is England. After wrapping up a series win in Sri Lanka with victory in the second match in Kandy they had won 10 of their past 17 games while scoring at 9.86 an over, faster even than India’s 9.73.Though Brendon McCullum has led them through a miserable winter, marked by players being freed to indulge in disappointing decision-making on and off the pitch,the 2022 championshave the benefit of knowing they cannot face India or Australia until the semi-finals at the earliest.But Australia are the bookmakers’ second favourites, which doesn’t reflect the injury crisis that has ruled out Pat Cummins and forced Josh Hazlewood to remain in Sydney at the start the tournament, but does reflect their world ranking and the fact that they are Australia and this is a World Cup.Bangladesh’s absence, after announcing a few weeks from the start of the tournament they would refuse to play in India – the one Bangladeshi team that was willing to come, its journalists, was shamefully refused accreditation en masse – and the apparent loss of Pakistan’s encounter with India, the sport’s most high-profile and lucrative game, have tarnished in advance the reputation this tournament is about to make. In this sport, chaos and calamity are never far from the surface, but in this format, and at this moment, the next few weeks promise to be particularly wild.This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructionsExplore more on these topicsCricketThe Spin newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

Therefore their quiet window was no surprise, but they will be relatively pleased to have brought in a star of the future, Smilla Holmberg, at right-back and to have fulfilled their need for a backup goalkeeper, with Barbora Votíkova’sdeadline-day loan. Much more significant, though, is the positive progress they are understood to have made in theirattempt to sign Georgia Stanwayon a free at the end of the season, and big decisions such asnot seeking to extend Katie McCabe’s stay, as they prepare to refresh the team.Key insSmilla Holmberg (Hammarby), Barbora Votikova (Slavia Prague, loan)Key outsJenna Nighswonger (Aston Villa, loan), Laila Harbert (Everton, loan)Aston VillaThe signing of Oriane Jean-François from Chelsea, for a fee reportedly as high as £450,000, is a major move from Villa, whose results have not gone the way they would have wanted in 2026 but who can be satisfied with their acquisitions. They also brought in Jenna Nighswonger on loan from Arsenal. The USA defender arrived in England with a terrific reputation but things have not worked out for her in north London so, if Villa can help her settle in the WSL and enjoy her football again, that could be a clever move. They also recouped some cash with the sale of the England winger Katie Robinson to the promotion-chasing Bristol City.Key insOriane Jean-François (Chelsea), Jenna Nighswonger (Arsenal, loan)Key outsKatie Robinson (Bristol City), Sarah Mayling (Leicester, loan)BrightonThe main talking point of Brighton’s window centred around a player who did not leave: Fran Kirby. The former England forward was strongly linked with Juventus and sources have said the 32-year-old would have liked the chance to play Champions League football again, but Kirby was not for sale because of her importance to the team. Olaug Tvedten’s acquisition from Vålerenga should add a goalscoring threat to the midfield. But the relative insignificance of transfer news was put into perspective with the death of Brighton’s head of women’s and girls’ coaching Rado Vidošić, father of the head coach, Dario. The news affected everybody around the club.Key insOlaug Tvedten (Vålerenga)Key outsJorelyn Carabali (Boston Legacy FC)View image in fullscreenOlaug Tvedten should add a goalscoring threat to Brighton’s midfield.Photograph: Charlotte Tattersall/WSL/Getty ImagesChelseaThe club have frequently been declared “winners” of transfer windows over the past decade but this one was a rare disappointment for Chelsea. They did not sign a player, despite trying to take Jennifer Echegini from Paris Saint-Germain. The lack of activity is partly down to their focus on summer plans, with significant incomings and outgoings expected, but it will frustrate their fans that they have not strengthened, amid poor form and with Sonia Bompastor taking the risky step ofquestioning their squad depth. PSG’s rejection of Chelsea’s bid for Echegini, coupled with Villa’s signing of Jean-François, meant Chelsea were unwilling to loan the England youth midfielder Lexi Potter to Leicester, who had offered more game time.Key insNoneKey outsOriane Jean-François (Aston Villa),Maika Hamano (Tottenham, loan)EvertonEverton worked late into the night on Tuesday to complete their move for the Slovenia midfielderZara Kramzar from Romaand the supporters will have been glad the deal went through after an otherwise quiet window. Kramzar has arrived on loan with an obligation to buy this summer. The arrivals of Hannah Blundell and Laila Harbert on loan from Manchester United and Arsenal respectively will help to strengthen the squad somewhat. Everton stood firm regarding Kelly Gago, insisting they would sell only if her release clause were met, so the want-away France forward is staying. The head coachBrian Sørensen was sackedon Wednesday.Key insZara Kramzar (Roma, loan), Hannah Blundell (Manchester United, loan), Laila Harbert (Arsenal, loan)Key outsKatie Robinson (loan ended), Hayley Ladd (Crystal Palace)View image in fullscreenZara Kramzar (left) arrives on loan from Roma but Everton have an obligation to buy.Photograph: Just Pictures GmbH/AlamyLeicesterThe club have commonly had the lowest average age for a starting WSL XI this season, so their main aim was understood to be trying to add more experience, and they did that by buying Ashleigh Neville, Rachel Williams, Alisha Lehmann and Emma Jansson, and loaning Sarah Mayling from Aston Villa. Those five players have an average age of 31 and Leicester hope their maturity on and off the pitch can aid their quest to stay clear of the relegation playoff spot. The downside to Leicester’s window was losing their former captain Janice Cayman to PSV, but it is understood the motivation was predominantly to be nearer home and loved ones, and she moved with the club’s blessing and best wishes.Key insAshleigh Neville (Tottenham), Rachel Williams (Manchester United), Alisha Lehmann (Como), Emma Jansson (Rosengård),Sarah Mayling (Aston Villa, loan)Key outsJanice Cayman (PSV)View image in fullscreenAlisha Lehmann made her Leicester debut in a defeat by her former club West Ham.Photograph: Leila Coker/WSL/Getty ImagesLiverpoolThis was Liverpool’s best window in recent memory and went a long way towards making amends for poor business last summer and to mitigate for a lengthy injury list. The WSL’s bottom club, in danger of losing their top-flight status without major improvements, appear to have delivered with several quality additions. The Sweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk, in particular, is a world-class signing. At the other end of the pitch, the arrivals of Martha Thomas and Anna Jøsendal should broaden the goal threat of the league’s second-lowest scorers, and Alice Bergström got off the mark with a goal last Sunday.Key insAlice Bergstrom (Häcken), Aurélie Csillag (Freiburg), Denise O’Sullivan (North Carolina Courage), Anna Jøsendal (Hammarby), Jennifer Falk (Häcken, loan), Martha Thomas (Tottenham, loan)Key outsRafaela Borggräfe (Bayer Leverkusen, loan), Leanne Kiernan(Nottingham Forest, loan),Emilia Szymczak (loan ended)View image in fullscreenAnna Jøsendal should increase the threat posed by Liverpool, the WSL’s second-lowest scorers.Photograph: Nick Taylor/LFC/Getty ImagesLondon City LionessesThe best bargain of this WSL window was surely London City’ssigning of Delphine Cascarinoon a free from San Diego Wave on a three-and-a-half-year deal. The 28-year-old France winger, a star of Euro 2025 and in the prime years of her career, would ordinarily have been expected to sign for a club competing to win the Champions League, so her arrival is a major coup for the WSL newcomers, who went on to complete a deadline-day move for the Danish midfielder Malou Marcetto from Madrid CFF. Several players also left Eder Maestre’s side on loan, including the young striker Lotta Lindström, who scored a hat-trick for Birmingham in WSL2 last weekend.Key insDelphine Cascarino (San Diego Wave), Malou Marcetto (Madrid CFF)Key outsSofia Jakobsson (Toluca),Katie Zelem (West Ham, loan), Lotta Lindström (Birmingham, loan)View image in fullscreenDelphine Cascarino will bring star quality to the WSL.Photograph: Tullio M Puglia/Getty ImagesManchester CityThe leaders completed themarquee signingof this window by bringing the USA midfielder Sam Coffey to England. The women’s game was shocked when it wasrevealed on 8 Januarythat the parties were in advanced talks. It was a flex of City’s muscles, at a time when they are racing away with the league title, and another sign of the rising trend of US players being keen to play in Europe. Very little else happened during this window for Andrée Jeglertz’s side but their fans will most likely think it did not need to, with things going so smoothly. The club know they need to bolster their defensive depth in the summer if they are to challenge for the European title.Key insSam Coffey (Portland Thorns)Key outsNoneManchester UnitedThis was a highly impressive window for United, who not only completed their business early but brought in players of a high calibre in positions where it was clear they needed to strengthen, the squad having looked a little thin, given that they are juggling European and domestic football. The Germany strikerLea Schüllerelevates the forward line and appears to have settled quickly, as has Ellen Wangerheim, a 21-year-old who the club feel will get better and better.Key insEllen Wangerheim (Hammarby), Lea Schüller (Bayern Munich), Hanna Lundkvist (San Diego Wave)Key outsRachel Williams (Leicester), Geyse (Club América), Hannah Blundell (Everton, loan)View image in fullscreenLea Schüller, holding off a challenge from Liverpool’s Jenna Clark, has settled quickly at Manchester United.Photograph: Mike Martin/Focus Images /ShutterstockTottenhamSpurs acted swiftly to complete their business and the rest of the division are really starting to take Martin Ho’s side seriously, after they moved to within two points of second spot and a point of a European place. It is no secret that several Champions League clubs had been keen on Signe Gaupset, so Tottenham were delighted to secure her signature, and their interest in the Scandinavian market was also evident as they signed Hanna Wijk, Matilda Nildén and Julie Blakstad. The addition of Maika Hamano on loan from Chelsea feels like a low-risk but potentially high-reward move. The exit of a long-serving fan favourite, Ashleigh Neville, to Leicester was a tough pill for Tottenham supporters to swallow but the club were keen to evolve the age profile of the team.Key insMatilda Nildén (Häcken), Hanna Wijk (Häcken), Julie Blakstad (Hammarby), Signe Gaupset (Brann), Maika Hamano (Chelsea, loan)Key outsAshleigh Neville (Leicester), Martha Thomas (Liverpool, loan), Kit Graham (Ipswich, loan)West HamThe club had a decent, if unspectacular, window and raised eyebrows with the signing of the Norway defender Tuva Hansen from Bayern Munich. The 28-year-old is very well thought of across the Bundesliga. They also recouped significant money with the sale of Anouk Denton to the American side Bay FC, in a club-record sale understood to be about £200,000. West Ham also held on to their top scorer, Shekiera Martinez, but whether or not they have done enough to stave off the threat of relegation remains to be seen, particularly in light of Liverpool’s impressive additions.Key insTuva Hansen (Bayern Munich), Ylinn Tennebø (Vålerenga), Ria Bose (Sporting), Katie Zelem (London City), Estelle Cascarino (Juventus, loan)Key outsAnouk Denton (Bay FC), Manuela Paví (Toluca),Amber Tysiak (Union Berlin)PosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1429392Man Utd Women1416283Chelsea Women1412274Arsenal Women1315265Tottenham Hotspur Women140266London City Lionesses14-7197Brighton & Hove Albion Women140178Aston Villa Women14-7169Everton Women14-101110Leicester Women13-15911West Ham Women14-20812Liverpool FC Women14-137Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenAston Villa WomenBrighton & Hove Albion WomenChelsea WomenEverton WomenManchester City WomenanalysisShareReuse this content"

In at least one key respect, even so, the two events are perfectly aligned: one early stumble for France or Ireland and a potentially painful descent awaits.Despite the possibility of first‑night nerves and some Parisian drizzle it should still make for more intriguing viewing on ITV1 than the alternative of Dragons’ Den and The Apprentice on BBC One. Unless, of course, France are so far out of sight inside 40 minutes that they cannot be caught and the audience are free to switch over in good time to watch Sir Alan Sugar say: “You’re fired!”Six Nations form guide: how the 2026 contenders are shaping upRead moreThat was pretty much Wales’s fate at this stage 12 months ago. By half-time in the 2025 tournament’s opening fixture, France were 28-0 ahead and cruising.The final score was 43-0and, by the middle of March,Les Bleuswere hoisting aloft the trophy. Onlya narrow away defeat by England, in a game Fabien Galthié’s side could and should have won, prevented a French grand slam.A potential case of deja vu this time? Ireland would much prefer to rewind to 2024 when this fixture, because of the looming summer Olympic Games in Paris, was shifted to Marseille. France saw Paul Willemse shown a red card after half an hourbefore going down 38-17. And guess who emerged as champions the following month? None other than Andy Farrell’s Ireland.Plenty hinges on being able to seize the tournament initiative and send an early message to every other rival. And no one studying this week’s French team sheet could possibly say the hosts lack the ingredients to do that. While plenty of column inches have been given over to the absence of Damian Penaud, Gaël Fickou, the unavailable Thibaud Flament and the now retired Uini Atonio, rather fewer words have been devoted to the rich promise of Oscar Jégou, Matthieu Jalibert, Nicolas Depoortère, Théo Attissogbe and the ridiculously prolific Louis Bielle-Biarrey.Then on the bench there is the 20‑year-old Kalvin Gourgues, the exciting Toulouse centre who has had to overcome serious health concerns to pursue his burgeoning career. Last year Gourgues was forced to undergo surgery to replace an artery in his left foot with one from his thigh to solve a blood-clotting problem that might otherwise have required the amputation of his lower leg.View image in fullscreenIreland’s head coach, Andy Farrell, has a long list of injury absentees.Photograph: Billy Stickland/Inpho/ShutterstockRoll it all up together and if France click the results could be spectacular. Jalibert has been in majestic form for Bordeaux, offering a sharp running threat in addition to his other playmaking talents. Some insist that he and Antoine Dupont, back after a 10‑monthabsence following the cruciate ligament injuryhe sustained against Ireland last March, are not an ideal half-back pairing because both prefer to run the show. Which is a perfectly valid stance if you ignore how attuned Jalibert and Bielle-Biarrey seem to be at club level, let alone Dupont and his ToulouseconfrèreThomas Ramos.It leaves a much-changed Ireland with umpteen tricky questions to answer and a few reputations at stake. Front-row injuries have presented Munster’s Jeremy Loughman with his first Test cap for two years, the 30-year-old slotting in at loosehead prop in the absence of Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle. Thomas Clarkson starts at tighthead with Tadhg Furlong not deemed to have recovered fully from a calf injury.With no Hugo Keenan, Robbie Henshaw, Jordan Larmour, Mack Hansen, James Lowe orthe suspended Bundee Aki, there is a similarly reshuffled feel to the backline. While Farrell has dubbed it “a fantastic opportunity” for some less familiar names to impress, he will also be aware that Ireland’s foundations are less stable than is usually the case.It makes for a subtly different mental challenge, too, with Brian O’Driscoll suggesting last week that Ireland would benefit from adjusting their sights anyway. Ireland have paid a price previously, O’Driscoll reckons, for obsessing overSix Nationstitles at the expense of prioritising exactly how best to deliver longer‑term World Cup success. He was speaking in a noisy room in Edinburgh but his message was clear enough: to reach the last four of a World Cup, Ireland need to prepare more strategically and give more big-match experience to fringe squad members en route.That scenario has arrived. It is a colossal night, in particular, for the Prendergast brothers – 22-year-old fly-half Sam and 25-year-old flanker Cian – picked to start a Test together for the first time. As Farrell observed: “You can tell they try to keep it on the down low in front of all their teammates but I’m sure behind the scenes, along with their parents, they’re as proud as punch.”View image in fullscreenIreland and France lock horns in Dublin last season, when the visitors thumped the hosts 42-27.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThis will also be Jacob Stockdale’s first Six Nations appearance in five years, the Ulsterman having been crowned the player of the tournament as far back as 2018. For this Ireland side collectively, though, this feels like uncharted territory, even if Farrell is unfazed by the bookmakers giving France a 13-point start. “It’s obvious who are the favourites and all of that but it really doesn’t matter,” the victorious British & Irish Lions head coach of last year insisted.There will also be some new silverware on offer, with the two teams playing for the inauguralSolidarity Trophy, which will now be awarded annually to the victors. And if the opening night story turns out to be a crushing Irish defeat, brace yourself for the “Thursday Murder Club” headlines.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026France rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.”Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?”Hewas also well knownfor his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots.Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match.His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths.The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.”Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.”Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace.View image in fullscreenJohn Virgo pictured in 1994.Photograph: Shutterstock“Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.”The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.”Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was.

But new head coach Mike Vrabel has transformed the narrative around the teamOliver ConnollyWed 4 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 13.27 ESTShareThere used to be a simple rule: Anybody but theNew England Patriots.From 2001 through 2019, the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick dynasty totaled sixSuper Bowltitles, 13 conference championship appearances and 17 divisional crowns. They were the Evil Empire, constant contenders in a league designed for parity. It didn’t matter who you were; the Patriots were the final boss.The early years of the Patriots’ dynasty had a different feel. They were thePatriots,a dash of Americana, playing in red, white and blue,who won their first title as scrappy underdogs, lifting theLombardi after a national tragedy. They had the head coaching guru in the hoodie and discovered the All-American quarterback in the sixth round of the draft. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when Brady, Belichick and the Patriots were underdogs. They were, whisper it, even admired and beloved.Butler did it: 11 years on, was the NFL’s most criticized call actually the right decision?Read moreBut winning has a way of hardening opinions. And the Patriots committed the cardinal sports sin: they won too much. And they won differently. They were better, smarter, colder. And when other teams attempted to import the wisdom,it ended in disaster.Fans of other teams were sick of their success. Opponents, too.Sure, there were other reasons. There were the cheating scandals:real and serious, andstupid and imagined. There were theoff-field scandals. The arrogance. The whiff ofMaga. The jockeying for credit. There wasPortnoy. But the Patriots’ chief crime was that they won. For 20 years, they made 31 other fanbases miserable, building a generation of resentment. It made the downfall all the sweeter.Dynasties don’t explode. They erode. First,Brady left. The aura followed. Then the wins.Without Brady, Belichick and the Patriots suffered. ThenBelichick left. His replacement was fired after a season. Even in New England, the nostalgia faded away. Suddenly, Foxborough wasn’t hosting coronations. It was hosting fourth quarters where half the crowd had already beaten the traffic. The Evil Empire had become … normal.But normal, it turns out, is humanizing.And now the Patriots are back in the dance. On Sunday, they will be trying for their seventh title, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins by a franchise. They will face the Seahawks as underdogs. And the last time the Patriots were underdogs in a Super Bowl was 24 years ago, back when they were the fun upstarts, with the golden boy at quarterback taking onthe Greatest Show on Turf. The prevailing sense now is not dread, but: good for them.It’s funny how a single force can have a halo effect on a franchise. In New England, that force is Mike Vrabel.If the old Patriots were sterile, Vrabel’s version feels like a bar fight.Vrabel is almost a caricature of a football coach. He’s the former Patriots linebacker who dives into brawls during team practice. The coach who bloodies his nose while teaching players proper technique. He’s the master strategist with a rah-rah spirit; the man who preaches situational football while ripping on a vape pen. He’s the secret dork who can recite the details of the rulebook while drinking his offensive linemen under the table.“You changed my life, coach,”Cory Durden, a Pats defensive end, said to Vrabel on the sideline after last month’s AFC championship game.Durden isn’t the only one to think that way. Players – current and former – talk about Vrabel with alevel of reverence. He’s one of their own. Vrabel spent 14 years in the league as a player, helping to kickstart the Patriots’ dynasty on the field before returning to the team as a coach. Win on Sunday, and he will become the first person to win a Super Bowl as a player and coach for the same franchise.But for all the bombast, Vrabel is a brilliant football mind. He combs the rulebook for any advantage. He has built his coaching career on mastering “situational football,” breaking the game down to its component parts. As a player, he was a thumper. As a coach, he’s a tactician.In Tennessee, Vrabel rebooted a flagging franchise, leading the Titans to the playoffs three times in six years. In New England, he has overseen a similar turnaround, from four wins a season ago to 14 wins and a Super Bowl berth this year. And his fingerprints are all over the rebuild. Along with coaching, he has the final say on personnel. He’s nailed draft picks, built a quality coaching staff and imported a free-agent class filled with guys from his Tennessee days. Anchoring the roster around a solid defense and quarterback Drake Maye, he turned the Patriots from doormat to contenders in one offseason.Vrabel is, in his own sense, an underdog; on a short list of players who have played and coached at the highest level. Chucked out by the Titans after a power struggle, he spent a year in the wilderness, helping out in Cleveland after missing out on head coaching gigs in the 2024 cycle. At 6ft 4in and around 250lbs, he wastoo big and too intimidatingfor modern executives, according to The Athletic. That didn’t matter to the Patriots.The team is now built in his image. They’re talented, obviously,piloted by Maye, an MVP-caliber quarterback, even if he has struggled so far this postseason. But they’re also scrappy, a who’s who of cast-offs and grinders. The dark lore that shrouded the mid-to-late period of the Belichick-Brady partnership has been left behind. These Patriots don’t beat you 38–10. They beat you 20–17 and make you hate every second of it. There’s something oddly charming about that.View image in fullscreenThe Patriots were feared – and hated by many – under Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.Photograph: David J Phillip/APAnd yet, as always, some elements break the happy, scrappy narrative.This is still a team owned and operated by Robert Kraft, a man so utterly dedicated to securing his place in the game’s history that he produced a 10-part documentary to burnishhis own reputation– while knifing the greatest coach of the modern era in the back. Kraft has been so relentlessly obsessed with a place in the Hall of Fame that it hasturned voters off.Then there’s Kraft’s off-field activities. There was themassage parlor. There is his cosy relationship with the Trump administration. Kraft and Trump are long-term friends. Kraft claimed tocut communicationwith the President after the storming of the Capitol in 2021, butsat next to Trumpat the premiere ofMelanialast week. The public showing came after Kraft had lobbied the administration to give his buddy favorable treatment during acrackdown on law firms. It is also surely a coincidence that the friendship restarted after Kraft’s son, Josh Kraft,dropped out of the Boston mayoral race. Kraft, it seems, is happy to help drive a nation over the cliff if he can pick up some hardware and huzzahs on the way.It would be easy to ignore Kraft’s involvement if it were not standard practice for theNFLto present the trophy to the winning owner before anyone else.The Patriots also have two players under investigation for allegations of violence against women. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore is facingdomestic violence charges, accused of assaulting his daughter’s mother, who is pregnant with his second child, according to a criminal complaint. Stefon Diggs, a wide receiver, is facingstrangulation and assault chargesfrom a woman who worked as his private chef.Barmore and Diggs, who both deny the allegations against them, are key contributors to the team. If Barmore grabs a game-clinching sack or Diggs hauls in a crucial catch, will NBC even mention the accusations? If Kraft holds the trophy, will the broadcast do anything butgenuflect to Mr Kraft? Don’t hold your breath.Vrabel’s halo is doing a lot of heavy lifting. But he has been able to wind back the clock to the pre-dynasty days. The Patriots have a lovable coach again and a young star at quarterback, one whose wife bakes pregame cookies. They play as a team. They’ve turned underheralded players into potential champions. They are good and fun and young and even cool again. On the field, they are mostly likable.It only took two decades, six banners, a collapse and an identity transplant. But Vrabel has made most of the team human again. And the funny thing about humans? We tend to root for them.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I’m sure it’s going to be good come race day. They always do a great job here so with the new snow I’m sure it’s going to be good.”Vonn said on Tuesday that she will compete for medals in Cortina even after her injury, which she sustained last week while crashing out of the World Cup downhill in Crans-Montana. The 41-year-old came out of retirement in November 2024 after persistent pain led to surgery to partially replace her right knee earlier that year.Her coach said he believed Vonn can be competitive at the Games. “I’m pretty confident that she can still pull off this dream,” Chris Knight said. “I’ve got no doubts in my mind that this is going to be OK.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Lindsey VonnWinter OlympicsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet having trialled it in San Moritz last week, it has now emerged that the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation quickly banned the helmets on 29 January, saying they “did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape”.Team GB have now appealed the decision to the court of arbitration for sport, arguing the design and manufacture of the helmet meets rigorous safety standards. The appeal will be heard on Thursday, with the verdict expected on Friday. Weston and Wyatt will compete next Thursday and Friday (12 and 13 February).UK Sport has spent £5,765,123 of National Lottery funding on skeleton sliders over the past four years, and has been rewarded with Weston in particular dominating the sport. Last year the 28-year-old became world champion for a second time, beating his closest rival Wyatt by 1.9secs. This season, Weston has won five races and Wyatt two.Speaking just before the Games, UK Sport’s performance director Kate Baker had admitted Team GB had been using new tech in the buildup, especially in skeleton and bobsleigh, and had been using their own wind tunnel to improve performance. “Critically, what’s exciting about the way that the skeleton and bobsleigh programme are now working is that they are fully integrated together,” she said.“They used to be separate programmes. They’re now overseen by the same performance director, Nat Dunman. She has overseen an integrated research and investment programme which has brought some real fruit, as you will see from the performances that we’re already producing,”Asked whether technical upgrades are deliberately held back for the Olympics, Baker added: “Historically, you could turn up at the Games and you could just pull out a totally brand new kit set-up, send the athletes out on it, and they’d suddenly find seconds. You just can’t do that any more.”She added: “Our innovation team at the UK Sports Institute works with a number of critical partners. Whether those are related to Formula One or related to cycling, we now have, which is a unique position for us, our own wind tunnel which we can get into and test consistently, which we are doing with our skeleton athletes.”This is not the first time that the Great Britain’s skeleton team has been the subject of controversy on the eve of a Winter Olympics. In 2018, the Guardian reported that other teams had raised eyebrows that they were usingcustom-made aerodynamic suitsthat provided a “massive” improvement on the conventional equivalents. However, the suits were declared legal by the IBSF.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

Upon turning up in the New York outpost of Lake Placid for their finalWinter Olympicswarm-up competition, Jamaica’s four-man bobsleigh team were informed they were not allowed to take part. A hat-trick of gold medals over the preceding few weeks had seen them rise too high in the world rankings to take their customary place on the second-tier North American Cup circuit. They had simply become too good.In the overwhelming majority of countries, the Winter Olympics is an assortment of sporting oddities held in an alternative climate that might pique attention every four years. Rarely does it break through to the mainstream, which is what makes Jamaican bobsleigh such a curious exception.“There is no meeting that I cannot get, and no conversation that somebody is [not] at least willing to have with me,” says Jamaica Bobsleigh Federation president Chris Stokes. “Not because they know me, and not because they know bobsleigh. But because they know Cool Runnings.”View image in fullscreenThe Jamaican bobsleigh team who first gained fame at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games: Devon Harris, Dudley Stokes, Michael White, Freddy Powell and last-minute replacement Chris Stokes photographed in Kingston, Jamaica in May 1991.Photograph: Paul Harris/Getty ImagesWhen Stokes arrived in the Canadian city of Calgary in February 1988, his sole intention was to watch his brother Dudley drive Jamaica’s four-man bobsleigh on their country’s Winter Olympic debut. Unexpectedly drafted into Dudley’s sled after injury struck one of the other team members, Stokes found a love for the sport that remains strong almost four decades later.He would also go on to become immortalised on the big screen, albeit with a hefty dose of artistic licence. It is 33 years since the release of the Disney film based on Jamaica’s extraordinary 1988 bobsleigh exploits,but awareness of Cool Runnings– and particular soundbites: “Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up, it’s bobsled time!” – still greatly eclipses that of the sport it briefly took to Hollywood.View image in fullscreenThe famous bath scene from Cool Runnings (left) and John Candy pushes the sled (right).Composite: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar; Maximum Film/Alamy“Is it a documentary? No. Is it historical? No. But it’s entertaining, inspirational and it has stood the test of time,” says Stokes. “People draw strength from it. It has changed people’s lives, opened doors, and it is certainly a massive asset we have that we continue to leverage. The only circumstance I see surpassing it is making the Olympic podium.”Even entertaining such a possibility is, admits Stokes, “insane”. Yet that is his precise aim – one that appears closer than ever before. Having competed at four Winter Games and served in various national federation roles over the years, Stokes took up the presidency in 2017 on the basis that it would no longer suffice to be “an inspirational face of bobsleigh, but not really competitive on the ice. We want to win.”Travel limitations of the Covid pandemic dashed any hopes of improvement for the 2022 Winter Olympics, after which Stokes introduced a 10-year strategy with a view to Jamaica winning a bobsleigh medal at the 2034 Games. Central to it was the introduction of the “Back to the Well” programme, focusing on harnessing the athletic talent pool within Jamaica. “Because I believe we have the best athletes in the world,” explains Stokes.View image in fullscreenJamaica’s Shanwayne Stephens, Ashley Watson, Rolando Reid and Matthew Wekpe in action during the four-man bobsleigh heats in Beijing, where they went out after their third run.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersSubsequent converts include the former Jamaica 100m champion Tyquendo Tracey and reigning national 200m champion Ashanti Moore, while Shane Pitter has gone from a fisherman to what Stokes describes as “the most talented young pilot I’ve ever seen” in the space of three years.Pitter will drive the two-man and four-man sleds at the Milano Cortina Games, while the former Team GB bobsleigh athlete Mica Moore will represent Jamaica in the monobob. Aiding Pitter is Team GB’s 2014 Olympic bronze medallist, Joel Fearon, who came on board as a performance coach at the start of this winter and has ended up pushing in both sleds.View image in fullscreenFormer fisherman Shane Pitter (far left) and his Jamaica bobsleigh teammates Andrae Dacres, Junior Harris and Tyquendo Tracey.Photograph: Junior Harris“I didn’t plan to come out of retirement, but there’s still a bit of life left in me,” said the 37-year-old, who stepped back from bobsleigh after his sister, Natasha Morais, was murdered in 2023. “Both my parents are Jamaican, so I’m pushing and coaching the guys at the same time. It’s been busy. I’ve had my hands full. But the athletes are so talented and hungry, which makes the job much easier.”The season has already yielded eight gold medals across all Jamaica sleds in the North American Cup, which sits beneath the top-level World Cup. That tally is more than ever, but acceptance of Jamaica’s success has not been universal. “We want people to show us a bit more respect,” says Fearon.“Some other teams, staff and officials have been treating us like we’re a bit stupid and don’t know what’s going on, not realising that I’m already an Olympic medallist. Almost as if we didn’t belong. It was hurtful, and made the team angry. I had to be on my best behaviour to not get myself in any trouble, because on the GB team it’s something I would never experience.“Some people might not think so, but we’re going to make ourselves fit and make ourselves belong,” adds Fearon, who has a 100m personal best of 9.96 seconds, set in 2016. “We’re looking to show people that we’re here to stay. It’s not just a gimmick.”View image in fullscreenFormer British bobsleigh athlete Mica Moore will represent Jamaica in the monobob.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersAchieving their lofty ambitions by 2034 is no easy task. Still in his infancy as a pilot, Pitter has never been down most European tracks, including the one in Cortina, leaving Fearon to suggest a top-12 finish might be a realistic aim this time around.Jamaica possesses no proper bobsleigh training facilities, with the team based in New York for much of the winter when not competing. Funding is a permanent concern. The federation receives no money from the Jamaica Olympic Association, with the overwhelming majority of income generated from private sponsorship and public fundraising.Jamaica’s four-man sled for Cortina is a South Korea cast‑off that won silver at the 2018 Games, while the two-man sled used to belong to Team USA. Such financial impediments will almost certainly need to be overcome to challenge the likes of the indomitable Germans in the long term. But Stokes is adamant hurdles can be overcome.“One of the things you learn growing up in Jamaica is having money is an illusion,” he says. “I remember seeing Usain Bolt train on a grass track at the University of the West Indies and then break the world record. After that, the money rolled in, but he was already good.“It’s always an error to think that if you have more money things will get better. It is far more important to be resourceful than to have resources. We’re trying to do something great, and you can’t do that with a normal mindset or attitude. You have to be extraordinary in every regard.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJamaica Olympic teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From the fashion capital of Milan to the dramatic peaks of Cortina d’Ampezzo, the Milano Cortina Games – the first to be co-hosted by two cities – will stretch across northern Italy blending world-class winter sport with a strong sense of history and ambition.Sixteen sports and more than 110 gold medals await, from the raw speed of alpine skiing and bobsleigh to the tactical endurance of biathlon and cross-country. Alpine fans will once again be drawn to Mikaela Shiffrin, still redefining excellence across the technical disciplines.Figure skating returns with its familiar blend of artistry and pressure, led by the American phenomenon Ilia Malinin, whose boundary-pushing jumps continue to reshape the sport, while Team GB hope that Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson grasp their opportunity to win Britain’s first figure skating medal since Jayyne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994.Speed skating and its short-track form, where Italy’s home hope Arianna Fontana remains a dominant force, offer drama measured in hundredths of a second. Ice hockey brings physicality and heated rivalries (if you know, you know), with Canada the perennial favourites, and curling – yes, still with the brooms – will remind casual viewers, under the guidance of Team GB’s Bruce Mouat, that precision can be just as gripping as power."

EU member states, however, will need to hold further talks on how to include the UK, including agreeing a list of products that could be procured from British suppliers.The decision comes after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, signalledhe would like to reopen talks with the EUon a defence pact. Negotiations to join the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) programmecollapsed last year.As the current Safe scheme progresses without the UK, the loan for Kyiv offers a more immediate way for the EU and UK to find rapprochement on defence.The loan is a crucial lifeline for Ukraine, which has been enduringmonths of brutal Russian attacks damaging its energy and heating systems, leaving people in the cold and dark, while the country is in the grip of a bitterly cold winter.EU leaders last year agreed to lend Ukraine the money to fill a critical funding gap in 2026 and 2027, as Kyiv risks running out of money to fund its defence, pay public servants and pensions.The loan will be funded by borrowing on capital markets, secured against unused spending in the EU budget. EU leaders alighted on this solution, after disagreeing over the alternative of securing the loan againstRussia’s frozen assets.Under the plan, €60bn is earmarked for Ukraine’s defence and €30bn for general budget support.The EU has said Ukraine would be required to buy military equipment from domestic suppliers, the EU or closely associated countries, such as Norway. But if critical kit was not available in those countries, Kyiv could securepermission from Brussels to buy from other countries, including the USThe intention is to ensure a European preference, but give Kyiv flexibility to buy, for example, US Patriot missile defence systems.The updated version of the proposal, approved on Wednesday, has introduced two new clauses, aimed at giving Kyiv greater flexibility to buy from non-EU countries that have signed security pacts with the union.One clause is aimed at the UK. Ukraine would be allowed to buy military equipment from a country that has committed to “provide a fair and proportionate financial contribution to the costs arising from [EU] borrowing” commensurate with the value of contracts won. In addition, the country should also have a security and defence partnership with the EU and be able to demonstrate it is providing “financial and military support to Ukraine in a significant manner”.The UK and EU signed a security and defence partnership last May as part of the reset.An EU diplomat told the Guardian it made sense to open up the possibility for Ukraine to buy weapons in the UK – and for the UK to make a financial contribution. “It is natural to ask the UK to participate in interest repayment proportionally to the contracts UK firms would obtain. Otherwise EU taxpayers would be subsidising UK industry.”No figure for a “fair” UK financial contribution has been proposed. Some sources say this is a deliberate effort to avoid intense focus on finances, while others say it would be impossible to propose a UK contribution without knowing the UK’s potential involvement.Before Wednesday’s decision, a UK government spokesperson said: “We do not comment on internal EU processes.”The loan now needs to be approved by the European parliament, with the aim of releasing the first tranche of funds from April.According to EU estimates the €90bn covers two-thirds of Ukraine’s funding needs and other “international partners” are expected to fill the gap.Asked whether the UK would be one of the countries to contribute to Ukraine’s financing, the government spokesperson said: “In total, the UK has committed £21.8bn in support for Ukraine through military and fiscal assistance.”Our support for Ukraine is iron-clad. We continue to work with G7 and EU partners to ensure Ukraine can defend itself.”The decision was taken under a special procedure involving 24 of the EU’s 27 member states, after Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia declined to add their support but agreed not to block the plan.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUkraineArms tradeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He also reiterated lies that undocumented people are brought to the US to vote and their participation led to Democratic electoral victories.Democrats say Trump’s immigration crackdown has undermined efforts to combat human traffickingRead moreRepeating false claims that undocumented people vote in large numbers in US elections, Bannonsaid on his War Room showon Tuesday: “You’re damn right we’re gonna have ICE surround the polls come November.”The comments come as elections officials nationwide grow more concerned about potential interference from theTrump administrationin this year’s midterms. One of those fears is that immigration agents will be near polling places or have a heavy footprint in Democratic areas on election day.Law enforcement presence at the polls is generally seen as a negative among election officials, and in some places subject to legal parameters, because it can intimidate voters from casting their ballots. Immigration agents, in particular, have caused people – including US citizens and otherwise legal residents – to stay home for fear of detention or racial profiling.Trump has attempted to take over aspects of elections via an executive order that, among other provisions, would have required proof of citizenship to vote. Courts haveblockedmuch of the order from going into effect, recognizing the states’ roles in managing elections. Congress also has considered bills that would require proof of citizenship, though those efforts appear stalled.In Minnesota, where thousands of agents have surged in the last month, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, issued a set of demands to the state to get the government to draw down its agents. Among those demands: the state turning over its voter rolls to the federal government. The Department of Justice has requested and is suing to get access to the voter rolls in several states, and elections officials have fought back against the requests over privacy and security concerns.“Let’s put you on notice again: ICE is going to be around the polls in the 2026 midterm elections,” Bannon said, adding that the Democrats were mostly “the credentialed class” who keep “the abject poor … on these social welfare programs and never let them off it”.Explore more on these topicsSteve BannonICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was registered at the forum under the banner of HP Trust, which is the family office of Ghandehari and describes itself as having a portfolio value in excess of $10bn (£7.4bn).HP Trust said Farage was an honorary and unpaid adviser since about 2018, but the Reform UK leader disputes that he has ever worked for them and declared no role for the firm on the register.Since Farage’s funding from Ghandehari emerged, questions have been mounting for Reform about a£200,000 donation from a design firm, Interior Architecture Landscape, which counts the Ghandeharis as a major client.The firm is officially owned by a John Richard Simpson, a conveyancer from Potters Bar, and the company insists that the Ghandeharis had no influence on the donation being made.In response to questions about the £200,000 donation, an Interior Architecture Landscape spokesperson said: “We confirm that the company has, in aggregate, approximately £15m in active contracts, including maintenance, refurbishment, and fit-out works, in relation to several properties across the United Kingdom.Get in touchContact Guardian Politics about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

He was also interviewed by Rebel News, a Canadian media outlet thatplatforms far-right contributors, whose reporter questioned Farage on whether he regretted comments about the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson, who has threatened to sue him for wrongly saying his criminal conviction was in relation to violence against a woman.Farage said he was “sorry if he got it slightly wrong” about Robinson’s conviction and added: “I don’t wish to have a fight with him.

Several hundred carers are estimated to have also received fraud convictions.Schofield promised the committee last month he would put right carer’s allowance failures, which have been likened to the Post Office scandal. After outlining how the department would do this, he was accused by one MP of giving out “a lot of blancmange”.In aletterto Schofield published on Wednesday, Abrahams said: “Given the previous assertions by DWP that it would fix carer’s allowance overpayments, I’m sure you can understand my scepticism about your most recent commitments.”Abrahams citedGuardian revelationsabout an internal DWP blog post published in December in which a senior civil servant in the department, Neil Couling, blamed carers themselves for incurring the overpayments.Couling’s view was at odds with a government-commissioned independent review by disability expert Liz Sayce published just days earlier, which found the overpayments were caused bysystemic DWP leadership failures, poor benefit design and unlawful internal staff guidance.“I’m afraid this indicates that a member of your senior team doesn’t accept the findings of the Sayce review (although the government has), which raises questions about the senior team as a whole under your leadership,” Abrahams said.“Moreover, I am concerned that these attitudes may be more widespread, and indicative of a culture within the department that blames claimants for errors and fails to recognise the needs of vulnerable people.”Abrahams said that, while there had been some “constructive” changes to DWP culture, “fundamentally, we believe that the department is failing to put the needs of vulnerable people first, that it is unwilling to learn from its mistakes and that it shows a lack of urgency to bring about change”.She added: “Until the department changes its culture, it will always struggle to build trust with the people it is meant to serve.”Abrahams said a “culture of complacency” existed in the DWP: “[It] has shown repeated inadequacy in its response to mistakes and a lack of urgency when it comes to righting wrongs. You told the committee that DWP has ‘a great track record of putting right when we get things wrong’ – I disagree.”She asks Schofield to write to the committee with evidence of the “action you will be taking in your senior team to address the evident attitudinal issues”, and to set out how he will ensure “the problems are actually addressed this time”.Interviewed by the Guardian in December, Sayce said the DWP needed amanagement and cultural overhaulif it was to restore public trust, adding she had been surprised by the department’s “lack of organisational curiosity” when confronted by evidence of carer’s allowance failings.A DWP spokesperson said: “We inherited a system that let carers down but we’re taking decisive action to put things right. We’ve accepted the vast majority of the Sayce review’s recommendations and have made changes – hiring extra staff, updating internal guidance, and making letters clearer. And we will continue putting things right by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers.”Explore more on these topicsCarersSocial careBenefitsCivil servicePublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

In Norway, rape can be defined as occurring with or without intercourse.The party had taken place in the basement of Skaugum, the official residence of the crown prince and princess, while they were upstairs, he said.On Tuesday, the court was shown four films and 10 pictures apparently taken between 7:12am and 7:17am one morning in December 2018. The prosecution believes the rape without intercourse took place during this time.When on Wednesday the judge asked Høiby about the videos and photos found on his phone, Høiby said: “I don’t even remember taking them.”He told the three judges that he and the woman did have consensual sex, but not while she was asleep. She must have been awake, he said, because “I don’t sleep with women who are not awake.”Within minutes of taking the witness stand, Høiby broke down in tears after saying he found it “incredibly difficult to speak in front of so many people”. The press, he said, had “harassed and tormented” him since he was three years old.He said he had lived a life that “very few here can relate to”, in which there had been a lot of partying and drinking. “I am known for being my mother’s son. Nothing else. I have had an extreme need for validation,” he told the court. “And that manifested itself in a lot of sex, a lot of drugs, and a lot of alcohol.”His testimony came after that of the alleged victim from the party. She told the court she remembered briefly having sex with Høiby earlier in the evening before she stopped it,but had had no recollection of the alleged rape until she was contacted by police who showed her the footage.She told the court that in the footage she had been “completely unconscious” and that learning of it felt like “a betrayal and a shock”.She said she had never seen herself like that and had never experienced that kind of memory loss. She said she believed she had been drugged.Breaking down in tears, she said she did not want to be a victim, adding: “Unfortunately, I have been, thanks to Marius Borg Høiby.”Høiby said he believed that alcohol and drugs were consumed at the party, but that: “Before this came up, this is not an evening that has lingered so much in my mind.”Asked whether he remembers taking any pictures, he said: “I don’t remember taking them myself, but we had sex completely awake and voluntarily. I don’t remember much of that sex either.”He said he stored sexual photos and videos in a separate app on his phone because “I don’t want to scroll past a lot of nude photos”. He added: “It’s never been for anyone else but me anyway.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The hottest summer followed the driest spring in over 100 years in southern England. And although making hay while the sun shines is genuinely crucial, rain is critical to growth. Last year produced a very poor harvest, and hay is now running out.Traditionally, two cuts are made, in late spring and summer, doubling the yield. It’s an ancient, ingenious and hopeful system, and in the case of meadow hay (rather than single-species ryegrass) it benefits nature, removing nutrient‑laden grass and encouraging biodiversity. But long-term studies show that as our weather patterns change,grass-growing potential has declined greatlyover the last 80 years.View image in fullscreenLow hay stocks in the barn, which are protected from the elements to a degree.Photograph: Nicola ChesterLast year, many farms could only make one cut of a thin, drought-stricken sward. It didn’t grow back. To compound the issue, many began using hay as feed in summer. Olly Morris, a hay merchant in nearby Thatcham, warned early that yields were down 60%. Prices for small bales, usually £4-£5, have doubled to £8-£10, reflecting the haulage costs from further afield.I open another bale to feed our chestnut mare. I’ve lost my bale cutter knife, so I pick up the orange twine from the previous bale, find the knot in it, tuck it under the strings of the new one and seesaw it till the string breaks, and the bale bursts open in sweet-smelling summer goodness. A quick sniff tells me there’s no trace of mould. The dog attends. Once, a tennis ball rolled out from a sprung bale, and she’s remained ever hopeful.View image in fullscreenHorses stand beside the hay trailer in a field of parched grass, summer 2025.Photograph: Nicola ChesterThe horse munches her hay rhythmically, pulling it from a stuffed hay net, which makes it last longer, mimicking grazing and preventing wastage and trampling.

Outside, a mistle thrush carols into the wind and rain. It’s been such a wet January, but perhaps there’ll be early warmth, the muddy fields will recover, and the grass will grow again.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024, is available now atguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentCountry diaryRural affairsFarmingWinterHorsesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The scheme does not require criminals to serve the remainder of their sentence in the second country, meaning Lecka will walk free.The father told the Guardian that, after feeling some relief from the sentencing that the matter was closed and the family could move on, it was “upsetting and frustrating” to learn of Lecka’s imminent deportation.“All the work that was done, the public money that was spent, the trauma of sitting through the trial, seeing all the evidence – now all of that seems a bit pointless, because the actual sentence is not being served.”As well as their personal upset, he said he and other victims’ families were worried that the nursery worker could harm other children in Poland. “Lecka was refused bail on multiple occasions during her period in pre-trial custody, identified as a flight risk and a risk to the public,” he said.“The concern was she would flee to Poland … but now, after all this time, pain, the vast expense and emotional trauma of the investigation, trial and sentencing, we effectively end up at the same point. All we have as victims is the verdict and the notion of a sentence. Justice has in this case sadly not been done.”Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, told the Guardian she had been contacted by victims’ families who were “horrified” to learn of Lecka’s deportation.“Let’s not forget she was convicted of child cruelty to 21 babies,” Wilson said. “The families want justice to be served, but many of them are also concerned that she may go on to harm children in Poland and elsewhere.“I understand that our prisons are full and that ministers are trying to free up prison space, and, with foreign nationals, wanting to deport them as quickly as they can. But victims want to see justice done. This policy potentially means that serious offenders are evading justice, and that seems pretty unfair.”After raising the matter in parliament and writing to theHome Office, Wilson was told by ministers that, due to time on remand before her trial, Lecka had become eligible for deportation on 7 October 2025 – less than a fortnight after receiving her eight-year sentence. She will be barred indefinitely from returning to the UK.Recent changes to the early removal schemereduced the proportion of a sentence foreign offenders must serve before being eligible for deportation from 50% to 30%. Further changes due to come into force this year will allow foreign criminals to be deported as soon as they are sentenced, which critics say means they will effectively escape justice.“These early removal schemes … are a really blatant example of the administration prioritising removals over criminal justice,” said Sarah Singer, a professor of refugee law at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. “They think it would be a political point scorer, but for the families of the victims this is deeply distressing.“It seems that that interest in removing people from the UK dwarfs any interest in ensuring people serve prison time. I’m sure that it’s also informed by the overcrowding crisis that we have in prisons at the moment. But they’re simply trying to offload the problem. It doesn’t actually address the issue.”The Home Office was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSentencingUK criminal justiceLondonPolandHome OfficeMigrationPrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, the outcome of a coroner’s inquest must not be inconsistent with a murder conviction in criminal proceedings.At a hearing in Warrington last week, Letby’s barrister, Mark McDonald, said the law meant the inquests were “not the forum to re-litigate the convictions”. However, he said it was important for the coroner to understand how each baby died and that there were “systemic failings” at the hospital.Richard Baker KC, representing a number of the bereaved families, told the hearing last week the inquests must not be used as a “collateral attack on the convictions”.Lucy Letby will face no new charges, Crown Prosecution Service saysRead moreHe said the coroner was “bound by those convictions and cannot act in any way that is inconsistent with them”.Devonish told the barristers: “At this point in time, how the babies died has been determined by the verdict of a criminal trial. If there’s an appeal we can revisit that question at this point.”On Wednesday, the coroner said she would adjourn the five inquests until the outcome of a public inquiry by Lady Justice Kathryn Thirlwall, which examined the deaths and is due to publish its report in the coming months.A provisional date for the full inquest hearings has been set for 14 to 25 September, with an internal review set for 5 May.An inquest into the death of a sixth baby, Child D, which was originally opened and suspended in 2016 was further suspended on Wednesday.An inquest into the death of a seventh newborn, Baby A, was held in October 2016 in which a narrative conclusion was recorded, saying it could not be determined what caused the child’s collapse and subsequent death or whether it was due to a natural or unnatural event. The family of Baby A do not want the inquest reopened.The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, has been examining the convictions since February last year.Letby has twice unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the convictions at the court of appeal in London.Prosecutors announced last month that Letby would not face further charges after considering a file of evidence from Cheshire constabulary.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had considered 11 new offences: two of murder and two of attempted murder in relation to two babies who died, and seven of attempted murder in relation to seven babies who survived.The new allegations included the alleged murder of a baby at the Countess of Chester hospital and another at Liverpool Women’s hospital.However, the CPS said the evidence did not meet the test required to bring fresh charges.Cheshire constabulary is continuing an investigation into three former senior Countess of Chester bosses who were arrested last year on suspicion of alleged corporate manslaughter or gross negligence manslaughter.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyCheshireChesternewsShareReuse this content"

The programme focused on a pair of pellet production sites in British Columbia, and the company accused the broadcaster of repeating “inaccurate claims about biomass” from “ill-informed” critics.In the days following the broadcast, the company’s chief executive, Will Gardiner, responded to a letter from Jacob Rees-Mogg, then energy secretary, which raised questions about the documentary’s findings. He assured the government that Drax was complying with its subsidy requirements. A senior policy manager offered similar assurances to civil servants.Gardiner wrote: “I have positioned sustainably sourced biomass to be at the heart of Drax. This requires careful and robust governance and traceability.”View image in fullscreenLog piles at Drax’s Burns Lake wood pellet plant log yard in British Columbia, Canada.Photograph: Desiree Wallace/ Stand.earthHowever, court documents provided to several news organisations, including the Guardian, have raised fresh questions about whether the guarantees given by Drax to ministers, civil servants and the industry regulator Ofgem after the broadcast could be justified at the time.Drax responded to the BBC documentary by claiming that 80% of the material used to make its biomass pellets was sawmill residue – “sawdust, wood chips and bark left over when the timber is processed” – and that the rest was waste material.The Guardian revealed last year that forestry experts believe the company has continued as recently as last summer to source 250-year-old trees from some of Canada’s oldest forests via the Burns Lake pellet plant.Rowaa Ahmar, the company’s former head of public affairs, took Drax to court alleging that she was sacked after writing to Gardiner in the weeks following the broadcast to warn that the company was “misleading the public, government and its regulator” about the sustainability of the imported pellets.Ahmar gave evidence to the tribunal that the BBC’s allegations against Drax triggered a “level of chaos that I have never seen before”, and that her work after the documentary’s revelations demonstrated that the allegations “were correct and that Drax had been misleading the public, government and its regulator”.Her witness statement claims that Drax’s head of compliance admitted in an email to colleagues in the days after the broadcast that the company might have burnt old-growth pellets from Meadowbank and Burns Lake “consistently” at its North Yorkshire plant since “at least 2019”.The compliance boss warned that, if this were true, Drax would have committed a “significant misreporting of burn data” under the government’s subsidy schemes, according to Ahmar’s witness statement.Ahmar’s statement claims that, in the weeks that followed, the compliance chief explained during an in-person meeting with Ahmar that Drax did not have enough data to prove the exact origin of all its wood pellets, meaning that the company could not prove that its biomass was sustainable and legal under the government’s requirements.Paul Sheffield, the company’s chief commercial officer, said he had also been aware of these concerns. He said in a witness statement that he had been aware that the head of compliance “had some concerns about our ability to fully evidence the points we were making around Panorama” and that these concerns were laterraised with Drax’s executive committee.Further concerns were raised in an online meeting between Ahmar and a second member of the company’s compliance team, according to Ahmar’s statement, in which the staff member explained that Drax did not measure every log used for biomass sustainability but that “we represent to Ofgem that we do”. The tribunal documents do not suggest that Gardiner was aware of the concerns raised by some Drax executives when he first denied the BBC’s allegations.View image in fullscreenA sample of the biomass fuel pellets used at the Drax power station.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersGardiner said in his witness statement that he had been advised by his head of corporate affairs before the broadcast that it would “not have a significant impact or fallout” but that after the revelations the company had called “a crisis meeting” as it faced questions “both from within Drax and externally”.His statement said the team in the UK “dealing with the fallout” were “not very connected with the team on the ground in Canada”, meaning that it had been a “challenge” to collect all the information needed to respond in a public statement and to the government.“From very early on in our response to the Panorama programme it became clear to me that we needed to carry out a full review of the allegations made,” Gardiner said. His statement denied Ahmar’s suggestion that he had resisted a review over fears of what it might uncover.In a witness statement, Jonathan Oates, director of external affairs at Drax, said the focus after the BBC documentary had been “on getting correct information out there in rebuttal” to the allegations. “The number one rule of public relations is that you do not lie,” Oates said.Clare Harbord, the company’s former corporate affairs director, told the court that all the external statements made by the company had been “signed off by numerous people across the business” and that the “amount of cross-checking was extraordinary, meticulous and robust”.The consultancy KPMG was tasked with reviewing the data Drax had provided to the regulator and the public statements made after the broadcast almost a month after the allegations emerged. Drax has declined to make the findings of the review public.Ahmar left Drax in January 2024 after a period of “special leave” from her role. She reached a settlement with the company over the employment tribunal claim last year. Drax said the company and Ahmar had “reached a mutually agreeable position, without admission of liability”.A spokesperson for Drax said the claims made against the company in the tribunal were “thoroughly and seriously investigated through our internal processes, an independent report by a leading employment KC and separate reports by a third-party on our biomass sourcing”.The spokesperson added: “We provided all relevant material from this investigation to our regulator, Ofgem. Following their separate investigation, which ended in August 2024, Ofgem concluded that they did not find any evidence that we had been issued with [subsidies] incorrectly or that our biomass does not meet the government’s sustainability threshold. Ofgem also found no evidence of deliberate misreporting.”The 16-month Ofgem investigation, which was not focused on the issuing of subsidies to Drax, found that there had been “an absence of adequate data governance and controls in place” when it came to profiling the sources of wood used by the company from Canada between April 2021 and the end of March 2022. Draxagreed to pay £25min compensation for the breach.A separate investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority continues. It is investigating “historical statements” made by Drax about the sourcing of pellets.Drax – which produced 10% of Great Britain’s electricity in 2024 – was once western Europe’s largest coal-fired power station but committed to replacing coal with compressed wood biomass pellets in 2012 and completed the shift in 2023.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryBiomass and bioenergyRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

I refuse to sit idly by and let that happen,” Pritzker said.Face masks ‘inadequate’ and should be swapped for respirators, WHO is advisedRead moreHe added: “By joining the World Health Organization’s coordinated network, GOARN, we are ensuring that our public health leaders – and the public – have the information, expertise and partnerships they need to protect the people of our state. Across our state and alongside valued partners around the world,Illinoiswill continue to put science, preparedness and people first.”Illinois’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, echoed the governor’s remarks, saying: “We will always choose the health of our people over political grandstanding or misinformation, and we will remain focused on what keeps families and communities safe.”Through its membership in GOARN, Illinois will gain direct access to global early-warning alerts and outbreak intelligence, as well as opportunities for technical collaboration and surge support during major public health emergencies. The state will also participate in international training programs, exercises and best-practice exchanges, Pritzker’s office said.Illinois’s move comes after Trump made the decision to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) upon retaking office last year. The US had been the WHO’s largest donor, accounting for about 18% of its total funding. Its departure led to theloss of nearly a quarterof the WHO’s workforce – about 2,000 jobs – from a total staff of roughly 9,400.Trump’s withdrawal of the US drew widespread condemnation from medical organizations including theAmerican Medical Association, as well as theUN. At the time, Trump accused the WHO of failing to act independently due to “inappropriate political influence of WHO member states”.He also criticized the organization’s funding structure, complaining of “unfairly onerous payments” from the US, andsaidlast January: “World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more.”After the US withdrawal, Illinoisjoinedthe Governor’s Public Health Alliance last October, a coalition of 15 governors – including those from New York and California – “committed to protecting their states from the Trump administration’s erosion of trust and dismantlement of America’s public health infrastructure”.Explore more on these topicsIllinoisWorld Health OrganizationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He was a founding member of the 5th Dimension, a vocal group whose smooth pop and soul sounds with a touch of psychedelia brought them big hits in the 1960s and 70s.McLemore died on Tuesday aged 90 at his home in Las Vegas, surrounded by his family, his representative Jeremy Westby said in a statement. He died of natural causes after having a stroke.The 5th Dimension had broad crossover success and won six Grammy awards including record of the year twice, for 1967’s Up, Up and Away and 1969’s Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In. Both songs were also top 10 pop hits, with Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In, a mashup of songs from the musical Hair, spending six weeks at No 1.McLemore had a parallel career as a sports and celebrity photographer whose pictures appeared in magazines including Jet.The St Louis-born McLemore had served in the US navy, where he worked as an aerial photographer. He played baseball in the Los Angeles Dodgers’ farm system and settled in southern California, where he began making use of his warm bass voice and skill with a camera.He sang in a jazz ensemble, the Hi-Fi’s, with future 5th Dimension bandmate Marilyn McCoo. The group opened for Ray Charles in 1963, but broke up the following year.Later, McLemore, McCoo and two of his childhood friends from St Louis, Billy Davis Jr and Ronald Towson, along with schoolteacher Florence LaRue, formed a singing group called the Versatiles in 1965, and signed to singer Johnny Rivers’ new label,SoulCity Records.Rivers told the group, his first signees, that their name wasn’t current enough. Towson came up with the 5th Dimension, a name that would echo the sprinkling of psychedelia and hippy culture the group embraced.Their breakthrough hit came in 1967 with the Mamas & the Papas’ song Go Where You Wanna Go.That same year they released the Jimmy Webb-penned Up, Up and Away, which would go to No 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song would later win four Grammys: record of the year, best contemporary single, best performance by a vocal group and best contemporary group performance.McLemore is survived by his wife of 30 years, Mieko McLemore, daughter Ciara, son Darin, sister Joan and three grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockSoulnewsShareReuse this content"

No one has claimed responsibility.Sa’idu Baba Ahmed, a politician in the Kaiama region, said gunmen had rounded up residents, bound their hands behind their backs and killed them. The attackers also torched homes and shops. “As I’m speaking to you now, I’m in the village along with military personnel, sorting dead bodies and combing the surrounding areas for more,” he told Reuters.He said many people had fled into surrounding bushland with gunshot wounds and that the whereabouts of several people, including the village’s traditional king, were unknown.Residents told Reuters the gunmen were jihadists who often preached in the village and that they demanded that locals ditch their allegiance to the Nigerian state and switch to sharia law. When the villagers pushed back, the militants opened fire during Tuesday’s sermon, they said.According to Amnesty International the gunmen killed more than 170 people, razed homes and looted shops. “The security lapses that enabled these attacks are unacceptable,” the rights group said, adding that the gunmen had been sending “warning” letters to the villagers for more than five months.Map of Nigeria showing KajamaThe Kwara state governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, condemned the attack as “a cowardly expression of frustration by terrorist cells following the ongoing counter-terrorism campaigns in parts of the state”.Kwara borders Niger state, which is targeted increasingly by armed groups. The military recently carried out operations in the area against what it called “terrorist elements”.Nigeria is in the grip of interlinked security crises, including a jihadist insurgency in the north-east and north-west, a surge in looting and kidnapping for ransom by armed groups known as “bandits” in the north-west and north-central regions, and intercommunal violence in central states.At least two groups operating in the country are affiliated with IS: an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as Islamic State WestAfricaProvince in the north-east, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province, known locally as the Lakurawa, which is prominent in the north-west.The military has said in the past that the Lakurawa has its roots in neighbouring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria’s border communities since a 2023 military coup.In a separate attack on Tuesday, gunmen killed at least 13 people in Doma village in the Faskari area in Katsina state in the north-west, police said on Wednesday. Last week, armed extremists in the north-east killed at least 36 people during separate attacks on a construction site and on an army base.Tuesday’s attack in Katsina state happened despite a series of peace deals brokered between armed groups of motorcycle-riding bandits and villagers in the 11 local government councils most affected by the violence in the state. The deals were negotiated by community elders and traditional rulers and reportedly backed by local authorities. Faskari, a predominantly farming and animal husbandry area, was one of those councils.The Nigerian military has intensified operations against jihadists and armed bandits and regularly claims to have killed huge numbers of fighters.The military said last month that it had launched “sustained coordinated offensive operations against terrorist elements” in Kwara state and achieved notable successes.Local media reported that the army had “neutralised” or killed 150 people. In a statement on 30 January the army said that troops had also “stormed remote camps hitherto inaccessible to security forces where several abandoned camps and logistics enablers were destroyed, significantly degrading the terrorists’ sustainment capability”.In response to the myriad insecurity woes, local authorities in Kwara state imposed curfews in certain areas and had closed schools for several weeks before ordering them to reopen on Monday.Insecurity in Africa’s most populous country has been under intense scrutiny in recent months since the US president, Donald Trump,alleged a “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria.The claim has been rejected by the Nigerian government and many independent experts, who say the country’s security crises claim the lives of Christians and Muslims, often without distinction.On Tuesday, Gen Dagvin Anderson, head of the US Africa Command, said the US had deployed a small military team to Nigeria, where Trump’s administration has alternately put pressure on and aided the government as it fights jihadist violence.Anderson said at a virtual news conference that the two countries had agreed to “increase collaboration”.Despite these efforts, many in the north and south of the country claim the authorities are not doing enough to combat the violence and are instead focused on politics. Hours before the Doma massacre unfolded, thousands of supporters of the ruling All Progressives Congress party travelled on roads where raids have happened in recent years to Katsina’s state capital, where they participated in a rally endorsing its governor for next year’s general elections.Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Lepas cars will be built initially in China and imported to the UK, which does not have the tariffs imposed by the US and EU, but the government is hopeful it will eventually decide to manufacture cars in Britain.Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest automotive employer, is in early-stage discussions over a potential deal to use its factories to make Chery cars but no agreement has been announced.The new brand launch comes a week after Chery said it would open aresearch and development headquarters in Liverpoolfor commercial vehicles.Chery has been the largest exporter of cars fromChinafor 23 years but did not make significant inroads in Europe because it focused on cheaper models for other regions such as the Middle East.The rise of electric cars and heavy government subsidies for Chinese manufacturers, however, have allowedcompanies such as Chery, BYD and the MG owner SAICto take on European and Japanese carmakers.Chery launched its Omoda brand in 2024, Jaecoo in January 2025 and its eponymous brand last summer. It sold 53,600 of those cars in 2025 in the UK, or 2.7% of the market. That meant it outdid BYD, Tesla and the German-owned Mini, and easily outsold Japanese rivals such as Honda and Mazda.In January, Chery sold nearly 6,100 cars in the UK, most of which were hybrids combining a smaller battery with a petrol engine, according to figures from New Automotive, a thinktank.The sales figures also suggested that Tesla’s sales slump continued, with only 650 sales recorded, fewer than half the 1,400 recorded in January 2025. The US carmaker’s European sales have been hit by an ageing model lineup as well as consumer distaste for the chief executive Elon Musk’s support for far-right politicians. Tesla’s sales were less than half the 1,326 electric sales of BYD, which last year overtook it to become the world’s biggest seller of battery electric cars.Chery has not yet committed to manufacturing in the UK, but it has indicated that it is considering doing so. Its UK director, Victor Zhang, said in June it was“actively considering” building a UK plantas part of a “localisation” strategy.The company has said repeatedly it wants to pursue an “in UK, for UK, be UK” strategy, suggesting that setting up manufacturing would be a serious option.The Lepas brand – a madeup word referring vaguely to leopards – appears to be positioned as a mass-market offering, emphasising “fun”. Its Jaecoo brand, in contrast, has been described by some as a “Range Rover clone”, albeit for a much cheaper price.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinaMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

The sector ranges from the hotel and catering industries to legal and financial firms.The survey was released as investors attempted to digest the implications of artificial intelligence expected to automate work in the publishing and legal software industries.On Tuesday, Anthropic, the company behind thechatbot Claude, said its tool could automate legal work, sending shares in publishers and data companies falling sharply. Thesell-off in those companiesbegan in London and spread through global markets, continuing into Wednesday despite the FTSE 100 hitting a record high.Some of those industries employ large numbers of staff in entry level positions, meaning they have been more badly affected by rises in the national living wage and increases in employers’ national insurance contributions since last April.This has occurred against a backdrop of widespread rising costs, such as higher energy and food prices, as well as ashake-up of business ratesthat will push up some bills and has sparked criticism of the government by companies.However, business activity in the services sector got off to a good start overall in 2026 after a weak final quarter, with output rebounding to a five-month high.The PMI survey indicated activity had risen to a balance of 54 in January, up from 51.4 in December, and was the fastest pace of expansion since August. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below suggests contraction.When combined withJanuary’s PMI survey for manufacturing, the combined reading showed business activity in the UK at a 17-month high in January.The survey said part of the improvement came from a lift in sentiment after the budget in late November ended months of speculation about potential tax rises, and delayed projects and investment could begin again.Expectations for an upturn in business activity were also the strongest since October 2024, when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, imposed unexpectedly big tax rises on companies in her first budget despite companies’ concerns about geopolitical risks and weak consumer demand.Explore more on these topicsServices sectorEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”View image in fullscreenIllustration shows the Pinterest app.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.The script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.The source, who the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.Ready said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.The chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.It comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, asbusinesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week,Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 rolesworldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.Explore more on these topicsPinterestSocial mediaSoftwareInternetJob lossesTechnology sectorDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Did her mother’s howl of distress need to be broadcast?Lucy ManganWed 4 Feb 2026 03.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 11.24 ESTShareThe Investigation of Lucy Letby is at least the fifth documentary that has been produced in the wake of the neonatal nurse’s convictions in 2023 and 2024 on seven counts of murder and seven of attempted murder of babies in her care at the Countess of Chester hospital. Probably the best of them was ITV’sLucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt?last summer. It did a fine job of meticulously explaining the evidence against her – and why a growing body of experts believe that at the very least her conviction on the basis of what was gathered is unsafe, and at most that none of the babies were murdered by her, but were victims of a chronically understaffed and mismanaged unit that might have sought to scapegoat an individual for its failings.The Investigation ofLucy Letbydoes not compare in its attention to detail, preferring a broader-brush, more emotive telling of the story of either one of the most prolific female serial killers in history or one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in recent times. Its publicity has made much of the fact that it contains hitherto unseen footage of Letby’s arrest at her parents’ home. Her mother and father say they were unaware that it would be shown until Letby’s barrister told them. “We will not watch it – it would likely kill us if we did.” When the footage is shown, you can hear her mother howl in distress as the police take Letby away. It is an almost inhuman sound. It is hard to say what value such an inclusion adds except to warn the viewer to brace themselves for sensationalism along the way as the case is pieced together using accounts from the police, people – from both sides – directly involved with the case, Letby’s best friend Maisie and Letby’s current lawyer (not the one who represented her in court), Mark McDonald, along with media reporting from the time and tapes of her interviews with investigators.The first hour of the 90-minute programme lays out the police and prosecution’s case. It includes the spike in infant deaths and catastrophic collapses between 2015 and 2016, the correlation between their occurrence and Letby’s presence on the unit and the fact that they stopped happening when she was removed from the unit. There is also the matter of the 250-patient handover sheets – confidential documents – brought home from work and filed in date order in a box marked “Keep”, plus the Post-it notes found during a police search of her home. On the latter Letby had written “I am evil”, “I did this” and other such apparently conclusively damning phrases. The expert witness brought in by police and who testified at the trial, retired paediatrician Dewi Evans, asserted that certain symptoms in the babies could only point to deliberate attempts to harm, often by inducing air embolisms in the babies.The last half-hour is spent with McDonald and Dr Shoo Lee pulling apart most (not all – we do not get an explanation of the handover sheets, which Letby says she accidentally brought home then couldn’t properly dispose of, despite a shredder being found in the house) of the evidence. McDonald notes that the trial judge was, in a very unusual move, emailed by a court of appeal judge during the trial to state “in robust terms” the latter’s concerns that Evans might be a witness whose evidence could be tailored as needed. The Post-it notes were written on the advice of the therapist provided by the NHS to Letby after the spike in infant deaths. According to Letby at her police interview, they were a product of her terrible fear that “I might have hurt them without knowing, through my practice”. They also contain such phrases as “slander”, “discrimination”, “victimisation”, born of the feeling that the unit – which Maisie says had always been “cliquey” – was using her to distract from systemic failures. The drop in mortality rates when Letby left can be attributed to the fact that the unit was downgraded at the same time and started treating fewer sick children.McDonald (who became involved with the case only after Letby’s convictions) contacted Lee, the author of the paper from which Evans had drawn most of his conclusions, and Lee said they were mistaken and convened a panel of independent experts to go through the clinical notes, finding alternative explanations for all the prosecution’s theories and therefore, as he said to an assembled press, “no murders”.The film includes contributions from the anonymised mother of one of the babies, which are of course heartbreaking. But it is a weighty decision to include them. They are there to make good television for the producers, pull in viewers and tug on their emotions and even if this is not the intention, they run emotional interference between them and a rational appraisal of the facts. Which, even on this partial telling, surely need revisiting in a court of law. Reports are with the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Its decision is expected in autumn. Everyone’s suffering continues.The Investigation of Lucy Letby is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLucy LetbyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Where the witches of the original can seem like a plot device – a means to trigger Macbeth’s ambition – here, the supernatural is all-encompassing. “I am doing the bidding of the gods,” says Aderemi, with conviction.View image in fullscreenFrom warrior to despot … Kehinde Bankole and Deyemi Okanlawon, with Jude Akuwudike in the background.Photograph: Robling PhotographyIn Mojisola Kareem’s production forUtopiaand Sheffield Theatres, Esu (Patrice Naiambana) is a deity as real in his pointy cap and red rags as the amulets and shells that cast spells over the characters.

They have good reason for their ambition.The Rat Trap review – teenage Noël Coward’s jaundiced marital portraitRead moreGood to see Oyebisi sticking it out to the end, with no intervening madness; but in setting himself free from Shakespeare’s words, Agboluaje also lessens the psychological insight. Aderemi is not given to reflection and, as the play goes on, it seems less about him than about the social impact of his actions.The playwright shifts the focus to the politics of succession, the royal houses negotiating their corners while trying to contain a headstrong leader. As the throne dangles in midair, suspended by streams of blood on Kevin Jenkins’s set, this is a play about power and governance. “It must never happen again,” says a survivor of the carnage, a warning we could apply to the demagogues of today.AtCrucible, Sheffield, until 7 February.Then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreSheffield TheatresMacbethreviewsShareReuse this content"

The perennially resplendent Kelly Rowland is Leah, a boss babe morning TV producer in line to replace her retiring boss (the omnipresent Matt Walsh) as showrunner. Just as she’s poised to break the glass ceiling, the network higher-ups stick her in a bake-off with Jarrett, a ringer from her romantic past played with devil charm by Method Man. The promise of one of Destiny’s Children playing the will they/won’t they game with the hunk of the Wu-Tang Clan could well prove too strong a lure to stop the scores who grew up on their music from clicking on the Prime Video thumbnail just out of nostalgic curiosity.Iron Lung review – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horrorRead moreIt’s a tractor beam made stronger by director Linda Mendoza’s extraordinarily fast pace. I mean, those 90 minutes just breeze by. Relationship Goals’s three-headed writer team – led by Michael Elliott, whose credits include Queen Latifah’s Just Wright and Beyoncé’s Carmen hip-hopera – are bracingly efficient with their paint-by-numbers set-up. Leah’s besties – Treese, the tragically single makeup girl (Flamin’ Hot’s Annie Gonzalez); Brenda, the wistful morning anchor (A Black Lady Sketch Show’s Robin Thede), Roland, the omniscient assistant (Pose’s Ryan Jamaal Swain) – helpfully fast-talk through backstory points and punctuate scenes with snappy one-liners and winks at the audience. (Brenda titles her emergency engagement plan: Project Put a Ring on It.) Only Dennis Haysbert slows things down as Leah’s grieving father, but not enough to be a drag.The film’s genre and millennial-coded winsomeness make it easy to forgive its purposeful misunderstanding of how TV news works. (Two New York Cityproducers up for a top network job got athree-weekdeadline to nail a Valentine’s Day puff piece? Come on, cupid, be for real.) And a soundtrack, that whips from Victoria Monét to the Doobie Brothers and ends with a duet from the leads called Complicated, helps us forget about the truly mortal danger Leah puts Jarrett in to ensure their cliched airport denouement via an empty bomb threat. (“I’m tryna cater and Spotify you with baby makers,” Johnny Blaze spits in a word salad line that, at the very least, explicitly makes clear where listeners can stream the track.) It’s only after you’ve watched the trailer and committed to the feature that you realize that this PG-13 experience is actually meant to be a faith-based film for women who may be spending Valentine’s Day alone.Its true star is Michael Todd, a rising star in a new generation of prosperity gospel-hawkingsneaker preachers. This film takes its title from his bestselling book – which, among other things, delivers homilies about dating with intention while likening women who don’t as “chicken nuggets”.This movie has been seen before. Fourteen years ago, Family Feud’s Steve Harvey spun his relationship manual into the blockbuster Think Like a Man franchise and was roundly criticized for smiling as he reheated old-school misogyny – or “the toxic butthole of patriarchy”, as Leah might call it. TD Jakes, theOprah- and Diddy-approvedmegachurch leader has been spinning his bestselling polemics into film allegories about feminine submission for years (So it’s no surprise to find one of Jakes’s screenwriters, Cory Tynan, on this).Todd is deeply embedded in Relationship Goals: the characters venerate him as an expert. Leah and Jarrett make him and his wife, Natalie, the principal subjects of their Valentine’s Day puff piece, which playstwice.They make a pilgrimage to Todd’s Tulsa, Oklahoma-based megachurch for Sunday service – and not necessarily to tee up Method Man for an off-key rendition of Keyshia Cole’s Love in a road trip sequence, or for Rowland to wash away her sins against cinema inTyler Perry’s Mea Culpa. Stripped of its nostalgic familiarity and romantic frustration, Relationship Goals is no better than an extended infomercial for Todd’s ministry produced by DeVon Franklin, another canny sneaker preacher who nested his pulpit in Hollywood ages ago.Earlier this month, the comedian Druski produced asketchwhere he played a sneaker preacher who drop-wires on to the pulpit in a smoke shroud rocking peacock colors and flashy chains to “impregnate everyone with the word of God”. The parody, which racked up 43m views in a day and ignited raging debates about extravagant megachurch pageantry corrupting spiritual focus, was no doubt inspired by Todd – who infamously wiped his own phlegm on the eyes of a worshipper to illustrate a parable about Jesus healing the blind. (Although Todd did say he found Druski’s sketch funny.)Relationship Goals is no less parochial a take on marriage, presented yet again as a woman’s only path to true and lasting peace in life. If you can turn a blind eye to that message and focus on the familiar funny faces instead, the tractor-beam ride to the credits is heavenly enough.Relationship Goals is now available on Amazon PrimeExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsComedy filmsAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Throw the book away and step into the madness of undeniable chemistry and explosive toxic desire.”Veteran film writer Anne Thompsonpredictedthe film “will open well and soar at the box office”, calling it “a rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd pleaser. Both Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie will come out ahead. Audiences will fall for Emerald Fennell’s garish visuals and unrestrained direction. Everything is BIG.”Box office pundit Scott Mendelsonconcurred, saying that the film “rocks” and praising its “big-budget production value and cinematic style value we once took for granted” but also suggesting “it works on its own terms as a nuanced romantic tragedy”.A slight note of caution was voiced by Brandon Norwood, whocalledthe film “a tad too long” but said its stars are “explosive together. Their chemistry leaps off the screen.” “And yeah it’s hot,” he emphasises. “It’s horny.”Fennell’s film has already been met with some scepticism by Brontë purists for its anachronistic approach to costume design, apparent embrace of BDSM, and the casting of 35-year-old Robbie as the 19-year-old Cathy and the white Elordi as Heathcliff, a character generally understood to be of Romany origin.Fennell has defended her approach, saying: “There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it”, and emphasising that her adaptation is a personal take, and one among many.“The great thing about this movie is that it could be made every year and it would still be so moving and so interesting,” she said. “There are so many different takes. I think every year we should have a new one.”The film is released worldwide on 13 February.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordWed 4 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 02.03 ESTShareJust when I thought I was out … just when I thought I would no longer have that sweeping, ever so slightly irritating theme tune ringing around my head for hours on end, or feel the need to remember the difference between House Tyrell, Tully or Arryn, I suddenly find myself pulled back in to the Game of Thrones extended universe. The blame for this goes to A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, thelikably low-key Game of Thrones spin-off seriesabout a cloth-eared hedge knight and his shrewd child squire currently ambling through its first season on HBO/Sky Atlantic.Before its arrival, I had departed Westeros for good. My faith had first been shaken by that rushed, badly plotted final season of Game of Thrones proper, which bashed to bits six previous seasons’ worth of finely tuned political intrigue and fascinating character dynamics in a succession of endless (often badly lit) CGI-laden battles, before flambéing them in dragon fire. Worse came with House of the Dragon, a dreary, po-faced, endlessly withholding slog of a prequel series, the enjoyment of which seemed to rest entirely on whether the viewer was familiar with deep lore buried within a Westeros history book that George RR Martin wrote instead ofcracking on with that sixth novel. If, like me, you were not, the show proved to be little more than a confusing conveyor belt of platinum-haired poshos glowering at each other. Oh and dragons. So many dragons.For my money, the dragons were always the worst bit of Game of Thrones. They were just about tolerable, or ignorable at least, when they were scrawny lizards perched on the shoulder of Daenerys Targaryen, but as they grew, season by season, they began to dominate proceedings, and tipped the show over into the deep waters of the fantasy genre. Pre-dragons, if you squinted extremely hard, you could just about convince yourself that you were basically watching afantasy-tinged version of Wolf Hall, with its noble families clandestinely scheming away against each other. That was the real magic trick of Thrones, to convince those of us usually unwilling to dip our toes into fantasy, that we were watching something more than that. But dragons the size of aircraft carriers, including a zombified version that breathed ice instead of fire, made that basically impossible. The spell was broken.View image in fullscreenThree cheers … Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg.Photograph: HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.Until, that is, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms came shuffling along. A self-contained, small-stakes story told across six half-hour episodes, it feels like a rejection of the bloat of later Thrones andHouse of the Dragon. (Happily there’s not a dragon in sight, bar one made of fabric in a puppet show.) Instead, Seven Kingdoms shares some of the cheerful, bawdy qualities of parts of Game of Thrones’s early years, particularly the adventures of mismatched pairings like Jaime and Brienne or Arya and the Hound. Though Ser Duncan the Tall and his companion Egg’s matters are far less pressing: Dunk just wants to enter a jousting tourney to cement his knightly reputation, honour his deceased mentor and earn some coin; the more inscrutable Egg just seems to be going along for the ride, though later episodes will reveal more at play (thanks to early screeners, I raced through the entire first season in a single afternoon). At points, the pair don’t seem to be doing very much at all, just meandering aimlessly about the tourney site, sniping away at each other.Which is more than enough, really: you could happily watch these two do nothing much, forever. There’s a lovely, easy chemistry between giant rugby player-turned actor Peter Claffey, who plays the dim but lovably sincere Dunk, and the excellent Dexter Sol Ansell as keen-eyed though ultimately innocent Egg. And the figures they bump into – Daniel Ings’s riotous Lyonel Baratheon, a handful of Targaryens of varying shades of loathfulness – are absorbing and entertaining too. The show clanks up several gears in its back half, with just a dash of Thronesian nastiness to keep you from getting too comfortable.In short, it’s terrific. So now I’m left in a tricky position: do I properly dive back into the Thrones universe? I’ll definitely come back to Seven Kingdoms when it returns for a second season. And I am more than happy to write off House of the Dragon rather than trudge through its final two seasons. But then, according to Martin, there are several otherGame of Thronesspin-offs in various stages of development. What to do with them? The answer is to hold out for the ones that prioritise great characters and stories over flash and fantasy – and keep the dragons to a minimum.To read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterGame of ThronesHouse of the DragonGeorge RR MartinTelevisionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The next, our friends are dying’: the gay porn soundtrack composers lost to the Aids crisisGay porn in the 80s was home to beautifully moody synth music that is only now getting rediscovered – tragically too late for many of its creatorsDaniel Dylan WrayWed 4 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 10.01 ESTShareMichael Ely knew from the first moment he met James Allan Taylor that he had found someone special. The pair had separately hitchhiked to a gay bar, with fake IDs, in Sunset Beach, California. They connected, they danced and stepped outside for a kiss in the thick fog. “I was only 18 but I knew I had just met my soulmate,” says Ely.The pair remained a couple until 2015 when Taylor, who was nicknamed Spider, died from liver cancer. A new collection of Taylor’s music, Surge Studio Music – electronic pieces he composed for gay porn films – has just been released. “I was like: wait, there’s a fanbase for 80s gay porn music?” laughs Ely. “I had no idea. When Josh contacted me, I found the cassette tapes in a box in the back of the closet. They’d been there for ever.”Josh Cheon runs Dark Entries, a San Francisco-based record label that focuses on celebrating overlooked gay artists, including many who died from Aids-related illnesses, and releasing their lesser-known forays into the world of soundtracking gay porn. As well as Taylor’s Surge Studio Music material, there have been releases by the Hi-NRG and disco pioneer Patrick Cowley and the electro innovator Man Parrish, and the compilation Deep Entries: Gay Electronic Excursions 1979-1985, described as “10 tracks of obscure queer synth bliss”.“This had been on my docket since day one of the label,” Cheon says. “There were all these compilations of people doing rare Australian synth pop or Japanese new wave but I’m like: ‘What about gay? Where’s the gay voice in all of this? It’s all been erased, forgotten, lost to Aids or thrown out.’ So I’ve literally been working on this for 16 years trying to amplify this underground gay music scene.”The proceeds from many of the releases get donated to Aids charities but it’s also an opportunity to direct some money towards artists who maybe weren’t all that business savvy when they first took on the scoring work. “Man Parrish was like: oh, I think I got $50 and a blowjob,” laughs Cheon. “Which he then spent on drugs.”Working with queer film historian Elizabeth Purchell to track down and unearth old films and scores, Cheon has found a niche within a niche. “There is so much amazing stuff out there,” he says. “If I wanted to, I could switch to just being a gay porn soundtrack reissue label.” As if by magic, his phone rings to prove his point. “Oh my God, this is crazy,” Cheon beams after quickly taking the call. “It’s another gay porn soundtrack composer that everyone thought was dead. No one has talked to him in 30 years. I literally have goosebumps right now.”It was at a Los Angeles glory hole club, Basic Plumbing, where Taylor’s Surge Studio Music material was born. He was working at the club in the early 80s when he met Al Parker, who ran porn production company Surge Studios with Steve Scott – both of whom would die due to Aids-related illnesses – and began making soundtracks for their films. Previously, “Al and Steve really went out of their way, for the most part, to source original material for the music,” Cheon says. “But they also stole music from Brian Eno, B-52s and the Human League. They would cut up the Human League’s Being Boiled, loop it and slow it down, taking out the vocals to manipulate it as an instrumental. I guess today it would be called a cosmic or Balearic remix.”View image in fullscreenSurge Studios head Al Parker.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsTaylor’s film music has a similar vibe – slow, moody, textural, synthy – but despite its enduring appeal, Ely recalls it just being “a side job”, he says. “Neither one of us were really into porn. It was just something to earn as we were starving musicians.” Taylor was more known for his impressive guitar playing, with Eddie Van Halenreportedly sayinghe was the greatest guitar player he’d ever heard. Taylor and Ely were also in the post-punk outfit Red Wedding at the time (1981-85) which was made up entirely of openly gay men – a rarity in the scene.The pair had been living openly from the off, even when same-sex relationships were still illegal in California. “We were very bold and part of a wave of young gay couples living out in the open just a couple of years after Stonewall,” Ely recalls. It was not without its challenges however. “I pretty much lost my family,” Ely says. “We encountered a lot of hostility and a lot of really fucked things happened to us over the years.” He then tells me a harrowing story of their cat being stolen, killed and returned in a cardboard box with “faggots” written on it and a noose around the neck of their pet.But by the mid-80s, when these film scores were being recorded, they had a beautiful community of like-minded friends and were part of a thriving underground music scene. “Then Aids reared its ugly head,” recalls Ely. “One moment it was a little blip, something we heard was going on in San Francisco. The next thing friends of friends are dying, and then our friends are dying.” It was so traumatic that the pair ended up moving to Arizona and starting a new chapter away from bands and music. “We lost so many friends, and it did something to us,” Ely says. “We didn’t want to be in LA any more. There were too many ghosts. Everywhere we looked it reminded us of people that we loved that died these horrible deaths.”View image in fullscreenAlbum cover for the soundtrack to Turned On, a film by Al Parker, with music by Forbidden Overture AKA Man Parrish.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsAnother release the label has just put out is Fallen Angel by Brandy Dalton, a collection of soundtracks – spanning melodic electronica to squelchy electro via minimal industrial techno – to the award-winning series of porn films under the same name. Dalton, who died from an Aids-related illness in 2006, had his roots in the more extreme and experimental part of the gay community in LA. His band Drance, an industrial and EBM outfit, would play venues such as the legendary Club Fuck!, a home for the leather, tattoos and body piercing crowd.“It was absolutely wild,” says Dalton’s bandmate John Munt. “Drance was a very sexual band and we would have go-go dancers who were painted gold or accompany performance art pieces which would involve pretty extreme mutilation and mummification. I say it with affection, but we would always find out where all the freaks were and play there.”View image in fullscreen‘He carried on making music, but things got tough for him’ … Brandy Dalton.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsWith so much of this type of music forgotten, or never released in the first place, it’s significant to have the work of these late artists being celebrated. “It’s so nice to have Brandy’s work out,” says Munt. “He carried on making music, but things got tough for him. Aids really ravaged him and he needed to use a lot of drugs for the extreme pain. I loved him as a really close friend, and it was hard to watch.”Similarly, for Ely this goes beyond just music for porn films. “It means a lot to me,” he says. “It celebrates Spider one more time. I’ll always be in awe of him, and I’ll always be in love with him. He was an incredible, gifted, loving person, and until the day I die I will keep talking about him. I want people to remember him. I want people to hear his music. It’s the least I can do for him.”Spider Taylor compilationSurge Studio Musicand Brandy Dalton compilationFallen Angelare out now on Dark Entries RecordsExplore more on these topicsElectronic musicPornographyAids and HIVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re poor. They’re unpopular. Their families are a wasteland. But they have each other and their great shared passion: trad rock climbing. Whenever they can, they head to a climbing route – sometimes a boulder at the edge of a disused parking lot, sometimes a cliff an hour’s hike into a national park – and climb, often with no gear but their bloodied bare hands and tattered shoes.This is the premise of Crux, the second novel from Gabriel Tallent, the author of the critically acclaimedMy Absolute Darling. At its heart, it’s a sports novel, and Tallent’s prose here is precise and often exquisite, inching through a few seconds of movement in a way that reflects the unforgiving nature of climbing. We get a lot of closeups of granite and faint half-moons in rock that suddenly become “the world’s numinous edge”. The language of climbing – a dialect of brainy dirtbags – is a gift to the writer. Tallent’s characters talk about “flashing bouldering problems” and “sending Fingerbang Princess”; a list of routes with “Poodle” in the title includes Poodle Smasher, Astropoodle, Poodle-Oids from the Deep, A Farewell to Poodles, and For Whom the Poodle Tolls. Tallent also has an extraordinary gift for descriptions of landscape; a road is“overhung with stooping desert lilies, tarantulas braving the tarmac in paces, running full out upon their knuckly shadows, the headlights smoking with windblown sand”.Crux is a book that wanders from majesty to mediocrity, with occasional spills into outright bathosAnother pleasure of the book is Tamma, a snaggletoothed, dirty, foul-mouthed, acne-ridden, big-hearted, joyful urchin, who expresses her life’s dream as: “I want to climb hard and dangerous routes that make you shit your pants! I want to live in caves and eat dog food!” When a doctor tries to prescribe Tamma birth control, she finds increasingly baroque and allusive ways of telling him she’s gay,until she’s saying: “Will these help me if I exhume the body of Mary Wollstonecraft from her cold, worm-ridden grave and bring her back to life with a lightning strike and the two of us have undead lesbian sex while wearing full-body latex catsuits?” She’s persecuted by mean adults, who demonise her as a stupid white-trash burnout – somewhat improbably, given her quick wit, charm and negligible drug use. As all this suggests, she’s a little too good to be true: sophisticated beyond her years; hotheaded and sensitive, but never unkind or needy. She’s a manic pixie dream girl, in short, always climbing into Dan’s bedroom window “grinning from molar to molar”. Still, even at her most implausible, she has unstoppable charisma.Dan, however, never comes into focus. The fundamental problem is that his plot stakes aren’t convincing. He’s a straight-A student, depressed for as long as he can remember, whose coming-of-age conflict is a choice between becoming a climber (the only thing with meaning for him) and going to college (which his parents, who never got an education, desperately want him to do). It’s hard for the reader to get emotionally involved in this, though, since clearly he could go to collegeandbe a climber. It might be a compromise, but it’s an obvious one that feels like a pretty sweet deal. So it becomes incredibly frustrating that Dan never considers it, instead spending page after page agonising over his either/or decision.Dan’s mother, Alexandra, is an equally unsatisfying character. In her teens, as an unhoused high school dropout working as a diner waitress, she wrote a 900-page bestselling literary novel in eight months. (Tallent delivers this information by having Dan look his mother up on Wikipedia.) Now ill and even more depressed than Dan, she’s given up writing and only leaves her room to deliver self-pitying monologues to her son. “I understood something, then. Lying there in that hospital bed … the truth was that people are nothing to one another and the world in which they live is finally meaningless and empty.” He listens in martyred silence while having equally dramatic thoughts: “Dan could see it, that she was a great artist, hard done by the world, and the keenness with which she felt it, and the hostility with which she now spoke, was apiece with her genius.” There are pages of this stuff, and all it really serves to do is nudge Dan back and forth in his choice between college and climbing.Crux is a book that wanders from majesty to mediocrity, with occasional spills into outright bathos. For many readers, the great sports writing and lovable heroine will make its flaws irrelevant. But anyone who can’t get past B-movie plotting should sit this one out.Crux by Gabriel Tallent is published by Fig Tree (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

She enjoyed laughing at her own jokes, revelling in the misfortunes of others, and telling people off. If an event combined opportunities for all three activities, so much the better.When my father was six, he refused to eat the meatloaf that his mother had given him for lunch. Gisela took the piece of meatloaf, now rapidly turning rancid in the Zimbabwe afternoon heat, and served it to him for dinner, and breakfast, and every subsequent meal until he forced himself to eat it. It was the late 1950s – tyrannical parenting was de rigueur, and uneaten meatloaf was the hill that Gisela was willing to die on.Fast forward 30 years, and I am six years old, surveying the horror-movie tableau of my grandmother’s dinner table in Freiburg: the pungent pink slab ofFleischkäse, the trembling white sausages in a bowl of what appears to be lukewarm dishwater, the slimy cold herrings in pickle juice, the brick of black rye bread that takes 20 minutes to saw through and three days to digest. “I don’t want to eat anything on this table,” I announce to the room, and promptly retreat to the floor, crawling between the table legs to wait out this so-called dinner.My parents exchange a pained look and shrug in resignation. Gisela is apoplectic, channelling her rage towards my father for being a permissive weakling, but ultimately powerless to exert her will over the next generation. She exacts her revenge for the next two decades: every time we are in company, she recounts this story in detail, my food refusal getting wilder and her reaction more saintly with each retelling, as she works her way up to the punchline. “Then she sat under the table for the whole meal … LIKE A DOG!”View image in fullscreenIrreverent and transgressive … Kieran Culkin as Benji and Jesse Eisenberg as David in A Real Pain.Photograph: Courtesy of Searchlight PicturesAs I spent the last few years researching and drawing Gisela’s life story for my graphic memoir The Crystal Vase, I found these recollections of her gleeful humiliation tactics and self-aggrandising anecdotes slipping in to the gaps between the heavy facts ofHolocausthistory. Each generation relates to their family history differently, and as the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor I found I had a certain critical distance from that lived experience that my father did not have.In recent years, telling serious Jewish history through family comedy has become the dominant approach for third-generation survivors.A Real Paindirector Jesse Eisenberg summed it up as follows in a recent interview: “First generation builds the house. Second generation lives in the house. Third generation burns it down.” “A movie can simultaneously have great reverence for the history while also creating an irreverent and sometimes transgressive tone, because that’s the full and honest way I experience history,” he elaborated.The centuries-old tradition of self-deprecating Jewish humour was all but stamped out of German culture in the HolocaustNowhere is this tension more apparent than in the scene where the impulsive Benji (Kieran Culkin) persuades the rest of his Holocaust tour group to pose for photos as Polish fighters next to the Monument to the Heroes of Warsaw statue. His uptight cousin David (Eisenberg) protests, “Doesn’t that seem disrespectful?” as he is forced to be their official photographer, juggling everybody’s phones while they merrily reenact heroic moments from the Warsaw Uprising, imaginary guns blazing. David’s discomfort is played for laughs, while Benji’s allergy to the tour guide’s repetition of dry facts manifests as this disruptive urge to feel the history bodily, to welcome in the fun and allow it to sit with the pain.In fellow “grief tourism” tragicomedyTreasure, prickly Ruth (Lena Dunham) travels to Poland with her Auschwitz-survivor father, the exuberant Edek (Stephen Fry), to see where his family used to live. Their exasperated bickering undercuts many of the film’s more solemn moments. When Ruth finally manages to buy back her murdered grandmother’s tea set from the Poles who took over Edek’s apartment in 1940 after the family were deported, Edek is unimpressed. “You have no idea how much this means to me, Dad,” she tells him. “Before this we had nothing, nothing from your past.” “And now,” he deadpans, “you have a teapot.”View image in fullscreenBickering … Stephen Fry and Lena Dunham in Treasure.Photograph: Anne WilkElsewhere, writerJoe Dunthorne goes on a research trip to Munich with his mother in the 2025 book Children of Radium, a wry family memoir about his German-Jewish great-grandfather, a scientist who developed chemical weapons for the Nazis. Dunthorne and his mother (who he describes as a Birkenstock-wearing “cut-throat bastard”) stay in the same apartment rooms where his great-grandfather spent his wedding night. “I don’t think we gained much from this immersive research, eating bowls of our own overcooked spätzle while trying not to visualise the newlyweds going at it in the corner.”As the last generation to grow up around adult Holocaust survivors and hear their accounts first-hand, it is not surprising that we now have the impulse to record our grandparents’ stories for posterity, and reflect on how they affect us. But why are we choosing humour as our medium? Perhaps it is just our generation’s default mode of presentation, busily maintaining an ironic distance from difficult subjects. Are we so fragile that we need to use humour as a buffer, to make even the bleakest history cosy and palatable?The bare facts of my own grandmother’s story certainly don’t read like a comedy. Gisela escaped NaziGermanyin 1939 at the age of 18. Her family home in Bad Homburg had been destroyed on Kristallnacht, and her father was beaten, arrested, and taken to Buchenwald. He did not survive the war. Many other family members were trapped in Germany and eventually killed in the camps at Sobibór, Mauthausen and Theresienstadt.But Gisela went to Amsterdam – where several of her Frankfurt cousins were already living in exile, including her second cousins, Margot and Anne Frank – before sailing to South Africa. She took a train north, and ended up in the first place that would take her: Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. Her passport was confiscated when the war broke out, so she was stuck there. So began Gisela’s new life in colonial Africa. She married German-Jewish émigré Hans Goldschmidt, and had three sons.View image in fullscreenA detail from The Crystal Vase.Illustration: Astrid GoldsmithThey stayed in Bulawayo for almost four decades, until the political situation in 1970s Zimbabwe forced them to flee again. My grandparents returned to Germany in 1976 and settled in Freiburg, chosen for its strategic location close to the borders of two other countries: even in retirement, these lifelong refugees were keeping their options open.After their deaths, our family had to decide how to divide the remaining precious belongings that had been saved from the Nazis. My initial intention was to write a reverential book that honoured my grandmother, who was vivacious, elegant, and a great raconteur (as long as you were interested in stories about how incredible she was).But in the aftermath of her funeral, my family’s eccentricities rose violently to the surface and irrevocably coloured my experience. I took a fraught road trip acrossEuropewith my father to clear out Gisela’s flat and distribute her belongings to the rest of the family. My aunt deemed four-course lunches more of a priority than packing heirlooms, and my uncle smuggled the family silver across borders in his underwear. I brought Gisela’s collection of moth-infested Persian rugs into my pest-phobic sister’s house, and have never been forgiven. Family secrets were uncovered, everyone fought over heirlooms, we all fell out. In the end, an approach that embraced the humour alongside the tragedy felt like the only way to tell this story.View image in fullscreenInitial condemnation … Volumes I and II of Maus by Art Spiegelman.Photograph: sjbooks/AlamyMaking light of one of the darkest horrors of the 20th century is a risky business. Even Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer prize-winning Maus was initially met with condemnation in Israel due to the perception of comics as vulgar, funny and inappropriate. Spiegelman’s frustrations with his Auschwitz-survivor father are palpable throughout Maus, as he details their complicated relationship.By being one generation removed, my relationship with Gisela was different – I could be both amused and terrified at a safe distance. The centuries-old tradition of self-deprecating Jewish humour was all but stamped out of German culture in the Holocaust, and this new wave of Jewish diaspora stories is embracing it. Humour and solemnity can coexist while examining tragic events, and I found both helpful when dealing with the mixed bags passed down by survivors. Humour is not a buffer here, but a doorway: it allows access to a narrative. The third generation are taking ownership of our family histories, drawing our own conclusions, and making space for the humour of human foibles, even in our darkest stories.As for me, I await the eventual tell-all memoir of my own son, who we are raising vegetarian, in which he complains bitterly that his mother never fed him meatloaf.Astrid Goldsmith’sThe Crystal Vaseis published by Jonathan CapeExplore more on these topicsBooksComics and graphic novelsHolocaustSecond world warGermanyEuropeA Real PainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 4 Feb 2026 07.35 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 07.37 ESTShareI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – thinkCrow CountryorFear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specificallyaboutthe millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year.Despeloteis set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. Theaward-winning Consume Meis about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.Perfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.The earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of beingperceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.View image in fullscreenComedic and satirical … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoymaking fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.Perfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.For a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.It is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone elseexperienced those same formative years.What to playView image in fullscreenAm I the baddie? … Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator.Illustration: SteamLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment.

And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’sitems in10 years’ time ...”Once upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.Digital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.Digital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. Andeverybodyhates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She explains how her drawings and sculpture weave botanical illustration and traditional craft to engage with generational traumaWed 4 Feb 2026 09.35 ESTShareWhen the artist Charmaine Watkiss was a child, she frequently visited G Baldwin’s, a herbalist who sold natural remedies and essential oils in London’s Elephant and Castle, to pick up medicinal herbs and sarsaparilla for her mother. “They’ve had an apothecary for over 100 years,” she says. “It’s a place Black women used as a resource in the 1970s and 80s. You’d say: ‘I’ve got this ailment’ and they’d recommend something.”Watkiss’s mother was part of the Windrush generation who migrated from the Caribbean to the UK, and these memories sparked a new area of research for the artist before her first gallery show in 2021, The Seed Keepers, which explored the botanical links connecting the Caribbean, the UK and the African continent in the context of the transatlantic slave trade. “While in my studio, I thought: all this knowledge must have travelled with the enslaved.” Thus began Watkiss’s large-scale illustrated portraits depicting women of African descent alongside medicinal plants. Evoking historical botanical illustrations, the artist traces how the enslaved relied on herbal knowledge for survival.View image in fullscreen‘All this knowledge must have travelled with the enslaved’ … The Warrior mediates all the forces of nature by Charmaine Watkiss.Photograph: Charmaine WatkissWatkiss is talking ahead of an exhibition of newly commissioned works at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, where she was invited to create new work that engages directly with the institution’s holdings. She immediately noticed an absence. “I needed to respond to the West Africa display as the story of the diaspora was missing,” she says. “I needed to speak to the people who were taken away from the continent – my ancestors – and speak about the diaspora through material.”Watkiss used the opportunity to do something different: her usual way of producing work involves drawing on paper, but after encountering RAMM’s collections of masks, she turned to sculpture. The artist was particularly drawn to themukengahelmet masks designed to cover the wearer’s face, originating from the Kuba kingdom in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and traditionally made with materials such as cowrie shells and glass beads. “My mask will be in the cabinet with all the other African masks,” she says. “Interestingly, they’ve got some masks on loan from the British Museum too, so there is a dialogue.” Her RAMM commission also includes a new watercolour which incorporates some of the museum’s holdings, such as ankisifigure, traditionally used for purposes including healing and protection. “With sculpture, I work intuitively. With drawing, it’s research – then the drawing takes over,” she says.Watkiss’s journey to becoming an artist wasn’t straightforward. She worked as a footwear designer in the late 1980s but faced discrimination from those she worked alongside in the industry. She later turned her attention to studying film, and one tutor told her: “Black people made no contribution to western civilisation.” She wrote her dissertation to prove him wrong. Later, in 2015, she devised a five-year plan: “I wrote that within five years I wanted to become an artist. I had no idea how it would happen.” She embarked on a foundation course at City Lit in London before starting an MA in illustration at Wimbledon School ofArt. In January 2020, Watkiss shut down her old work website and took a giant leap of faith. She credits this decision in part to also practising reiki. “When you heal someone, you align all their energy to an intention. I used myself to test that idea, and it worked. It’s a process of hurling yourself into the unknown and trusting you’re not going to die when you jump.”View image in fullscreen‘With sculpture, I work intuitively’ …Mukengahelmet mask from the DRC.Photograph: Charmaine WatkissThis isn’t the first time Watkiss has responded to historic museum collections and narratives: she has held research fellowship stints at the Sloane Lab in partnership with the Natural History Museum and the British Museum. “I wanted to find out what Hans Sloane and his contemporaries knew about healing plants, as many specimens were collected by enslaved Africans,” she says. A work commissioned last year is currently on view at London’s National Portrait Gallery, placed alongside a portrait of physicist and collector Sloane. He was an owner of enslaved people in Jamaica and gained substantial profits from his wife’s sugar plantations – his collection formed the foundation of the British Museum, and he owned the land on which Sloane Street and Sloane Square in London now stand. Watkiss reimagines a woman Sloane wrote about in an 18th-century volume as a “queen in her own country” who helped to cure a growth on Sloane’s foot.I ask Watkiss about the difficulties of working with legacies of race and the enslaved within western museological collections. “It’s a hard, complicated history,” she says. “That trauma is generational – it’s in our DNA. Growing up in western culture, being viewed a certain way – it’s another layer.” In her response to Sloane’s portrait, Watkiss replaces him at the centre of the story with the woman once relegated to the margins: the healer is depicted seated on a throne, rich with symbolism including thesankofabird, an Akan symbol of looking back to move forward.Charmaine Watkiss: For the Ones Who Came Before … is at RAMM, Exeter, 10 February until 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingDrawingSculptureinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The reason they’re sitting on the ground is because there weren’t any chairs in the waiting room’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 4 Feb 2026 10.02 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 12.50 ESTShareMy new book Social Season opens with a poem set in the mid-1800s, a time that marked the beginning of a period of increased financial prosperity for some African Americans. Cotillion dances have European origins, but in the poem, Black New Yorkers perform classic dances such as waltzes and quadrilles and are dressed in fine outfits. These Black debutante balls go back a long way, and are one example of African Americans trying to create a better life. Today, they continue to introduce young women into society and retain a strong emphasis on the participants’ education.Initially, I had been working towards creating a book with a larger overview of Black subcultures in general. I’d photographed cheerleaders, churches, traditional rodeos and other intergenerational community gatherings. I wanted to include a debutante ball in a post-industrial city, and Detroit has a very rich Black history. When I first reached out to the city’s Cotillion Society, I only planned to attend one year’s event. But after that evening in 2022, I realised this was a project in itself and that I was really going to have to work for the images I wanted.The Detroit Masonic Temple, where the cotillions take place, is an incredible venue, but it doesn’t provide any natural light, something I’ve relied on for most of my career. I would get six to eight hours to work, arriving while the kids were getting dressed and preparing for the evening’s events. The girls take etiquette lessons for months leading up to the ball as part of the programme, as do their male escorts, and all the kids have to learn the formal choreography for the group dances. There’s a live orchestra playing classical and jazz music – they’ll do variations of songs such as Sammy Davis Jr’s Hello Detroit and Bridgerton-themed songs, too.The photographs in the book were taken during four balls held in consecutive years. Every event brings something new and I have to be aware of my goal. One year, I might have got enough images of girls looking directly into the camera, so next time I’d aim for more candid photos. There was a sense of collaboration – I would say: “Listen, if you see the camera, try to ignore me – the flash will be going off, but I’ll stay out of the way.” Being able to connect with them on that is 100% why the photos work, plus I did earn my place in the community by doing a lot of prep to make people aware of what I was doing, and using Zoom calls to introduce myself to the families and so on.Every debutante is accompanied to the stage by a father figure – their dad, uncle or another older man who is important to them. Before the dances start, they each get an introduction listing their accomplishments and where they are going to college next year. There’s a lot of waiting. The reason the girls in this picture are sitting on the ground is because for the first couple of years I went, there weren’t any chairs in the waiting room. After two or three hours, it gets pretty tiring standing up in one of those dresses. I love how relaxed this moment was and that while the girls were happy to sit, the dads were, like: “No, we will be standing.”Another photograph shows a boy I spotted towards the end of one night, standing next to the old shoeshine area by one of the bathrooms – I don’t remember having seen him until that point. Despite being dressed in formal wear, he was on crutches. I didn’t find out why, but I really like those pictures that add a bit of unexpected variety. At the same time, I was glad that if someone left the dancefloor, they were not allowed back on without the proper attire. If any of the kids had been in normal clothing, some magic would be lost. But after the cotillion dances are over and everybody has had their sit-down meal, the string instruments give way to contemporary party music and you get to see that these future community leaders are still gen Z kids just finishing high school.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Miranda BarnesMiranda Barnes’s CVBorn:Brooklyn, 1994High point:Social SeasonTop tip:Reading is fundamental!Social Season by Miranda Barnes is out now, published byMack.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His diverse range of subjects included The Caesars (1983), A Portrait of Scottish Rugby (1984) and critical studies of Muriel Spark (1979) and Colette (1986).He was the Scotsman’s chief literary critic for more than 25 years, and as one of his editors there I looked forward to his faxed copy arriving invariably before deadline. Elsewhere he wrote columns, diaries, book reviews, essays and articles on everything from sport to the state of the nation for publications including the Spectator and Daily Mail.However, it was for his novels that Allan preferred to be known. The first, Change and Decay in All Around I See, appeared in 1978. As its blurb candidly accepted, it followed “firmly in the paths” ofEvelyn Waugh,Ronald Firbank,Henry GreenandAnthony Powell. Indeed, its main character’s name, Atwater, was borrowed from Powell’s first novel,Afternoon Men. With a cast of drunks, gamblers and other dissolute characters, it examined a bohemian Britain in the process of renouncing its claim to greatness.View image in fullscreenHe returned to the theme in its successor, The Last Peacock (1980), about a matriarch on her deathbed in a Perthshire manse. The following year came The Death of Men, set in Rome where, in the 1970s, Allan had taught English as a foreign language. Taking as his starting point thekidnapping and killing in 1978 of the Italian prime minister Aldo Moro, he produced a political thriller that was perhaps overly indebted, as the Times Literary Supplement’s unimpressed reviewer suggested, toGraham GreeneandJohn le Carré. However, Douglas Dunn, writing in Encounter, had no such misgivings: “One can only applaud Massie as perhaps the finest of living Scottish novelists.”With his sixth novel,A Question of Loyalties(1989), which won the Saltire Society/Scotsman book of the year award, Allan finally found a voice and subject true to himself. It was the first of “a loose trilogy”, which included The Sins of the Father (1991) and Shadows of Empire (1997), set largely in occupied France during the second world war. Lucien de Balafré, the main character, is an aesthete with dilettantish tastes, who chooses to serve the collaborationist Vichy government because he believes it is his patriotic duty.Throughout Allan’s fiction there are common concerns and themes, as he told me in 1990: “Difficulty of coming to firm moral conclusions. Interaction of public and personal life. Relationship of the individual to social background and landscape. Also, of how much people choose their own life.”View image in fullscreenBeing born in Singapore made him, he said, “quite a typical Scot, a child of the British empire”. Both his mother, Evelyn (nee Forbes), and father, Alexander, came from farming families in the north-east ofScotland. Having little money, Alexander took a job as a rubber planter in Malaya. When the second world war broke out he was captured by the Japanese and spent four years in a prisoner-of-war camp.Allan was sent to boarding school, first to Drumtochty Castle, in Kincardineshire, then to Glenalmond college, in Perthshire. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he studied history “not very assiduously”. The broadcaster Colin Bell, who knew him at the time, said he was a prototype fogey in theBrideshead Revisitedmould: “It never occurred to us that he was going to be a novelist.”Thereafter Allan returned to Drumtochty, where he taught for 10 years and married Alison Langlands, the headteacher’s daughter. They went on to have three children, Claudia, Alexander and Louis.Aware that his drinking was becoming problematic after he based himself in Edinburgh, with its many watering-holes, he moved to an estate near Selkirk in the Borders, where he rented a house. Writers, he acknowledged, are particularlysusceptible to alcoholbecause they don’t have to turn up at an office, so there’s no threat of the sack. “They just get pleading letters from publishers.”View image in fullscreenA non-driver, he relied on taxis and buses. He was addicted to Gitanes, citing smoking as one his hobbies in Who’s Who. Wearing a beret and a ghillie’s tweeds gave him a donnish, dandyish air.Though he was mild-mannered and urbane in person, something seem to come over Allan when faced with a typewriter, and he enjoyed riling those in his homeland who did not share his admiration forMargaret Thatcher.In 1997, he was one of few cultural figures in Scotland to oppose devolution. Writing on the eve of the referendum, he concluded: “A student of South African politics told me recently the powers given in the white paper to the Scottish parliament are almost exactly those which the South African apartheid regime gave to the Bantustans. Vote on Thursday for ‘Scotland – the new Transkei’.”Allan’s personal values were “old-fashioned Christian” ones, which he explored in a series of novels about Ancient Rome. Beginning with Augustus in 1986 and concluding five books later with Caligula (2003), they purport to be the memoirs of the emperors or of people in their orbit.Gore Vidal, a fan, called Allan a “master of the long-ago historical novel”.A series of four crime novels featuring Superintendent Lannes (2010-15), was much praised for itsevocation of Bordeauxduring the second world war. Though the books were not based on direct experience, it was the kind of praise that Allan was very happy to accept. In 2013 he was appointed CBE.Alison died in 2022, and he is survived by his children.Allan Johnstone Massie, writer and journalist, born 16 October 1938; died 3 February 2026Explore more on these topicsFictionThrillersCrime fictionHistory booksScotlandobituariesShareReuse this content"

Occasionally it was an exclamation mark, or a star. Other times, she herself was doing something similar. “I’m sorry to say that is not a typo,” she writes, at one point. And then, in a later chapter, “I’m going to have to put this in bold …”It wasn’t stylistic commentary, although The Good Society is well written. Nearly every scribble was next to a fact. Pickett is a social epidemiologist, and deals in facts: “In the decade from 2011 to just before the pandemic, total spending on preventive services for families declined by 25%”, for instance. Or that half of children born in Liverpool in 2009 and 2010 had been referred to children’s services by the time they were five. Or that in 2023-4, England’s local authorities had only 6% of the childcare places they needed for children with disabilities (that was the bit Pickett wished to point out wasn’t a typo).The cover of Kate Pickett’s bookPickett came to international prominence with a book she wrote with Richard Wilkinson in 2009,The Spirit Level. That book used a battery of facts to argue that countries with the greatest overall inequality – even those that seemed to be richest – had the worst levels of health, social cohesion and human capital development. The Spirit Level sold more than 300,000 copies, was translated into 26 languages and was named by the Guardian as one of the100 most influential books of the 21st century. Pickett and Wilkinson followed it, in 2018, withThe Inner Level, which set out to illustrate the many ways in which the chronic stress caused by high inequality negatively affects our psychological wellbeing.The Good Society is by Pickett alone and is, in some ways, a work of synthesis: the first two-thirds draw together vast amounts of already existing research on the current state of theNHS, of Britain’s care system (from cradle to grave), its education and then its prison system – it is, to put it bluntly, not good news. The final third suggests solutions. And there is nothing small about Pickett’s proposals. We “can’t afford to nibble”, she writes, in characteristically demotic fashion, “at the edges of the climate crisis, or the crisis in care, or the other big problems we’re facing; we need wholesale change”: nothing less than “a new social fabric for a good society”.View image in fullscreenTreating the cause … Pickett’s book draws on existing research on the NHS.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt feels … almost transgressive, to make such a big claim. Risky, even. There is a pause. “I think it feels risky, yes, to say those big things,” Pickett says. “There are quite a lot of loud voices who want to tread on that kind of thinking. So to raise your head above the parapet and say, ‘Let’s talk about a good society’ does feel … quite risky.” Pickett, who in 2022 was made an OBE for her services to societal equality, is a poised woman, very still, except for hands that move constantly, expressively, as she talks. At first, she says, this was going to be quite a tight project, asking why government doesn’t listen to evidence. One of the striking things about her many facts is how often they are from well-resourced, “excellent” government-commissioned reports, full of “excellent” recommendations – repeatedly scuppered by yet another election, and put on a shelf to gather dust. But under encouragement from her editor, it began to grow. “I did need to be encouraged to find confidence in myself, to express that bigger vision. I worried a lot that it felt a bit … well, ‘Who am I to say these things? Who am I to say how the world should look and what the good society is?’ It took me a while to have the confidence to say: ‘This is what I think it should look like, what about you?’”We have fallen out of the habit of thinking that we can choose to do what it takes to create the best society possibleTo be fair, this lack of confidence is not just personal. “We’ve been so locked into the neoliberal capitalism that’s been dominant for so long that it feels like the way things must be, are the way the world is. And it’s just too difficult, too utopian to think about something else.” Couple this with the sheer size of the problems facing our world, “this juggernaut of potential crisis that just keeps on rolling”, and what we often have, at best, is a kind of small pragmatism. “I think we feel stuck. Sometimes when I talk to people about what I’m trying to do, people say, well, it’s too hard. And it’s too difficult.” It is so long “since we had great visions declared for us of what a good society could be” that we have somehow mislaid that type of agency. “We have fallen out of the habit”, as she puts it in her book, “of thinking that we can choose to do what it takes to create the best society possible”.This is not the same as the agency we are sold every day, which is individual: that we alone can choose to be more healthy, can choose not to commit crime, can choose, through hard work and supposedly innate merit, to flourish; to win at the game of life. The flipside of which, of course, is that if we fail, it is our own fault. “We call it lifestyle drift in public health,” says Pickett. “Blaming the individual.” The challenge is to identify and create the context that best supports those aims. “Yes, in the end, it is going to have to be me who doesn’t buy that pack of cigarettes. And it’s going to have to be me who chooses not to commit that crime and to lead a life that’s not one of criminality. But what is the context that supports that? Often the context is about a safe and secure early childhood, as well as sufficient livelihoods.” Get in early, and you have a chance of heading off the worst effects. In the end it is also, almost always, cheaper.One of the most effective aspects of Pickett’s method is the way in which she zooms out. So the UK may be home to some of the richest people on the planet – but that fact about the children of Liverpool, for instance, is followed a paragraph later by the illuminating information that of all the 40 countries in the OECD and the EU, Britain had the greatest rise in child poverty in the decade before 2023, at 20%; close to a third of British children now live in poverty. We may know, in general, or from what we see around us, that child poverty is rising, but this method puts that knowledge into stark relief. (At one point in our conversation I ask Pickett what she found most surprising, as she worked on the book. There is a long silence, then “I’m not sure I found much of it surprising, but I found quite a lot of things shocking. Thescale:quitehow many people need the kinds of social care that they can’t get. Quite how many people return to prison within six months of leaving it.” (It’s 63%.)But looking at other countries also throws up alternatives. Many areas in Brazil, for example, have a system ofparticipatory budgeting, where citizens set their spending priorities and have the power to direct spending. The Netherlands is shifting toward a four-day working week. In Costa Rica the law that protects its natural ecosystems isprivileged above other laws, while “reading about Finland’s assessment of schools”, writes Pickett, in which “wellbeing and mental health come first … and the curriculum is designed with the primary purpose of engaging children’s curiosity in the world around them, rather than trying to fill them with a set body of knowledge” made her “want to weep with frustration”. And then there’s Bhutan’s famed decision to measure gross national happiness rather than GDP (in the UK, on the other hand, Pickett points out, paying for private therapy for someone with serious depression adds to GDP).People say: ‘We don’t want a nanny state.’ Why wouldn’t we? A nanny looks after you and nurtures you. Bring on nanny!Pickett has a clear blueprint for the UK. The evidence is now incontrovertible, she argues, that the chronic stress caused by inequality places an untenable burden on society. There is also the ever-increasing evidence that adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs (which includeeverythingfrom violence to mental illness, imprisonment to homelessness) predict worse outcomes for everything from education to health to life expectancy. She believes that a universal basic income would be a good start, in order to establish basic dignity and autonomy, not to mention a buffer if AI takes your job. At one point Pickett quotes, approvingly, a study that claims “money is the ultimate personal medicine” – in that instance because even short-term changes in financial circumstances have measurable consequences for mental health. Elsewhere she points out that every £1,000 increase in household income translates to a rise of 3.6 months, or a quarter of a year, of life expectancy, regardless of which rung you happen to be on on the social ladder. She also suggests participatory budgeting, progressive taxation, citizen assemblies and the strengthening of trade unions in the UK, alongside a National Institute for Social Change – similar to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – for “ongoing proper assessment of the effectiveness of proposed social policies, their cost effectiveness”, so that the “then government could act on those things”. A National Care Service, built on similar lines to the NHS; a National Education Service, and/or a National Children’s Service would also be a good start, she says.You could think of all society as a child, I suggest, in that the better you look after its very youngest people, the more likely the thriving of the adult population. “You’d get a lot of things right in society if you did it from that point of view!” says Pickett. It’s the “flipside of the ‘nanny state’ argument. [People say] ‘We don’t want a nanny state” – well, why wouldn’t we? Actually, if nanny looks after you and nurtures you and makes it possible for you to live a good life, I think that’s what we should be aiming for. Bring on nanny!”View image in fullscreenPrimary concern … in Finland the curriculum is designed with the purpose of engaging children’s curiosity.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesThe thing is, how is this to happen? The Spirit Level was published more than 15 years ago, and we are more unequal, not less. Why did it not achieve more traction? Pickett agrees that far more could have been done, but insists that “things have changed in terms of the conversation. So when we published The Spirit Level, nobody was talking about inequality. It just wasn’t on the political agenda at all.” Inequality is certainly now a major part of the conversation. What would she do about this if she was Rachel Reeves or Keir Starmer? “I think I would try to be evidence-based because the evidence is really powerful,” she says. “And when you’ve got powerful evidence that links the way society is structured to outcomes, that means there are powerful stories in there as well. And I think you need to bring those together. So if you want to be a political leader who gets the public on side for a better vision of society, for a good society, you are going to have to use the stories and the statistics to tell a compelling narrative that people do then think they want to commit to, because they feel it’s possible.”How does she think they’re doing? The answer is immediate. “I’m disappointed that having come in with such a large majority and a wave of support, that they haven’t been more visionary and bold, and that it has taken them too long to do certain things. I’m one of many people who campaigned for the ending of the two-child limit, and that took a long time. I celebrate the fact that it’s happened now, but if you think about the numbers of families who went into poverty during that time, that is something that could have happened much, much earlier. Given their mandate for change, I think they could and should have been bolder and faster.” She notes that there has been a “whole spate of commissioning new reviews”, which is fine unless they sit on the shelf, gathering dust, like so many other government reviews.A striking insight that comes up in Pickett’s chapter on prisons is just how much of what we assume to be immutable is actually ideology. She cites a study that compared “changes in prison populations in the US over two decades, from 1980 to 1996, and found absolutely no effect (really – a proper zero in their table, not just a small number) of changing crime levels on changing rates of imprisonment.” Whereas when, in 2005, the Netherlands decided to run the system on a rehabilitation rather than a punishment model, the prison population fell by 40% in 12 years. They literally chose a different way to look at the problem – ie, she argues, the ground is probably far readier for new ideas, and different ways of seeing, than governments repeatedly seem to assume. “I think that’s what I’m disappointed by. I think if you demonstrate bold leadership, you can carry people with you. You can convince.” And right now, “people are very aware of the difficulties and the problems they’re having in their lives or that they see in their families and friends. People are quite thirsty. They’re thirsty forhope.”The Good Society by Kate Pickett (Vintage Publishing, £25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

This week, it comes to you from Cartagena,Colombia, where I was attending a literary festival but, to be honest, have been mostly eating empanadas. It was my first time in Latin America, and I was not quite ready for a strange sort of culture shock, one that was as much about alienation as it was about recognition. I walked around the city in circles, trying to pound my way into absorbing a place of complex, layered histories.But it was Cartagena’s racial legacy that, at points, I found overwhelming. It sounds naive, but there is something about travelling halfway across the world to meet others of African descent that brings home the scale of the impact of centuries of enslavement. And it was in the “palenqueras” of Cartagena that I felt that history, in all its contradictions and legacies, resided.The fruit sellers at the crosshairs of historyView image in fullscreenRich tapestry … graffiti depicting descendants of African peoples with words or phrases in the Palenque language.Photograph: Ever Mercado/The GuardianI saw the firstpalenquerasminutes after I walked out of my digs. Black women in the same colourful dresses and head wraps, carrying bowls of fruit and sweets either on their heads or in their hands. They were so perfectly coordinated, always in small groups, that it looked as if they were part of some photoshoot. And it turned out that they, in a manner, were modelling for pictures to be taken. But it was tourists who took those photos, sometimes posing with them, and paying for the privilege. I would come to learn that these women came down from San Basilio de Palenque, a town more than an hour away, to make their living.I had read about San Basilio and, indeed, had conversations about its history with our South America correspondent, Tiago Rogero, who wrote arichly reported deep diveinto the town. It is the most famous ColombianPalenque– a town or village established by people who escaped enslavement. San Basilio, home to about 4,000 residents, was founded in the 1400s and is broadly recognised as the first “free” town in the Americas. Its inhabitants created their own community and a language that’s a mix of African languages, Creole, and Spanish and Portuguese. But I had not been aware of the particular history of thepalenqueras.They seemed to me, in that fugue of trying to absorb a new place, less like colourful features of Colombia’s tapestry and more ghosts from the past; a serene haunting presence that seemed to only recall the centuries of forced displacement that brought them to the street corners of Cartagena.A picturesque, historical hub of the enslavement industryView image in fullscreenForced displacement … A statue memorialising Benkos Biohó.Photograph: Ever Mercado/The GuardianMore than a million captive Africans were brought to Cartagena over three centuries. The city was one of the largest ports for the trade of enslaved people across Colombia and other colonised territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. I stood in the Plaza de los Coches, now a hub of performers and street food but once one of the largest markets for the sale of human beings. Across the plaza is the new Four Seasons hotel.The contrast between Cartagena’s affluent tourist areas and its industrial human trafficking and enslavement history, as well as the presence of the colourful smilingpalenquerassandwiched between the two, was head-spinning. I know this is starting to sound a bit like I was having a fever dream, and I’m sure jet lag and heat played a role, but the swirl of it all inspired a swell of undefinable but strong, new feelings. I sat on a stump on the street to still my head, only to realise that I had already started to weep.Palenqueras prideView image in fullscreen‘Untouchable’ ancestry … vibrant scenes in the historic centre of Cartagena, Colombia.Photograph: Ever Mercado/The GuardianAt one point, I began chatting to a group ofpalenquerassitting on a park bench, swigging beers under gathering storm clouds. We were a stone’s throw from a statue memorialising Benkos Biohó, the legend who escaped Spanish bondage in Cartagena and founded the Palenque from which they came. One of them, Milena, told me that her mother was apalenqueraand she was following in her path.Her predecessors would make the arduous journey from their town to Cartagena, and sell fruits and sweets to support their families, while the men concerned themselves with planting and harvesting fruits from their lands. Today, she said, she and others would spend two to three days in Cartagena a week, to avoid making the daily journey, which was still on a difficult road.Before I had even asked her, she said, stressing to a Colombian friend of mine who was translating, that she is from a place that is “a small Africa, the first free Black town in America. We have our own dialect. It’s called Bantu.” So I ask her what it’s like, and how the culture that founded her town remains. “We have never changed the traditions – we keep our origins intact. We are protected,” she says, as a place of precious heritage. Palenque has its own traditional ancestral community policing forces and the language is taught in its schools, and the town is on its way to securing autonomous local governance (Unesco alsoclassified Palenque as a siteof intangible cultural heritage of Humanity in 2008). She then adds that her home town is “untouchable”, laughing. “And it should never change”. She went on to say, “palenquerasnever have limits”. When I asked her what she would say if someone questioned who she was and where she was from, she replied, with a sharp distinction between being Colombian and beingfromColombia. “I would say that I am from a town that is a small Africa in Colombia.”I spent the rest of the time in Cartagena trying to reconcile the strident, almost miraculous ability of San Basilio de Palenque to maintain such a strong identity, language and even self-administration over the years, with the fact that the cost is that such communities remain carved out of the prosperity of the cities that thrived due to the labour of San Basilio’s founders. But what began to take shape in my mind is an understanding that thepalenqueras, and their entire communities, were nonetheless living full, self-fashioned lives, ones that were so syncretic in culture and language that they had become a new thing. Neither one-dimensional victims of the past, nor, like all of us, ever fully able to escape it. They were entirely foreign and unknowable to me, as well as entirely familiar. People separated by violence and history, but otherwise always conjoined.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsColombiaThe Long WaveAmericasSlaverynewslettersShareReuse this content"

When the drizzly season hits, it’s the weatherproof saviour that makes leaving the house just about bearable. Beyond practicalities, though, it’s also an important style choice. As the top layer of every outfit, it’s the piece of clothing everyone sees first, so you need to make it count.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s much to consider when looking for a new piece of outerwear. Will it be warm enough? Is it a design you’ll wear in a year’s time? Does it coordinate with the rest of your wardrobe?The ultimate men’s capsule wardrobe: the only 22 items you’ll ever needRead moreAs with most fashion, we recommend keeping it timeless. Trends come and go – see skinny jeans, motocross jackets, gorpcore et al – but coats are best done classic. Think overcoats, macs, car coats, chore coats, trenchcoats and pea coats. Any of these in a versatile shade of black, navy, khaki or neutral will be a safe investment for this year and beyond.Also think about what you’ll need the coat for. If you’re out walking the dog every day, you’ll need one that’s waterproof – our favourite would beRains’ rubberised PU take. Or if you’re a drinks-after-work kind of guy, you’ll want a versatile overcoat that’s sophisticated enough for the office yet warm enough for the pavement. And for the tricky transitional period, a trench is usually best.Either way, we’ve searched far and wide for the best coats to suit. Here’s our top picks.The best men’s coats in 2026Best value for money coat:H&M Atelier wool-blend topcoatH&M AtelierWool-blend topcoat£89.99£89.99 at H&M£89.99 at H&MThere’s a reason H&M has remained a mainstay on the high street for more than 75 years. The Scandi brand creates accessibly priced collections that every guy wants in their wardrobe, whether it’s a simple T-shirt or an exciting designer collaboration.One of the brand’s newest additions is the Atelier line: premium pieces made using quality fabrics. A case in point is this topcoat that’s made with an Italian viscose-wool blend twill. From the contemporary silhouette (it’s calf length, which is idealfor a topcoat – take a look atJacob Elordi’s fits for reference) to the subtly textured finish, it looks far more expensive than its £89.99 RRP.H&M AtelierWool-blend topcoat£89.99£89.99 at H&MBest waterproof coat:Rains long jacketRainsLong jacketfrom£85£85 at CHO£100 at Rains£85 at CHO£100 at RainsAs you may have guessed from the name, Rains is an expert at weatherproof outerwear. Ever since trying one of the label’s coats back in 2018, it’s become my go-to for waterproofs. You can choose from long or short, ponchos or two-piece sets, all in a range of colours crafted using the signature PU fabric with welded seams. The only downside? Since they’re entirely watertight, they’re not the most breathable, so go for a different design if you’re planning particularly active pursuits (see ourbest waterproof jacketsguide for inspiration).RainsLong jacketfrom£85£85 at CHO£100 at RainsBest insulated raincoat:Uniqlo hybrid recycled down coatUniqloHybrid recycled down coat£99.90£99.90 at Uniqlo£99.90 at UniqloWhen it comes to seasonal essentials, Uniqlo covers all of the bases. During summer, it’s the lightweightAirismT-shirts on everyone’s wishlist, whileHeattech thermalsare sub-zero saviours. Now, the Japanese label’s range of outerwear is rising up the ranks, too. This coat pairs a water-repellent outer with targeted ventilation zones and high-performance recycled down, making it perfect for days when it’s wetandcold.UniqloHybrid recycled down coat£99.90£99.90 at UniqloBest versatile coat:Mango wool-blend hooded overcoatMangoWool-blend hooded overcoat£109.99£109.99 at Mango£109.99 at MangoIf you’re after a one-and-done outerwear situation, Mango’s overcoat is a great choice. You could dress it up for work or down on the weekend. It has a hood for rain protection, the wool-blend fabric is warm enough for the winter but not too insulated for the transitional period, and the black shade will work with everything else in your wardrobe.MangoWool-blend hooded overcoat£109.99£109.99 at MangoBest car coat:Arket car coatArketCar coat£189£189 at Arket£189 at ArketIf you dressed head to toe in Arket daily, you’d look like a man whogetsfashion. The Stockholm-based label designs its collections with acapsule wardrobemindset: the pieces work together no matter what. It could be an easy T-shirt or a sweater, some straight-leg jeans or, in this case, a dark blue car coat that’s well constructed and designed to last.ArketCar coat£189£189 at ArketBest trenchcoat:Octobre Éditions Hopper trenchOctobre ÉditionsHopper trench£290£290 at Octobre Éditions£290 at Octobre ÉditionsA trenchcoat is useful for pretty much every season. When it’s warmer, you can wear it over a shirt and trousers, or you can amp up the heat with a roll-neck and thermals once the temperature drops – Harry Styles was evenspotted wearing onein coldest December. Go for one that’s easy to wear with most of your wardrobe; my go-to is one in tan or camel that falls just below the knee. Independent label Octobre Éditions’ Hopper trench nails the brief.Octobre ÉditionsHopper trench£290£290 at Octobre ÉditionsBest high-street trenchcoat:Zara water-repellent trenchcoatZaraWater-repellent trenchcoat£149£149 at Zara£149 at ZaraFor elevated menswear on the high street, Zara takes the top spot.Every season, there’s a few pieces in its collection that could easily be mistaken for a high-end designer’s work. From the longline cut to the wide lapels and cuff fastenings, all in an elevated shade of taupe, this trenchcoat is giving quiet luxury but for a fairly reasonable price.ZaraWater-repellent trenchcoat£149£149 at ZaraBest single-breasted coat:Weekday oversized coatWeekdayOversized single-breasted coat£142£142 at H&M£142 at H&MWeekday may be best known for its gen Z-targeted, trend-led collections, but it also has a solid selection of timeless pieces, too. This coat, from the classic check to the sharp, strong lapels, is a good example. It’s also the perfect overcoat length (below the knees to elongate the body rather than shortening it). All in all, a strong addition to any coat rack.WeekdayOversized single-breasted coat£142£142 at H&MBest duffle coat:Gloverall Admiral navy duffle coatGloverallAdmiral navy duffle coat£450£450 at Gloverall£450 at GloverallWhat do David Bowie, peace-loving beatniks from the 50s and a famous cartoon bear have in common? Duffle coats. Characterised by their thick woollen fabric and toggle fastenings, they’re a heavy hitter in colder months. Gloverall is the brand credited with upping the silhouette’s profile back in the 1950s – so why not stay true to the OG? At £450, it’s a considerable investment, but it’s a coat you’ll be wearing for years.GloverallAdmiral navy duffle coat£450£450 at GloverallBest waxed jacket:Barbour Ashby waxed jacketBarbourAshby waxed jacketfrom£199£199 at Flannels£199 at Frasers£199 at Flannels£199 at FrasersWhen you think of waxed jackets, the first brand on your mind should be Barbour. Loved by everyone from the royal family toDavid Beckhamand Liam Gallagher, they’re a tried-and-tested staple that works for just about anyone. Our favourite? The Ashby. Cut to a relaxed silhouette from a heavy, 6oz waxed cotton, it’s a winter-ready essential that still leaves plenty of room for layering when the cold sets in – you could even pair it with one of the brand’s signature zip-in layers.BarbourAshby waxed jacketfrom£199£199 at Flannels£199 at FrasersBest black overcoat:Topman double-breasted overcoatTopmanDouble-breasted overcoatfrom£110£110 at Topman£110 at Asos£110 at Topman£110 at AsosTopman is a go-to for well-designed, affordable menswear. Although a black coat may not sound exciting, this one ticks every box. It’s cut to a fit. It has cool-guy XL lapels. And the length is just right. Pair it with plain black basics, and you’ll look like you’ve made an effort – even if you haven’t.TopmanDouble-breasted overcoatfrom£110£110 at Topman£110 at AsosBest premium wool coat:Cos double-faced wool long car coatCosDouble-faced wool long car coat£399£399 at Cos£399 at CosThere’s something inherentlyluxurious about a chocolate brown overcoat. Amp up the richness with a slightly relaxed fit (check out luxury designerthe Row’s collectionsto see how menswear tends to look premium when it’s a touch oversized) and a weighty fabric, preferably a wool blend. This car coat by Cos ticks every box. The only snag? The higher price.CosDouble-faced wool long car coat£399£399 at CosBest high-street wool coat:M&S Autograph wool-blend hounds tooth overcoatM&S AutographWool-blend hounds tooth overcoat£150£150 at M&S£150 at M&SOne detail that tends to give away high-street overcoats from high-end designers is the length – they often finish at mid-thigh length, which shortens the body. That isn’t the case with this hounds tooth take by Marks & Spencer’s elevated diffusion line, Autograph, which lands mid-calf. Silhouette aside, the sharp revere collar and textured fabric add to the top-quality finish.M&S AutographWool-blend hounds tooth overcoat£150£150 at M&SBest puffer jacket:The North Face Saikuru jacketThe North FaceSaikuru jacketfrom£129£129 at the North Face£150.50 at Ellis BrighamFrom £129 at the North Face£150.50 at Ellis BrighamWhen the frosty mornings set in, only a puffer jacket will do. Enter the North Face’s Saikuru jacket. As someone who’s tried many puffer jackets over the years, this is the one I return to time and again. Not only is it well- insulated using synthetic fill, but it’s also lightweight, a cropped boxy fit (Stephen from The Traitors would certainly be a fan), and it’s wind- and water-repellent. If you’d like something a little brighter than black, there are four other colourways to choose from.The North FaceSaikuru jacketfrom£129£129 at the North Face£150.50 at Ellis BrighamBest duvet coat:Collusion unisex maxi puffer coatCollusionUnisex maxi puffer coat£59.99£59.99 at Asos£59.99 at AsosThis might not be a coat you could wear to work, but certain occasions call for a duvet style – walking your dog on a frosty morning or popping to the shops when it’s sub-zero. It’s a coat that will keep you cosy in the cold, even if the silhouette isn’t sharp. Luckily, Asos’s Collusion brand has you covered with this cocooning design that comes in three colours – although the brown is now sold out and stocks of the black and light green are low.CollusionUnisex maxi puffer coat£59.99£59.99 at AsosFor more, see:The best men’s jeans for every occasion – and how to pick your perfect pair‘Understated, unexpected, cool’: the best men’s knitwear brandsThe best men’s pyjamas for sleeping, lounging and all-day comfortPeter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beautyThe article was originally published on 18 December 2024.

Food styling: Tom Hunt.Waste notBiscuitsHow to make moreish cookies from store-cupboard odds and ends – recipeAlmost anything goes with these thrifty and delicious cookiesTom HuntWed 4 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTShareIoften eat a bag of salty crisps at the same time as a chewy chocolate bar, alternating bite for bite between the two, because the extreme contrast of salt from the chips and the sweetness of the chocolate fire off each other and create an endorphin rush. The same goes for these cookies, adapted from a recipe byChristina Tosiat New York’s legendaryMilk Bar.Compost (AKA larder) cookiesChristina Tosi writesin Gourmet Traveller Australia how she first learned to make these cookies at a conference centre on Star Island, New England, where they’d bake them each week with a hodge-podge of different ingredients. Being on an island, they didn’t always have access to what they wanted, so they had to come up with a new recipe every week using whatever they had. In the spirit of the recipe’s origins, I’ve adapted Tosi’s recipe for the UK, and made it flexible, so you can raid your own store-cupboards and adapt and invent your own version from it.The two main revelations I had when devising this recipe (both of which I’d highly recommend you include) are, first, use fresh coffee grounds, because they impart an incredible depth of flavour without overpowering the cookie. And, second, the addition of salty snacks (salted crisps, pretzels and/or peanuts, for example) is totally delicious in combination with the sweets. You can also try adding other ingredients such as cereal, tortilla chips or roasted fava beans.Tosi makes a Graham cracker crumb to mix into her cookie dough, but I’ve simplified that to an optional biscuit crust made from crushed biscuits (I used malted milk biscuits, but any will do) brought together with a little melted butter.MakesAbout 20For the cookie dough225g room-temperature butter350g sugar– I used a mixture of 250g granulated sugar and 100g dark brown sugar50g golden syrup, or liquid glucose or extra sugar1egg½ tsp vanilla extract225g flour(bread flour, plain flour or a mixture including wholemeal)40g rolled oats2½ tsp fresh coffee grounds(notinstant coffee; optional)½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda, or more baking powder1 tsp sea saltOptional extras50g biscuit crust(eg, graham crackers, Lotus biscuits, digestive biscuits) crushed to a crumb and mixed with 1 tbsp melted butter150g chocolate chips, or roughly chopped chocolate100g other sweets or bars(toffee, fudge, butterscotch, Snickers; I usedRocky bars), roughly chopped100g mixed salted snacks(crisps, pretzels,peanuts)First make the cookie dough. Vigorously beat the butter, sugar and golden syrup for a few minutes, then add the egg, vanilla extract, flour, rolled oats, coffee grounds, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and sea salt, and beat well to combine.Fold in any biscuits, chocolate or sweets that take your fancy, then gently fold in any more fragile salted snacks. Divide and roll the dough into 20 evenly sized balls and place these on a tray in the fridge for at least an hour, and ideally overnight.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line several baking trays with baking paper (unbleached, for preference). Arrange the dough balls evenly on the trays, leaving plenty of room (at least 10cm) between them, to allow for spreading. Bake from cold for about 18 minutes, until lightly golden around the edges, then remove and leave to cool on the trays. Store in an airtight container for several days (or in the freezer for up to three months).Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsWaste notFoodFood wasteBakingSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blood oranges are simmered whole until soft, perfuming your home as they do so, then they’re sliced, skin and all, mixed with sugar and a fragrant cinnamon stick, and embellished with a shot of amaro. Squirrel the jars away for a grey morning, give a few to deserving friends, and be sure to keep at least one to make this elegant mocha marmalade mousse tart. A cocoa biscuit crust topped with a chocolate marmalade mousse and crowned with a cold brew coffee cream, it’s a delightful trifecta of bitterness that no one will ever guess is an easy no-bake dessert.No-bake mocha marmalade mousse tart (pictured top)If you’re not up for preserving, make this using shop-bought thick-cut marmalade.Prep10 minChill10 hrCook1 hrServes8-10For the topping300g whipping cream50g coffee beans15g icing sugarA pinch of saltFor the crust230g digestive biscuits15g cocoa powder, plus extra to finish, if you like1tbspcaster sugar, plus extra for rolling½ tsp espresso powder¼ tsp salt115g unsalted butter, meltedFor the mousse170g whipping cream175gdark chocolate, roughly chopped1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk¼ tsp salt120g blood orange marmalade with amaro and cinnamon(see recipe below ), or shop-bought thick-cut marmalade, plus extra to decorate1 tbsp amaroStart the topping the night before. In an airtight container with a lid, mix the whipping cream and coffee beans, then cover and refrigerate overnight. If you like, you can also make the crust and mousse the night before to get ahead.Grease a 23cm springform tin and line the base and sides with baking paper. To make the crust, put the digestive biscuits, cocoa, sugar, espresso powder and salt in a food processor, then pulse until the biscuits are finely ground. Add the melted butter, pulse again until combined, then press the mix evenly into the base of the lined tin; refrigerate while you make the mousse.In a medium bowl, whisk the whipping cream to medium peaks, then cover and put in the fridge.In a food processor, pulse the chocolate to chop it finely, then add the egg, egg yolk and salt and pulse again to combine. Put the marmalade in a small pan, add 60ml cold water, then bring to a boil over a medium-high heat, stirring to combine. With the motor running, pour the hot marmalade mixture into the food processor, scrape down the sides and keep pulsing for about a minute, until the chocolate mix has melted and slightly cooled. Add the amaro and pulse again to combine.Gently fold a third of the chocolate mix into the chilled whipped cream, then fold in the remaining chocolate mix until no streaks remain. Pour on to the biscuit crust in the tin, then chill in the fridge for at least two hours (and up to overnight) to set.To decorate the tart with sugared peel, rinse the jelly off a few tablespoons of marmalade, then dry the pieces of peel on a rack until tacky. Once dried, roll in sugar.Just before serving, strain the coffee-infused cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, then discard the beans. Add the icing sugar and salt, and whip to firm peaks. Spread or pipe the coffee cream over the chilled mousse, then dust with optional cocoa powder and decorate with the sugared dried peel, if using. Serve at once or chill for up to three hours. Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to three days.Blood orange marmalade with amaroView image in fullscreenCamille Wynne’s blood orange marmalade with amaro and cinnamon.Prep5 minCool34 hrsCook2 hr+MakesAbout 5250ml jars1kg blood oranges1kgwhite sugar100g lemon juice1 cinnamon stick45g amaroWash the oranges, then put them in the base of a large pot in a single layer. Add enough water so the fruits float freely, then cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium, then simmer for one to two hours, until the oranges are soft. Take off the heat and leave the oranges to cool in the cooking water overnight.The next day, set a food mill or fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl. Drain the oranges, then halve them and scoop the insides into the food mill or sieve; reserve the peel. Push the flesh and juice through the mill/sieve and into the bowl, then discard the seeds and membranes. Cut the peel into 25mm x 6mm lengths.Add the sliced peel to the bowl with the flesh, then stir in the sugar and lemon juice and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes, and preferably overnight (or up to a week, in which case cover and keep in the fridge).When you’re ready to cook the marmalade, sterilise clean jars by putting them in a preheated 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½ oven for at least 20 minutes. Have new lids ready and put a couple of saucers in the freezer.Transfer the marmalade to a large pot or preserving pan, add the cinnamon stick and bring to a boil, stirring often, over a medium-high heat. When the froth subsides and the bubbles become regular and splutter violently, test the marmalade for doneness by putting a teaspoon of it on the saucer from the freezer. After two minutes, the marmalade should have formed a skin that wrinkles when prodded; if it doesn’t, cook a little longer and test again.Take the pan off the heat, add the amaro and fish out and discard the cinnamon stick. Ladle the marmalade into a heatproof measuring jug, then pour into the sterilised jars, filling them to just below the rim. If any marmalade strays, wipe the jar rims with damp paper towel, then top with the lids, seal tightly and invert for a minute or two.Leave the jars to cool for another 24 hours, then check the seals before storing them somewhere cool, dark and dry, where the marmalade will keep for at least a year.Camilla Wynne is the author ofAll That Crumbs Allow, and Nature’s Candy, which is published by Appetite By Random House at £26.99.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Fairphone 6 costs £499 (€599), making it cheaperthan previous modelsand pitting it squarely against budget champs such as theGoogle Pixel 9aand theNothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade.The new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don’t drop it in a bath or swimming pool.The back plate is held in place by two exposedTorx screwsand hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed.View image in fullscreenThe back plate can be swapped for various accessories, eachcosting about £25, including a finger loop, a credit card holder or a lanyard.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots or the power-off and restart menu. They are also very easy to hit accidentally when pulling the phone out of a pocket, ramping up the volume unnecessarily.Above the power button on the right side is a big, colourful switch that turns onFairphone’s “Moments” minimalist interface, which blocks notifications and swaps the standard Android home screen for a simple list of essential apps. It’s a smart idea for those hoping to reduce distractions. But swiping up to exit an app shows the regular home screen for a split second, making it feel like a hack. The switch can be repurposed for other features, including activating “do not disturb” or the torch.View image in fullscreenThe Moments switch turns on a distraction-free interface and sits above the flush power button with integrated fingerprint scanner.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.31in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (431ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3RAM:8GBStorage:256GB + microSDOperating system:Android 15Camera:50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP55 (splash/rain)Dimensions:156.5 x 73.3 x 9.6mmWeight:191.4gMid-range power with expandable storageView image in fullscreenThe phone lacks wireless charging support but fully powers up via USB-C in just over an hour, hitting 50% in 22 minutes using a 30W power adapter (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fairphone 6 has the same mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip as theNothing Phone 3a Pro, which can’t rival the best phones for raw power but generally feels fast enough in use. It will handle light gaming and most tasks but will struggle with more advanced titles. The phone has 256GB of storage and a rare microSD card slot for adding more.The battery life is reasonable if not remarkable, lasting about 35 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about four to five hours across 5G and wifi. The Fairphone should see out most heavy-use days, but will need charging nightly.SustainabilityThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles and it can be replaced at home using a single screwdriver, along withthe rest of the 12 modular components. Batteries cost£35, screens£78and the main camera£61. The phone wasawarded 10 out of 10 for repairabilityby the specialists iFixit.The handset is made with50% recycled or fair materials, and Fairphone publishes itslifecycle report.Barebones Android 15View image in fullscreenThe Moments distraction-free interface blocks notifications and gives you a small list of apps to use, which can be customised.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe phone either runs regular Android 15 with Google services, as reviewed, or a privacy-focused, open-source version of Android, without Google services,called /e/OS. Unfortunately, that means the Fairphone 6 isn’t running the latest version of Android 16, but it will besupported with updates until 2033, which is about a year longer than the best mainstream phones.The software is generally uncluttered with little in the way of customisation, which for the most part is a good thing. But it is a little rough around the edges and lacks a few of the bells and whistles that Samsung, Google and others add to their software.It is notably devoid of the artificial intelligence that has been shoved in every crevice by other phone manufacturers. It has Google’s Gemini chatbot assistant, but without the ability to activate it via voice while the phone is locked. The Fairphone also misses out on Google’s excellentCircle to Searchfeature common to most other phones, which is a bit of a shame.Recent updates have fixed some of the bugs, including one in which the screen stuttered and stalled after being turned on from standby. But the software still lacks the level of polish you should expect.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app will be familiar to most, with plenty of features to play with.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fairphone has two cameras on the back and one selfie camera in the screen. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good photos in bright light, but it struggles with high contrast scenes, often misjudging the white balance or looking washed out. The night mode is usable but not as good as you’d expect from a modern smartphone.The 2x digital zoom is reasonable but stretching to 10x causes the photos to become full of artefacts. The 13MP ultrawide camera produces pretty good photos in decent light, with solid detail in the middle of the frame even if they are a little soft at the edges. The macrophotography mode can produce great closeup images with a bit of practice, and the 32MP selfie camera takes good photos for the money.The Fairphone 6 easily has the best camera the company has made and gets the job done, but it can’t hold a candle to similarly priced rivals.PriceThe Fairphone Gen 6 costs£499(€599).For comparison,Google’s Pixel 9acosts£499, theNothing Phone 3a Procosts£449and theApple iPhone 16ecosts£599.VerdictThe sixth-generation Fairphone takes the company further into the mainstream with a solid, mid-range Android with all the perks of a modular, repairable and more ethical design.It trades a few premium features for a lower price than its predecessors, but still has a good screen, great looks and reasonable battery life. It even has a microSD card slot for adding more storage, which is incredibly rare in 2026.The camera is serviceable, though far from the best you can get for the money. The software is basic Android 15, which is unfortunately not the latest version, a little rough around the edges and devoid of AI tricks other than Google’s Gemini chatbot. But Fairphone is slowly fixing bugs and will provide support until 2033. The distraction-free Moments mode switch is a good idea, too. The chip is fast enough now, but it isn’t the most powerful and may become pretty tired after eight years of use.The fingerprint scanner is not the best and the power and volume button placement is an irritating design flaw. While few phones offer as repair-friendly a design, more mainstream devices offer almost as long software support as the Fairphone.The Fairphone 6 is the best, least-compromised phone the company has made. But things have improved in the rest of the industry, with better access to repair and longer software support, making the Fairphone tough to recommend for everyone over mainstream devices.Pros:modular accessory support, repairable-at-home design, software support to 2033, recycled and fair materials, microSD card slot, good screen, five-year warranty,Cons:mid-range performance, fingerprint scanner and volume button placement annoying, average camera, cannot be submerged in water, no Android 16 yet and software is a little rough around the edges.View image in fullscreenThe simple back design hides the modular components and can be swapped out for various accessories.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesEthical and green livingEthical businessreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to get the best ratesWith 1.8m fixed-rate deals due to end this year, now’s the time to dig out the details and look at what’s on offerRupert JonesWed 4 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTShareBe preparedAbout 1.8m fixed-rate mortgage deals are due to end in 2026, and most of these borrowers will need to get a new home loan. If that includes you, but you are not sure when your deal expires, dig out the details.Interest rates have been on a rollercoaster ride since late 2021, and many of those coming off five-year fixed deals will face a jump in payments when they switch to a new product. By contrast, borrowers whose two-year deals are ending will be able to save hundreds of pounds a month.More Bank of England base rate cuts are anticipated this year, which could translate into further reductions in the cost of new deals. The next interest rate announcement is on 5 February.Some will want to fix again for the payment security, but the potential for further rate cuts means others might favour a base-rate tracker deal. Clearly, a lot depends on what happens with interest rates. The Guardian and other news outlets will give you the latest on what economists are forecasting in terms of future rate movements. But ultimately, no one knows for sure what will happen to rates in future, particularly in these turbulent times.View image in fullscreenStaying on the SVR after your mortgage term has elapsed will usually cost your more money than finding a new deal.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAIf you haven’t remortgaged for a while, your home may well have gone up in value, meaning you will qualify for a lower loan-to-value (LTV) band, which will give you access to better deals. If you plan to stay with your existing lender, they will hopefully be able to give you an estimated valuation. If you plan to switch to another lender, you will need to make an assessment of what your property is worth. Check recently sold price data for your area on websites such as Rightmove and Mouseprice.Don’t sit on theSVRIf you don’t arrange a deal to start when your existing one ends, you will usually go on to your lender’s standard variable rate (SVR).This can usually be set, and moved, at the lender’s discretion. The average SVR is 7.25%, according to the financial data provider Moneyfacts, with some lenders charging more than that. Yours is likely to be higher than the rate you have been paying up to now.It might be tempting to stay on the SVR while you see what is happening with interest rates, but mortgage brokers say there are very few scenarios where someone should stay on the SVR for longer than a few months.Someone with a £250,000 mortgage could save more than £500 a month with a deal at 3.65% rather than paying an SVR of 7.25%.Situations where it may be better to stay on the SVR might include if you are coming towards the end of your mortgage, or you only have a very small balance remaining. Arrangement fees for a new loan of between £1,000 and £2,000 are not uncommon, and if your mortgage is small, the costs of taking a new deal might be bigger than any saving.Ask your current lender …Typically your current lender will write to you about three or four months before your deal expires, says David Hollingworth of the broker L&CMortgages. It will usually offer you a choice of products – perhaps including a two-year fix and a five-year fix, and/or maybe a deal with a fee, and one with no fee to pay. Some lenders offer the same products to existing customers that they offer to new ones, while others will have deals exclusively for existing borrowers.Taking a new deal offered by your current lender – known as a product transfer – will be attractive to some as it will be quicker and less bother than remortgaging to a new provider.There will also be less form-filling and it will require a lot less in the way of affordability checks, says Hollingworth. By contrast, a new lender will probably ask lots of questions about income and outgoings, and want to see payslips and bank statements, though this will vary depending on individual circumstances.Some lenders charge fees to value your property (a valuation fee) and/or for legal work. If you stick with your existing lender you will avoid these.… but shop around, tooThere are now more than 7,100 different mortgage products on sale in the UK – the highest figure since 2007, says Moneyfacts. So it is worth comparing the deals your lender offers with its rivals.View image in fullscreenAs the Bank of England base rate edges down, the difference between tracker rates and fixed rates are narrowing.Photograph: Corey Rudy/ReutersOften lenders throw in free valuations and legal services.It’s not hard to do your own research:MoneyfactsandMoneySavingExpert(among others) publish comprehensive, regularly updated best-buy tables on their websites.Consider using a brokerA mortgage broker can help you compare the different offers, look at your individual circumstances before making a product recommendation, and handle the paperwork. Also, some deals are only available from a broker. If you are thinking of using one, check they are able to look at all mortgage products available to brokers (known as a “whole of market” broker) rather than being tied to just one or a few lenders.Check if they charge a fee. There are a number of firms that don’t charge a broker fee: one of the biggest is L&C Mortgages. All brokers receive a payment from the lender when a mortgage completes, which is how the no-fee firms make their money.Weigh up ratesThe fixed rates on offer are at their lowest level since 2022. If you are in the market for one, you need to decide whether you want one lasting five years or more on the basis that this offers payment stability for longer, or a shorter-term deal so you are free to move again soon if interest rates fall or your circumstances change.There is now not a big premium to pay for taking a longer-term fix. At the time of writing, the best fixed rates for those remortgaging were around the 3.64% (two-year) and 3.70% (five-year) mark.Some borrowers will be considering a base-rate tracker deal so they can benefit from lower payments in future, assuming we get more rate cuts. With a tracker, the rate moves down, or up, in line with the official base rate.But as well as offering certainty, fixed rates are typically cheaper than trackers at the moment. At the time of writing, the best-buy tracker rates for those remortgaging were priced at about 3.90%.View image in fullscreenUK fixed mortgage rates are at their lowest level since 2022.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA“Currently, fixed rates are still typically a bit lower than the pay rate on a tracker,” says Hollingworth. But as the Bank of England base rate edges down, that margin is narrowing. He says we may see more demand for trackers if the messaging implies “more rate cuts to come”.Trackers are far more likely to come without any early repayment charges, which may appeal to – for example – those in line for a bonus or inheritance fairly soon, says Hollingworth. This can allow you to hedge your bets: “Trackers can give more flexibility, plus the promise of further rate cuts.” But bear in mind that switching at any point could mean paying fees.Reserve a deal nowRemortgage offers are typically valid for up to six months, so if your deal is ending in four or five months’ time, you can reserve a loan now and wait to see what happens.If the cost of new deals has come down, which many would argue seems likely, you are not committed to that mortgage offer and can enquire about switching to a lower rate – and take your business elsewhere if necessary. (In most cases the product fee often attached to a mortgage is paid on completion, so many people will not have stumped up a fee in advance which they then might be at risk of losing.)If rates have risen, you have locked in at a lower rate.Unlock cash if you need itFor some, the need to finance work such as a loft conversion will be the trigger that has prompted them to remortgage. Others will be remortgaging anyway but will use this as an opportunity to borrow a bit more to finance home improvements (or something else).For those in the first group who don’t have to remortgage, borrowing more from your existing lender might be the cheapest option. Ask your lender; not all will allow a further advance.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesMoney hacksConsumer affairsMortgagesPropertyMortgage ratesBanks and building societiesHousing marketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt ashamed of having chosen artificial enhancement.I’m an outdoorsy mountain runner. At 56, I want to model aging naturally, but having breast implants ran counter to that. Now they are gone, thanks to explant surgery – implant removal without replacement.I decided to speak openly about going flat-chested so more women who face implant removal or mastectomy might consider staying flat.Like other women I spoke with who later had their breast implants removed, I originally got mine to fit a nearly impossible beauty standard: a thin body with round, fuller breasts.Does wearing a bra make breasts more or less perky?Read moreMy little A-cups had risen to the occasion to nurse my two babies from 1998 through 2002. They literally vanished after weaning, as if my body absorbed every cell of breast tissue. I became flatter than my husband. My fit physique developed a masculine chest that made me view my body as tough and unappealing as beef jerky.I had been conditioned early in life, both by our culture and by parents who casually commented on “good tits”, to value the appearance of well-shaped breasts in order to please men. My mom used to test the quality of her breasts by placing a pencil under them to see if the pencil would fall or if it got stuck from the sagging. My dad used to keep his spare change in a ceramic mug shaped like a woman’s large, naked upturned breast.It’s no wonder that after puberty hit, I padded my bras and worried about my small chest.At age 34, I was going through a period of low self-confidence as a stay-at-home mom with a shelved career, and I was trying to redeem myself in my marriage after stupidly falling for another man’s advances. My kind, respectful husband never suggested that I get implants, but I seized on the idea as a way to make us both happier. It felt like a gift to him.I wanted B-cup, not Baywatch, breasts, so I told the plastic surgeon: “I want runner boobs – like, ballerina boobs. I want the world’s smallest boob job.” And I got it.The 34-year-old me wasn’t in a good headspace, and I wish someone had suggested counseling before cosmetic surgery. I also wish I had listened to my obstetrician, who said that if your breasts shrink after breastfeeding, then you’re normal and blessed that they did their job of feeding your babies.That arc – getting implants during a period of insecurity, then feeling relief a decade or more later after removing them – is no longer unusual.View image in fullscreenSarah Lavender Smith at home with her dog, Daisy.Photograph: Morgan SmithOver the past several years, demand for breast implant removal has surged. A December 2024reportby the International Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery found that implant removal surgeries worldwide nearly doubled between 2017 and 2022, a rise the authors describe as “escalating at a pace surpassing that of other mammoplasties” and signaling a potential shift in how patients perceive breast implants.Jaime McDonald of North Carolina, whom I met in 2014 at an ultramarathon, got her breast implants at age 19, in 1999, when she was struggling psychologically and drinking alcohol excessively after her boyfriend took his life.McDonald temporarily lost so much weight that her breasts shrunk to an A-cup. She told her surgeon she wanted to be a C, but she says he evaluated the implants’ fit mid-surgery and decided bigger would be better.“I came out of surgery with a double-D, and I remember thinking, please let this be swelling. From the get-go, I was not happy with them,” she said. She subsequently regained a great deal of weight and didn’t become healthy and fit until she took up running and sobriety. At that point, she grew to dislike her artificially large and uncomfortable breasts even more.She had her implants removed eight years ago after falling in love and marrying a woman “who loves me for me and just wants me healthy, which makes me feel comfortable and loved in my own skin”. Implant removal and a return to her small A-cup natural breasts was “the best decision I ever made”, she said. “It literally felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders. They never were me.”My own decision to have my implants removed didn’t come all at once. Several years ago, they began to harden – like hockey pucks – making it uncomfortable to sleep on my stomach. A doctor told me it was time to replace them because I had capsular contracture, a condition in which the scar tissue surrounding an implant hardens and thickens.About 10% to 15% of women with breast implants develop capsular contracture. The risk is higher with over-the-muscle placement, like mine – something I didn’t know when I had the surgery.At the time I chose implants in 2004, I also wasn’t aware that my nipples could lose sensitivity (which happened to me on one side), and I paid hardly any attention to other risks or to the additional surgery I’d face in the future. The younger me focused on the short term and cared more about her looks.The younger me also didn’t know about breast implant illness (BII), which is an umbrella term for an array of symptoms such as joint pain, rashes and autoimmune reactions that occur after breast implants (which, thankfully, I did not experience). Countless women on social media have shared stories about pain, fatigue, inflammation and rashes that they believe their implants triggered, and that explant surgery alleviated or eliminated.Last year, I initially was inclined to replace my implants with new ones, but then I opened my mind to permanent removal and to staying flat thanks to Junko Kazukawa, an accomplished distance runner and personal trainer, who talked to me about her bilateral mastectomy from breast cancer.I asked Kazukawa if she had reconstruction with implants or had stayed flat after mastectomy. “Flat, 100%,” she said. “I never had big breasts, but just enough to annoy me when running. The doctor also told me that if I got [implants], I’d have to replace them in about 20 years, and I don’t want surgery again.”I realized I could be like her. I could be my flat self. Why risk new implants and face surgery again, if they hardened like my old ones or caused other complications?My explant surgery was not covered by insurance (and cost me $5,617, compared with $8,403 if I swapped them out with a new set of implants). It left me with smiley-shaped scars under the breasts. For two weeks following surgery, I had grenade-shaped plastic bulbs hanging from tubes exiting my ribcage to drain fluid. For four weeks, I was advised to avoid high-impact exercise and heaving lifting or reaching until my chest fully healed.While my explant surgery did not involve added procedures, many women choose a breast lift (removal of excess skin) along with their implant removal. Some explant or mastectomy surgeries also involve an “aesthetic flat closure” to remove or resculpt remaining breast tissue and leave the chest wall smooth.I talked to my surgeon, Dr Matthew Swelstad of Grand Junction, Colorado, about explant options and why more women are getting them done. A plastic surgeon for more than 18 years, he says breast implant removal definitely has been “a growth area” in his practice.“The overall trend [for breast appearance] is for something smaller, more athletic and more proportional, and a lot of women don’t want to wear a bra,” he said. “Size is now less important, but perky remains desirable.”The aesthetic favored in the 1990s onwards was “truly a lot bigger”, he said, “with times changing, there are a lot of different ways to be a woman, and there’s more acceptance of those differences … You can still be feminine with a flat chest.”While many patients come to him for explant due to perceived breast implant illness or fear of it, Swelstad said many also want their implants removed more for psychological reasons involving self-image.“Their narrative is really similar,” he said, “and it goes, ‘I never really wanted them to begin with. I got them years ago when I was younger, and there was this other person in my life who wanted them, and I can’t believe I did this to my body.’”Can breast implants make you sick?Read moreDebbie Sironen, a 74-year-old athlete who lives in Idaho, had her implants removed for reasons that align with the narrative Swelstad described.“I never wanted bigger breasts,” she said, “but my ex-husband said, ‘I just think you’d look so much better.’ When I divorced him and married the man I’ve been married to for almost 33 years, I said, ‘I really want these things taken out,’ and he said fine.”Sironen says she would advise younger women considering implants, “Don’t do it, unless you really want to look different, but I think in the long run you’d regret it. Be happy your body works and can run, hike, work out or whatever, and just stay healthy – that’s the most important thing. Don’t worry so much about how you look and what other people think of you.”Taking Sironen’s advice to heart is easier said than done when celebrities drastically transform their breasts, face, teeth and other body parts, and medical spas normalize injections for fuller lips and wrinkle-free foreheads.After briefly trying Botox in my 40s – and being appalled at the cost – I said no to further injections and learned to live with the vertical lines between my eyebrows and with the folds and bags around my eyes. I’ve since come to believe that cosmetic procedures create a slippery slope: the more you do, the more hooked you become on the idea that you need to claw your way back to a younger version of yourself. It’s a trap that encourages preservation over acceptance, maintenance over meaning.Still, having a chest as flat as a door isn’t easy. When I feel self-conscious about how I look in a tight shirt, I remind myself how much better I feel with the implants gone. My body feels wonderfully aerodynamic when I run or work out, and going braless is as freeing as unbuttoning a too-tight waistband.As I age, it gets easier to give the middle finger to appearance expectations. At long last, I’m letting go of caring about being attractive in the eyes of others.It’s also easier to feel at ease with my natural flat chest and walk with shoulders back for good posture when I see women I respect who made a similar choice – women like my friend Kelly Ridgway-Smith of northern California, who described her decision to stay flat after a bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer last March.“I have absolutely no regrets” about not getting implants after the mastectomy, she said. “I like the way I am now, although sometimes I feel self-conscious. You feel like everyone is looking at your chest going, ‘What happened there?’”Like me, Ridgway-Smith purchased prosthetic forms that can be inserted into a bra to give the appearance of small breasts filling an A-cup.For now, neither of us is using them. “I’m getting more confident being who I am,” she said. “We don’t need that to be a full woman.”Sarah Lavender Smith is a Colorado-based writer who specializes instories about midlife adventures and older athletes.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWomenRunningBreast cancerWomen's healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Try a dose of birdsong to lift the spirits. A new study shows that paying attention to the treetop melodies of our feathered friends can boost wellbeing and bring down stress levels.Previous researchhas shown that people feel better in bird-rich environments, but Christoph Randler, from the University of Tübingen, and colleagues wanted to see if that warm fuzzy feeling translated into measurable physiological changes. They rigged up a park with loudspeakers playing the songs of rare birds and measured the blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol levels (a marker of stress) of volunteers before and after taking a 30-minute walk through the park. Some volunteers experienced the birdsong-enriched environment, some heard just natural birdsong, and some wore noise-cancelling headphones and heard no birdsong. Half of the recruits were asked to pay attention to the birdsong.Reporting inLandscape and Urban Planning, the researchers found that all groups, even those wearing noise-cancelling headphones, experienced a reduction in blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol levels, demonstrating that simply going for a walk was beneficial. Adding in rare birdsong did not reduce stress more than natural birdsong but, interestingly, paying attention to birdsong did. No matter where you live, birdsong may be just what the doctor ordered.Explore more on these topicsBirdsSpecieswatchMental healthWildlifeAnimalsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At this time of year, when it feels like we’ve been scurrying around in near-constant darkness like moles for as long as we can remember, we crave the brightness you get with snowfall – and the glamour of it, too.

A pop of snowy white is the best boost you can give an outfit right now. White is to January what rust and orange are to October: a colour pulled from nature to remind us of the best bits of the season. After all, autumn has grey skies and muddy puddles too, but we ignore them and lean into its gorgeous falling-leaf colours instead.A half moon of bright white at the neckline brightens your look the way a squeeze of lemon or a pinch of salt perks up a dishThe same trick works when we’re in deep midwinter: a burst of white somewhere on your outfit feels like snowflakes, or the first cluster of nodding snowdrops. A reminder to focus on the positive. At a time when life can feel like a bit of a slog, you’ve got to celebrate the small wins to stay sane.Adding a splash of white to a winter look instantly shifts the vibe. Our clothes may be heavy, by necessity, because we need to stay warm, but we don’t want the vibes to be too heavy, right? A flash of white lightens the mood.View image in fullscreenTry white boots like actor Emma Roberts.Photograph: ShutterstockA pair of white ankle boots that I bought a few years ago have been one of those seemingly frivolous purchases that turns out to be unexpectedly useful. I was seduced by their skating-rink energy. (Actual ice skating is my idea of hell – I’m the one hanging on to the edge for dear life – but I am very much here for it as a winter aesthetic.)But you can microdose your whites however you fancy. If you want to channel Cameron Diaz in The Holiday, a white knitted beanie is your pal. But a sock is (as so often) a chic place to start. White socks might sound a little school uniform, but they sharpen the grammar of your look. That they are equal parts nerdy and chic is exactly the tension that makes an outfit interesting. Worn with dark trousers and loafers, the glimpse of ankle-level brightness shifts the energy of an otherwise moody outfit, like the dazzle of sunlight on an icy pavement. Let them peek out unapologetically; the visible contrast is the point here.It is too cold to wear just a shirt or T-shirt, of course, but a crisp, white button-down shirt, or simple white long-sleeve T-shirt, is useful as a supporting player. Winter outfits tend to be boxy, with lots of blocky shapes, but if you wear your shirt beneath a sweater and let the tails sweep loose, the fluttering hems will add a poetic touch.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: the number-one rule for coats this winter – make it longRead moreNot everyone likes wearing shirts, though. I know lots of people who find them too formal, or a lot, what with all their buttons and bits and pieces, and they prefer a sleek crew neck as a bottom layer. If this is you, the thing to do is to wear your T-shirt under a sweater that reveals a half moon of bright white at the neckline. This tiny, almost accidental-looking detail brightens your look the way a squeeze of lemon or a pinch of salt perks up a dish. The flash of white aerates the outfit, somehow making it breezier, like a lungful of cold fresh air.But, just as when adding lemon or salt, be judicious. Head-to-toe white takes your look to a completely different zone: more playful, more whimsical. To keep the vibe grounded, the perfect recipe is around one part white to five parts dark.The days are short, the weather is downright rude, and there are crumpled tissues in every coat pocket. But add a pop of white, and you will look – and maybe even feel – a little sunnier.

I’ve worn it often during the day, and although it reduced redness, I didn’t find it as richly moisturising as others.

This vibrant Welsh market town is a creative spot – it’s where the famous Dinefwr wool blankets are woven and boasts many galleries and antique stores – and is a pretty place to wander. Our eyes land on the rows of handmade cards and mugs stamped with Welsh words. One said:Cwtch. Pronounced “kutch” , it has no direct translation into English. “It’s a big, warm hug,” said the shop owner, “but also it’s a feeling, a sense of belonging,” - and a word that would come to define our weekend.We – I was travelling with my friend, Anna – were here to try outDiscover Carmarthenshire’s new “The Sisterhood” breaksthat tap into the growing trend of women swapping prosecco-fuelled girlie weekends for trips that focus on new skills and wellbeing experiences. For those wanting pre-curated stays there’s a Sisterhood Sorted section on the website, but groups of any size can create a bespoke trip by selecting west, central or coastal Carmarthenshire, choosing from a list of places to stay (from barns to glamping pods ), and then selecting experiences led by Wild Kin, a collection potters, painters, coastal foragers, horse whisperers, walking guides, makers and massage therapists.View image in fullscreenEmma enjoys a jewellery-making workshop with Elen Bowen.Photograph: Anna MooresWe’d chosen Ardderfin Farmhouse on the outskirts of historic Carmarthen, a rustic stone cottage with a clawfoot bath and huge open fireplace . It reminded us of the cottage in the film The Holiday.After settling in, we drove 15 minutes into town for dinner. “Carmarthen is still a community of farmers and the Women’s Instituteis still massive here,” said Rachel Williams, owner ofthe New Curiosity– a weekends-only, seasonal-menu restaurant she runs with her husband-chef, Daniel. “Everyone at our tables tends to know each other – my home is your home,” she said, as I tucked in to a perfectly pink Welsh sirloin.There’s a growing trend of women swapping prosecco-fuelled girlie weekends for trips that focus on skills and wellbeingSaturday brought low sun that splayed silhouettes of the skeletal trees across the frosted fields as we wended up into the hills to meet Yoka Kilkelly, AKA the “Dutch potter on the hill”, who runs herSiramikpottery studioout of a converted barn on a sheep farm. Inside, the slate stone walls were spattered with flecks of clay.View image in fullscreenEmma’s friend Anna captures sunset on the Tywi estuary.Photograph: Anna MooresWe started with wedging – kneading the clay to soften it, make its texture consistent and ensure there are no air bubbles in it. It requires serious heft. “No potter has bingo wings,” smiled Yoka, as we struggled away while she made her clay look as soft as bread dough. We portioned our clay into four, thwacked a lump on to the potter’s wheel and started coaxing it into shape as it span. “A person’s personality shapes their pot,” said Yoka. My clay morphed into coffee cups and Anna’s turned into a bowl, which we later daubed with a glaze. “It’s a mindful practice,” she added. With shards of winter sun spearing through the studio windows and the sensation of earthy clay spinning in my palms, I did feel very present.In the afternoon, we drove toward Llansteffan for a short walk along the sands of the Tywi estuary. Atop a hill was the crenelated shadow of 800-year-old Llansteffan Castle. The tide had drawn back, leaving a trail of bone-white cockle shells and shallow pools that reflected the pinkening sunset. Anna, a keen birder, was scanning for curlews and egrets, camera at the ready. It’s not often I get to see her in her element.In Wales we have a history of women meeting, especially while making food – milking, churning butter, that sort of thingLowri JohnstonWe returned to Ardderfin Farmhouse to find our next activity waiting. Lowri Johnston is a yoga teacher and organicflower farmerbased in nearby Nantgaredig. We lit the fire in the living room and she guided us through a gentle session. Then, fuelled by brownies she’d brought from a local bakery, she taught us to make willow wreaths gilded with ivy, eucalyptus, pine cones and dried dahlias foraged from her own farm, slowly warming the willow first to coax it into a circle.“I love doing this because it embeds people in the seasons and land,” Lowri said. She told us that the Welsh word for sisterhood ischwaeroliaeth. “It means ‘sisters together.’ In Wales we have a history of women meeting, especially while making food – milking, churning butter, that sort of thing.”View image in fullscreenAnna and Emma found there was plenty of time to get outside and explore between sessions.Photograph: Anna MooresAfter Lowri left us, Anna and I dined on a gourmet picnic of homemade meatballs in tomato sauce followed by ginger cake with toffee sauce that had been delivered byWright’s Food. We revived the fire, and sat in deep sofas talking until the wee hours as the embering wood hissed and crackled.Sunday dawned with rain drifting across the fields. I nudged the car toward Newcastle Emlyn to meet primary school teacher turned jewellerElen Bowen, who runs silver and gold jewellery making workshops at her home. She only turned her hand to it in 2023 after having twin girls and deciding on a career change. “I thought, heck, I’ll start an Instagram page and see how it goes – and it snowballed!” This year, she was selected to craft the crown for best story writer in theNational Eisteddfod– Wales’ largest annual festival celebrating Welsh literature, music and arts.Anna chose to make a bracelet; I decided on a ring. And with Elen’s guidance, we hammered, soldered and polished, bringing our own personalities to the piece, as we had with the pottery. After, we gathered around the table to share bowlfuls of her homemadecawl– Welsh stew.By the time we left, and had hugged goodbye every woman we’d met, I thought back to the mug printed withcwtch– how it wasn’t just a hug, but a sense of being gathered in by each of the creators we’d spent time with.

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differentlyAnouchka GroseWed 4 Feb 2026 01.55 ESTShareIn November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three.As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness.But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it.There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myselfhoursof future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I wasnice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit moregrrrr, I wondered if it might stop.View image in fullscreenBefore looking ‘a bit more grrrr’ … Anouchka and Dot in London, 2000.Photograph: Patricio ForresterI asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric.It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades.I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?)I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while lookinggrrrrmeant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others.Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingA moment that changed meFamilyChildrenWomen's hairWomenBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why – and at what cost to the animals and their owners?Elle HuntWed 4 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTShareEven if you’re not afraid of dogs, you might be a little intimidated by Butch Cassidy. His tail may be wagging, but the Belgian shepherd weighs 40kg and moves with awesome agility. Even a casual brush of his body could knock you off your feet if you weren’t expecting it. “I don’t for a minute think he’s going to bite anyone,” said his owner Grahame Green earlier. “Although he would, if I asked him to.” Now Green’s about to demonstrate.He brings Cassidy to heel, and gets him to sit. Facing them is another man, Florin, already braced and wearing a protective arm sleeve. The dog is visibly quivering with excitement, so keen is his anticipation for what comes next. Green gives a one-word command, in German. Cassidy darts forward, an auburn arrow, and in that split-second clamps on to Florin’s forearm. Florin is engaging every muscle to remain upright, but Cassidy does not let go until Green gives the word.Both men are experienced dog handlers, and Cassidy is under control. Still, it is not hard to imagine how even a highly trained animal such as this might misfire in an unpredictable situation, or less confident hands – and chilling to imagine the outcome.Yet “personal protection dogs” like Cassidy are bought, sold and trained every day in the UK. At the top end of the market, purpose-bred animals trained to bite, hold and release on command are sold for tens of thousands of pounds, marketed as family pets that double as live-in security solutions. Demand for these dogs, once the preserve of the ultra-rich and security professionals, seems to be growing, fuelled by celebrity endorsements, social media and widespread anxieties about crime.View image in fullscreenGrahame Green, wearing a protective arm sleeve, during a training session with a protection dog.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianThis is also a largely unregulated corner of dog ownership, raising difficult questions about public safety, animal welfare and where responsibility lies when a dog trained to protect ends up causing harm.The premium tier of protection dogs are purpose-bred German shepherds, Belgian malinois like Cassidy, dobermans, rottweilers and cane corsos, trained to respond to perceived threats, deter intruders and even physically restrain them on cue.Among those who have bought such dogs in recent years are former pop starsRochelle and Marvin Humes,reality TV personalitiesMolly-Mae HagueandKatie Price, actorBarry Keoghanand a number of footballers, includingJohn Terry,Rio Ferdinand,Marcus RashfordandRaheem Sterling. Many were motivated by recent burglaries or other security threats. Australian fitness influencer Kayla Itsines, who acquired two dogs from a UK-based company afterbeing stalked for months,said in apromotional video that she had “never slept more soundly”.These high-profile endorsements seem to be driving mainstream interest. “Demand has increased, without a doubt,” says Alaster Bly, founder of the companyK9 Protector, which has supplied dogs to Olympic athleteMo Farah, singerAlexandra Burkeand a former prime minister Bly won’t name.While most of his clients are wealthy or in the public eye, Bly says he has seen growing interest from people who aren’t obviously either, wanting “to make an investment in security”. K9 Protector breeds and trains its own dogs, selling between 40 and 60 animals each year. Most are German or Belgian shepherds, or Bly’s own “chimera” hybrid: a “very specific genetic combination” he developed for higher-risk environments. Pricing depends on the dog’s level of training and the buyer’s threat profile, but chimeras start at £32,000.At the other end of the market, trainers advertise “personal protection” courses for existing pets. The result is an expanding spectrum of animals marketed as protection dogs – with next to no consistency in training standards, oversight or expectations of the people handling them.View image in fullscreenDog trainer Florin with Shadow.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianPersonal protection dogs are legally ambiguous. They do not fall under theGuard Dogs Act, which governs working guard dogs used to protect commercial premises or security personnel. “Legally, they are treated in exactly the same way as any other dog,” says Sunjay Versani, a criminal defence solicitor at Duncan Lewis Solicitors. “What matters is the dog’s behaviour and level of control exercised by the owner, not how the animal is marketed or labelled.”Dog attacks havecontinued to risein recent years, though protection dogs aren’t distinguished within official statistics. Premium suppliers often argue that their dogs are highly socialised and disciplined to attack only on command, and as such are safer than untrained pets. But whether someone has legitimate reasons for wanting such an animal, or the competence to control one, is largely left to the discretion of individual breeders and trainers.Versani says training a dog for protection purposes can even increase an owner’s criminal liability, “because it may be treated as evidence that the dog was being used as a weapon, rather than as a pet”. Standard home and pet insurance policies typically exclude dogs trained to bite, exposing owners financially as well as legally.And when any dog attacks, regardless of circumstances, it is often the animal that pays the price. In 2020, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toAnimalsreceived two complaints about protection dogs; last year, that increased to 39. Most related to dogs being trained with force or coercion.“We are worried that this is becoming an emerging trend,” said Dr Samantha Gaines, head of the RSPCA’s Companion Animals Science and Policy department.Green, Cassidy’s owner and a professional dog trainer with decades’ experience, is already seeing the rise in interest. Most of his business at Norwich Dog Training School is obedience training for family pets and puppies. As a former security professional, he also has experience with guard dogs.Any dog that isn’t trained in the right way, be that a pet or a protection dog, is potentially a threat to the publicOn his website, Green is forthright about the risks and responsibilities involved in owning apersonal protection dog, andexplicitly discouragesmembers of the public who might be interested. His own passion (and his and Florin’s reason for training their dogs in protection) is forSchutzhund, a specialised (and regulated) working-dog sport developed in Germany.But even in suburban Norfolk, Green receives regular inquiries from local people wanting him to train their dogs to protect them, and even to bite on command. “Most of them are idiots,” he says. “They’ve just got no clue as to the work involved. And why would you want one in the first place?”The breeds most commonly used for protection work are not prohibited under the Dangerous Dogs Act; they are, however, large, powerful animals and potentially challenging for inexperienced owners. Since the XL bully ban, cane corsos in particular havereportedly become more popular, showing how demand for “status” dogs can shift in response to regulation. Protection training offers another outlet for owners wanting a dog to intimidate others, or project power and control.View image in fullscreenA police dog training session.Photograph: ozgurdonmaz/Getty Images/iStockphotoGreen blames the growing mainstream demand on social media, spreading performative displays of canine power and aggression. Online, he says he’s seen dogs trained to bite areas other than the forearm, framed as sport or self-defence. In the US, canine “protection sports”, a modern and more extreme evolution ofSchutzhund, are gaining popularity.Green links that to people who have contacted him about protection training and boasted about their dogs’ alleged power and “bite pressure”. “They want to look big and tough and macho … It’s all an ego thing.”He will occasionally agree to teach dogs to bark on command, as a relatively safe way of increasing peace of mind. But many of the animals he’s asked to consider are clearly unsuitable candidates and may already pose a risk to public safety. More often than not, he argues, people seek out a protection dog as a status symbol, overlooking the very real risks. Once a dog undergoes protection training, “it’s no longer a pet”, he says.None of Green’s dogs has ever bitten someone outside training or demonstrations, but he says he has had some close calls with strangers taking them by surprise or behaving in ways the dog could have construed as a threat. “With a few choice words to the individuals and to my dog, I was able to manage the situation safely.” But, Green adds, the same couldn’t be said of all protection-trained dogs in similar situations.Dogs are sensitive beings; they’ve got their own emotions, preferences, wants and needsAlaster Bly of K9 Protector does not deny there are potential risks to protection dogs, but says that his pose no greater threat than the average pet. A former police officer, Bly established his business 17 years ago. Personal protection dogs were already “big business” in the US and Bly saw an opportunity in the UK.Most of his clients approach him after experiencing a burglary, stalking or other traumatic event, Bly says.K9 Protector has clients across London and the home counties as well as overseas. Bly says he has placed 20-odd dogs within a five-mile radius in north London, after a spate of burglaries. He has also just sold a dog to a Formula One driver who was informed by police that his home was being targeted by an organised crime gang.The uptick in inquiries he has received this winter alone has led Bly to review his offering. K9 Protector is now breeding and training what he calls “high-threat-environment dogs”, capable of taking on multiple intruders and responding to weapons. The company markets its animals as “the sword at your side”. “We try to prepare the dogs for any eventuality,” Bly says.View image in fullscreenCane corsos have become a popular status dog.Photograph: Antons Aleksenko/Getty ImagesHe believes it is “just a matter of time” before one is injured or killed in an altercation. “Ultimately, they are being bought with the viewpoint that they may have to place themselves in harm’s way.” At the same time, Bly downplays the risks they pose outside that worst case scenario. The training they receive to bite, hold and release on command is “more of an obedience exercise”, like recall, than it is “forward aggression”, he says.Bly estimates that 1% of the dogs he sells each year will bite and hold or fight with an individual within the first 12 months of ownership. “The barky, bitey bit is [only] a percentage of what we do,” he says: equally important is that his K9 Protectors are stable, “thoroughly sociable, and able to be taken anywhere”. The vast majority of the time, they serve as deterrents and often cherished family pets. Every dog sold undergoes annual top-up training, while owners are offered ongoing support.Responsibility, in Bly’s view, lies less with the concept of protection dogs than with who is breeding, training and selling them. “Any dog that isn’t trained in the right way, be that a pet or a protection dog, is potentially a threat to the public.” K9 Protector carries out basic searches on potential owners, and sometimes enlists an external company to do further checks. “If we’re not happy with the individual’s character, we can go a little bit deeper,” says Bly. One prospective client was revealed to be a “career criminal”: “We refused to sell him a dog, and that was the end of that.” But, he allows, there is no guarantee that someone else didn’t.Not long after founding K9 Protectors, Bly says he tried to gather others in the industry to establish a regulatory body and minimum standards for welfare, training and breeding. “I couldn’t get everybody on the same page.” Back then, there were only a handful of protection dog providers; now there are dozens. Some are not “morally correct”, says Bly, selling unhealthy or unstable dogs to people who might be afraid for their safety or otherwise vulnerable. He supports greater regulation to protect consumers. “The only thing people have got to fall back on is trading standards … It is a bit of a minefield.”View image in fullscreenGrahame Green receives inquiries from locals wanting him to train their dogs to bite on command.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianYet even the most robustly trained protection dog remains an animal, with instincts and unpredictable impulses. For Samantha Gaines of the RSPCA, it raises the question of whether dogs should be used for “personal protection” at all. “The real concern here is that you have dogs who are being treated, ultimately, as security equipment or tools for defence.Dogsare sensitive beings; they’ve got their own emotions, preferences, wants and needs,” she says. Dogs are also individuals and change over their lives. “This idea that they will consistently and reliably behave in accordance with how they’ve been trained is actually misguided … They’re not robots.”The demand also risks incentivising irresponsible breeders and trainers, and further commodification of animals. “Even if people had realistic expectations about what it means to bring this type of dog into their home, we would still have concerns, just because of how the industry is operating … It’s incredibly difficult for anyone to navigate,” says Gaines.The RSPCA supports introducing licensing for dog owners; Gaines suggests a tiered system could be one way to keep track of those with protection animals, and dissuade others from taking them on. Greater regulation of breeders and trainers could also better ensure welfare.But in the bigger picture, Gaines says, the RSPCA would be inclined to argue against using dogs for protection at all. “There are alternative security measures that are much, much easier.”Explore more on these topicsDogsDangerous dogsPetsAnimalsAnimal welfarePolicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among the questions is which cases the movement rallies behind – and which it doesn’t.In the hours and days after Pretti’s killing, dozens of local national and local gun rights groupslambasted federal officialsincluding Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, and Gregory Bovino, a senior border patrol official, who baselessly claimed that Pretti’s carrying of a handgun proved that he planned to harm and kill border patrol agents. Prominent gun rights organizations, including Gun Owners of America (GOA) and the National Rifle Association (NRA), called for an independent investigation into the shooting and defended Pretti’s right to carry a gun.The reaction from theNRA, in particular, was markedly different from the one it adopted nearly a decade ago when it was called on to speak on the killing of another legal gun owner by law enforcement.Why the Minneapolis killings have driven a wedge between Trump and pro-gun groupsRead moreIn July 2016, 32-year-old Philando Castile, a Black man, was shot and killed in front of his girlfriend and her four-year-old daughter by a police officer in St Anthony, Minnesota, a suburb of St Paul. Castile was pulled over and told the officer that he had a gun – for which he had a permit – in the car. Seconds after the disclosure, the officer shot Castile five times, killing him.At the time, the NRA was the nation’s most prominent and influential gun rights group and was working to defend and expand policies that would allow people to carry their firearmswith and without permits. Two days after the shooting, the organization released a statement calling for an investigation, but it didn’t use Castile’s name and didn’t comment the following year when the officer who shot Castile was acquitted of manslaughter.“Gun rights advocates said nothing even though he was licensed to carry,” Glenda Hatchett, who represented Castile’s family in a civil lawsuit against the city of St Anthony, said. “[Castile] said to the officer – very clearly – that he had a weapon. He said it voluntarily. Before he could even get his ID, [the officer] steps back and unloads his pistol in him. What the hell?”The NRA’s initial silence and subsequently limp response drewire from withinand outside their ranks, with masses of commentators and gun owners alike calling out what they saw as hypocrisy from the group.“You’re on the forefront on this issue but then someone dies and you say nothing? That strikes me as hypocritical,” Hatchett added. “If you are advocating and you’re saying that people have the right to carry then why were you silent?”She argues that race was a major factor in the NRA’s lukewarm response.“Race is a factor, let’s call it like it is. It’sbeena factor in this country,” she added. “If Philando had been white in the suburbs of Minneapolis, would they have said something?”Amid the NRA’s silence, other organizations did speak out. TheMinnesota Gun Owners CaucusandSecond Amendment Foundationboth released statements mentioning Castile by name and describing his death as “troubling” and “a tragedy”.“For Castile, who was killed 4 miles from my house, we made a statement because it was the right thing to do. There was a core moral issue,” said Bryan Strawser, the chair of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.“Why wasn’t there a huge outrage from more than just the local advocates? What about the NRA and all these advocates who talk about the right to carry? If there was ever a case that they could have come out and talk about, it is the one where this man has the right to carry this gun but he was killed on the side of the road,” Hatchett said.When she started seeing the stories about Pretti’s death and the videos depicting his final moment, Hatchett remembers feeling a sense of “horror” and thinking of Castile as well as George Floyd, whose death was also captured on camera and replayed countless times.“It brought back a flood of difficult memories for me. I immediately started having flashbacks to Philando and George Floyd. The world watched this man being killed – not by a gun – but being killed while we all watched,” she said.Hatchett said she hoped both legislation and training could stop interactions between gun owners like Castile and Pretti and law enforcement officers from leading to death and injury. “If we can’t learn from these situations then what is the hope for the state and country?” she said.The NRA did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on their response to Castile’s killing.Explore more on these topicsNRAGuns and liesMinnesota ICE shootingsPhilando Castile shootingRaceUS gun controlTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

No one has claimed responsibility.Sa’idu Baba Ahmed, a politician in the Kaiama region, said gunmen had rounded up residents, bound their hands behind their backs and killed them. The attackers also torched homes and shops. “As I’m speaking to you now, I’m in the village along with military personnel, sorting dead bodies and combing the surrounding areas for more,” he told Reuters.He said many people had fled into surrounding bushland with gunshot wounds and that the whereabouts of several people, including the village’s traditional king, were unknown.Residents told Reuters the gunmen were jihadists who often preached in the village and that they demanded that locals ditch their allegiance to the Nigerian state and switch to sharia law. When the villagers pushed back, the militants opened fire during Tuesday’s sermon, they said.According to Amnesty International the gunmen killed more than 170 people, razed homes and looted shops. “The security lapses that enabled these attacks are unacceptable,” the rights group said, adding that the gunmen had been sending “warning” letters to the villagers for more than five months.Map of Nigeria showing KajamaThe Kwara state governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, condemned the attack as “a cowardly expression of frustration by terrorist cells following the ongoing counter-terrorism campaigns in parts of the state”.Kwara borders Niger state, which is targeted increasingly by armed groups. The military recently carried out operations in the area against what it called “terrorist elements”.Nigeria is in the grip of interlinked security crises, including a jihadist insurgency in the north-east and north-west, a surge in looting and kidnapping for ransom by armed groups known as “bandits” in the north-west and north-central regions, and intercommunal violence in central states.At least two groups operating in the country are affiliated with IS: an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as Islamic State WestAfricaProvince in the north-east, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province, known locally as the Lakurawa, which is prominent in the north-west.The military has said in the past that the Lakurawa has its roots in neighbouring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria’s border communities since a 2023 military coup.In a separate attack on Tuesday, gunmen killed at least 13 people in Doma village in the Faskari area in Katsina state in the north-west, police said on Wednesday. Last week, armed extremists in the north-east killed at least 36 people during separate attacks on a construction site and on an army base.Tuesday’s attack in Katsina state happened despite a series of peace deals brokered between armed groups of motorcycle-riding bandits and villagers in the 11 local government councils most affected by the violence in the state. The deals were negotiated by community elders and traditional rulers and reportedly backed by local authorities. Faskari, a predominantly farming and animal husbandry area, was one of those councils.The Nigerian military has intensified operations against jihadists and armed bandits and regularly claims to have killed huge numbers of fighters.The military said last month that it had launched “sustained coordinated offensive operations against terrorist elements” in Kwara state and achieved notable successes.Local media reported that the army had “neutralised” or killed 150 people. In a statement on 30 January the army said that troops had also “stormed remote camps hitherto inaccessible to security forces where several abandoned camps and logistics enablers were destroyed, significantly degrading the terrorists’ sustainment capability”.In response to the myriad insecurity woes, local authorities in Kwara state imposed curfews in certain areas and had closed schools for several weeks before ordering them to reopen on Monday.Insecurity in Africa’s most populous country has been under intense scrutiny in recent months since the US president, Donald Trump,alleged a “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria.The claim has been rejected by the Nigerian government and many independent experts, who say the country’s security crises claim the lives of Christians and Muslims, often without distinction.On Tuesday, Gen Dagvin Anderson, head of the US Africa Command, said the US had deployed a small military team to Nigeria, where Trump’s administration has alternately put pressure on and aided the government as it fights jihadist violence.Anderson said at a virtual news conference that the two countries had agreed to “increase collaboration”.Despite these efforts, many in the north and south of the country claim the authorities are not doing enough to combat the violence and are instead focused on politics. Hours before the Doma massacre unfolded, thousands of supporters of the ruling All Progressives Congress party travelled on roads where raids have happened in recent years to Katsina’s state capital, where they participated in a rally endorsing its governor for next year’s general elections.Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

While in hiding, Wine has been engaged in a war of words with Museveni’s son – and Uganda’s military chief – Muhoozi Kainerugaba.View image in fullscreenMuhoozi Kainerugaba, the son of Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni.Photograph: Abubaker Lubowa/ReutersWine, a 43-year-old former musician whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, was the main challenger to Museveni in the election, which was preceded by a widespread crackdown on dissent.Most Ugandans have not lived under a presidency other than that of the 81-year-old Museveni, and urban youth in particular have connected with Wine. After the election, Winealleged mass fraudduring the voting and called on supporters to protest.The election was followed by attacks on supporters and officials of the National Unity Platform, the party Wine leads. Hundreds of his supporters were arrested.On 24 January, Wine’s wife, Barbara Kyagulanyi, said armed men had forcefully entered their home and assaulted her as they sought to find out her husband’s whereabouts.View image in fullscreenUgandan police officers detain a civilian in Kampala demonstrating against President Museveni’s election victory,Photograph: Abubaker Lubowa/ReutersCiting the placing of Wine and another opposition politician,Kizza Besigye, under house arrest after past elections, the political analyst Timothy Kalyegira said the “street-smart” Wine “knew the inevitable” and “must have decided he won’t wait for that”.From his hideouts, Wine has posted text and videos on social media rejecting the election results and taunting the military for failing to find him.In text accompanying one of his recent videos on X,he wrote: “I advise the regime to stop looking for me – I will resurface at an appropriate time. The best they would do is to peacefully relinquish power and let the people of Uganda decide their own destiny. Short of that, they will face the inevitable fate of all despots before them”.In a more recent post, on Friday, he directly taunted Kainerugaba. “A rebel without a gun, hiding in plain sight and yet you can’t find me because I’m concealed by the people. Catch me if you can!” hewrote.View image in fullscreenPresident Yoweri Museveni speaks during 60th independence anniversary celebrations in 2022.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/APWine’s statements appear to have irkedKainerugaba, a provocative social media poster. Observers have long suspected Museveni of grooming him as his successor, though the president has denied it.In now-deleted posts since the election, Kainerugaba declared that Wine was wanted “dead or alive” and threatened to castrate or even kill him. “We have killed 22 NUP terrorists since last week,” Kainerugaba wrote last month. “I’m praying the 23rd is Kabobi [Bobi Wine]”.Kainerugaba denied that soldiers had assaulted Wine’s wife during the raid on her house. “First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her,” he posted.A few days later, he posted a photo showing an armed man standing over Barbara while she sat on the floor of her house. “This is when our soldiers captured and then released Kabobi’s wife Barbie,” he said, referring to the raid.On Friday, his rants took a diplomatic turn when he accused officials of the US embassy in Kampala of helping Wine go into hiding and declared that the armed forces had suspended cooperation with the embassy. Wine “kidnapped himself and is missing; and according to our best intelligence did all this in coordination with the current administration at the US embassy in our country”, he said.Kainerugaba later apologised, saying he “was being fed with wrong information”.In response to a request for comment, Col Chris Magezi, acting spokesperson of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces, denied the military was pursuing Wine. “Please save the UPDF from the Bobi Wine drama. We are not interested in it because we are busy and have more important matters to attend to,” he said.Last month, the prime minister, Robinah Nabbanja, and the information minister, Chris Baryomunsi, said Wine was not wanted by the state.Noting the case of the reported assault last year of Wine’s bodyguard Edward Ssebufu, another of Kainerugaba’s social media targets, Kalyegira said the military chief’s statements should be taken seriously because he “does translate some of these threats into reality”.Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer for Wine, said Kainerugaba’s statements “materially elevate the risk of unlawful harm” on Wine and called on the UN, foreign governments and international human rights mechanisms to treat the threats “with the utmost seriousness” and “to demand immediate guarantees” for Wine’s safety.“Based on my personal knowledge of the torture Mr Wine has previously suffered at the hands of Ugandan security forces, it is not hyperbolic to state that his arrest or detention now carries a real and credible risk of death or grievous bodily harm,” he said in astatement.Explore more on these topicsUgandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In a tribute, her choir said she was a rising star “on the cusp of sharing her incredible talent with the world”.Snakebites kill one person every five minutes globally –up to 138,000 every year, and leave 400,000 more with permanent disabilities. Many cases and deaths arethought to go unrecorded, particularly where victims seek care from traditional healers rather than hospitals.View image in fullscreenA boomslang, one of the most venomous snakes in Africa – most snakebite deaths are preventable if antivenom is administered quickly.Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty ImagesCampaigners say there isinsufficient fundingto meet the UN’s goals, set in 2019, of halving deaths and disabilities from snakebites by 2030, andresearch investmentis “precarious”. Snakebite envenoming is classed as a neglected tropical disease.According to the WorldHealthOrganization, most deaths from snakebites are “entirely preventable” if safe and effective antivenoms are available and administered swiftly. They are in the WHO’s list of essential medicines, and global health officials say they “should be part of any primary healthcare package where snake bites occur”.Nwangene said she was woken up at about 8.30am by a bite on her wrist from a grey snake. Two snakes were later found in her apartment, one, a medium-sized cobra, in her bedroom.Nigeria has 29 species of snake, of which 41% are venomous.Shortages of antivenomdue to manufacturing problems have been reported across Africa, along with quality concerns about some products.The first hospital in Abuja that Nwangene went to, there was no antivenom available, according tosocial media postsby her brother.She then went to the Federal medical centre (FMC) where she received treatment including polyvalent snake antivenom, but died after what that hospital has described as “severe neurotoxic complications from the snakebite” and a “sudden deterioration”.Sam Ezugwu, director of Amemuso choir, of which Nwangene was a member, had rushed to the hospital after she asked for help in the choir’s WhatsApp group. He said doctors at the FMC said “they urgently needed neostigmine [a drug used in combination with antivenoms in snakebite cases] and additional doses of the medication already administered, explaining that the hospital had exhausted its supply”.But while he was at a nearby pharmacy purchasing the drug, Nwangene died.“We returned to the hospital to find Ifunanya’s lifeless body on the bed,” he saidin a statementon the choir’s Facebook page. “We cried, prayed, screamed, but she could no longer hear us.”A poll of 904 healthcare workers across Brazil, Nigeria, India and Indonesia by theStrike Out Snakebite global initiative, published last month, found 99% reported challenges with antivenom administration.View image in fullscreenA herpetologist handles an African puff adder during the extraction of its venom to be used in research for the production of antivenom in Kenya.Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty ImagesThey included a lack of training on how to monitor signs of progression, poor infrastructure and inadequate equipment, and daily shortages of antivenom – the shortages were reported by more than a third of the healthcare workers.South Sudan medics trial AI app to identify snakes and improve bite treatmentRead moreElhadj As Sy, chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and co-chair of the Global Snakebite Taskforce, said: “Many solutions exist, but we need political will and bold commitments from partners and investors to turn the tide on this preventable yet devastating neglected tropical disease.“Snakebite must no longer be overlooked or underfunded by the international community. It is time for action – not sympathy, not statements, but action worthy of the scale of this crisis.”The FMC has denied that there was a lack of appropriate antivenom at its site. In astatementit said: “Our medical staff provided immediate and appropriate treatment, including resuscitation efforts, intravenous fluids, intranasal oxygen, and the administration of polyvalent snake antivenom … We stand by the quality of care and dedication our team demonstrates daily. The claims of non-availability of anti-snake venom and inadequate response are unfounded and do not reflect the reality of the situation.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSnakesHealthNigeriaAfricaAnimalsGlobal healthnewsShareReuse this content"

In just 12 months, theTrump administrationhas carried out a broad assault on key pillars of American democracy and the global rules-based international order, which the US, despite inconsistencies, helped to establish. It was now working in the “opposite direction”, he said.Citing DonaldTrump’s calls on Republicans this week to “nationalise” the US voting systemand revelations that a member of an Emirati royal family was behind a$500m investment into the Trump family’s cryptocurrencycompany, Bolopion said: “Every day you see confirmation of this trend, but when you step back you see an organised, relentless, determined assault on all of the checks and balances that are meant to limit executive power in US democracy – a system designed to limit power and protect rights.”He called on democracies, including the UK, theEuropean Unionand Canada, to form a strategic alliance to preserve the rules-based international order, which is under threat from Trump, Russia and China.The HRW report catalogues attacks on the rights-based system during Trump’s second-term administration. They include undermining trust in the sanctity of elections, reducing government accountability, attacking judicial independence, defying court orders, using government powers to intimidate political opponents, the media, law firms, universities, civil society and even comedians.Recent abuses, from attacks on free speech to deporting people to countries where they may face torture, underscored this assault on the rule of law, the organisation said.Combined with longstanding efforts byRussiaand China to weaken the global rules-based order, the US administration’s actions had enormous repercussions around the world, said Bolopion, leaving the global human rights system in peril.How three Uyghur brothers fled China – to spend 12 years in an Indian prisonRead more“Under relentless pressure from US President Donald Trump, and persistently undermined byChinaand Russia, the rules-based international order is being crushed, threatening to take with it the architecture human rights defenders have come to rely on to advance norms and protect freedoms,” he said.View image in fullscreenSt George’s flags in Kent last year. The appearance of union and England flags on lamp-posts has been linked to the rise of anti-migrant sentiment and the far right.Photograph: Getty“Trump has boasted that he doesn’t ‘need international law’ as a constraint, only his ‘own morality’,” Bolopion warned.HRW also reports on the UK, finding that the British government “repeatedly undermined” rights in 2025.The Labour government’s punitive approach to immigration had played a “key role” in making the anti-migrant rhetoric that had emboldened the far right increasingly part of mainstream debate, it said. The human rights organisation criticises the UK’s authoritarian crackdown on the right to protest and a failure to address adequately the worsening cost-of-living crisis.Anti-migrant rhetoric was a “dangerous trend for human rights in the UK, but also [in] France and Germany and other European counties”, Bolopion said, adding that Trump had encouraged this by claimingEuropewas threatened by “civilisational erasure”. By also leaning into racist tropes to cast entire populations in the US as unwelcome, he was “flirting with far-right ideology”, he said.This “democratic recession” pre-dated Trump and began decades ago, the report found. Democracy is now back to 1985 levels, with 72% of the world’s population now living under autocracy. Together with the undermining of the rules-based order, this presented a “perfect storm” for human rights and freedoms around the world, HRW said.Argentina used as a ‘testing ground’ for eroding abortion rights, warns AmnestyRead moreThe foreword to the report states: “Russia and China are less free today than 20 years ago. And so is the United States.”An alliance of rights-based democracies could become a “powerful force” and a “substantial economic bloc”, offering incentives to counter policies that had undermined multilateral trade governance and human rights, Bolopion said, adding that such an alliance could form a powerful voting bloc at the UN.The work of civil society was also crucial in this “dangerous new world”, he said. “It is a challenging time but one for action, not for despair.”There was hope he said, citing publicanti-ICE protests in Minneapolis,after the fatalshootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Goodlast month by federal immigration officers,protests in Iran, which began after a sharp fall in the value of Iranian currency but grew to include calls for political change, toGen Z protests in Moroccoover underfunded healthcare and education.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Millions of Venezuelans’ lives were thrown into uncertainty. Politicians at home and abroad scrambled to respond. It seemed this was something no one had seen coming. Except one person did actually predict it.In the hours before the attack, someone - and we have no way of knowing who - placed a series of bets that Donald Trump would oust Maduro on a prediction market platform, netting them nearly $500,000 when it happened. These platforms allow their users not just to bet on whoever’s going to win the Super Bowl, but also on world events. Heavily regulated under the Biden administration, these apps have enjoyed a huge boom in popularity since Trump came to power.The Atlantic’s senior editor,Saahil Desai,explains them toAnnie Kelly. “They’re called prediction markets because these sites are thought of as more akin to stock markets. The idea being that you put money based on what you think will happen. And in that sense, prediction markets let you forecast the future. But in effect, it’s just a fancy way of betting.”He explains why the fact that media organisations are partnering with prediction market platforms is a worrying trend. “Let’s say you are a donor to a major Senate candidate. You could put millions of dollars into the prediction market for whether your preferred candidate would win and swing the odds. And so you can really shape media coverage in a way that you can’t with traditional polling. And all of that is exacerbated as media outlets start to incorporate this into their coverage.”But how do they work, why are they such big news in the US and why does Trump want to set up his own?Archive sources: NBC, BBC, CBS, CNN, CNBC, Daily Mail, 60 MinutesPhotograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsBusinessToday in FocusVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericas"

The first character means “horse” while the final character, “fú”, means “fortune” or “blessing” – a powerful symbol found across lunar new year celebrations.Put together, Malfoy’s name can be loosely read as “horse fortune”, making him an unexpectedly auspicious figure for the year ahead.The wordplay has sparked a wave of memes, fan art, decorations and themed merchandise across Chinese social media.

Ukraine’s partners, he said, had to exert more pressure on Moscow.“It must be felt now,” Zelenskyy said. “People in Ukraine must feel that the situation is genuinely moving toward peace and the end of the war, not toward Russia using everything to its advantage and continuing attacks.”He added that Ukraine expected the talks to lead to a new prisoner exchange soon.The president, interviewed by the television channel France 2, said the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed on the battlefield as a result of the war with Russia was estimated at 55,000.Despite renewed diplomatic efforts by the Trump administration, the prospects for a viable peace deal remain unclear, with Moscow continuing to press itsmaximalist territorial demands. The Kremlin has said repeatedly any settlement must include Ukraine ceding the entire eastern Donbas region, including areas still under Ukrainian control. Kyiv has rejected such terms, saying the conflict should instead be frozen along the current frontline and ruling out any unilateral withdrawal of its forces.Other major obstacles remain. Moscow has said it would not tolerate European troops on Ukrainian soil, a condition Kyiv sees as essential for crediblesecurity guarantees. Speaking to Ukraine’s parliament on Tuesday, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said European allies had committed to deploying forces to Ukraine once a deal was reached – a proposal Russia has so far flatly rejected.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday Russian forces would continue fighting until Kyiv made “decisions” that could bring the war to an end, underlining Moscow’s hardline stance even as negotiations resumed.Kyiv was dealt a diplomatic blow before the talks when Trump declined to condemn Russia for pounding Ukraine’s energy grid with missiles and drones despite an apparent ceasefire.Drones chart“Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelenskyy wrote after the attacks, urging western governments to denounce the strikes.Trump said later on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin had “kept his word” on the ceasefire, adding that Russia’s pause in attacks was meant to last only until Sunday.The second round of talks was initially supposed to start on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, but waspostponedbecause ofrising tensionsin the region over Iran.The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, travelled to Abu Dhabi for the negotiations. The two men have become fixtures in US diplomacy, shuttling between talks on the Middle East, the Iran crisis and the Ukraine war, but have faced criticism over their lack of formal diplomatic experience.Kirill Dmitriev: ‘ruthlessly ambitious’ Kremlin figure behind Ukraine planRead moreUkraine’s team includes Kyrylo Budanov, the former head of military intelligence who now leads the presidential administration, and Andrii Hnatov, the chief of the general staff. The Russian delegation is led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU military intelligence service, alongside other senior intelligence officials and the Kremlin’s investment envoy,Kirill Dmitriev.A potential meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has been mooted, but the Kremlin said it would agree to such talks only if the Ukrainian leader were willing to travel to Moscow.In a show of wartime alignment, Putin held a video call on Wednesday with China’s president, Xi Jinping, with both leaders hailing the strength of bilateral ties.China has emerged as a crucialeconomic lifeline for Russia, stepping up trade and purchases of Russian oil as western sanctions have tightened. Ukraine and several European governments have accused Beijing of providing weapons to Russia, allegations China denies.Washington has previously put pressure on India, another close partner of Moscow, tocurb its purchases of Russian oil, which the west says help finance Putin’s war.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropeUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

EU member states, however, will need to hold further talks on how to include the UK, including agreeing a list of products that could be procured from British suppliers.The decision comes after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, signalledhe would like to reopen talks with the EUon a defence pact. Negotiations to join the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) programmecollapsed last year.As the current Safe scheme progresses without the UK, the loan for Kyiv offers a more immediate way for the EU and UK to find rapprochement on defence.The loan is a crucial lifeline for Ukraine, which has been enduringmonths of brutal Russian attacks damaging its energy and heating systems, leaving people in the cold and dark, while the country is in the grip of a bitterly cold winter.EU leaders last year agreed to lend Ukraine the money to fill a critical funding gap in 2026 and 2027, as Kyiv risks running out of money to fund its defence, pay public servants and pensions.The loan will be funded by borrowing on capital markets, secured against unused spending in the EU budget. EU leaders alighted on this solution, after disagreeing over the alternative of securing the loan againstRussia’s frozen assets.Under the plan, €60bn is earmarked for Ukraine’s defence and €30bn for general budget support.The EU has said Ukraine would be required to buy military equipment from domestic suppliers, the EU or closely associated countries, such as Norway. But if critical kit was not available in those countries, Kyiv could securepermission from Brussels to buy from other countries, including the USThe intention is to ensure a European preference, but give Kyiv flexibility to buy, for example, US Patriot missile defence systems.The updated version of the proposal, approved on Wednesday, has introduced two new clauses, aimed at giving Kyiv greater flexibility to buy from non-EU countries that have signed security pacts with the union.One clause is aimed at the UK. Ukraine would be allowed to buy military equipment from a country that has committed to “provide a fair and proportionate financial contribution to the costs arising from [EU] borrowing” commensurate with the value of contracts won. In addition, the country should also have a security and defence partnership with the EU and be able to demonstrate it is providing “financial and military support to Ukraine in a significant manner”.The UK and EU signed a security and defence partnership last May as part of the reset.An EU diplomat told the Guardian it made sense to open up the possibility for Ukraine to buy weapons in the UK – and for the UK to make a financial contribution. “It is natural to ask the UK to participate in interest repayment proportionally to the contracts UK firms would obtain. Otherwise EU taxpayers would be subsidising UK industry.”No figure for a “fair” UK financial contribution has been proposed. Some sources say this is a deliberate effort to avoid intense focus on finances, while others say it would be impossible to propose a UK contribution without knowing the UK’s potential involvement.Before Wednesday’s decision, a UK government spokesperson said: “We do not comment on internal EU processes.”The loan now needs to be approved by the European parliament, with the aim of releasing the first tranche of funds from April.According to EU estimates the €90bn covers two-thirds of Ukraine’s funding needs and other “international partners” are expected to fill the gap.Asked whether the UK would be one of the countries to contribute to Ukraine’s financing, the government spokesperson said: “In total, the UK has committed £21.8bn in support for Ukraine through military and fiscal assistance.”Our support for Ukraine is iron-clad. We continue to work with G7 and EU partners to ensure Ukraine can defend itself.”The decision was taken under a special procedure involving 24 of the EU’s 27 member states, after Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia declined to add their support but agreed not to block the plan.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUkraineArms tradeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In Norway, rape can be defined as occurring with or without intercourse.The party had taken place in the basement of Skaugum, the official residence of the crown prince and princess, while they were upstairs, he said.On Tuesday, the court was shown four films and 10 pictures apparently taken between 7:12am and 7:17am one morning in December 2018. The prosecution believes the rape without intercourse took place during this time.When on Wednesday the judge asked Høiby about the videos and photos found on his phone, Høiby said: “I don’t even remember taking them.”He told the three judges that he and the woman did have consensual sex, but not while she was asleep. She must have been awake, he said, because “I don’t sleep with women who are not awake.”Within minutes of taking the witness stand, Høiby broke down in tears after saying he found it “incredibly difficult to speak in front of so many people”. The press, he said, had “harassed and tormented” him since he was three years old.He said he had lived a life that “very few here can relate to”, in which there had been a lot of partying and drinking. “I am known for being my mother’s son. Nothing else. I have had an extreme need for validation,” he told the court. “And that manifested itself in a lot of sex, a lot of drugs, and a lot of alcohol.”His testimony came after that of the alleged victim from the party. She told the court she remembered briefly having sex with Høiby earlier in the evening before she stopped it,but had had no recollection of the alleged rape until she was contacted by police who showed her the footage.She told the court that in the footage she had been “completely unconscious” and that learning of it felt like “a betrayal and a shock”.She said she had never seen herself like that and had never experienced that kind of memory loss. She said she believed she had been drugged.Breaking down in tears, she said she did not want to be a victim, adding: “Unfortunately, I have been, thanks to Marius Borg Høiby.”Høiby said he believed that alcohol and drugs were consumed at the party, but that: “Before this came up, this is not an evening that has lingered so much in my mind.”Asked whether he remembers taking any pictures, he said: “I don’t remember taking them myself, but we had sex completely awake and voluntarily. I don’t remember much of that sex either.”He said he stored sexual photos and videos in a separate app on his phone because “I don’t want to scroll past a lot of nude photos”. He added: “It’s never been for anyone else but me anyway.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for the Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Likeness of restored angel to Giorgia Meloni triggers investigations in RomeRead moreValentinetti for days denied he had deliberately restored the angel’s face to look like Meloni, before confessing. “Yes, it’s the prime minister’s face,” he toldLa Repubblica. “But it’s similar to the previous painting.”The altered painting was first completed in 2000 and is not protected by any heritage regulations.The likeness to Meloni prompted investigations by Italy’s culture ministry and the diocese of Rome, with cardinal Baldo Reina, the diocese’s vicar general, expressing “bitterness” over the incident. He said: “Images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited.”Daniele Micheletti, the basilica’s parish priest, said he had noticed “a certain resemblance” to Meloni but insisted he had instructed Valentinetti to restore the painting, which had suffered water damage, exactly as it was.View image in fullscreenThe church has been filled with curious visitors keen to see the image for themselves.Photograph: Francesco Fotia/AGF/ShutterstockSince the story broke, the church has been filled with visitors curious to see the image for themselves. “There was a procession of people that came to see it instead of listening to mass or praying,” said Micheletti. “It wasn’t acceptable.”Opposition politicians seized on the scandal, with members of theFive Star Movementsaying in a statement that art and culture should not risk becoming “a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister”.Meloni had laughed off the incident, posting a picture of the painting on her Instagram account with the caption: “No, I definitely don’t look like an angel,” and a laughing emoji.Explore more on these topicsItalyGiorgia MeloniVaticanCatholicismChristianityEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

They will take place amid a massive buildup of US naval and airpower in the region and appear to be a last chance for Tehran to avert a US strike against the country’s leadership and nuclear programme.The talks had collapsed earlier on Wednesday as Iran vowed they would be confined to its nuclear programme only. The US had demanded the talks also address Tehran’s ballistic missile programme, which Iran had ruled out.Asked whether Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should be worried after reports of the collapse of negotiations, Trump responded: “I would say he should be very worried, yeah, he should be.”It is not clear whether the dispute has been fully resolved. Axios reported that the talks had been reinstated after the US was approached by a number of Arab and Muslim countries urging it not to abandon negotiations with Iran.Despite its relatively weak negotiating hand, Iran has said the only issue on the agenda can be the assurances that Tehran is willing to provide that its nuclear programme has no military purpose or objective. It says the talks must be held in Oman, where most of the previous rounds of talks were held.Iran had thought it had forced businessman Jared Kushner, who is also Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, to agree to these terms and drop the plans for the talks in Turkey. Instead, it has been reported that Witkoff will travel to Doha on Thursday and then return to Washington without meeting the Iranians. The US has a large naval fleet in the region that Trump has said he is willing to use to force the Iranians to back down.Explaining US thinking before news of the apparent collapse started to circulate, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said: “We thought we had an established forum that had been agreed to in Turkey that was put together by a number of partners who wanted to attend and be a part of it. I saw conflicting reports yesterday from the Iranian side saying that they had not agreed to that, so that’s still being worked through.”He added: “At the end of the day, the United States is prepared to engage, and has always been prepared to engage, with Iran. In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include certain things, and that includes the range of their ballistic missiles.“That includes their sponsorship of terrorist organisations across the region. That includes the nuclear programme. And that includes the treatment of their own people.”His remarks, diplomats said, did not preclude the discussions on these topics being sequenced, as Turkey had recommended, and left an ambiguity as to what other issues might be discussed if the nuclear file is initially addressed.Iran had been hoping that the opening of the talks in Oman might lead to a broad statement by both sides to agree to negotiate and to de-escalate tensions. This would allow direct talks to start. But the US appears to be determined that its agenda and format, one that appeared to have the support of some Arab states, should prevail. The US believes that Iran is in a weak negotiating position and Tehran has badly overreached itself.No guarantee existed that the nuclear file can be resolved since Iran insists it must retain its right to enrich uranium inside Iran and that there is no need for its existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium to be transferred out of the country to a third party such as Russia. On Thursday, Russia said its proposal to take the Iranian uranium stockpile still stood.Rubio added: “Iran has only shown willingness to discuss its nuclear programme, albeit not on the terms demanded by the US – for the Islamic Republic to agree not to enrich uranium on its own territory and export all of its already enriched stockpiles out of the country.” He added that the US did not see agreeing to meet the Iranians as a concession or an act of legitimisation.Tensions within Iran about its negotiating stance were reflected in criticism made by some Iranians of the aggressive posture being adopted by Ali Shamkhani, the former secretary of the supreme national security council of Iran from 2013 to 2023. He has warned that war is likely and said Iran need only reduce the purity of its uranium stock.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaOmanNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Global Counsel, a lobbying company Mandelson co-founded and part-owns, also works for Palantir.The cabinet secretary, Sir Chris Wormald, is being urged to release information about Mandelson’s role when the British embassy arranged forKeir Starmerto visit Palantir’s showroom in Washington DC in February 2025 shortly after Mandelson became ambassador to the US.Mandelson and Starmer met the company’s chief executive Alex Karp and were shown the company’s military technology. Karp signed a strategic partnership with the UK defence secretary, John Healey, seven months later and in January theMinistry of Defence(MoD) signed a £241m three-year contract with Palantir to “boost military AI and innovation”.What does the criminal investigation mean for Peter Mandelson?Read moreFoxglove, a fair tech campaign group, led calls for the Cabinet Office to release information relating to any involvement by Mandelson in the negotiation of Palantir’s contracts.Alex Burghart, a Conservative MP and shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, also urged Wormald to review Palantir’s latest MoD contract “given the allegations now coming to light about Mandelson’s conduct”.Starmer’s meeting with Palantir did not appear in the prime minister’sregister of visitsand was acknowledged only in subsequent disclosures, Burghart said. He said Palantir’s MoD contract “was granted by direct award” – without competition – and asked that the cabinet secretary check there were “no other such contracts, no other such undisclosed meetings”.Calls for transparency came after Mandelson wasapparently shown to have forwarded to Epstein highly sensitive informationhe received as business secretary under Gordon Brown in 2009, including government responses to the global financial crisis. Epstein received a prison sentence for child sex offences in 2008 but was able to keep working and Mandelson stayed in contact with him.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The British Medical Association said last week that doctors could refuse to use Palantir’s £340m NHS federated data platform in some cases, in protest over the tech company’s role in facilitating ICE activity in the US.Palantir was co-founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel who has supported Trump. Emails released by the Ministry of Justice suggest that Epstein also had a relationship with Thiel.Zack Polanski, the Green party leader, said in a letter to the health secretary, Wes Streeting: “There are worrying questions to answer about his role in the government’s deal with Palantir – a spy-tech firm co-founded by a man who thinks the NHS should be ‘ripped up’.“Was the government’s decision to trust this controversial company with British people’s most sensitive and personal health data made on the basis of what’s best for our country – or was it yet another dodgy backroom deal brokered by Mandelson for the benefit of his rich pals?”Chi Onwurah, the chair of the science and technology committee, said: “We have raised questions about Palantir’s public sector contracts, how and why they came about and whether the UK should be dependent on large, US-based providers. We will be publishing our findings shortly, but it is clear that the government should prioritise greater sovereign capability in emerging technologies, and review its dependence on these firms.”While Mandelson resigned as director of Global Counsel in May 2024, he has continued to retain shares in the consultancy, according to records at Companies House.“We need the full picture on Mandelson’s involvement,” said Campbell. “Anything else risks irreparable damage to public trust.”Palantir declined to comment.

The rightwing Israeli government refers to the area as “Judea and Samaria” in reference to the biblical kingdoms of ancient Israel as part of broader efforts to bolster historical and religious claims to the land. The international community, on the other hand, broadly recognizes the West Bank as occupied land that must be part of a future Palestinian state.The term “Judea and Samaria” has been embraced by many US Republicans since the first Trump administration, including the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who Donald Trump appointed as ambassador to Israel last year. Arkansas became the first US state to mandate replacing references to the “West Bank” in state institutions with “Judea and Samaria” in April last year. Similarbillshave been proposed in the US Congress but have not come up for vote.‘A violation of our history’: Palestinian uproar over Israel’s plan to seize historic West Bank siteRead moreFlorida’s proposed legislation is the only one to also target K-12 schools.If the Florida legislation passes,, state agencies, including universities and colleges, would be prohibited from using the term “West Bank” in any official state government materials, and would require any new instructional or school library materials in K-12 public schools to comply with the new law and use the term “Judea and Samaria”.The bill, called the Recognizing Judea and Samaria Act, comes amid the imposition of sweepingrestrictive changesto school textbooks and library materials by Florida legislators in recent years, particularly targeting LGBTQ+ and race-based themes; climate change and social justice issues, including the Black Lives Matter movement; critical race theory; and descriptions of socialism.The Lake Worth Democratic representative Debra Tendrich, who is Jewish and one of HB 31’s sponsors, said she felt the bill was necessary to combat the “erasure” of Jewish links to the land. “Jordan coined the term West Bank, not for any other reason than to erase the Jewish connection from this land,” she told the house state affairs committee last week.But the Democratic representative Angie Nixon of Jacksonville told the committee the proposal “could be seen as an attack, an erasure of the Palestinian people”. Adam Abutaa, Florida organizing manager with the Muslim-American advocacy group Emgage Action, added that the proposed change “elevates one narrative while erasing another, restricting how educators, researchers, public institutions can speak about a region recognized by the US government and the international community”.“This bill does not operate in the abstract; it touches people’s histories, families and lived realities,” said William Johnson, PEN America’s Florida director. “Our state is home to thousands of Palestinian Americans, many of whom have deep ties to the West Bank. At a time of rising anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian rhetoric, the legislation sends a worrying signal that some Floridians’ identities and experiences fall outside the bounds of recognition and belonging.”The house version of the bill, HB 31, was advanced by the state affairs committee on 27 January and awaits debate on the house floor. The parallel senate effort, SB 1106, is still awaiting committee review to advance to a vote.

His political office quickly demanded an impartial inquiry into his death, casting doubt on the ability of the UN-backed government based in Tripoli to mount such an investigation.The Tripoli-based prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, holds on to power even though a UN-led process in 2021 had only intended to install him as an interim leader pending new elections that never happened.Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of ex-Libyan leader, killed, say officialsRead moreAs a result, Libya remains divided between an authoritarian east led by the family of the warlord Khalifa Haftar and the UN-recognised west that istrying to demonstrate that the country has shed its violent past.But Saif Gaddafi’s difficulty was that he did not fit neatly into this picture of a country divided in two – and as such represented a threat to many.One Libyan said: “There is a large constituency inside Libya that has come to support what he symbolises, and if there were elections it was likely that he would do better than Dbeibeh and Haftar, especially since there is a nostalgia for the past that is remembered as more secure. Since there have been no national elections in Libya since 2015 there is a large group of voters that have no personal experience of Gaddafi’s father or what he did.”The conspiracy theories swirling around Saif’s death are made all the more intriguing by recent reports that the rival camps had met in Paris last week to discuss a common approach to elections. The two sides were brought together by Donald Trump’s adviser on Arab and African affairs, Massad Boulos.Any national unity deal between the two sides would have faced the obstacle of Gaddafi’s apparent determination to stand as a third force. Already his supporters are lauding him as a martyr.But his death also marks another step back for international justice.Elham Saudi, the director of the London-based group Libyan Lawyers for Justice, said: “Saif Gaddafi is the last person who had anoutstanding arrest warrantat the international criminal court for violations in 2011, and for that avenue to justice to be closed off now would be very regrettable, especially since this is the 15th anniversary of the uprising. It would be a sad day for victims if that file is now closed with his death.”More sophisticated and western-oriented than his father, Saif was often seen as the slick interlocutor with western powers as they negotiated Libya’s abandonment of weapons of mass destruction or compensation for the families of those killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland.Educated in the west, his modern image managed for a period to beguile London academia – including the London School of Economics, which in 2008 granted him a PhD soon after Libya promised the institution £1.5m of funding over five years.But once the Libyan civil war erupted in 2011 Saif was unambiguously by his father’s bloody side and was captured by Islamist revolutionary forces as he sought to flee for Niger. The militia that captured him – the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq battalion – for six years ignored the ICC warrant, and released him in 2017 as part of a general amnesty.Slowly he entered a third phase in his political career, acting as a populist alternative to the corrupt elites in both the east and west.In 2021, he attempted to run for president, appearing in the southern city of Sabha in tribal dress to deliver his nomination papers.Libya’s army chief dies in plane crash in TurkeyRead moreHis message, as relayed in a rare interview given to the New York Times, had a resonance. “There’s no money, no security. There’s no life here. Go to the gas station – there’s no diesel. We export oil and gas to Italy – we’re lighting half of Italy – and we have blackouts here. It’s more than a failure. It’s a fiasco.”His candidacy was blocked and the whole election process stalled amid arguments between all sides about the qualifications required to run for the presidency. Yet Saif Gaddafi paradoxically benefited from being silenced. Untainted by being in government, and the endless corruption, he retained a mysterious allure.In recordings smuggled out more recently he questioned why “martyrs” had sacrificed themselves in 2011 only to find they were being ruled by foreign ambassadors from Turkey, Britain, the US and France or by UN special envoys such as the American Stephanie T Williams.Now no one will know whether he could have won a presidential election. But the story of how his death is investigated, the culprits identified and his life memorialised still has the potential to influence the future of Libya. Fifteen years after the death ofMuammar Gaddafi, the dictator’s shadow still looms large over the country.Explore more on these topicsLibyaSaif al-Islam GaddafiMuammar GaddafiMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Tents in al-Mawasi, an encampment of displaced people in Khan Younis, were shredded by the blasts.The strikes targetedGazaCity and Khan Younis. The Israeli military said it had fired on Gaza after a gunman shot at Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded a reservist.“While we were sleeping in our house, the tank shelled us and the shells hit our house, our children were martyred – my son was martyred, my brother’s son and daughter were martyred,” said Abu Mohamed Habouch at his children’s funeral.Israel has killed more than 556 people in Gaza since the start of a ceasefire in October, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian gunmen have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same time period, according to Israel.The Israeli strikes were the latest violations of the fragile ceasefire, which, even as diplomats tried to push it through a difficult second stage, has not stopped a continued war in the beleaguered territory.While strikes ripped through Gaza, health officials reported that Israel had also stopped medical patients crossing the Rafah border crossing to Egypt. The crossing had partly reopened on Monday,allowing a trickle of Palestinians to crossfor the first time in months.The Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.“They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was expecting to be evacuated, said at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.The Israeli military agency that controls access to Gaza, Cogat, said on Wednesday that the Rafah crossing remained open, but that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organization to facilitate the crossing.The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.An Egyptian security source said that efforts were ongoing to get Rafah reopened, and that Israel had said it had closed the crossing due to security issues.Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of US president Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants.Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, medics in Gaza said.Three women who crossed back into Gaza through Rafah on Monday told the Associated Press that Israeli troops had interrogated and threatened them, holding them while blindfolded and handcuffed for several hours before releasing them. The Israeli military said it had no knowledge of arrests by the Israeli security establishment.In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire in which the sides would negotiate the shattered territory’s future governance and reconstruction.Key issues such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the more than 50% of Gaza they occupy and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 2.7 million people tracked, 2.8% were diagnosed with autism between the ages of two and 37.They found that by the age of 20, diagnosis rates of men and women were almost equal, challenging previous assumptions that autism is more common among males.“Our findings suggest that the gender difference in autism prevalence is much lower than previously thought, due to women and girls being underdiagnosed or diagnosed late,” said the lead author, Dr Caroline Fyfe.The research calculated that in childhood, boys were diagnosed on average nearly three years earlier than girls – the median age at diagnosis was 15.9 for girls, but 13.1 for boys. Overall, boys were three to four times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism under the age of 10, although girls were found to “catch up” by the time they were 20, owing to a rapid increase in autism diagnosis during adolescence.“These observations highlight the need to investigate why female individuals receive diagnoses later than male individuals,” the authors conclude.The study, published in the BMJ, also found that while gender disparities in diagnosis rates remained pretty consistent over the last three decades for children under 10, they decreased rapidly for all other age groups.“Findings indicate that the male to female ratio for autism spectrum disorder has decreased over time and with increasing age at diagnosis,” the authors observe.“This male to female ratio may therefore be substantially lower than previously thought, to the extent that, inSweden, it may no longer be distinguishable by adulthood.”Patient and patient advocate Anne Cary, writing in a linked editorial, said the research supported arguments that it was “systemic biases in diagnosis, rather than a true gap in incidence” that were behind the discrepancy in diagnosis rates.While the onset of symptoms could be delayed and masking was undoubtedly a factor, the methods and tools to diagnose autism might be biased and need refining, she said. “These biases have meant that a girl who would ultimately have a diagnosis of autism would have a less than third of a chance of receiving a diagnosis before the age of 10 years,” Cary added.“As autistic girls and women await proper diagnosis, they are likely to be (mis)diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, especially mood and personality disorders, and they are forced to self-advocate to be seen and treated appropriately: as autistic patients, just as autistic as their male counterparts.”Responding to the findings, autism charities said much more needed to be done to tackle gender stereotypes.Dr Judith Brown, head of evidence and research at the National Autistic Society, said: “Gender should never be a barrier to receiving an autism diagnosis and access to the right support.“Historically, it was wrongly assumed that autistic people were mostly men and boys, but we now know that women and girls are more likely to ‘mask’ what [are] traditionally thought of as signs of autism, making it harder to identify the challenges they face.“Misdiagnosed autistic women can develop coexisting mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression, as a result of a lack of support and the exhaustion of masking. This is why it’s so vital that the experiences of autistic women and girls are not overlooked, and outdated stereotypes and incorrect assumptions are finally put to rest.”Jolanta Lasota, chief executive of Ambitious aboutAutism, said: “Autistic girls have different experiences to autistic boys and have slipped under the radar for far too long.”By having their needs misunderstood or explained away as something else, “they have missed out on vital support, and in some cases, reached crisis point with theirmental health”, she added.“It is crucial researchers and diagnostic services continue to build understanding of the different presentations of autism in girls and women, and that our support services adapt to accommodate the increasing number of people who we now know need them.”Dr Conor Davidson, former Royal College of Psychiatrists’ autism champion and clinical lead for Leeds autism diagnostic service, said: “Autism in girls is more likely to go undetected during childhood and signs of the condition might only surface during adolescence or even early adulthood.“Psychiatrists working in adult neurodevelopmental clinics in the UK have started to see higher numbers of women coming forward than men in recent years. Unfortunately, waiting lists for both child and adult autism assessments are unacceptably long.“There are many autistic women who have not received a diagnosis, and it is vital that they are able to access a timely assessment and care if they need it.“Psychiatrists must also be aware of the possibility of autism when they are assessing patients with mental health problems. This can be particularly important for women, whose autism may not have been picked up in childhood.”Explore more on these topicsAutismChildrenHealthNeurodiversityMental healthSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

The doctors’ unioncondemned that figure as “indefensible”and “an insult” when the Department of Health and Social Carefirst proposed it in evidenceto theNHS pay review body and doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration body.The search for a resolution has become more urgent since theBMA announced on Mondaythat resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, had voted overwhelmingly to keep on striking for another six months in pursuit of their demands for a 26% pay rise over the next several years, along with more places for doctors to start training in their chosen medical speciality.Thefive-day walkoutresident doctors staged just before Christmas was their 14th strike since March 2023. Each of the three five-day stoppages they have held since Labour took power in July 2024 has cost the NHS an estimated £250m.Streeting is also looking at introducing a system of financial penalties for hospitals that do not do enough to improve resident doctors’ working lives. That could lead to NHS trusts being fined if they do not give those medics access to rest areas and hot food during their shifts, including overnight – a longstanding complaint by the BMA.He is also drawing up plans to address another major grievance among resident doctors, namely that those who do extra work outside their contracted hours should receive payment for that or time off in lieu.Jim Mackey, NHS England’s chief executive,last year set out a 10-point planfor hospitals to improve resident doctors’ working lives. However, the BMA and Mackey are both frustrated that some NHS trusts have been slow to make enough progress on issues like access to rest and food, as well as payroll errors and management of doctors’ rotas.In a sign that Streeting’s talks with the BMA appear hopeful, Dr Arjan Singh, the deputy chair of the union’s resident doctors committee,told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesdaythat it is unlikely to call further strikes in the near future, despite their new legal mandate to do so, because progress is being made.“There is no intention to go on strike. It is a negotiating tool, but we’ve got no intention of actually using it.“We can pull the trigger and go on strike whenever we want, but that’s not the aim of the game. The aim is to get good pay and good conditions, without strike action, hopefully,” he said.Singh added: “We’ve been on strike 14 [or] 15 times, quite a lot, over the last two years. Ideally we can get this done without any further action.”New polling on Wednesday showed that a majority of the public oppose strikes by resident doctors over their demands. YouGov found that 52% of people in Britain do not support walkouts – down from 53% in a similar survey in December – and that 38% do support them, a figure which has not changed.YouGov asked 4,592 adults in Britain if they supported or opposed resident doctors going on strike over pay and job insecurity. The survey was undertaken on Tuesday, after the BMA’s ballot result.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care denied the story and said: “We won’t be giving a running commentary on what have so far been constructive talks.”Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingTrade unionsIndustrial actionDoctorsLabourHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, until now there has been limited evidence of how it might affect the risk of all forms of stroke.The study, published in Neurology Open Access, a journal of the American Academy of Neurology, shows an association but does not prove the Mediterranean diet causes a lower risk of stroke.However, experts not involved with the research welcomed the findings, and said there was “huge potential” to reduce a person’s chances of experiencing a stroke. Globally, more than 15 million people experience a stroke every year. Of those, 5 million die and another 5 million are left permanently disabled.In the study led by researchers from the US and Greece, the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of stroke overall, as well as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.Ischemic stroke is caused when blood flow is blocked to part of the brain, and is the most common type of stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain.“Our findings support the mounting evidence that a healthy diet is critical to stroke prevention,” said study author Sophia Wang, of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Duarte, California. “We were especially interested to see that this finding applies to hemorrhagic stroke, as few large studies have looked at this type of stroke.”The study involved 105,614 women in California with an average age of 53 at the start of the study, who had no history of stroke.Participants were given a score of zero to nine based on how closely they followed the Mediterranean diet. They received points for consuming above the overall population average in specific categories – wholegrain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil and fish – and if they drank a moderate amount of alcohol.They also received points for consuming a below-average amount of red meat and dairy products. In total, 30% of participants had scores of six to nine, the highest group, and 13% had scores of zero to two, the lowest group.Participants were followed for an average of 21 years. After adjusting for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity and high blood pressure, those in the highest group were 18% less likely to have a stroke than those in the lowest group.They were also 16% less likely to have an ischemic stroke and 25% less likely to have a hemorrhagic stroke,according to the study.“Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, so it’s exciting to think that improving our diets could lessen our risk for this devastating disease,” said Wang. “Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to help us understand the mechanisms behind them so we could identify new ways to prevent stroke.”The study had limitations – it looked only at women, and participants reported their own diet data – but independent experts suggested the findings were significant.Nine out of 10 strokes were preventable, said Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association, a charity, so there was “huge potential” to reduce the chances of a person experiencing one.“It’s long been known that eating a Mediterranean diet can help to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke,” she said. “We welcome how this has now been shown to reduce the risk of total, ischemic, and haemorrhagic strokes.“Haemorrhagic strokes, while less frequent, are much more severe, so it’s reassuring that this study sheds light on this critical yet understudied subtype.”Explore more on these topicsHealthStrokenewsShareReuse this content"

The singercanceled the US portion of his tour last yearout of fear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would target his fans.There has been a frenzy online of people posting about Bad Bunny lyrics, including Puerto Ricans explaining slang used by the singer and non-Spanish speakers documenting their journey to learn Spanish.Anticipation forhis half-time performancehas only intensified since last weekend, when his album Debí Tirar Más Fotos became the first Spanish-language album to win the Grammy for album of the year. He did not shy away from addressing targeted federal immigration operations at the awards.Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big in Grammys ceremony filled with anti-ICE sentimentRead more“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said in English after winning his first Grammy for música urbana album. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”‘Like a form of protest’Niklaus Miller, 29, has been buckling down on learning Bad Bunny lyrics since the singer’s SNL appearance months ago.“I am delusional enough to be like ‘this would be easy. I could pick it up pretty quickly,’” Miller said.The fervor to learn a new language within a short time span highlights the powerful impact of Latino culture in the US despite the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions.“It felt like a form of protest,” Miller said. “What can I do right now besides what everyone is doing that is trying to help? It just feels good.”Miller said he has got messages from people who watch his videos with their parents since he started posting about the process of learning Spanish. They say they feel seen and appreciated.While Miller has not learned Bad Bunny’s entire discography, he has learned portions of six songs that he feels will be part of the half-time show, including Tití Me Preguntó, DtMF and Baile Inolvidable.The day after Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act, O’Neil Thomas, 28, a New York City actor and content creator, started learning the singer’s catalog.“I was just so excited because he wasn’t an artist that I expected,” Thomas said. “And given how we are right now with the state of the country I think he is the perfect person to headline such a humongous stage.”The response to his TikTok videos – showing Thomas learning NUEVAYoL and other tracks – have been really positive, Thomas added. Many Puerto Rican people have reached out, saying they are proud that someone outside the community is attempting to learn about their culture.Latin culture intensifies interest in Spanish“People were already starting to make the effort with learning Spanish as a result of their interest in Latin music,” said Vanessa Díaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University. “The Super Bowl itself is an additional push for a trend that was already happening.”Díaz, who is the co-author of P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance, says the rise of Latin music over the past decade has pushed non-Spanish speakers to learn the language. Bad Bunny’s clear messaging in his lyrics, videos and performances amplifies that interest, Díaz said.Spanish is the most spoken language at home behind English in the US – except in three states, according to US census data. More than 13% of residents age five and older speak it.View image in fullscreenNiklaus Miller has been learning Bad Bunny lyrics since the singer’s SNL appearance.Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/APBut Bad Bunny’s booking at the Super Bowl has been divisive from the start.Trump called the selection “ridiculous.”Conservatives have called it anti-American – even though native-born Puerto Ricans are also US citizens. Turning Point USA is putting on analternative “All-American Halftime Show”with a lineup led by Kid Rock.This all comes against the backdrop of Latinos and Spanish-speaking communities being targeted in Trump’s immigration crackdowns. His executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.Díaz doesn’t think his performance will necessarily shift how Latinos are perceived in the US but she says it will create an interesting conversation depending on “how people are going to grapple with the magnitude of having someone like Bad Bunny on the stage.”At a time when “the US is targeting Latinos and migrants and Spanish speakers or even those who are just perceived to be any of those things in a way that we haven’t seen in our lifetimes”, his visibility is powerful, Diaz said.For Thomas, Bad Bunny’s music offered the perfect opportunity to take on the challenge of learning a new language.Donald Trump will not attend Super Bowl because it’s ‘too far away’Read more“I love Spanish and I always wanted to learn it,” Thomas said. “So, this has been a fun introduction for me to finally hone in.”Both Miller and Thomas said that learning Spanish, specifically Puerto Rican Spanish, in a short period of time has been a unique challenge.Thomas said listening to Bad Bunny’s music casually is a different experience than learning the lyrics.“Listening to his music is really fun,” Thomas said. “The amount of times I’ve pressed rewind just to get a phrase, I can’t even count.”Miller said the hard part about learning the songs is that the Puerto Rican dialect tends to chop some words and it is very fast. Miller said if he hasn’t worked on understanding a song for days, he might forget the pronunciation and it’s hard to come back to it.“It’s fun but then stressful because I am a type-A person, so that’s been hard, honestly,” Miller said. “I’m firing on all cylinders.”Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyPuerto RiconewsShareReuse this content"

Approximately one-third of employees were affected.Staffers at the Posthave been on edge for weeksabout the rumored cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It’s an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.‘No one knows anything’: Washington Post staffers fear major cutsRead moreDuring a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said,according to an audio recording of the meeting.Murray told employees that the Post was ending the current iteration of its popular sports desk, though some employees would remain on a new team. The Post is also restructuring its local coverage, reducing its international reporting operation, cutting its books desk and suspending its flagship daily news podcast Post Reports.Murray said that while the Post’s international coverage team will be scaled back, approximately 12 bureaus will remain “with a focus on national security issues”.“We all recognize the actions we are taking today will be painful – most of all, of course, for those of you who are directly affected, but for everybody,” Murray told staffers on the call. “I know that the reset is going to feel like a shock to the system and raise some questions for everybody.”Martin Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”Seeking to lay out the business case for the layoffs, Murray said the move was “about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded and competitive and complicated media landscape”.“I know that these last couple of weeks have been an unusually tense and distracting time for all of us, and I know it will be a difficult day,” he added. “I appreciate the excellence of your work during this time.”Murray said the Post’s largest team would be focused on covering politics and government, and the paper would also prioritize coverage of nationals news and features topics such as science, health, medicine, technology, climate and business.Post employees who have been laid off will continue to be on staff through 10 April, though they will not be required to work. They will receive six months of continued health insurance coverage.The affected employees include Caroline O’Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg,have also announcedthat they were affected.One editor who was laid off on Wednesday laid much of the blame at the feet of the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, who did not speak on the company’s morning conference call.“Will Lewis’s legacy (already pretty bleak to begin with) will be having enabled Bezos to tank an American institution,” the staffer said, requesting anonymity to speak candidly. “And he wasn’t even brave enough to face his staffers more than once in his tenure at the Post. Embarrassing to say the least.”After years of growth under owner Bezos, the Post has been shedding staff over the last few years. About 240 staffers left via buyouts offered at the end of 2023, and another chunk of staffers took buyouts last year, which were offered to any employee with more than 10 years of experience.Layoffs, particularly of journalists in the newsroom, have been less common. In fall 2024, the Post laid off 54 employees from the division responsible for its proprietary publishing software, and in January 2025, the Post laid off about 4% of staffers who worked in advertising, marketing and print operations.Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos stays silent as employees brace for cutsRead moreOver the past week, Post employees had been urging Bezos to stop – or at least soften – the planned cuts, signing letters and sending personalized messages on social media that conveyed the importance of the journalism the Post produces.But Bezos has remained silent, and did not respond to a series of letters sent by staffers representing the newspaper’s foreign, local and White House reporting teams.On Monday, though, he was there in person to warmly greet Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, on a tour of another one of the companies he owns, his Blue Origin spaceflight startup in Florida.Baron, the former executive editor, warned: “The Washington Post’s ambitions will be sharply diminished, its talented and brave staff will be further depleted, and the public will be denied the ground-level, fact-based reporting in our communities and around the world that is needed more than ever.”Baron called out Bezos for an ill-timed decision to pre-empt the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for president in fall 2024, as well as a decision to narrowly focus its opinion page to prioritize writing “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, decisions that led to the resignation of a top editor and quickly cost the Post hundreds of thousands of subscribers.“Bezos’s sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump have left an especially ugly stain of their own,” Baron said. “This is a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”The union representing most Post employees said the cuts made on Wednesday were not “inevitable”.“A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the union said. “Continuing to eliminate workers only stands to weaken the newspaper, drive away readers and undercut The Post’s mission: to hold power to account without fear or favor and provide critical information for communities across the region, country and world.”The union suggested that Bezos might not be the right owner for the Post. “IfJeff Bezosis no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then the Post deserves a steward who that will.”The union has organized a protest of the cuts to be held in front of the Post’s Washington DC headquarters on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsWashington PostJeff BezosNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

The federal agency has the authority to investigate charges against employers who are covered by the law.Lucas, a Republican, was appointed as acting head of the EEOC by the US president in 2025. Her predecessor during the Biden administration, Charlotte Burrows, was fired shortly after Trump’s return to office last year.“Title VII’s prohibition of race-based employment discrimination is colorblind and requires the EEOC to protect employees of all races from unlawful employment practices,” Lucas said. “Thanks to President Trump’s commitment to enforcing our nation’s civil rights laws, the EEOC has renewed its focus on evenhanded enforcement of Title VII.”Striking Starbucks workers urge customers to delete coffee chain’s appRead moreOn his first day in office, Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts. He also signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don’t promote DEI. The administration has alsotargeted universities, urging them to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal funding.The information that the EEOC is seeking dates back to 2018, and includes criteria used to select employees for layoffs, information related to the company’s tracking, use of worker race and ethnicity data, and information about “16 programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities”.Lucas has targeted programs related to diversity and gender since being appointed by Trump in 2025, in alignment with the administration’s agenda. In a recentinterviewwith the New York Times, she said that her goal was to undo the consequences of an “aggressive focus by D.E.I. activists” under the Biden administration.In a statement, a Nike spokesperson said: “We have had extensive, good-faith participation in an EEOC inquiry into our personnel practices, programs, and decisions and have had ongoing efforts to provide information and engage constructively with the agency.“We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC’s inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information.”Nike is a “proud American company”, the spokesperson added. “We are committed to fair and lawful employment practices and follow all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination. We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously. We will continue our attempt to cooperate with the EEOC and will respond to the petition.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessTrump administrationNikeDonald TrumpRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Our spirits still strong.‘We’re not going anywhere’: how unionization ‘whirlwind’ set stage for historic Starbucks strikeRead more“What we’re asking for has not changed. We’re demanding livable wages, stable and predictable hours, and an end to union busting. Starbucks still has not delivered on any of that.”Since 13 November last year, Starbucks Workers United began anunfair labor practice strike.Since December 2021, workers won union elections atmore than 600 Starbucks stores. With several stores hit by closures, Starbucks Workers Unitednow representsabout 11,000 baristas at 576 Starbucks stores in the US. A further 15 storesfiled for a union election last month.At the end of December, the unionscaledback the scope of the strike, with most stores giving a return to work notice to Starbucks, with the aim to keep several hundred to 1,000 workers on strike in a rotational basis given the financial burdens of long strikes for low-income employees, and to put energy into increasing the number of unionized Starbucks stores.About 1,000 baristas across nearly 50 stores are on strike. “We have definitely made it known that we deserve a fair contract and union busting has got to stop now,” said Christi Gomoljak, a Starbucks barista, during asolidarity callannouncing the “Delete the App” campaign.Gomoljak and her co-workers recently organized a union at the Downtown Disney Starbucks in Anaheim, California, and walked out on strike in November 2025.“We are calling on Starbucks customers everywhere to delete the Starbucks mobile app off your phone,” Gomoljak added. “When baristas get a fair contract, you can reload the app on your phone and then finally, use any gift cards that you might have gotten from the holidays. But trust me, coffee with a union contract tastes so much better, and it is worth the wait.”Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, said on the call: “Supporting our baristas as they take on one of the most powerful companies in the world … is an incredible way to make an impact. This fight is about something way bigger than just coffee. It’s about whether we as working people get to live with dignity in this world that we make possible.”Starbucks has downplayed the strike and its impact, claiming that fewer than 1% of the chain’s stores were ever affected, and more than half either continued operating, or reopened, shortly after the strike. They did not comment on the app deletion campaign.“The union has called for an unconditional return to work at nearly all of the coffeehouses on its strike list,” said a Starbucks spokesperson, Jaci Anderson. “We see this as a positive step and hope it signals a willingness to return to the bargaining table.She added: “With more than 30 tentative agreements already in place, we’re confident we can move quickly toward a fair contract – one that reflects that Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 an hour for hourly partners.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position.It recently emerged that, days before Trump’s inauguration, a member of theEmirati royal family was behind a $500m investment into the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company,World Liberty Financial.Griffin said this type of investment, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, “bothers” him.Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”.“Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said.Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee.He did highlight specific Trump policies that he supported at the conference in Florida, including the president’s focus on securing the US border with Mexico and hisnomination of Kevin Warshas chair of the Federal Reserve last week.The billionaire also suggested he might run for office himself, and said: “In a future point in my life I would like to be involved in public service.”In response to Griffin’s comments, the White House spokesperson Kush Desai told the Financial Times: “The only special interest guiding the Trump administration’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people.“The fact that major stock indexes have hit multiple all-time highs, real wages have grown, and inflation has cooled since President Trump took office is proof that this administration is delivering for every American.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald Trump JrEric TrumpDonald TrumpUS political lobbyingUS political financingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mirrors distort. Perspectives shift. And nothing is quite what it seems. It is an apposite metaphor for theseWinter Olympics, which officially open in Italy on Friday.Over the following 16 days, the world will be enraptured by the dazzle and spin of these Games: downhill skiers bombing down mountains at 95mph, snowboarders twirling like gyroscopes, the balletic grace of the world’s best skaters. But in Milano Cortina a fresh cold war is also brewing amid global political chaos.The Joy of Six: unlikely Winter Olympics starsRead moreThis week the IOC president, Kirsty Coventry,called for sport “to be a neutral ground”, separate from politics and the actions of governments. It was a worthy sentiment. But she might as well have been singing kumbaya in a warzone.While Coventry was speaking, US Olympic officials changed the name of an athlete hospitality space in Milan from “Ice House” to “Winter House”, following protests over the fatal shootings by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.It was a move welcomed by the American figure skater Amber Glenn, who told reporters: “It’s unfortunate that the term ‘ice’ isn’t something we can embrace because of what is happening, and the implications of what some people are doing.”Less than 24 hours later, Italy’s foreign minister revealed that the country had thwarted a series of cyberattacks “of Russian origin” targeting websites linked to the Winter Olympics.That revelation was even more noteworthy for another reason. Because over the past few days there has been strong momentum in Milan for Russian teams, who are banned because of the war on Ukraine, to be allowed back into the sporting fold.And while there are just 13 Russian competitors at these Games – under the banner of Authorised Neutral Athletes – there is hope in Moscow that the country’s new stars, such as the 18-year-old Russian skating champion Adelia Petrosian, can make their mark.As Irina Rodnina, a state Duma deputy and three-time Olympic champion, put it: “It’s already encouraging that Russian athletes will be competing at these Olympics. Literally the entire country will be rooting for them and cheering for them.”However it has also raised eyebrows here that Petrosian is being coached in Milan by the controversial Georgian, Eteri Tutberidze, who was condemned by the IOC four years ago for her “tremendous coldness” after she was seen screaming at the then 15-year-old skater Kamila Valieva.View image in fullscreenThe presence of Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag has angered Ukrainian competitors.Photograph: John Locher/APValieva, who was under pressure havingtested positive for a banned drug, fell twice in her routine, leaving the then IOC president Thomas Bach to describe Tutberidze’s behaviour as “chilling”. Expect there to be more questions about why the Georgian is here in the days ahead.Meanwhile on the Ukrainian side, there is ongoing outrage that the Russians are here at all. And they are expressed most eloquently by the skeleton star Vladyslav Heraskevych, who made global headlines in Beijing when he held up a sign saying “No War In Ukraine”.“There is war fatigue, which makes people start to forget that Russia is a terrorist state,” he told the Guardian. “We see them more often in sports arenas. We see them more in the cinema. Everywhere in the world. But Ukrainians are getting bombed every day. We are sitting in houses without water, without heating, and it’s minus 20 degrees outside.”Heraskevych is back competing again in Italy. However, he says he has been warned by the IOC not to protest. “I don’t want to really jump into the details but I was contacted after our junior team protested at the Europa Cup,” he says. “It was the first competition where neutral athletes in our sport were allowed to compete. And so our team, together with Latvia and Sweden, made a protest.“After that, the Ukrainian side was contacted by the IOC, and we were warned. They also mentioned protesting at the Olympics. There were some warnings. And a pretty serious one.”There are plenty more potential flashpoints that lie ahead. On Thursday, for instance, pro-Palestinian activists are planning a demonstration when the Olympic flame arrives in Milan to protest against Israel’s participation in the Games. While later in the week, environmental groups also intend to march.On Wednesday evening the IOC also had to fend off questions about the head of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, Casey Wasserman, who is in the Epstein files, as well as the election of the first Iranian women, Soraya Aghaei, to the IOC just weeks after protests in the country were violently put down.On Valentine’s Day, Denmark will face USA at ice hockey – a match that has significantly more riding on it after the US president, Donald Trump, started making ominous threats against Greenland.View image in fullscreenThe streets of Milan are prepared for a global celebration of winter sports.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA recent poll found that only 17% of Danes see the US as an ally – while 60% of them see them as an adversary. That is not an outlier, and on Wednesday, the IOC president was asked if she expected the USA team to be booed at the opening ceremony.“I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as an opportunity to be respectful towards each other,” she said. “I hope for everyone watching I hope it will be a really good showcase of possibilities and inspiration – and a nice reminder of how we could act towards each other, and how we can do that respectfully. I think that is what the Olympic Games represent.”The ceremony on Friday at San Siro will feature stars such as Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli and Snoop Dogg – while, according to Marco Balich, the creative lead, it will feature harmony as its core message. It was a theme that Coventry picked up when asked if she had a message for those planning to protest in the coming days.“The Games are a place where people can be reminded of the best of humanity,” she insisted. “And I hope that more and more people will feel that magic as we head towards the opening ceremony.”Although given everything that is bubbling away here in Milan, that may prove to be a forlorn hope.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But new head coach Mike Vrabel has transformed the narrative around the teamOliver ConnollyWed 4 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 13.27 ESTShareThere used to be a simple rule: Anybody but theNew England Patriots.From 2001 through 2019, the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick dynasty totaled sixSuper Bowltitles, 13 conference championship appearances and 17 divisional crowns. They were the Evil Empire, constant contenders in a league designed for parity. It didn’t matter who you were; the Patriots were the final boss.The early years of the Patriots’ dynasty had a different feel. They were thePatriots,a dash of Americana, playing in red, white and blue,who won their first title as scrappy underdogs, lifting theLombardi after a national tragedy. They had the head coaching guru in the hoodie and discovered the All-American quarterback in the sixth round of the draft. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when Brady, Belichick and the Patriots were underdogs. They were, whisper it, even admired and beloved.Butler did it: 11 years on, was the NFL’s most criticized call actually the right decision?Read moreBut winning has a way of hardening opinions. And the Patriots committed the cardinal sports sin: they won too much. And they won differently. They were better, smarter, colder. And when other teams attempted to import the wisdom,it ended in disaster.Fans of other teams were sick of their success. Opponents, too.Sure, there were other reasons. There were the cheating scandals:real and serious, andstupid and imagined. There were theoff-field scandals. The arrogance. The whiff ofMaga. The jockeying for credit. There wasPortnoy. But the Patriots’ chief crime was that they won. For 20 years, they made 31 other fanbases miserable, building a generation of resentment. It made the downfall all the sweeter.Dynasties don’t explode. They erode. First,Brady left. The aura followed. Then the wins.Without Brady, Belichick and the Patriots suffered. ThenBelichick left. His replacement was fired after a season. Even in New England, the nostalgia faded away. Suddenly, Foxborough wasn’t hosting coronations. It was hosting fourth quarters where half the crowd had already beaten the traffic. The Evil Empire had become … normal.But normal, it turns out, is humanizing.And now the Patriots are back in the dance. On Sunday, they will be trying for their seventh title, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins by a franchise. They will face the Seahawks as underdogs. And the last time the Patriots were underdogs in a Super Bowl was 24 years ago, back when they were the fun upstarts, with the golden boy at quarterback taking onthe Greatest Show on Turf. The prevailing sense now is not dread, but: good for them.It’s funny how a single force can have a halo effect on a franchise. In New England, that force is Mike Vrabel.If the old Patriots were sterile, Vrabel’s version feels like a bar fight.Vrabel is almost a caricature of a football coach. He’s the former Patriots linebacker who dives into brawls during team practice. The coach who bloodies his nose while teaching players proper technique. He’s the master strategist with a rah-rah spirit; the man who preaches situational football while ripping on a vape pen. He’s the secret dork who can recite the details of the rulebook while drinking his offensive linemen under the table.“You changed my life, coach,”Cory Durden, a Pats defensive end, said to Vrabel on the sideline after last month’s AFC championship game.Durden isn’t the only one to think that way. Players – current and former – talk about Vrabel with alevel of reverence. He’s one of their own. Vrabel spent 14 years in the league as a player, helping to kickstart the Patriots’ dynasty on the field before returning to the team as a coach. Win on Sunday, and he will become the first person to win a Super Bowl as a player and coach for the same franchise.But for all the bombast, Vrabel is a brilliant football mind. He combs the rulebook for any advantage. He has built his coaching career on mastering “situational football,” breaking the game down to its component parts. As a player, he was a thumper. As a coach, he’s a tactician.In Tennessee, Vrabel rebooted a flagging franchise, leading the Titans to the playoffs three times in six years. In New England, he has overseen a similar turnaround, from four wins a season ago to 14 wins and a Super Bowl berth this year. And his fingerprints are all over the rebuild. Along with coaching, he has the final say on personnel. He’s nailed draft picks, built a quality coaching staff and imported a free-agent class filled with guys from his Tennessee days. Anchoring the roster around a solid defense and quarterback Drake Maye, he turned the Patriots from doormat to contenders in one offseason.Vrabel is, in his own sense, an underdog; on a short list of players who have played and coached at the highest level. Chucked out by the Titans after a power struggle, he spent a year in the wilderness, helping out in Cleveland after missing out on head coaching gigs in the 2024 cycle. At 6ft 4in and around 250lbs, he wastoo big and too intimidatingfor modern executives, according to The Athletic. That didn’t matter to the Patriots.The team is now built in his image. They’re talented, obviously,piloted by Maye, an MVP-caliber quarterback, even if he has struggled so far this postseason. But they’re also scrappy, a who’s who of cast-offs and grinders. The dark lore that shrouded the mid-to-late period of the Belichick-Brady partnership has been left behind. These Patriots don’t beat you 38–10. They beat you 20–17 and make you hate every second of it. There’s something oddly charming about that.View image in fullscreenThe Patriots were feared – and hated by many – under Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.Photograph: David J Phillip/APAnd yet, as always, some elements break the happy, scrappy narrative.This is still a team owned and operated by Robert Kraft, a man so utterly dedicated to securing his place in the game’s history that he produced a 10-part documentary to burnishhis own reputation– while knifing the greatest coach of the modern era in the back. Kraft has been so relentlessly obsessed with a place in the Hall of Fame that it hasturned voters off.Then there’s Kraft’s off-field activities. There was themassage parlor. There is his cosy relationship with the Trump administration. Kraft and Trump are long-term friends. Kraft claimed tocut communicationwith the President after the storming of the Capitol in 2021, butsat next to Trumpat the premiere ofMelanialast week. The public showing came after Kraft had lobbied the administration to give his buddy favorable treatment during acrackdown on law firms. It is also surely a coincidence that the friendship restarted after Kraft’s son, Josh Kraft,dropped out of the Boston mayoral race. Kraft, it seems, is happy to help drive a nation over the cliff if he can pick up some hardware and huzzahs on the way.It would be easy to ignore Kraft’s involvement if it were not standard practice for theNFLto present the trophy to the winning owner before anyone else.The Patriots also have two players under investigation for allegations of violence against women. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore is facingdomestic violence charges, accused of assaulting his daughter’s mother, who is pregnant with his second child, according to a criminal complaint. Stefon Diggs, a wide receiver, is facingstrangulation and assault chargesfrom a woman who worked as his private chef.Barmore and Diggs, who both deny the allegations against them, are key contributors to the team. If Barmore grabs a game-clinching sack or Diggs hauls in a crucial catch, will NBC even mention the accusations? If Kraft holds the trophy, will the broadcast do anything butgenuflect to Mr Kraft? Don’t hold your breath.Vrabel’s halo is doing a lot of heavy lifting. But he has been able to wind back the clock to the pre-dynasty days. The Patriots have a lovable coach again and a young star at quarterback, one whose wife bakes pregame cookies. They play as a team. They’ve turned underheralded players into potential champions. They are good and fun and young and even cool again. On the field, they are mostly likable.It only took two decades, six banners, a collapse and an identity transplant. But Vrabel has made most of the team human again. And the funny thing about humans? We tend to root for them.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is averaging 20.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.‘Alex Pretti was murdered’: NBA’s Haliburton among sports stars to condemn Minnesota killingRead moreDavis made nine starts in the 2024-25 season after arriving inthe much-maligned tradethat sent fellow All-NBA star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers on 2 February 2025.

Among the subjects: the 2026 World Cup, to be co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada this summer.“I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices,”Weah said.“Lots of real fans will miss matches.”“It is too expensive,” he added. “Football should still be enjoyed by everyone.”Pochettino plainly did not appreciate Weah wading intothe affordability discoursethat has become one of the dominant topics of this World Cup – along with, you know,all the rest of it.‘They’re not getting a cent of my money’: how readers feel about World Cup ticket pricesRead more“I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside,” Pochettino said. “It is not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket … We are not politicians. We are sport people that only we can talk about our job.”The antediluvian stick-to-sports take rankled, in no small part because Weah wasn’t talking about politics. He was a soccer player commenting on an extremely soccer-related matter. The ability for people from any economic class to be able to come and watch Tim Weah play in a World Cup is inarguably something that relates to his job. Why shouldn’t he have an opinion on it?It also flew against recent precedent. The men’s national team has made it a point to become more outspoken in recent years – not nearly at the level of the Megan Rapinoe-era USWNT, but enough to notice. The players’ recent“Be The Change” campaignwas aided and encouraged by the federation and Pochettino’s predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, who helped players find and sharpen their message.Pochettino then lent full-throated support to Fifa, a divisive governing body that has strayed far from its own statutory political neutrality inopenly backing Donald Trump.“I think if Fifa does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why,” he said. “But it’s not up to us to provide our opinion. … And I think we have the organization that is over us, that is Fifa, that is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people. I think for sure the media need to ask [these questions] directly to Fifa, and for sure you are going to receive a very good answer. But no, it is not up to us to judge this type of thing. We need to be focused on the sports side, and trust in the organization that is in charge of soccer or football around the world, that they are going to do the right things.”On one hand: Pochettino was speaking from Fifa’s World Cup headquarters in Coral Gables, Florida; what else was he supposed to say? On the other hand: Oof.Save forthe odd cranky moment, Pochettino has been affable and savvy since joining US Soccer after short-lived spells as manager of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But here, he sounded credulous and out of touch; ignorant of the many monetary obstacles placed before any non-rich fan wishing to support his team in person this summer. The cost ofparkingat the Los Angeles-area venue where the USMNT will play two of its three World Cup group stage matches will run as high as $300,per Fifa.It also contrasted sharply with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola recentlyspeaking out on the horrors in Gazaand showing support for the Palestinian people and their plight yet again.Rather than being called out for holding an opinion on something squarely within his realm of employment, Weah should be commended for handling the subject deftly; for acknowledging that there is indeed a whole world of people out there with experiences that differ significantly from his own. While not withouthis own awkward utterances, Weah does have a track record of responding thoughtfully when he has been dragged intoactualpolitics – he was a member of the first family of Liberia until fairly recently, after all. Like that time he and several Juventus teammates found themselves in the Oval Office, the backdrop to anunprovoked broadsideby Trump on transgender athletes.“It was weird,” Weah said after that experience last summer. “I was caught by surprise, honestly, when he started talking politics, with Iran and everything. I was kind of like, I just want to play football. … They just told us that we have to go, and I had no choice but to go. So I guess it was a cool experience, obviously being in the White House as a first time, it’s always wonderful. But I’m not one for the politics, so it wasn’t that exciting.”It is no small irony, then, that Weah and Pochettino appear to share the belief that players should remain apolitical. Which is to say that the manager not only misrepresented what Weah said, but also boosted the World Cup organizers whoareblending soccer with politics.In doing so, he completely missed the mood of the moment.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

But Vonn has a solid claim to be the best ever in the speed events (downhill, super-G), and she has been racing exclusively in those disciplines since returning from retirement, surging to the top of the World Cup downhill standings at age 41. She has a score to settle with the sport’s biggest stage – her lifetime total of three Olympic medals (one gold) would probably be higher if not for a horror crash in practice in 2006 and injuries that either limited or outright excluded her from other Games. After someselection dramain the team combined event in last year’s world championships, it seems inconceivable that Vonn and Shiffrin, both of whom have had some misfortune in the Olympics, would not be paired up to form Alpine skiing’s equivalent of the 1992 basketball Dream Team.Vonn was in a nasty crashlast weekend but it seems that she will be fit to take part in Italy.2) Jessie DigginsCross-country skiingNot the global GOAT but certainly the US’s GOAT, Diggins is on pace to move into retirement as the World Cup overall champion, a prize she has already claimed three times. Since bursting into public consciousness with her team sprint gold medal in 2018, a moment made more memorable by commentatorChad Salmela’s frenzied “HERE COMES DIGGINS!” call, she has added two more Olympic medals, a second world championship and five straight top-two finishes in the World Cup overall standings. Diggins is a legitimate threat in most events and could leave Italy with more medals than anyone else in the US delegation.View image in fullscreenJessie Diggins is closing in on a fourth World Cup overall title, cementing herself as the world’s most dominant cross-country skier.Photograph: Grega Valancic/VOIGT/Getty Images3) Aerin FrankelIce hockeyBoston fans are prone to exalting their home town heroes, and Frankel is a prime example. She excelled in college hockey at Northeastern and is the cornerstone of the PWHL’s Boston Fleet, earning the nickname “the Green Monster” after the imposing wall in Fenway Park. Frankel has started in the last three world championships, winning twice and being named the 2025 event’s best goalie thanks to her 94.5 save percentage. She did even better in the Rivalry Series against Canada in November and December, stopping 96.1% of the shots she faced against the only other country to win Olympic or world championship gold.4) Campbell WrightBiathlonOther than the new event of ski mountaineering, the only Winter Olympic sport in which no US athlete has claimed a medal is biathlon. The person with the best chance of changing that is a former New Zealand biathlete who changed his nationality to the US after the 2022-23 season. He had a breakout performance at the 2025 world championships, taking silver in the sprint and pursuit and finishing fourth in the mass start. He has taken another silver in World Cup competition this season. With veteran Deedra Irwin also in good form, the US mixed relay team came tantalizingly close to the podium in a World Cup mixed relay on 24 January, finishing 2.3 seconds behind third-place Czech Republic. The men’s relay team also has a fourth-place finish this season.View image in fullscreenCampbell Wright is a former New Zealand biathlete who changed his nationality to the US after the 2022-23 season.Photograph: Kevin Voigt/Getty Images5) Danny CasperCurlingOne hypothesis that explains the US men’s soccer team’s success at the 2002 World Cup is that several of the players were too young to feel the pressure. The 24-year-old Casper seems similarly impervious to nerves. Facing perennial Olympian and 2018 gold medalist John Shuster in a winner-take-all game at the Olympic trials in November, Casper rattled off clutch shots with the nonchalance of someone playing a Tuesday night social league game. The US had not yet earned its place in the Olympics, but Casper took care of that by scoring four in the ninth end against veteran Chinese skip Xu Xiaoming to wrap up the qualification tournament in style.6) Ilia MalininFigure skatingThe 21-year-old from the DC suburbs has been dominant for so long that it’s easy to forget he’s appearing in the Olympics for the first time. He took bronze in the 2023 world championships and has since rattled off three straight Grand Prix finals and two straight world championships. He has earned the nickname“Quad God”because he lands a dizzying array of quadruple jumps, including the quad axel that eludes mere mortals.

He has posted eight of the 15 top scores since the current scoring system came into place in the 2018-19 season.

At age 21, Stolz has already done it at two world championships. Last year, he merely medaled in all three sprint distances. In the World Cup this year, he has swept all 10 races at 1000m and 1500m. In the nine World Cup races at 500m, he has five wins, two second-place finishes, one third-place result and a lone podium miss, finishing 0.01 seconds out of third. Last year, he only lost once at 1500m, went unbeaten at 1000m, and won seven of 10 races at 500m.8) Ollie MartinSnowboardingThe New Zealand-born teen soared into the snowboarding elite last year at 16, taking a World Cup slopestyle win and following up with bronze medals in slopestyle and big air at the world championships.

But Love, a former collegiate sprinter at UNLV, has quickly climbed into elite status since switching from the back seat – she was Humphries’ brakewoman in 2022 – to the front. She had two runner-up finishes in World Cup two-woman competition this season and had a first and a second in monobob, the event in which she won the 2025 world championship.10) Anna GibsonSki mountaineeringIt’s difficult to imagine a more impressive debut than that Gibson made in the new Olympic sport of ski mountaineering. She only started training in June after a suggestion by Cam Smith, a veteran of the sport. In December, she made her World Cup debut in a relay with Smith – and won. She’s not exactly a newcomer to the demands of the sport, in which athletes power their way up a mountain and ski back down. She has a background in Alpine skiing. And cross-country skiing. And cross-country running. She had landed on trail running before going in a new direction in a new sport, going from neophyte to Olympian in less time than it would take most people to haul themselves up a medium-sized hill.View image in fullscreenKaysha Love, a former collegiate sprinter at UNLV, has quickly climbed into elite status since switching to driver from brakewoman.Photograph: Lars Baron/Getty ImagesBest bets for US medals, in descending orderUS women, ice hockeyJordan Stolz, speed skating (several events)US mixed team, figure skatingMadison Chock and Evan Bates, figure skating (ice dance)Ilia Malinin, figure skating (men)US men, speed skating (team pursuit)Chloe Kim, snowboarding (halfpipe)Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom, team combined)Lindsey Vonn, Alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, team combined)Alysa Liu, figure skating (women)Mac Forehand, freestyle skiing (slopestyle, big air)Troy Podmilsak, freestyle skiing (big air, slopestyle)Jessie Diggins, cross-country skiing (all events)US team, freestyle skiing (team aerials)Kaila Kuhn, freestyle skiing (aerials)US men, ice hockeyKaillie Humphries, bobsleigh (monobob, two-woman)Jaelin Kauf, freestyle skiing (moguls, dual moguls)Tess Johnson, freestyle skiing (moguls, dual moguls)US mixed team, skeletonUS contenders for first medals:Paula Moltzan, Alpine skiing (giant slalom, slalom)Campbell Wright, biathlon (all events)Kaysha Love, bobsleigh (monobob, two-woman)Korey Dropkin/Cory Thiesse, curling (mixed doubles)Quinn Dehlinger, freestyle skiing (aerials)Hunter Hess, freestyle skiing (halfpipe)Chevonne Forgan/Sophia Kirkby, luge (women’s doubles)Ollie Martin, snowboarding (slopestyle, big air)Lily Dhawornvej, snowboarding (slopestyle, big air)Maddie Mastro, snowboarding (halfpipe)Previous US medalists to watchElana Meyers Taylor, bobsleigh (monobob, two-woman)Alex Ferreira, freestyle skiing (halfpipe)Nick Goepper, freestyle skiing (halfpipe)Alex Hall, freestyle skiing (slopestyle, big air)Brittany Bowe, speed skating (1000m, 1500m)Red Gerard, snowboarding (slopestyle, big air)Erin Jackson, speed skating (500m, 1000m)Mia Kilburg, speed skating (mass start)Explore more on these topicsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsLindsey VonnJessie DigginsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But its moral clarity fades when the conversation shifts to catsWed 4 Feb 2026 10.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 11.34 ESTShareEvery February, theWestminster Dog Showarrives in New York City trailing equal parts pageantry, nostalgia and protest. The dogs come to be judged. The owners and handlers come to uphold breed standards. And, almost as reliably asthe movie referencesandthe best-in-show ribbon, Peta arrives ready to dominate the conversation.If there is one certainty about the Super Bowl of canines, it’s that the protest will share the stage with the pageantry. Westminster is an annual collision of tradition, spectacle and dissent, and Peta has become exceptionally good at owning that moment. This year was no different. Two enormous billboardsscreamed down from across the streetof the Javits Center, where breed judging unfolded on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the prime-time sessions at Madison Square Garden. One read:Flat-faced dogs struggle to breathe. NEVER buy them. Another:You can get a nose job. They can’t. DON’T buy breathing-impaired breeds.Doberman named Penny takes Westminster’s best in show as Catherine O’Hara honoredRead moreProvocative billboards, mobile ads, media hooks, message discipline: Peta is very, very good at this. And to be clear:criticism of extreme dog breeding and conformation standardsis legitimate and necessary. But that moral clarity gets murkier, and fast, when the conversation shifts from purebred dogs to cats.Because when it comes to cats, Peta’s messaging increasingly relies on selectively framed science, strategic ambiguity and a reluctance to acknowledge the logical endpoint of its own philosophy. That ambiguity allows the organization to criticize grassroots rescuers while avoiding the political and ethical toxicity of openly endorsing mass euthanasia policies. One of the clearest examples is its continued criticism of trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs, with claims – widely challenged by rescue communities and many veterinarians – that TNR encourages abandonment because people assume outdoor cats will be “taken care of”.The argument collapses under even casual contact with reality. Most people do not casually abandon pets. For most families, pets are family members. When financial hardship forces someone to choose between housing, feeding children, medical bills or veterinary care, those are traumatic decisions, not moral failures. The primary driver of unaltered cat populations isn’t indifference but access. The fact is affordable spay-and-neuter services remain out of reach in many communities.View image in fullscreenA Peta animal rights protester is removed by security during the Westminster Dog Show in 2024.Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesBut close behind affordability is something less visible and almost as consequential: education. It is remarkable how many people living with unneutered cats simply don’t know what spaying and neutering actually do: that they reduce spraying, aggression and roaming. In many cases, people aren’t rejecting responsible care. They simply don’t realize there is a practical, humane intervention that can turn an overwhelming situation into a manageable one.Yet Peta messaging often drifts toward a kind of performative responsibility checklist: cats should be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, licensed, microchipped and kept indoors. Which is, in theory, correct. It is also meaningless without confronting the obvious follow-up questions: who is paying, with what money, and where are those services actually accessible? Discussions of outdoor disease risk also tend to omit key context. Yes, outdoor cats face high disease exposure. But two of the most devastating viruses in outdoor populations – feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) – are strongly tied to mating and reproduction. Sterilization directly reduces those transmission pathways, which is, of course, the core mechanism of TNR. Ignoring that context creates a narrative that feels scientifically grounded while sidestepping the most practical intervention tool available.‘Demand has increased, without a doubt’: the shocking rise of personal protection dogsRead moreThe uncomfortable reality is thatNew YorkCity did not simply develop a stray cat problem so much as it manufactured one. The city’s affordability crisis has wreaked an animal welfare crisis. People are not choosing between being responsible and irresponsible; they are choosing between survival categories: rent, food, healthcare, childcare, transportation – and sometimes, yes, pet care loses out. Estimates place New York City’s outdoor cat population well above 500,000, and the burden of that population is not evenly distributed. It concentrates heavily in lower-income neighborhoods and outer borough communities, where access to veterinary care is already limited and where residents are more likely to be managing multiple layers of economic precarity at once.More than half of US pet owners report struggling to afford basic veterinary visits, and that pressure has been compounded by the rapid corporatization of veterinary medicine. Large corporate entities – including Mars Inc, which owns Banfield, VCA and BluePearl – now control a massive share of the US veterinary market, up dramatically from less than a decade ago. Prices have risen, staffing shortages have worsened and access has become more uneven. When humans face housing and food insecurity, their animals suffer too. This is not moral decay. It is economics, and pretending otherwise only pushes policy conversations further from solutions.Against that backdrop, TNR is not utopian animal activism so much as harm reduction. Outdoor cat reproduction is brutally efficient: females can become pregnant at four months old, gestation lasts roughly 65 days, and queens can become pregnant again while nursing. Kittens compete aggressively for limited nutrition and estimates suggest as many as 90% of kittens born outdoors never survive. Street mating is also a primary disease vector, with FeLV and FIV transmission heavily linked to reproduction and close maternal contact. Sterilization interrupts both population growth and major disease spread. Removal-only strategies have repeatedly failed anywhere they have been tried at scale without sterilization saturation. Killing cats without addressing reproduction simply creates a vacuum that new, unsterilized cats quickly fill.View image in fullscreenAnimal shelters in New York City are struggling to manage the overwhelming number of animals in their care.Photograph: UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesBy contrast, TNR stabilizes populations, reduces nuisance behaviors, lowers shelter intake pressure and improves overall colony health. It does not create perfection but it does mean fewer animals suffering. Talk to people who actually do this work – volunteers with full-time jobs, parents, teenagers, retirees – and you hear the same thing. City blocks change. Territorial fighting drops. Spraying declines. The endless cycle of dead litters slows. Neighborhoods stabilize. And yet these volunteers are frequently mocked or dismissed by organizations with far larger platforms, deeper pockets and greater public influence.If New York wants a serious solution, it is not glamorous, but it is extremely effective: city-subsidized universal spay and neuter access. Frame it any way you want. It works across every policy lens. It is public health policy, reducing disease burden and environmental strain. It is animal welfare policy, reducing the number of animals born into high-suffering conditions. And it is fiscal policy, reducing shelter intake, euthanasia costs and emergency medical spending over time. Pair that with sustained public education – explaining why sterilization matters, where services are available and how communities can participate – and you begin addressing root causes instead of symptoms.There are harder cultural conversations too. Cities that created massive shelter overflow while maintaining a retail pipeline of new animals deserve scrutiny. Working cats, including beloved bodega cats, may be culturally embedded. But without enforceable welfare standards, tradition can easily become neglect. None of this is anti-animal. It is pro-reality.Peta is right about one critical thing: the street is not freedom. Outdoor life for domestic cats is often short, violent and disease-filled. Outdoor cats also devastate bird populations and local ecosystems. But moral clarity requires consistency. If you are going to claim the ethical high ground on animal suffering, you do not get to choose the animals that make better viral billboards. Dogs deserve protection from exploitative breeding.Catsdeserve protection from policy debates built on half-said conclusions. And cities like New York do not need more slogans. They need sterilization access, affordability relief and sustained public education.Bob Barker used to sign off every episode of The Price Is Rightwith the same message: help control the pet population, have your pets spayed or neutered. No billboards. No outrage cycle. Just a simple, evidence-based solution repeated often enough to matter. Animal welfare could use more of that.Lauren Caulk is a co-founder and the president ofOcean Hill Cats, a non-profit cat rescue based in Brooklyn.Explore more on these topicsWestminster Dog ShowPetaAnimal welfareCatsNew YorkPetsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

This forged a friendship, but there may be fireworks between them after Guardiola was incensed by the Spaniard’s claim that he had “all the information” on City after they complained aboutArsenal’s “dark arts” tacticsin the 2–2 draw at the Etihad Stadium last season.Manchester City v Newcastle United: Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg – liveRead moreExpect media inquisitors to return to the spat after City booked a 22nd trip to Wembley under Guardiola in the quest to claim his fifth League Cup. They did so easily, two Omar Marmoush goals and a Tijjani Reijnders strike ending Newcastle’s defence embarrassingly.Anthony Elanga scored for Eddie Howe’s side but a defensive horror show cost them. City’s own rearguard remains leaky so if Newcastle were more ruthless, as the manager pointed out, it might have been his men in the final for a second successive year.Howe urged Newcastle to impose themselves early, then saw City score seven minutes in and by the interval the tie was all but finished.The opener came when Reijnders passed to Marmoush down the left. He veered towards goal and Dan Burn raced across, but when slide tackling the giant defender took the ball it ricocheted against the Egyptian’s leg and looped over the helpless Newcastle goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale, and in.Guardiola skipped in jubilation as City’s control tightened. Yet immediately the home rearguard was bisected as Anthony Gordon curved the ball left to Joe Willock before James Trafford, running out, killed the danger.City’s deputy keeper did the same when this time Gordon had the chance – Trafford narrowed the angle expertly, a corner was conceded and Newcastle failed to profit.Before this Rayan Aït-Nouri had fed Reijnders in on City’s left but the Dutchman blazed wide, and later in a crowded Newcastle penalty area Antoine Semenyo whipped the ball across goal from the right but no teammate could apply a touch.The contest was open – particularly now as Newcastle needed three goals merely to achieve parity.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush doubles Manchester City’s lead on the night from close range.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockGuardiola made four changes from thefirst-leg win on Tynesidethree weeks ago, the star name to miss out being Erling Haaland, though Phil Foden was in the XI for a first time in four games.The manager’s configuration was a 4-2-2-2 that had Semenyo and Marmoush up top while Howe’s side, featuring six different players from the defeat at St James’ Park, played a 3-5-2.Yet how Newcastle set up was cast as all but superfluous just after the half‑hour. By then City were 3-0 up on the night, 5-0 overall, and headed for a Wembley date with the Gunners in mid-March.First the ubiquitous Reijnders passed to Semenyo, who crossed from the left: Kieran Trippier hashed his clearance, the ball popped up and Marmoush headed his second.This was in the 29th minute. Three minutes later Reijnders had registered: the midfielder relayed to Semenyo, this time in Newcastle’s area along the right, he pivoted, the hapless Burn stuck a leg out, inadvertently serving the ball to Reijnders, who stroked home.Howe’s gameplan was in tatters. A wing-back system is supposed to offer a defensive foundation but if those in the back five underperform, as Burn (twice) and Trippier had, the system is immaterial.Manchester City produce little big plan to bamboozle Newcastle | Will UnwinRead moreIn first-half stoppage time Sven Botman forced Trafford into another save but with Gordon having to be replaced by Harvey Barnes moments before – he is an injury concern due to a hamstring problem – this was an anguished period for Newcastle.Yoane Wissa, one of three Newcastle second-half changes, ran through moments after Tony Harrington restarted but the striker scooped wide. The 29‑year‑old, who replaced Nick Woltemade, was joined by Elanga – for Willock – and Jacob Murphy, who took over from Lewis Hall as the left wing-back.Guardiola substituted Nathan Aké for Max Alleyne and when Ramsdale skewered a clearance out for a City throw, this suggested the young defender might not be too busy.But he did have a coming together with Wissa that had Howe furious when no penalty was awarded, and as Newcastle’s manager complained City moved the ball near Ramsdale’s goal where Reijnders missed a gilded chance, steering wide.Soon after Elanga slalomed in from the right, beating him, Aït‑Nouri and Nico O’Reilly before finding the back of the net off the left post. “We’re going to win 6-5” was regaled by the travelling faithful, yet when Barnes scored soon after it seemed more serious until the goal was ruled offside.Haaland, coming on after 71 minutes, hit a post before drawing a latest blank.

Therefore their quiet window was no surprise, but they will be relatively pleased to have brought in a star of the future, Smilla Holmberg, at right-back and to have fulfilled their need for a backup goalkeeper, with Barbora Votíkova’sdeadline-day loan. Much more significant, though, is the positive progress they are understood to have made in theirattempt to sign Georgia Stanwayon a free at the end of the season, and big decisions such asnot seeking to extend Katie McCabe’s stay, as they prepare to refresh the team.Key insSmilla Holmberg (Hammarby), Barbora Votikova (Slavia Prague, loan)Key outsJenna Nighswonger (Aston Villa, loan), Laila Harbert (Everton, loan)Aston VillaThe signing of Oriane Jean-François from Chelsea, for a fee reportedly as high as £450,000, is a major move from Villa, whose results have not gone the way they would have wanted in 2026 but who can be satisfied with their acquisitions. They also brought in Jenna Nighswonger on loan from Arsenal. The USA defender arrived in England with a terrific reputation but things have not worked out for her in north London so, if Villa can help her settle in the WSL and enjoy her football again, that could be a clever move. They also recouped some cash with the sale of the England winger Katie Robinson to the promotion-chasing Bristol City.Key insOriane Jean-François (Chelsea), Jenna Nighswonger (Arsenal, loan)Key outsKatie Robinson (Bristol City), Sarah Mayling (Leicester, loan)BrightonThe main talking point of Brighton’s window centred around a player who did not leave: Fran Kirby. The former England forward was strongly linked with Juventus and sources have said the 32-year-old would have liked the chance to play Champions League football again, but Kirby was not for sale because of her importance to the team. Olaug Tvedten’s acquisition from Vålerenga should add a goalscoring threat to the midfield. But the relative insignificance of transfer news was put into perspective with the death of Brighton’s head of women’s and girls’ coaching Rado Vidošić, father of the head coach, Dario. The news affected everybody around the club.Key insOlaug Tvedten (Vålerenga)Key outsJorelyn Carabali (Boston Legacy FC)View image in fullscreenOlaug Tvedten should add a goalscoring threat to Brighton’s midfield.Photograph: Charlotte Tattersall/WSL/Getty ImagesChelseaThe club have frequently been declared “winners” of transfer windows over the past decade but this one was a rare disappointment for Chelsea. They did not sign a player, despite trying to take Jennifer Echegini from Paris Saint-Germain. The lack of activity is partly down to their focus on summer plans, with significant incomings and outgoings expected, but it will frustrate their fans that they have not strengthened, amid poor form and with Sonia Bompastor taking the risky step ofquestioning their squad depth. PSG’s rejection of Chelsea’s bid for Echegini, coupled with Villa’s signing of Jean-François, meant Chelsea were unwilling to loan the England youth midfielder Lexi Potter to Leicester, who had offered more game time.Key insNoneKey outsOriane Jean-François (Aston Villa),Maika Hamano (Tottenham, loan)EvertonEverton worked late into the night on Tuesday to complete their move for the Slovenia midfielderZara Kramzar from Romaand the supporters will have been glad the deal went through after an otherwise quiet window. Kramzar has arrived on loan with an obligation to buy this summer. The arrivals of Hannah Blundell and Laila Harbert on loan from Manchester United and Arsenal respectively will help to strengthen the squad somewhat. Everton stood firm regarding Kelly Gago, insisting they would sell only if her release clause were met, so the want-away France forward is staying. The head coachBrian Sørensen was sackedon Wednesday.Key insZara Kramzar (Roma, loan), Hannah Blundell (Manchester United, loan), Laila Harbert (Arsenal, loan)Key outsKatie Robinson (loan ended), Hayley Ladd (Crystal Palace)View image in fullscreenZara Kramzar (left) arrives on loan from Roma but Everton have an obligation to buy.Photograph: Just Pictures GmbH/AlamyLeicesterThe club have commonly had the lowest average age for a starting WSL XI this season, so their main aim was understood to be trying to add more experience, and they did that by buying Ashleigh Neville, Rachel Williams, Alisha Lehmann and Emma Jansson, and loaning Sarah Mayling from Aston Villa. Those five players have an average age of 31 and Leicester hope their maturity on and off the pitch can aid their quest to stay clear of the relegation playoff spot. The downside to Leicester’s window was losing their former captain Janice Cayman to PSV, but it is understood the motivation was predominantly to be nearer home and loved ones, and she moved with the club’s blessing and best wishes.Key insAshleigh Neville (Tottenham), Rachel Williams (Manchester United), Alisha Lehmann (Como), Emma Jansson (Rosengård),Sarah Mayling (Aston Villa, loan)Key outsJanice Cayman (PSV)View image in fullscreenAlisha Lehmann made her Leicester debut in a defeat by her former club West Ham.Photograph: Leila Coker/WSL/Getty ImagesLiverpoolThis was Liverpool’s best window in recent memory and went a long way towards making amends for poor business last summer and to mitigate for a lengthy injury list. The WSL’s bottom club, in danger of losing their top-flight status without major improvements, appear to have delivered with several quality additions. The Sweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk, in particular, is a world-class signing. At the other end of the pitch, the arrivals of Martha Thomas and Anna Jøsendal should broaden the goal threat of the league’s second-lowest scorers, and Alice Bergström got off the mark with a goal last Sunday.Key insAlice Bergstrom (Häcken), Aurélie Csillag (Freiburg), Denise O’Sullivan (North Carolina Courage), Anna Jøsendal (Hammarby), Jennifer Falk (Häcken, loan), Martha Thomas (Tottenham, loan)Key outsRafaela Borggräfe (Bayer Leverkusen, loan), Leanne Kiernan(Nottingham Forest, loan),Emilia Szymczak (loan ended)View image in fullscreenAnna Jøsendal should increase the threat posed by Liverpool, the WSL’s second-lowest scorers.Photograph: Nick Taylor/LFC/Getty ImagesLondon City LionessesThe best bargain of this WSL window was surely London City’ssigning of Delphine Cascarinoon a free from San Diego Wave on a three-and-a-half-year deal. The 28-year-old France winger, a star of Euro 2025 and in the prime years of her career, would ordinarily have been expected to sign for a club competing to win the Champions League, so her arrival is a major coup for the WSL newcomers, who went on to complete a deadline-day move for the Danish midfielder Malou Marcetto from Madrid CFF. Several players also left Eder Maestre’s side on loan, including the young striker Lotta Lindström, who scored a hat-trick for Birmingham in WSL2 last weekend.Key insDelphine Cascarino (San Diego Wave), Malou Marcetto (Madrid CFF)Key outsSofia Jakobsson (Toluca),Katie Zelem (West Ham, loan), Lotta Lindström (Birmingham, loan)View image in fullscreenDelphine Cascarino will bring star quality to the WSL.Photograph: Tullio M Puglia/Getty ImagesManchester CityThe leaders completed themarquee signingof this window by bringing the USA midfielder Sam Coffey to England. The women’s game was shocked when it wasrevealed on 8 Januarythat the parties were in advanced talks. It was a flex of City’s muscles, at a time when they are racing away with the league title, and another sign of the rising trend of US players being keen to play in Europe. Very little else happened during this window for Andrée Jeglertz’s side but their fans will most likely think it did not need to, with things going so smoothly. The club know they need to bolster their defensive depth in the summer if they are to challenge for the European title.Key insSam Coffey (Portland Thorns)Key outsNoneManchester UnitedThis was a highly impressive window for United, who not only completed their business early but brought in players of a high calibre in positions where it was clear they needed to strengthen, the squad having looked a little thin, given that they are juggling European and domestic football. The Germany strikerLea Schüllerelevates the forward line and appears to have settled quickly, as has Ellen Wangerheim, a 21-year-old who the club feel will get better and better.Key insEllen Wangerheim (Hammarby), Lea Schüller (Bayern Munich), Hanna Lundkvist (San Diego Wave)Key outsRachel Williams (Leicester), Geyse (Club América), Hannah Blundell (Everton, loan)View image in fullscreenLea Schüller, holding off a challenge from Liverpool’s Jenna Clark, has settled quickly at Manchester United.Photograph: Mike Martin/Focus Images /ShutterstockTottenhamSpurs acted swiftly to complete their business and the rest of the division are really starting to take Martin Ho’s side seriously, after they moved to within two points of second spot and a point of a European place. It is no secret that several Champions League clubs had been keen on Signe Gaupset, so Tottenham were delighted to secure her signature, and their interest in the Scandinavian market was also evident as they signed Hanna Wijk, Matilda Nildén and Julie Blakstad. The addition of Maika Hamano on loan from Chelsea feels like a low-risk but potentially high-reward move. The exit of a long-serving fan favourite, Ashleigh Neville, to Leicester was a tough pill for Tottenham supporters to swallow but the club were keen to evolve the age profile of the team.Key insMatilda Nildén (Häcken), Hanna Wijk (Häcken), Julie Blakstad (Hammarby), Signe Gaupset (Brann), Maika Hamano (Chelsea, loan)Key outsAshleigh Neville (Leicester), Martha Thomas (Liverpool, loan), Kit Graham (Ipswich, loan)West HamThe club had a decent, if unspectacular, window and raised eyebrows with the signing of the Norway defender Tuva Hansen from Bayern Munich.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 4 Feb 2026 10.38 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 14.55 ESTShareMISSION IMPOSSIBLEGiven their near misses in recent seasons, it is entirely understandable that most sentient Arsenal fans are not prepared to publicly entertain the notion that their team will almost certainly win the Premier League this season. While they’re all lying in bed at night secretly fantasising about Martin Ødegaard’s trophy lift, most remain too scarred by ridicule over perceived “bottle jobs” to confidently state that as far as the title is concerned, nothing can possibly go wrong. While they have gladly accepted Mikel Arteta’s invitation tojump on the fun boat, all are wearing life preservers. Quite what these same Arsenal fans make of various pundits blithely weighing up their chances of winning an unprecedented quadruple is anyone’s guess, but since theybooked their place in the Fizzy Cup final, the external chatter has begun. Having won the square root of eff all in over five years, assorted experts are seriously suggesting Arsenal – Arsenal! – could win four shiny pots in the next four months.While achieving such a feat is not out of the question, it is almost certainly out of the question. Yes, Arsenal are clear at the top of the table but they have recent form in the field of Devon Loching that particular marathon with the finish line in sight. And while it’s true Arsenal were imperious in Bigger Cup group stage, so were Liverpool last season and look how unstuck they came at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the Round of 16. Should they overcome Wigan in the fourth round of the FA Cup, Arsenal will still have to win another four matches to lift the famous old trophy, all of them against teams who will be better than the plucky northerners. And yes, they may have booked a Wembley date in March after seeing off a Chelsea side who approached the second leg of their Fizzy Cup semi-final with all the vim and vigour of a sloth on duvet day, but they will still have to overcome one of two tournament specialists if they are to tick off the first and least prestigious leg of a prospective clean sweep.As Arsenal themselves have proved repeatedly in recent years, winning any football tournament is really, really difficult. Winning four in one season has thus far proved impossible for any English team in history, let alone one whose mental fortitude in the face of even the slightest adversity is often questioned. They could do it but historic precedent dictates they almost certainly won’t do it and as long as they don’t come up short in the quest for that first elusive league title in over two decades, few if any of their fans will be particularly bothered. “I think the crowd was brilliant today,” whooped Arteta following last night’s win. “They brought so much energy and belief to the team in different moments. It was very much needed and I think we all deserve to be together in Wembley. They were great and it wasn’t easy today because it was a late kick-off, windy, rainy, cold and they responded. The energy was very good from the beginning. I sensed it was different. They are on board.” The Arsenal fun boat is on course but expect no end of nervous chundering over the port and starboard sides between now and the end of the season.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray for red-hot updates on Manchester City 1-1 Newcastle (3-1 agg) in their Milk Cup semi-final second leg.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Never in the history of humanity have we had the info in front of our eyes more clearly than now.

Carroll, a former striker for Premier League sides Newcastle and Liverpool, indicated a not guilty plea to the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court on Wednesday.Carroll is charged with breaching the order made by the family court at Chelmsford justice centre by allegedly repeatedly calling in March last year Billi Mucklow, who has featured on the reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex.The 37-year-old Carroll, who plays for the National League South club Dagenham & Redbridge, played nine matches for England between 2010 and 2012, scoring twice, including one goal at Euro 2012.Wearing a green coat and using crutches with a foot brace on his left foot, Carroll spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth at the brief hearing. Asked whether he would like to be tried in a magistrates or crown court, Carroll said: “Crown please.”The district judge Roy Brown bailed Carroll and he will next appear at Chelmsford crown court on 4 March. Brown told Carroll: “Your next appearance at court will be at Chelmsford crown court on 4 March for a plea and trial preparation hearing. On that occasion you will be asked to enter a plea, if it remains a not guilty plea then arrangements will be made for a trial.”Carroll, when asked by a court clerk whether he would like to sit rather than stand, said: “I’m OK, I’ll stand.”He began his professional career with Newcastle before transferring to Liverpool for £35m in 2011, later playing for West Ham, Reading and West Brom.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsAndy CarrollnewsShareReuse this content"

Athletic Club give out the One Club Man and One Club Woman awards each year; the list of recipients include Paolo Maldini, Matthew Le Tissier and Malin Moström.There’s no such recognition of Almost One Club Men and Women, unless you count answers in one-newspaper trivia columns. (The Knowledge has no comment to make on reports that we turned down a small-money move to a rival broadsheet in 2005.) We had dozens of answers to this question – thanks to all of you – so let’s count them down in ascending order of One Clubness.First, a couple of bits of housekeeping:We haven’t included non-league teams, which rules out Paul Scholes (three games for Royton) and Le Tissier (Eastleigh) among others. We’ve also excluded Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler, whose one appearance for Cork Celtic was in a sponsored event.Data on appearances for individual players can vary from source to source, particularly for older players. We made a judgment call in each case, so the figures may only be 99.82% correct. But that’s appropriate for this question, right? Right?97.51% Gabby Agbonlahor(401 appearances: 2 Watford, 8 Sheffield Wednesday, 391 Aston Villa)Agbonlahor went on loan to Watford and Sheffield Wednesday at the start of his career97.63% David Narey(886 appearances: 865 Dundee United, 21 Raith Rovers)97.78% Manny Kaltz(754 appearances: 722 Hamburg, 1 Bordeaux, 16 Mulhouse, 15 Hamburg)98.38%* Thomas Müller(804 appearances, 791 Bayern Munich/Bayern Munich II, 13 Vancouver Whitecaps)Müller is still with Vancouver Whitecaps, so this percentage is likely to dropView image in fullscreenThomas Müller greets Vancouver Whitecaps fans in August last year.Photograph: Rich Lam/Getty Images98.63%David O’Leary(732 appearances: 722 Arsenal, 10 Leeds)98.88% Daniele De Rossi(623 appearances: 616 Roma, 7 Boca Juniors)99.01% RogérioCeni(1,209 appearances: 12 Sinop, 1,197 São Paulo)99.41% Lewis Dunk(512 appearances: 3 Bristol City, 509 Brighton)Dunk also played eight games on loan at non-league Bognor Regis99.58% Tom Finney(475 appearances: 473 Preston North End, 1 Toronto City, 1 Distillery)99.62% John Ebbrell(266 appearances: 265 Everton, 1 Sheffield United)99.69% John Atyeo(647 appearances: 2 Portsmouth, 645 Bristol City)Atyeo also played for non-league Westbury United99.81% Steve Death(538 appearances: 1 West Ham, 537 Reading)99.82% Matt Bloomfield(558 appearances: 1 Ipswich, 557 Wycombe Wanderers)“Current Oxford United managerMatt Bloomfieldplayed for Wycombe Wanderers for 19 years, amassing 557 appearances in league and cup,” writes Andy Carswell. “However, despite being known by fans as Mr Wycombe he actually started his career as a trainee at Ipswich Town, the team he supported as a boy. He made one League Cup appearance for them, meaning that 557 out of the 558 matches (or 99.82%) he played as a professional were for Wycombe.”Footballers’ weddings on live television“Your question about footballers’ funerals on TV reminded me that when the Turkey striker Hakan Sukur got married, that this was broadcast on live television. Have any other footballing nuptials been broadcast for any reason?”asks Andrew Miles.Even by the standards of modern life,Hakan Sukur’s story is extraordinary. He haslived in exile in the United States since 2016after being indicted for insulting Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on social media. Twenty-one years earlier, Erdogan – then the mayor of Istanbul – was present at Sukur’s wedding toEsra Elbirlik.Which footballers have had unlikely guests at their weddings? | The KnowledgeRead moreSukur, Turkey’s star player, was in the process of his inspiring his country to qualify for Euro 96 – their first appearance at a European Championship. His wedding was a huge deal . The marriage lasted only a few months; tragically, Elbirlik died in a 1999 earthquake at the age of 24.While Sukur has a case for being Turkey’s greatest ever footballer,Ianis Hagiis unquestionably the son of Romania’s finest, a genius called Gheorghe who lorded over international football between 1983 and 2000 (and also played alongside Sukur at Galatasaray). In the summer of 2024, shortly after Romania’s participation at the European Championship, Hagi was married toElena Tanaseon live TV. It was reported that the rights were sold for over €200,000.In December 1997, Peru and Boca Juniors wingerNolberto Solano– six months away from becoming a Newcastle player – marriedClaudia de la Florin a ceremony that was broadcast live on Channel 4. That’s Channel 4 of the América Televisión network, obviously.And it was Sky Sport Italia who showedFrancesco Totti’s nuptials in 2005. “Totti, the darling son of Rome, marriedIlary Blasi, a TV presenter and model,” writes Lee Wilson. “The whole day was covered live by Sky Sport Italia. Should you be so inclined, you canwatch ‘highlights’ of it here… but I wouldn’t bother.View image in fullscreenPerhaps some of these devoted Roma fans tuned in to watch Francesco Totti get married.Photograph: Federico Proietti/Sync/Agf/Shutterstock“The cameras were inside the church too and not just observing from outside.

Still, for one day at least, they were the perfect couple, and the world got to peek inside Basilica di Santa Maria in Aracoeli to see them radiating happiness and say ‘Io faccio’ live on TV!”Knowledge archive“Wikipedia says Melchester Rovers have won 35 major trophies. Are they the most successful fictional team ever?”tweeted SteadfastTweet in the days when you tweeted.Thanks to Roy Race’s remarkable form for the team in the 1960s and 70s, Melchester’s haul of baubles is even more impressive than that reported by our good friend Wikipedia. It includes 14 league championships, 16 FA Cups, three European Cups, four Cup Winners’ Cups, one Uefa Cup, three League Cups and the 1981-82 Second Division title – 42 trophies in total. And nobody in the world of football fiction can compete with that.In terms of prestigious titles only, Harchester United of Sky One’s drama series Dream Team weigh in with a significant number of trophies with eight (that includes three Second Division titles and, weirdly, the 1926-27 Third Division North title).But success comes in different forms. It is clear, for example, thatRugged Island are always victoriousover Father Ted’s Craggy Island in the All-Priests Five-a-Side Over-75s Indoor Challenge Football Match.

The club claimed their first home victory of the season on Sunday to move four points clear of relegation danger but it has not been enough to keep the 45-year-old Dane, who has been in charge since 2022, in his role.The club’s chief executive, Angus Kinnear, said: “Sunday’s first win of the season at Goodison Park was important, but it has become evident that a change of direction is necessary to ensure the progression on the pitch we are all striving for.”WSL deadline day: Arsenal sign keeper Votikova on loan, Kramzar joins EvertonRead moreThe club said the assistant coaches Stephen Neligan and Ashley Tootle had also left. Sørensen oversaw a sixth-placed finish in 2022-23, then back-to-back eighth-placed finishes.Kinnear said: “We would like to thank Brian, Stephen and Ashley for their hard work and efforts in their time at the club.”Everton’s Under-18s coach Scott Phelan will take interim charge for the remainder of the season, assisted by Jennifer Foster and the goalkeeping coach Ian McCaldon.Phelan, a former England youth international and Everton academy product, has worked as a coach at Everton’s boys academy for more than a decade, including managing the Under-23s. The 37-year-old’s first game in interim charge is at London City Lionesses on Sunday, before the crucial visit of fellow strugglers West Ham to Goodison Park a week later.Sørensen arrived in Englandbefore the 2022-23 campaign after leading Fortuna Hjørring to Women’s Champions League qualification in his homeland. He previously won a Danish Cup with Nordsjælland. Sørensen inherited an Everton who had finished 10th, nine points above relegation, and oversaw a relative period of stability after the short-term tenure of his predecessor, the Frenchman Jean-Luc Vasseur.However, six straight home league defeats this season, after the club made Goodison Park the women’s team’s permanent home, left some fans booing at the end of January’s loss against Brighton.Explore more on these topicsEverton WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The group also accused him of a “total failure” to display solidarity with Manchester’s Jewish community in the wake of theattack on the Heaton Park Synagoguelast October, in which two people were killed.“We have repeatedly asked for prominent individuals to be mindful about the words they use given how Jewish people have had to endure attacks across the globe,” a statement posted on X read. “Pep Guardiola is a football manager. While his humanitarian reflections may be well intentioned, he should focus on football.“Manchester City is being let down by him repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs. This is the second time in a week he has decided to offer his controversial views on the Middle East conflict. It’s especially galling given his total failure to use his significant platform to display any solidarity with the Jewish community subjected to a terrorist attack a few miles from the Etihad Stadium or the Barcelona community reeling from antisemitic violence close to where he once engaged in remarks we believe to be provocative. We implore Mr Guardiola to be more careful in his future language given the significant risk faced by our community.”City have been contacted for comment regarding the JRC statement.Guardiola said on Tuesday: “Never, ever in the history of humanity have we had the info in front of our eyes, watching more clearly than now – genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened in Russia, what happened all around the world, in Sudan, everywhere. What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problems as human beings.“There is somebody who sees the images from all around the world who is not affected? Today we can see it. Before we could not see it. Today we see. It hurts me.“If it was the opposite side, it would hurt me. Wanting harm for another country? It hurts me. [To] completely kill thousands of innocent people, it hurts me. It’s no more complicated than that. No more. When you have an idea and you need to defend [it] and you have to kill thousands, thousands of people – I’m sorry, I will stand up. Always I will be there, always.”Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

The EFL Cup rule 6.4.2 states that a player can represent two clubs in the trophy if he joins the second club before the semi-final first leg. Antoine Semenyo was eligible for the semi‑final as he joined from Bournemouth on 9 January.Guardiola said: “I told the club we must ask – hopefully we can convince theCarabao Cupthat Marc can play the final. I don’t understand why he cannot play the final. Hopefully we make a letter – you buy a player for a lot of money and he is not able to play for a rule I don’t understand. Hopefully they can change it.”Yet asked if he was hopeful, Guardiola said: “No. To change the rule? No way.”Of having the chance to win a fifth League Cup, Guardiola said: “Many of us, including me, we are really happy to come back to the final – and for many players that have never been in the final, the Carabao Cup, or a final with this club, it’s a good thing to experience that.”City’s goals came via two from Omar Marmoush and one from Tijjani Reijnders, all in the first half, Newcastle’s consolation scored by Anthony Elanga after the break.This leftEddie Howedisappointed as his side’s Carabao Cup defence ended. “It is painful, we loved the ride we had last year – it was an incredible experience and we were desperate to have it again,” the Newcastle manager said.Anthony Gordon was forced off before the break. “It looks a hamstring problem – a big worry,” Howe said.Bernardo Silva is a doubt for City’s trip to Liverpool on Sunday due to a muscle injury.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupPep GuardiolaEddie HoweManchester CityNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Friday will host the 6 v 6 and 3 v 3 fixtures, Saturday the 5 v 5 and 2 v 2 matches and Sunday the 4 v 4 and 1 v 1 finals.Spectators will be “buying blind” because it is unlikely the identity of the teams contesting the finals will be known until the weekend before, with results from three July Tests and three regular fixtures in November determining the standings.Still, the most expensive tickets to watch the 4 v 4 and 1 v 1 finals will stretch to £279.90. That allows supporters to watch two matches but it is in effect the top price for the final because tickets cannot be bought for a single match.Those buying tickets for multiple days will receive a discount, however, and it is understood that there will be a resale market for spectators to effectively “swap” tickets if their teams are playing on different days.While the matches take place at Twickenham, prices are set by the Six Nations organisers and Sanzaar who run theNations Championshipas a joint venture. The cheapest standard tickets for the day of the final are £125, £100 for the Saturday and £60 for the Friday. All junior tickets for finals day cost £50 and £20 for the Friday.Well-placed sources believe their pricing strategy caters for all types of spectators, compares well with other major sporting and music events and that the Nations Championship showcases elite teams at cheaper prices than the 2027 World Cup.England’s three home Nations Championship matches in the autumn in the weeks before finals day are against New Zealand, Australia and Japan, and prices for those are set by the RFU. Premium tickets for the match against the All Blacks will cost £238.Interest in tickets for the finals weekend is said to be tracking at a similar rate to that of England versus New Zealand, with a significant share coming from the United States. Organisers can also expect a late surge in interest for the most expensive tickets on the Sunday should England reach the final.Steve Borthwick’s side begin their campaign in July with a mouthwateringfixture againstSouth Africa in Johannesburg before locking horns with Fiji. As the Guardian exclusively revealed last week, that fixture could take place atEverton’s new Hill Dickinson Stadiumbefore England head to Argentina.Borthwick is weighing up fielding a second-string side against Fiji for logistical reasons but he may wish to reconsider if England pull off a Six Nations grand slam and defeat the Springboks, because the match against the Pacific Islanders would offer the chance of a world record-equalling 18th consecutive victory. The appeal of taking the Fiji fixture away from Twickenham is to steer clear of the “neutral” venue for finals day.Explore more on these topicsNations ChampionshipRugby unionEngland rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet having trialled it in San Moritz last week, it has now emerged that the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation quickly banned the helmets on 29 January, saying they “did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape”.Team GB have now appealed the decision to the court of arbitration for sport, arguing the design and manufacture of the helmet meets rigorous safety standards. The appeal will be heard on Thursday, with the verdict expected on Friday. Weston and Wyatt will compete next Thursday and Friday (12 and 13 February).UK Sport has spent £5,765,123 of National Lottery funding on skeleton sliders over the past four years, and has been rewarded with Weston in particular dominating the sport. Last year the 28-year-old became world champion for a second time, beating his closest rival Wyatt by 1.9secs. This season, Weston has won five races and Wyatt two.Speaking just before the Games, UK Sport’s performance director Kate Baker had admitted Team GB had been using new tech in the buildup, especially in skeleton and bobsleigh, and had been using their own wind tunnel to improve performance. “Critically, what’s exciting about the way that the skeleton and bobsleigh programme are now working is that they are fully integrated together,” she said.“They used to be separate programmes. They’re now overseen by the same performance director, Nat Dunman. She has overseen an integrated research and investment programme which has brought some real fruit, as you will see from the performances that we’re already producing,”Asked whether technical upgrades are deliberately held back for the Olympics, Baker added: “Historically, you could turn up at the Games and you could just pull out a totally brand new kit set-up, send the athletes out on it, and they’d suddenly find seconds. You just can’t do that any more.”She added: “Our innovation team at the UK Sports Institute works with a number of critical partners. Whether those are related to Formula One or related to cycling, we now have, which is a unique position for us, our own wind tunnel which we can get into and test consistently, which we are doing with our skeleton athletes.”This is not the first time that the Great Britain’s skeleton team has been the subject of controversy on the eve of a Winter Olympics. In 2018, the Guardian reported that other teams had raised eyebrows that they were usingcustom-made aerodynamic suitsthat provided a “massive” improvement on the conventional equivalents. However, the suits were declared legal by the IBSF.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

Her measured yet dogged pursuit of perfection has set her apart from her competitors for an entire Olympiad.View image in fullscreenJakara Anthony and Matt Graham pose with Australian team chef de mission Alisa Camplin and fellow athletes at Casa Italia.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images“There are athletes in our team who saw Jakara win gold in Beijing, and it sparked their Olympic dreams. Jakara is in a league of her own – role model, Olympic champion and a young Australian who sets her sights on something and doesn’t give up. I am so proud to name her flag bearer.”Camplin also praised the leadership and resilience of Graham, who competed in Beijing four years ago with a fractured collarbone. “Matt is a long-term leader in this team and competes with sheer grit and sportsmanly grace,” said Camplin, who won gold in the aerials in 2002 and bronze four years later.“He has done it all – the hungry debutant in Sochi, the silver medallist in Pyeongchang and an injury comeback for Beijing – on paper that’s more than enough to become flag bearer.“But what I love about Matt, is how he always lifts the team and carries the Aussie spirit when he competes.

From the fashion capital of Milan to the dramatic peaks of Cortina d’Ampezzo, the Milano Cortina Games – the first to be co-hosted by two cities – will stretch across northern Italy blending world-class winter sport with a strong sense of history and ambition.The medal table prioritises the number of gold medals won. If countries have the same number of gold medals, the order is then dictated by which has the most silvers, and finally bronze if the numbers are still identical. Sixteen sports and more than 110 gold medals await, from the raw speed of alpine skiing and bobsleigh to the tactical endurance of biathlon and cross-country. Alpine fans will once again be drawn to Mikaela Shiffrin, still redefining excellence across the technical disciplines.Figure skating returns with its familiar blend of artistry and pressure, led by the American phenomenon Ilia Malinin, whose boundary-pushing jumps continue to reshape the sport, while Team GB hope that Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson grasp their opportunity to win Britain’s first figure skating medal since Jayyne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994.Speed skating and its short-track form, where Italy’s home hope Arianna Fontana remains a dominant force, offer drama measured in hundredths of a second. Ice hockey brings physicality and heated rivalries (if you know, you know), with Canada the perennial favourites, and curling – yes, still with the brooms – will remind casual viewers, under the guidance of Team GB’s Bruce Mouat, that precision can be just as gripping as power."

They even succeeded once, sending him on loan to Leeds United only for the American to return six months later. When he got back to Turin, as US coach Gregg Berhalter told the story at the time, Juve had emptied his locker and given away his parking spot. Despite this, McKennie stuck around.Mauricio Pochettino’s odd jab at Tim Weah misread the player and the moment | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreIt’s just as well for the Old Lady that he did – McKennie is now in the form of his life. The 27-year-old has scored four times in just eight games since the start of 2026. He has become one of Juve’s most important players and arguably the biggest driving force behind their recent upturn in form. Luciano Spalletti – among the most big-name coaches currently working in Italian football – has used McKennie to mould the team in his own image.Spalletti is a tactical radical. In this era of positional play, he argued “systems no longer exist in football” during his Scudetto-winning time at Napoli. “It’s all about the spaces left by the opposition,”he told Sky Sports Italiarecently. “You must be quick to spot them and know the right moment to strike.”This is surely why he likes McKennie – a position-less player, or rather, aneveryposition player. He’s been Juve’s utility man for years, filling in all over the field whenever required. According to WhoScored, McKennie has played as a left back, right back, left wing back, right wing back, defensive midfielder, central midfielder, right winger, No 10 and centre forward. The only surprise is that he hasn’t played in goal (yet!).Since Spalletti’s arrival in October, McKennie has been most commonly used on the right side. From there the American has the license to drift inside, get in between the lines and push up as a secondary striker. As Spalletti says, systems no longer exist and McKennie is the Juventus player who best embodies the philosophy of the club’s new manager.One wonders what Mauricio Pochettino makes of McKennie’s current form. The US head coach omitted McKennie from his roster for the September and November friendlies, arguing “we already know what he can provide the team.” This was confusing reasoning considering how little time Pochettino had to work with his best players in 2025.McKennie is certainly one of the United States’ best players, but it’s not clear how he will fit into the lineup at the World Cup. Pochettino seems unsure of McKennie’s’s suitability for one of the deep-lying midfield roles, meaning he could be pushed further forward into one of the dual-No 10 positions. This part of the pool, however, also includes Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman, Gio Reyna and Diego Luna. Competition is stiff.It’s possible McKennie could line up for the USMNT on the right side, as he frequently does for Juventus. There, he could play in a 4-4-2 out of possession as part of the midfield four and tuck inside off the wing in attacking phases. So far, though, Pochettino has favoured Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah and even Alex Freeman in this role.If Pochettino is, as some suspect, a doubter of McKennie, he can expect to be proved wrong by the midfielder before too long. This is McKennie’s thing. He has been written off several times in his career. Almost every season McKennie has spent at Juventus has started with speculation about his future there. He’s been told multiple times to expect limited game time and every time he has worked his way back into the team.Men’s transfer window January 2026: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreSpalletti clearly gets McKennie. He has a firm grasp of his strengths and his weaknesses and has built his Juventus team around the American to accentuate the former. Against Parma on Sunday, when Juve produced arguably their best performance of the season so far, McKennie was at the heart of everything, scoring in the 37th minute of a 4-1 win.“I have never in my career worked with a coach like this,” McKennie said of Spalletti after his man-of-the-match performance. Spalletti has also taken the opportunity to talk up the Juve player who has embraced his ideas more fully than anyone else. “He fights, he’s strong in the air and he can jump high,” said the Old Lady boss. “He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.”Talks over a new contract to keep McKennie at Juventus beyond the end of the season have reportedly started. Conflicting claims have linked the midfielder withSerie Arivals Milan and Napoli while a move to FC Cincinnati in Major League Soccer appeared to be on the cards not so long ago. McKennie’s agent recently took to social media to dispel what he called “lies and propaganda.”What isn’t a lie is McKennie’s value to Juventus on the pitch. At a time when the Turin club is rebuilding for the future, the American is showing he deserves to be a central pillar of Spalletti’s new-look team. If and when McKennie puts pen to paper on a new contract, maybe he can ask for his parking spot back.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsSerie AJuventusEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Also making the final lineup were an Afghan hound named Zaida, a Lhasa Apso named JJ, a Maltese named Cookie, a smooth fox terrier named Wager and a popular old English sheepdog named Graham.New York City’s real animal welfare crisis isn’t the Westminster Dog Show | Lauren CaulkRead moreThe victory gave veteran handler Andy Linton another Westminster crown nearly four decades afterhe last won best in show in 1989with Indy, also a Doberman. For Linton, who has spoken publicly about living with Parkinson’s disease and has indicated he is nearing the end of his career, the moment carried additional weight.“I had some goals, and this was one of them,” Linton said. He later told reporters that winning at the milestone 150th edition of America’s most prestigious dog show made the triumph “extra-special”.Best in Show at the 150th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show goes to \"Penny\" the Doberman Pinscher! 🐶🏆pic.twitter.com/Ui66SyvL8B— FOX Sports (@FOXSports)February 4, 2026Penny, bred by Theresa Connors-Chan and Gregory Chan and co-owned with Francis and Diana Sparagna, emerged as the last dog standing after a winnowing-down process that began with roughly 2,500 dogs spanning more than 200 breeds and varieties from all 50 states and 17 additional countries including Peru, Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines. Breed judging took place during day sessions on Monday and Tuesday at the nearby Javits Convention Center before group winners advanced each night to the prime-time finals under the Garden lights.Each dog is assessed according to how closely it matches the ideal standard for its breed, with judges examining structure, movement, muscle tone and overall presentation. There is no prize money attached to the victory, but the best in show ribbon remains the most coveted honor in American dog shows and can dramatically increase breeding value.Dobermans, long associated with police and military service, have now won Westminster’s top prize five times: in 1939, in consecutive years in 1952 and 1953, in 1989 with Linton, and again in 2026 with Linton. The breed was developed in late-19th century Germany by tax collector Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann and later gained prominence in working roles, including service with the US Marine Corps in the Pacific theater during the second world war.Linton described Penny, whose official champion’s name is GCHP CH Connquest Best Of Both Worlds, as an exceptional example of the breed and said her temperament reflects the traditional Doberman balance of approachability and protectiveness. It marked the second straight year a dog from the working group won the top prize after a giant schnauzer called Montybroke a 95-year hoodoo for his breedlast year.“She’s a wonderful dog, she’s friendly,” Linton said at the news conference after Penny’s win. “Any one of you could come up here and she’d try to get you to pet her, but if you were a burglar, you wouldn’t come in our house. So she’s got that character that a Doberman’s supposed to have.”Away from the ring, Penny’s personality is relaxed and affectionate. Co-owner Greg Chan described her as “very demanding and very smart”, but also eager to please, particularly when food is involved. Her favorite snack, he added, is simply: “Everything.”View image in fullscreenPenny the Doberman Pinscher and trainer Andy Linton pose for photos after winning best in show at the 150th Westminster Kennel Club dog show.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesReserve best in show finisher Cota, a five-year-old Chesapeake Bay retriever handled by Devon Kipp Levy, drew sustained cheers throughout the final round. While retrievers remain among the most popular dogs in the United States, none has ever captured Westminster’s top prize. Supporters greeted Cota’s runner-up finish as another encouraging sign for the group.Fitzpatrick, himself a two-time Westminster best in show winner as a handler, praised the strength of the final field before announcing the result, calling it a lineup “that will go down in history”.The sesquicentennial edition of Westminster, the oldest continuously held sporting event in the United States after the Kentucky Derby, also leaned into its place in American pop culture. Organizers paid tribute to the actorCatherine O’Hara, whodied last week at 71, with a video montage that played on the Madison Square Garden jumbotron before the judging of the terrier group. O’Hara was especially beloved in dog-show circles for playing Norwich terrier owner Cookie Fleck in Christopher Guest’s 2000 mockumentary Best in Show, which gently lampooned the eccentricities and intensity of competitive dog showing while cementing the event’s place in the broader cultural imagination.The milestone show produced plenty of crowd-pleasing moments outside the final ring. A total of 202 breeds and varieties were represented at this year’s contest, from affenpinschers to Xoloitzcuintlis. A Danish-Swedish farmdog named Millie made history simply by advancing deep into competition after the breed became newly eligible for Westminster this year.For Penny, the immediate future will include the traditional Westminster media blitz, typically featuring national television appearances and ceremonial photo opportunities around New York before returning to life outside the spotlight – where, if her owners are to be believed, she will remain a driven performer when asked, and a food-motivated companion the rest of the time.“You can’t attribute it to one thing, but she is as great a Doberman as I’ve seen,” Linton said. “As the judge said, this is maybe the best lineup I could ever imagine, so it’s truly a great honor to win under that judge, who is so renowned and well-thought-of.”Explore more on these topicsWestminster Dog ShowUS sportsDogsCatherine O'HaraPetsAnimalsShareReuse this content"

His office did not respond to a request for clarification.Legislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.Spain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.The recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.But there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.Sanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.The proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.About 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year.

This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”View image in fullscreenIllustration shows the Pinterest app.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.The script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.The source, who the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.Ready said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.The chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.It comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, asbusinesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week,Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 rolesworldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.Explore more on these topicsPinterestSocial mediaSoftwareInternetJob lossesTechnology sectorDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Reskilling those affected by these job losses could save companies from making redundancy payments totalling as much as £757m, the report found.Upskilling staff would allow employers to focus on candidates’ potential rather than their past technical experience, the report found. It is estimated that up to 60,000 women in tech leave their roles each year for reasons including lack of advancement, lack of recognition and inadequate pay.Dame Susan Langley, the mayor of City of London, said: “By investing in people and supporting the development of digital skills within the workforce, employers can unlock enormous potential and build stronger, more resilient teams. Focusing on talent, adaptability and opportunity will ensure the UK continues to lead on innovation and remains a global hub for digital excellence.”Recent surveys have shown that as many as a quarter of UK workers areworried that their jobs could disappearin the next five years because of AI, according to a poll by the international recruitment company Randstad. Union leaders have called on companies to commit toinvesting in workforce skills and training.The City of London Corporation found that women were being overlooked for roles even as difficulties in hiring talent meant more than 12,000 digital vacancies in these sectors went unfilled in 2024.Companies have tried to deal with worker shortages by increasing wages above the national average, but the report found that higher pay rates would not solve the problem. It warned that the widening digital talent gap was forecast to last until at least 2035 and that under this scenario the UK could miss out on more than £10bn of economic growth.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorFinancial sectorAI (artificial intelligence)WomenGenderWomen in the boardroomnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Dutch ethical smartphone brand Fairphone is back with its six-generationAndroid, aiming to make its repairable phone more modern, modular, affordable and desirable, with screw-in accessories and a user-replaceable battery.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Fairphone 6 costs £499 (€599), making it cheaperthan previous modelsand pitting it squarely against budget champs such as theGoogle Pixel 9aand theNothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade.The new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don’t drop it in a bath or swimming pool.The back plate is held in place by two exposedTorx screwsand hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed.View image in fullscreenThe back plate can be swapped for various accessories, eachcosting about £25, including a finger loop, a credit card holder or a lanyard.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots or the power-off and restart menu. They are also very easy to hit accidentally when pulling the phone out of a pocket, ramping up the volume unnecessarily.Above the power button on the right side is a big, colourful switch that turns onFairphone’s “Moments” minimalist interface, which blocks notifications and swaps the standard Android home screen for a simple list of essential apps. It’s a smart idea for those hoping to reduce distractions. But swiping up to exit an app shows the regular home screen for a split second, making it feel like a hack. The switch can be repurposed for other features, including activating “do not disturb” or the torch.View image in fullscreenThe Moments switch turns on a distraction-free interface and sits above the flush power button with integrated fingerprint scanner.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.31in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (431ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3RAM:8GBStorage:256GB + microSDOperating system:Android 15Camera:50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfieConnectivity:5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP55 (splash/rain)Dimensions:156.5 x 73.3 x 9.6mmWeight:191.4gMid-range power with expandable storageView image in fullscreenThe phone lacks wireless charging support but fully powers up via USB-C in just over an hour, hitting 50% in 22 minutes using a 30W power adapter (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fairphone 6 has the same mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip as theNothing Phone 3a Pro, which can’t rival the best phones for raw power but generally feels fast enough in use. It will handle light gaming and most tasks but will struggle with more advanced titles. The phone has 256GB of storage and a rare microSD card slot for adding more.The battery life is reasonable if not remarkable, lasting about 35 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about four to five hours across 5G and wifi. The Fairphone should see out most heavy-use days, but will need charging nightly.SustainabilityThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles and it can be replaced at home using a single screwdriver, along withthe rest of the 12 modular components. Batteries cost£35, screens£78and the main camera£61. The phone wasawarded 10 out of 10 for repairabilityby the specialists iFixit.The handset is made with50% recycled or fair materials, and Fairphone publishes itslifecycle report.Barebones Android 15View image in fullscreenThe Moments distraction-free interface blocks notifications and gives you a small list of apps to use, which can be customised.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe phone either runs regular Android 15 with Google services, as reviewed, or a privacy-focused, open-source version of Android, without Google services,called /e/OS. Unfortunately, that means the Fairphone 6 isn’t running the latest version of Android 16, but it will besupported with updates until 2033, which is about a year longer than the best mainstream phones.The software is generally uncluttered with little in the way of customisation, which for the most part is a good thing. But it is a little rough around the edges and lacks a few of the bells and whistles that Samsung, Google and others add to their software.It is notably devoid of the artificial intelligence that has been shoved in every crevice by other phone manufacturers. It has Google’s Gemini chatbot assistant, but without the ability to activate it via voice while the phone is locked. The Fairphone also misses out on Google’s excellentCircle to Searchfeature common to most other phones, which is a bit of a shame.Recent updates have fixed some of the bugs, including one in which the screen stuttered and stalled after being turned on from standby. But the software still lacks the level of polish you should expect.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app will be familiar to most, with plenty of features to play with.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fairphone has two cameras on the back and one selfie camera in the screen. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good photos in bright light, but it struggles with high contrast scenes, often misjudging the white balance or looking washed out. The night mode is usable but not as good as you’d expect from a modern smartphone.The 2x digital zoom is reasonable but stretching to 10x causes the photos to become full of artefacts. The 13MP ultrawide camera produces pretty good photos in decent light, with solid detail in the middle of the frame even if they are a little soft at the edges. The macrophotography mode can produce great closeup images with a bit of practice, and the 32MP selfie camera takes good photos for the money.The Fairphone 6 easily has the best camera the company has made and gets the job done, but it can’t hold a candle to similarly priced rivals.PriceThe Fairphone Gen 6 costs£499(€599).For comparison,Google’s Pixel 9acosts£499, theNothing Phone 3a Procosts£449and theApple iPhone 16ecosts£599.VerdictThe sixth-generation Fairphone takes the company further into the mainstream with a solid, mid-range Android with all the perks of a modular, repairable and more ethical design.It trades a few premium features for a lower price than its predecessors, but still has a good screen, great looks and reasonable battery life. It even has a microSD card slot for adding more storage, which is incredibly rare in 2026.The camera is serviceable, though far from the best you can get for the money. The software is basic Android 15, which is unfortunately not the latest version, a little rough around the edges and devoid of AI tricks other than Google’s Gemini chatbot. But Fairphone is slowly fixing bugs and will provide support until 2033. The distraction-free Moments mode switch is a good idea, too. The chip is fast enough now, but it isn’t the most powerful and may become pretty tired after eight years of use.The fingerprint scanner is not the best and the power and volume button placement is an irritating design flaw. While few phones offer as repair-friendly a design, more mainstream devices offer almost as long software support as the Fairphone.The Fairphone 6 is the best, least-compromised phone the company has made. But things have improved in the rest of the industry, with better access to repair and longer software support, making the Fairphone tough to recommend for everyone over mainstream devices.Pros:modular accessory support, repairable-at-home design, software support to 2033, recycled and fair materials, microSD card slot, good screen, five-year warranty,Cons:mid-range performance, fingerprint scanner and volume button placement annoying, average camera, cannot be submerged in water, no Android 16 yet and software is a little rough around the edges.View image in fullscreenThe simple back design hides the modular components and can be swapped out for various accessories.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesEthical and green livingEthical businessreviewsShareReuse this content"

For Jason Berke, a consultant, the best Valentine’s gift he ever got was this “to-go coffee mug that I desperately needed”.

That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers and the like. Inkitchen “closing shift”videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through theirmorning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.For better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as aTikTokmom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.Rise of the Maha moms: the momfluencers embracing RFK’s push for a ‘healthier’ AmericaRead moreBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!In my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t seethatmuch of it in my online spheres.Instead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum betweenconservative tradwife propagandaand extraordinarily apolitical, considering theparalyzing polycrisiswe find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actuallyfundedby the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKABallerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine,describedby one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politicsKate Glavan“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavanposted a TikToksaying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.View image in fullscreenKatie Glavan.Photograph: Courtesy of Katie GlavanI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with therealities of motherhood in the USoverwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.Glavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has aworryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024prioritized“having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.The left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, 2.5 kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy andexploits wives as“instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages for Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.No need to dive into complex social theory, though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)Parenting is not just for pronatalists: the progressive case for raising kidsRead moreMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?If you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup –queer moms,solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, likeShe Is a Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is affected by politics, likeEres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time whenICE is separating childrenfrom their families and communities, likeBri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has avlogtitled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.Early attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, andmom influencers are all in.Around the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need toclarify to her followersthat her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.Her disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric andTerfiness.View image in fullscreenLisa Miller.Photograph: Courtesy of Lisa MillerLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”But the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dadJose Rolon(whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videosendorsingZohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creatorsto speak upabout ICE raids.Now Millerposts videosthat begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts ongun violence,ICE raidsandraising a child on the autism spectrumin RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equalityLisa MillerMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines ofthis one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed the VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.It’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.I know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.To loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)US politicsTikTokDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 4 Feb 2026 07.35 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 07.37 ESTShareI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – thinkCrow CountryorFear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specificallyaboutthe millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year.Despeloteis set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. Theaward-winning Consume Meis about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.Perfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.The earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of beingperceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.View image in fullscreenComedic and satirical … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoymaking fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.Perfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.For a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.It is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone elseexperienced those same formative years.What to playView image in fullscreenAm I the baddie? … Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator.Illustration: SteamLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment.

And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’sitems in10 years’ time ...”Once upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.Digital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.Digital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. Andeverybodyhates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It fits a broader playbook, with troubling historic precedentsWed 4 Feb 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 15.16 ESTShareWhat in the hell were FBI agents doing inan election facility in Fulton county, Georgia, last week? They surely weren’t investigating a crime. Nor were they serving the public.Justifying Donald Trump’s “big lie” about winning the 2020 election may seem like his ownlost cause– but like hisConfederate forebears, he is weaponizing it, damage be damned. Not even his subsequent election victory has quieted Trump’s appetite for more power, earned or otherwise.As their ICE compatriots in Minnesotawere laying siege to the Twin Cities, the FBI removed ballots and election records from a majority-Black jurisdiction that helped deliver Trump’s defeat in Georgia more than five years ago. He lost – and has admitted as much. Nevertheless, he persists.Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence,was present in Fulton county at Trump’s request. Upon that revelation, what could have been explained as routine oversight became a piece of suspicious political theater. Lacking any evidence of fraud, the objective could not have been law enforcement. It was power – and a reminder of who is presumed suspect when elections produce the “wrong” result.A movement that still believed in persuasion would be making an argument to voters; this one is preparing to manage them. Days after the Fulton county raid, Trump openly called for Republicans to “nationalize” elections in multiple states, recyclingthe false and long-debunked claimthat undocumented immigrants – including Somalis in Minnesota – had helped Democrats steal past contests. Republican leaders largely responded with careful hedges, if at all,gesturing toward states’ authoritywhile sidestepping the real issue: elections are being questioned not because of evidence, but because of outcomes.The pattern is familiar because history insists on rhyming. What connects the Fulton county raid, the administration’s immigration enforcement abuses and the systematic removal of Black history from public institutions is erasure. Depressing the vote is perhaps his most potent tactic. Power is the point. Operationalizing bigotry to erase people, their rights and their histories is simply the cost of doing business.That logic sharpened last week, when Trump allies and a faction of Senate Republicansopenly floated ending the legislative filibusterto force througha new, Orwellian voter-suppression bill– the Make Elections Great Again Act – that appears far more extreme than last year’sSave Act: tightening proof-of-citizenship requirements, restricting mail voting and badly undermining third-party registration drives.Supporters insist such measures are necessary to “protect” elections, despite the fact that noncitizen voting is already illegal and vanishingly rare. Opponents warn that scrapping the filibuster to pass them would dismantle yet another democratic safeguard while accelerating the most significant rollback of voting rights in generations.For too many who find themselves at the margins of Trump’s America, visibility in law, history and politics is inseparable from power and belongingTrump’s demands are not meant to withstand scrutiny, much less survive a court challenge. They are meant to justify intervention – to render ballots provisional, to discard some outright and to condition Americans to view their neighbors as intruders in a democracy that belongs to them, too. Considering the administration’s directive to strip allusions toBlack history,trans peopleand anyone else they considerpolitically inconvenient, suppressing the vote is merely part ofa larger project.Elders have often told children what the civil rights advocate Marian Wright Edelmanonce said: “You can’t be what you can’t see.” I always preferred “if you can’t see it, be it” – but for too many who find themselves at the margins of Trump’s America, visibility in law, history and politics is inseparable from power and belonging.When leaders and institutions work to erase your presence or your story from the American narrative, they are not merely stripping legal protections. They are teaching you to see your place in this nation’s past, present and future as conditional. Fulton county is but the most recent reminder.In the Jim Crow south, officials relied onostensibly legal mechanisms– poll taxes, literacy tests and arbitrary purges of voter rolls – to nullify Black political power. Fulton county echoes that logic. The county was repeatedly audited and found clean, yet federal agents descended under the banner of national security, signaling that a Black-majority electorate is inherently suspect. Black voters were legally present, but treated as adversaries. Today, they are scrutinized for the same offense: participating fully in their own democracy.The consequences are manifesting. On former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino’s Monday program, Trump said that “Republicans ought to nationalize the voting” in at least 15 states. Even by his standards, the remark signaled an escalation asthe specter of federal election interference grows.Once again, Trump justified the proposal with the racist fiction of widespread undocumented voting – a claim debunked beyond exhaustion, and deployed not to safeguard democracy, but to constrict it.If Republican leaders ever had an opportunity to confront this authoritarian turn, this was it. Instead, they offered equivocation or silence. Few if any Republicans were as forthright in their opposition as Don Bacon, the Nebraska congressman who plans to retire at the end of this term –writingthat his consistent opposition to federalizing elections won’t change. Thelack of concernof the House speaker, Mike Johnson, over Trump’s remark, on the other hand, functioned less as caution than as permission.Thehistorical echoesare unmistakable. During Reconstruction and its collapse, federal power was alternately used to protect Black voters and to enforce outcomes favored by white supremacist elites. Later, vague claims of fraud greenlit “oversight”. Trump’s desire for Republicans to control state elections belongs in that lineage: federal force framed as a remedy for allegedly illegitimate outcomes rather than demonstrable harm.Fulton county is not an aberration. It fits a broader playbook – immigration raids, the erasure of Black history from public spaces and attempts to revoke temporary protected status from Haitian immigrants.On Monday, Judge Ana C Reyeshalted that effort, writing that the administration’s actions were “substantially likely” motivated by “hostility to nonwhite immigrants”, and that constitutional obligations had been disregarded.Voter suppression limits access. Voter depression discourages participation. Dehumanization makes exclusion feel justified. Together, they do more than tilt outcomes – they hollow democracy out from within.Fulton county is a warning. The machinery long used to suppress Black and immigrant political power is being recalibrated for national use. The method is relentless. The stakes are immediate.To strip people of their voice in democracy is to attempt their disappearance. If, as Edelman warned, “you can’t be what you can’t see,” then the American project will not survive if it silences its own people and attempts to render them invisible.Jamil Smith is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But its moral clarity fades when the conversation shifts to catsWed 4 Feb 2026 10.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 11.34 ESTShareEvery February, theWestminster Dog Showarrives in New York City trailing equal parts pageantry, nostalgia and protest. The dogs come to be judged. The owners and handlers come to uphold breed standards. And, almost as reliably asthe movie referencesandthe best-in-show ribbon, Peta arrives ready to dominate the conversation.If there is one certainty about the Super Bowl of canines, it’s that the protest will share the stage with the pageantry. Westminster is an annual collision of tradition, spectacle and dissent, and Peta has become exceptionally good at owning that moment. This year was no different. Two enormous billboardsscreamed down from across the streetof the Javits Center, where breed judging unfolded on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the prime-time sessions at Madison Square Garden. One read:Flat-faced dogs struggle to breathe. NEVER buy them. Another:You can get a nose job. They can’t. DON’T buy breathing-impaired breeds.Doberman named Penny takes Westminster’s best in show as Catherine O’Hara honoredRead moreProvocative billboards, mobile ads, media hooks, message discipline: Peta is very, very good at this. And to be clear:criticism of extreme dog breeding and conformation standardsis legitimate and necessary. But that moral clarity gets murkier, and fast, when the conversation shifts from purebred dogs to cats.Because when it comes to cats, Peta’s messaging increasingly relies on selectively framed science, strategic ambiguity and a reluctance to acknowledge the logical endpoint of its own philosophy. That ambiguity allows the organization to criticize grassroots rescuers while avoiding the political and ethical toxicity of openly endorsing mass euthanasia policies. One of the clearest examples is its continued criticism of trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs, with claims – widely challenged by rescue communities and many veterinarians – that TNR encourages abandonment because people assume outdoor cats will be “taken care of”.The argument collapses under even casual contact with reality. Most people do not casually abandon pets. For most families, pets are family members. When financial hardship forces someone to choose between housing, feeding children, medical bills or veterinary care, those are traumatic decisions, not moral failures. The primary driver of unaltered cat populations isn’t indifference but access. The fact is affordable spay-and-neuter services remain out of reach in many communities.View image in fullscreenA Peta animal rights protester is removed by security during the Westminster Dog Show in 2024.Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesBut close behind affordability is something less visible and almost as consequential: education. It is remarkable how many people living with unneutered cats simply don’t know what spaying and neutering actually do: that they reduce spraying, aggression and roaming. In many cases, people aren’t rejecting responsible care. They simply don’t realize there is a practical, humane intervention that can turn an overwhelming situation into a manageable one.Yet Peta messaging often drifts toward a kind of performative responsibility checklist: cats should be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, licensed, microchipped and kept indoors. Which is, in theory, correct. It is also meaningless without confronting the obvious follow-up questions: who is paying, with what money, and where are those services actually accessible? Discussions of outdoor disease risk also tend to omit key context. Yes, outdoor cats face high disease exposure. But two of the most devastating viruses in outdoor populations – feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) – are strongly tied to mating and reproduction. Sterilization directly reduces those transmission pathways, which is, of course, the core mechanism of TNR. Ignoring that context creates a narrative that feels scientifically grounded while sidestepping the most practical intervention tool available.‘Demand has increased, without a doubt’: the shocking rise of personal protection dogsRead moreThe uncomfortable reality is thatNew YorkCity did not simply develop a stray cat problem so much as it manufactured one. The city’s affordability crisis has wreaked an animal welfare crisis. People are not choosing between being responsible and irresponsible; they are choosing between survival categories: rent, food, healthcare, childcare, transportation – and sometimes, yes, pet care loses out. Estimates place New York City’s outdoor cat population well above 500,000, and the burden of that population is not evenly distributed. It concentrates heavily in lower-income neighborhoods and outer borough communities, where access to veterinary care is already limited and where residents are more likely to be managing multiple layers of economic precarity at once.More than half of US pet owners report struggling to afford basic veterinary visits, and that pressure has been compounded by the rapid corporatization of veterinary medicine. Large corporate entities – including Mars Inc, which owns Banfield, VCA and BluePearl – now control a massive share of the US veterinary market, up dramatically from less than a decade ago. Prices have risen, staffing shortages have worsened and access has become more uneven. When humans face housing and food insecurity, their animals suffer too. This is not moral decay. It is economics, and pretending otherwise only pushes policy conversations further from solutions.Against that backdrop, TNR is not utopian animal activism so much as harm reduction. Outdoor cat reproduction is brutally efficient: females can become pregnant at four months old, gestation lasts roughly 65 days, and queens can become pregnant again while nursing. Kittens compete aggressively for limited nutrition and estimates suggest as many as 90% of kittens born outdoors never survive. Street mating is also a primary disease vector, with FeLV and FIV transmission heavily linked to reproduction and close maternal contact. Sterilization interrupts both population growth and major disease spread. Removal-only strategies have repeatedly failed anywhere they have been tried at scale without sterilization saturation. Killing cats without addressing reproduction simply creates a vacuum that new, unsterilized cats quickly fill.View image in fullscreenAnimal shelters in New York City are struggling to manage the overwhelming number of animals in their care.Photograph: UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesBy contrast, TNR stabilizes populations, reduces nuisance behaviors, lowers shelter intake pressure and improves overall colony health. It does not create perfection but it does mean fewer animals suffering. Talk to people who actually do this work – volunteers with full-time jobs, parents, teenagers, retirees – and you hear the same thing. City blocks change. Territorial fighting drops. Spraying declines. The endless cycle of dead litters slows. Neighborhoods stabilize. And yet these volunteers are frequently mocked or dismissed by organizations with far larger platforms, deeper pockets and greater public influence.If New York wants a serious solution, it is not glamorous, but it is extremely effective: city-subsidized universal spay and neuter access. Frame it any way you want. It works across every policy lens. It is public health policy, reducing disease burden and environmental strain. It is animal welfare policy, reducing the number of animals born into high-suffering conditions. And it is fiscal policy, reducing shelter intake, euthanasia costs and emergency medical spending over time. Pair that with sustained public education – explaining why sterilization matters, where services are available and how communities can participate – and you begin addressing root causes instead of symptoms.There are harder cultural conversations too. Cities that created massive shelter overflow while maintaining a retail pipeline of new animals deserve scrutiny. Working cats, including beloved bodega cats, may be culturally embedded. But without enforceable welfare standards, tradition can easily become neglect. None of this is anti-animal. It is pro-reality.Peta is right about one critical thing: the street is not freedom. Outdoor life for domestic cats is often short, violent and disease-filled. Outdoor cats also devastate bird populations and local ecosystems. But moral clarity requires consistency. If you are going to claim the ethical high ground on animal suffering, you do not get to choose the animals that make better viral billboards. Dogs deserve protection from exploitative breeding.Catsdeserve protection from policy debates built on half-said conclusions. And cities like New York do not need more slogans. They need sterilization access, affordability relief and sustained public education.Bob Barker used to sign off every episode of The Price Is Rightwith the same message: help control the pet population, have your pets spayed or neutered. No billboards. No outrage cycle. Just a simple, evidence-based solution repeated often enough to matter. Animal welfare could use more of that.Lauren Caulk is a co-founder and the president ofOcean Hill Cats, a non-profit cat rescue based in Brooklyn.Explore more on these topicsWestminster Dog ShowPetaAnimal welfareCatsNew YorkPetsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s fuzzy on the bits in betweenWed 4 Feb 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 14.18 ESTShareAs we all know from history and the current news cycle, autocracy is bad. But it can also be boring. For every explosive confrontation in Minneapolis, there is a quieter, less tangible threat in the form of Kash Patel’s FBIseizing voting recordsfrom Fulton county, Georgia – a state Donald Trump lost by fewer than 12,000 votes in 2020 – or the steady implementation of900-page manifestoby the influential rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation, neither of which lend themselves to blockbuster treatment. And so we have a problem: how to animate the quiet part of what’s happening in the US to reflect a dangerous but tedious reality – namely, that this thing ends not with a bang, but a combination of voter manipulation and federal electoral interference that undermines faith in the democratic process.I bring this up after a week of watching popular movies that resonate in Trump’s US, most of which go heavy on the firefights and light on the details of how we arrive at them. The latest, Anniversary, which launched this week onNetflix– a streamer increasingly uninterested in the subtleties of any situation, let alone this one – depicts a US in which an evil rightwing genius in the shape of a beautiful young woman talks the country into ditching democracy via the medium of (I love this detail; the sheer optimism of it) a stirring book of essays.Actually, I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film, in which Diane Lane plays a centrist mom and political scientist at Georgetown University, trying to keep her family and the discourse together. In essence, it’s a domestic drama with some autocracy for dummies around the edges. But what’s clever is its presentation of an Orwellian-style assault on democracy via language that sells plurality as hostile to “togetherness” and “unity” – very credible in today’s landscape.The book of essays, meanwhile, is entitled The Change and is a nod, possibly, toProject 2025, the shadowy rightwing playbook published by the Heritage Foundation that is now enjoying realisation on Capitol Hill. What the film doesn’t have patience for is the finer detail of how a New York Times bestseller leads to the collapse of the electoral system, and a new order in which subversive comedians are chased across bodies of water by paramilitaries in speed boats and drones threaten citizens in their own gardens after curfew.View image in fullscreenCailee Spaeny (left) and Kirsten Dunst in Alex Garland’s 2024 film Civil War.Photograph: A24If I sound like a killjoy, I apologise. It’s not the job of our creative industries to act as political shills (though we do have the Melania documentary for that). But this failure, to me, seems imaginative rather than political. Consider the impact of Hulu’s adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, in which the full horror of Gilead hits home precisely because the show (or rather, Margaret Atwood’s source material) meticulously joins the dots about the bureaucracy of how the US got there.With this in mind, after suffering through the second half of Anniversary, I returned to Alex Garland’s 2024 movie Civil War, which imagines a US in which three states have seceded against a strongman president in his illegal third term. I wasquite criticalabout this movie when it came out; the supreme court was hearing arguments about the January 6 riot that week and, despite the film’s delicious touches – the on-brand randomness of Florida joining a secessionist cause for reasons wholly unrelated to the broader popular uprising – its apolitical landscape seemed to me like a dodge.You could, I felt, sense the deep, can’t-be-arsed energy of the film’s creative team when they got to the political science part and it’s a fatigue to which we as American voters are vulnerable. It is easier, always, to pay attention only to the parts with explosions.What does that leave us with? There is Paul Thomas Anderson’s multi-Oscar nominatedOne Battle After Another, a slightly different beast to the other two movies in that it shows the US in the grip of a brutal military establishment hell-bent on chasing down “illegals” – in other words, the country as it is now rather than in some future dystopia. I’ve never got on with Anderson’s movies but I loved this, particularly the perfection of Sean Penn as Colonel Steven J Lockjaw, the psychopathic rogue officer who absolutely anticipated the border patrol official Greg Bovino. By reflecting back to us the seriousness of our present situation, the film makes a future reign of terror easier to imagine.View image in fullscreenTeyana Taylor as Perfidia and Sean Penn as Col Steven J Lockjaw in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. PicturesHere’s the weird thing, though. Of everything I watched this week it was Civil War, a far inferior movie to One Battle After Another, that really affected me. The movie occupies a quaint, pre-ICE symbolic order in which, even as civil war rages, the main external reference is to “Charlottesville” and a time when the biggest threat to the US was a bunch of tiki-torch-bearing dickheads, marching for fascism and armed by Bed Bath & Beyond. On first release, Civil War, so sketchy on details, made it easy to sit back and conclude “couldn’t happen here”. But the country has changed since then and, despite the film’s limitations, this time the violence on screen seemed to me suddenly, upsettingly closer.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionProject 2025NetflixUS constitution and civil libertiesICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)One Battle After AnotherAlex GarlandcommentShareReuse this content"

And where are the music stands?Wed 4 Feb 2026 09.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 10.42 ESTShareEvents in the United States of Trumpland continue to reveal staggering new dimensions to the possibilities of orchestral music. Trump’s announcement that his “Trump Kennedy Center” isto be shut for a refitis a brilliantly cynical way to stop the noise when artists try to cancel their appearances during the rest of his presidential tenure: it’s shut already!Biglylosers, all of you!But that’s not the new dawn for the artform I’m talking about. I mean the inspirational painting unveiled by the maestro of Trumpian kitsch, Jon McNaughton (and stamped with the presidential seal of approval – ie a post onTruth Social).Tucker Carlson is cheerleading on the cymbals and Elon Musk? He’s on electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral packMaga Symphonydepicts Trump as a conductor of the politicians and cultural figures who are Making the Orchestra Great Again. Who’s in this Maga fever dream of an orchestra? Marco Rubio leads the violins, JD Vance takes the cellos (Melania is relegated to the second desk), his sons and Roger Stone are on double basses, the foundation of the orchestra’s ideological soundworld. A bizarrely configured woodwind and brass lineup features four flutes and no oboes – mind you, there are no violas either, those shape-shifting probable Democrats! – plus Tom Homan on horn, with Tucker Carlson cheerleading on the cymbals. Where’s Elon Musk, you ask? On electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral pack.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s Truth Social post showing the painting.Photograph: @realDonaldTrumpAs McNaughton describes this image, “you can feel it – the music is coming together – rising and stirring something deep inside … When Americans pull together and trust a shared vision, they create something strong, lasting, and bigger than any one person.”And that’s the cultural trope that this ludicrous image burnishes: the idea of the all-powerful conductor, inspiring total command and obedience from their musicians, which has been inspirational catnip for dictators from Hitler to Stalin to Mussolini. As Elias Canetti wrote in his bookCrowds and Power: “There is no more obvious expression of power than the performance of a conductor … He has the power of life and death over the voices of the instruments.”Orchestras can represent an ideal society – if, that is, you’re a wannabe despot. Imagine: one hundred musicians, working in perfect togetherness to realise your vision, with no possibility of dissent, criticism or disagreement. Every tiny movement of your arms and facial expressions is magicked through the force of pure will into the sounds of your deepest desires. Which self-respecting autocrat wouldn’t want that kind of social control?McNaughton’s Maga orchestra takes the idea a stage further. There are no music stands in front of the players – they are performing through Trumpian telepathy, a connection as mystical as it’s musical. It’s not so much a Maga symphony as a political seance turned into sound.This concept of the orchestra didn’t only take hold of the fevered imaginations of dictators in the 1930s and presidents in the 2020s. Words such as McNaughton’s are routinely used in less obviously politically inflamed contexts to describe the potential social good that orchestras can do, from apologists for Venezuela’s El Sistema – its “system” of music education, and its satellites all over the world – to many leaders of orchestral culture here in the UK. If society worked more like orchestras, the story goes, our lives would all be better, because in orchestras everyone’s giving up their individuality for the greater good.An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collectiveBut that’s a deeply problematic idea, because orchestras never work in absolute harmony. An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collective. The best orchestras do not function like well-oiled machines, drilled to the finest margins of unanimity. Instead, they’re models of a controlled chaos of human emotions, desires and virtuosities that are held in tension, balance and friction in the moment of performance. They’re made from the transfigured experience of listening to each other. When orchestras really fly, the conductor isn’t an all-powerful musical despot, instead, he or she is an inspirer of a dynamic culture in which everyone responds to where the musical discourse is going, recognising when they’ve got the tune or the accompaniment, creating a permanent state of flux, volatility, and creative negotiation.The Trump image is comic, and troubling, because it reinstates the idea of the relationship between conductors and orchestras as populist shorthands for autocracy and demagoguery. No doubt the Association of British Orchestras’ annual conference,convening in London this week, will inspire a more genuinely collective vision for the future of the orchestra in this country. Or maybe an enterprisingly craven orchestra will sign up Trump as their next music director. Stranger things have happened. And probably will by next week.This week Tom has been listening to:Kevin Puts’s Emily: No Prisoner Be, Joyce DiDonato’s collaboration with Time for Three. It is communicative and urgently powerful in recording and performance.

Among the subjects: the 2026 World Cup, to be co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada this summer.“I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices,”Weah said.“Lots of real fans will miss matches.”“It is too expensive,” he added. “Football should still be enjoyed by everyone.”Pochettino plainly did not appreciate Weah wading intothe affordability discoursethat has become one of the dominant topics of this World Cup – along with, you know,all the rest of it.‘They’re not getting a cent of my money’: how readers feel about World Cup ticket pricesRead more“I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside,” Pochettino said. “It is not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket … We are not politicians. We are sport people that only we can talk about our job.”The antediluvian stick-to-sports take rankled, in no small part because Weah wasn’t talking about politics. He was a soccer player commenting on an extremely soccer-related matter. The ability for people from any economic class to be able to come and watch Tim Weah play in a World Cup is inarguably something that relates to his job. Why shouldn’t he have an opinion on it?It also flew against recent precedent. The men’s national team has made it a point to become more outspoken in recent years – not nearly at the level of the Megan Rapinoe-era USWNT, but enough to notice. The players’ recent“Be The Change” campaignwas aided and encouraged by the federation and Pochettino’s predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, who helped players find and sharpen their message.Pochettino then lent full-throated support to Fifa, a divisive governing body that has strayed far from its own statutory political neutrality inopenly backing Donald Trump.“I think if Fifa does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why,” he said. “But it’s not up to us to provide our opinion. … And I think we have the organization that is over us, that is Fifa, that is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people. I think for sure the media need to ask [these questions] directly to Fifa, and for sure you are going to receive a very good answer. But no, it is not up to us to judge this type of thing. We need to be focused on the sports side, and trust in the organization that is in charge of soccer or football around the world, that they are going to do the right things.”On one hand: Pochettino was speaking from Fifa’s World Cup headquarters in Coral Gables, Florida; what else was he supposed to say? On the other hand: Oof.Save forthe odd cranky moment, Pochettino has been affable and savvy since joining US Soccer after short-lived spells as manager of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But here, he sounded credulous and out of touch; ignorant of the many monetary obstacles placed before any non-rich fan wishing to support his team in person this summer. The cost ofparkingat the Los Angeles-area venue where the USMNT will play two of its three World Cup group stage matches will run as high as $300,per Fifa.It also contrasted sharply with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola recentlyspeaking out on the horrors in Gazaand showing support for the Palestinian people and their plight yet again.Rather than being called out for holding an opinion on something squarely within his realm of employment, Weah should be commended for handling the subject deftly; for acknowledging that there is indeed a whole world of people out there with experiences that differ significantly from his own. While not withouthis own awkward utterances, Weah does have a track record of responding thoughtfully when he has been dragged intoactualpolitics – he was a member of the first family of Liberia until fairly recently, after all. Like that time he and several Juventus teammates found themselves in the Oval Office, the backdrop to anunprovoked broadsideby Trump on transgender athletes.“It was weird,” Weah said after that experience last summer. “I was caught by surprise, honestly, when he started talking politics, with Iran and everything. I was kind of like, I just want to play football. … They just told us that we have to go, and I had no choice but to go. So I guess it was a cool experience, obviously being in the White House as a first time, it’s always wonderful. But I’m not one for the politics, so it wasn’t that exciting.”It is no small irony, then, that Weah and Pochettino appear to share the belief that players should remain apolitical. Which is to say that the manager not only misrepresented what Weah said, but also boosted the World Cup organizers whoareblending soccer with politics.In doing so, he completely missed the mood of the moment.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

Minnesotans, many of them Nordic, can be stoic and indirect. Not now. I have cried with more people in the space of a month than I probably have collectively in my life until now. I heard about their loved ones being taken, their kids being afraid and confused, their schools half-empty, their physical and psychological injuries afterICE encounters.Unless you’re here, you don’t really understand how consuming this is, how fried people’s nerves are, how frequently we’re sending around GoFundMe links and mutual aid drives, how many restaurants and storefronts are closed or reconfigured to be donation collection sites.

My colleagues from around the country have come to town to coverwhat’s happeningto thecommunity, and how people haveworked to help each other.I live in an inner-ring suburb, and while most of the videos you’ve seen are inMinneapolis, the suburbs have been hit hard, too, and often don’t have the density or rapid response networks of the city. You drive around scanning for SUVs with blacked-out windows driving erratically. “Down the road, I’m going to be in a psychiatrist’s office with one of those blob pictures like, what do you see? Out-of-state plates on a Jeep Wagoneer,” one woman joked to me recently. I heard a car alarm going off the other day from inside my house and immediately jumped up, unsure whether it was an accident or someone alerting neighbors to agents.Most people are a part of the resistance here, doing at least something to help their neighbors or fight against ICE. This is not a time for fence-sitters. I keep thinking of what a city council member told me soon after the Good shooting: “We’re not going to go quietly. I like that about us.”There is no helplessness.People have taken breaks from assisting the community – to care for loved ones, to attend funerals, to get treatment for illnesses, to get medical care after ICE roughed them up. One woman, wearing a coat she had written “Granny Against ICE” on the back of, cared for her sick father until he died, and then she went right to the streets to start protesting. If you have small children like I do, you’re parenting around a crisis, missing bedtimes and quieter moments, unable to fully explain to a toddler why you’re preoccupied.I have seen videos and images and heard stories that will be burned into my brain forever:Liam Ramosin his blue hat. Good saying: “I’m not mad at you, bro.” Cecilia’s parents both being taken, after nearly three decades in Minnesota, on their way to work as cleaners. People released into subzero temperatures in the dark of night from a federal detention facility, left to fend for themselves.Two federal agents reportedly identified in fatal shooting of Alex PrettiRead moreBut I’ve also seen the very best of us. Outside the Whipple building, a woman stood up an operation quickly to help people leaving detention get coats, phones and rides, after her son found two women without coats left outside. Natalie Ehret, who started Haven Watch, teared up talking about the detainees she’d seen – some US citizens, some not.Until recently, her last panic attack was three years ago, on the day she found out her son had brain cancer. Then, a couple days ago, she had another, after interviewing a young man who had left detention and was getting help from Haven Watch. The man reminded her so much of her son when he was a teenager.“I came out of that interview and I was, like, yelling: ‘What are wedoing?’ What are we doing to these young people, this 20-year-old boy, and he was so broken and hurt. He was traumatized, but he felt so hurt by us,” she said.Some of the stories she’s heard have changed her. Theyshouldchange you, she said.Even ifICEleaves tomorrow, the long threads of what has happened here will reverberate. These kids will remember. The families torn apart will never be the same. The people hiding out at home – when will they feel enough trust to leave again? I don’t know how you unwind this. I do know there’s a broad community of people that will help figure that out.On the day Good was killed, I stood on a snowbank outside the police tape line, watching as loads of federal agents poured onto the scene.Dozens of Minneapolis police also lined the area. When police finally got federal agents to leave, those agents were met with people screaming at them, calling them murderers. The agents gassed people at close range, spraying chemicals from inches away into people’s faces. They volleyed pepper balls into the crowd. They were liberal with the “less-lethal” weapons in a way I had never seen before, but have seen many days since.“Whatisthis? What is this for?” I said out loud to myself as I watched, and I have been thinking it every day since.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisMinnesota ICE shootingsTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This, not Maga’s conception of male power, is what we must teach young menWed 4 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 03.14 ESTShareThe first thing that grabbed me about the Rapture’s 2011 songIt Takes Time to be a Manwas the warbly, analogue fuzz of its recurring guitar and piano riff. Once that drew me in, what kept me listening were the lyrics’ hard-marriage of masculinity and empathy. In thefinal verse, Luke Jenner tells us that: “Well there’s room in your heart now / for excellence to take a stand / And there’s tears that need shedding / it’s all part of the plan”.For the past year, rightwing voices have waged war on empathy. According to Elon Musk, empathy is “the fundamental weakness of western civilisation”.Others go further, calling it “toxic”, “suicidal” and even “sinful”. Certainly, the macho wing of the Maga right sees no place for it amid its(mis)appropriationof medieval history and imagery that is visible everywhere from the face paint and horned headdress of the “QAnon shaman”, convicted for his role in the US Capitol siege,to thetattooed arms and bodyof Donald Trump’s secretary of war, Pete Hegseth.And yet, consider theideal of chivalryheld by medieval knights: generosity and suspicion of profit, courtesy, honesty and the bind of your word, hospitality, abiding by the rules of combat and granting mercy to your adversary – whose life a knight takes only as a last resort. I say this not because I think the medieval knight should be the new standard for modern men, but to point out that Maga men would fail, miserably so, to live up to their own ideals.But on 24 January, near the frozen kerb of Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, a different understanding of manliness was on display. This was a vision of masculinity that is the domain of men who have taken the time to understand that manhood lives in the deep empathy of the person who, likeAlex Pretti, places his body in front of a bully’s repression, rather than in the service of it.Masked government thugs snuffed out Alex Pretti’s life in broad daylight | Moira DoneganRead moreI have no idea what, if anything, Pretti believed about nonviolence. That he carried a gun implies that if it was his ethic, then it was so only up to a certain point. Minnesota is a state where “concealed carry” gun laws apply, and you could argue that a person in Pretti’s situation might reasonably conclude they were under assault from an armed militia, and draw their legally held weapon.Indeed, US gun lobbyists have loudlydefendedPretti’s right to carry a firearm against the Trump administration’s suggestions that bringing a gun to a protest implied violent intent. Had he drawn his weapon, a predictable logic would have played out.The Insurrection Actmight have been invoked and the repression that followed would have been swift, brutal and complete.Instead, his response resulted in a sacrifice that may have bent history and changed the course of resistance. Whether or not he made that calculation in his head at the time or not, he denied authorities any excuse for great repression.In the end, out of empathy for the other protester, who had been pushed to the ground, rather than from a place of aggression towards federal immigration agents, he risked his life (or, simply, life ) in an act of care rather than an act of violence. The French psychoanalyst and philosopher Anne Dufourmantelle wrote about this kind of voracious acceptance of risk in a 2011 book Éloge du risque (In Praise of Risk). “Perhaps risking ‘one’s’ life lies in realising that it is absolutely singular and nevertheless not one’s own,” writes Dufourmantelle, who died tragically six years later while risking her life to save two drowning children on the southern coast of France. “Perhaps it’s life that risks itself on us.”There is a common misconception that nonviolence means passivity. I know this is not the case because I grew up surrounded by people who believed deeply in an ethic of active, nonviolent resistance. These were people who arranged their lives around the consequences – the sacrifices – that came from their commitment to see others as we see ourselves, to a moral community beyond an identity community. As an adolescent, I claimed that this was my commitment as well. As an adult, I think nonviolence might only be an active choice when the balance of power between different parties is equal. And I don’t know if, faced with Pretti’s choice, I would have the courage to risk harm to myself. But this is the kind of courage that needs to be taught; that takes time to embody.Years ago, it dawned on me that what drives so many atomised, disaffected young men to turn towards far-right charlatans peddling fake, puffed-up versions of what it means to be a man, is that society – US society, in particular – has only ever showed them one conception of what it means to be powerful in the world.As a result they are,as French anthropologist Philippe Bourgois wroteabout young men who joined Harlem street drug gangs in the 1980s, in search of respect, in search of being seen.I was lucky enough to be served a different image. My childhood was full of potluck dinners at theCatholic Worker House, teach-ins about social injustice and anti-war protests. I heard my mom praying “Our father, ourmother, who art in heaven” next to me at mass. I had close friendships with women and men, who taught me to be emotionally vulnerable. I gained familiarity with open doors and open hearts and the willingness to sacrifice that defines real community, rather than its thin approximations found online.We, as a society, have to loudly shift the stories we tell boys and young men about just what type of man it takes time to become. Alex Pretti had courage and all the things the myths and tales say men should aspire to. He had them because of his empathy, because of his ethic of care. His executioners had the performance of masculinity, the kind won by meting out violence and terrorising communities.On a street in Minneapolis, two versions of masculinity clashed. One anchored in fear, the other in care. To the young men hesitating over what kind of man to become, in the words of the Rapture: “Well take it slow and take my hand.”Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist.

It should be withdrawn for three reasons.The first is institutional. The president ofIsraelis a constitutional role that is head of state but not part of the political or military chain of command. The office is similar to that of Australia’s governor general, though with somewhat more power. As head of state, the president embodies and represents the state of Israel.The international court of justice has found that Israel unlawfully occupies the Palestinian territories, has unlawfully purported to annex parts of the Palestinian territories and unlawfully plants, encourages and maintains unlawful settlements in Palestinian territories. The court is also trying a case in which Israel is accused of genocide.The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister and former defence minister, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The same court is investigating other senior Israeli military and political leaders on similar charges. The UNcommission of inquiryon the occupied Palestinian territory has found evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocidal intent by Israeli leaders and recommended their prosecution. Israel is a rogue state whose head of state, its supreme representative, should not be permitted to visit Australia.‘I don’t think this was a good decision’: Labor’s Ed Husic holds ‘deep concerns’ over Israeli president Isaac Herzog’s visitRead moreThe second reason is about Herzog himself. The commission of inquiry has found that Herzog has incited genocide. Herzog made the statement that all Palestinians, “an entire nation”, are responsible for the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023.The commission found that, because as president he is not part of the political or military chain of command, he was not responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity. But the crime of incitement to genocide stands outside the chain of command. It can be committed by any individual. The commission recommended that he be investigated and prosecuted by the international criminal court.Herzog denies this and has qualified his statement, saying “there are many, many innocent Palestinians who don’t agree” with the actions of Hamas. But the UN commission said it viewed that as an effort “to deflect responsibility for the initial statement”. He has been a vocal head of state and his words have been taken and repeated by Israeli soldiers. Someone who incites genocide does not satisfy the good character test for entering Australia. On the contrary, a person who incites genocide should be arrested on arrival and tried under Australian law and international law for the crime.Traditionally, a head of state has a special immunity when visiting another country. However, there is now strong legal argument that this immunity does not apply in relation to atrocity crimes, namely war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Australia should not apply immunity in relation to these crimes.Israel’s foreign ministry has previously rejected the commission’s report as “distorted and false”, and Herzog has said his comments have been taken out of context, noting he also said Israeli soldiers would follow international law.The third reason for withdrawing the invitation relates to us, Australia, and our current situation. The Hanukah massacre on 14 December has shaken us all. It was an atrocity. Immediately political leaders across the spectrum expressed concerns for “social cohesion”. They said steps were needed to restore social cohesion and called for national unity at a time of crisis. Eventually a royal commission was appointed for this purpose. And yet it’s hard to imagine a single event at this point in time more likely to harden national division and undermine social cohesion than a visit by the Israeli president. It could be the most divisive state visit to Australia since that of US president Lyndon B Johnson in October 1966 when the Vietnam war was at its height and Australian soldiers were being killed.Who is Israel’s president Isaac Herzog and why is his visit to Australia expected to prompt mass protests?Read moreWhat was the prime minister thinking when he invited Herzog? In the days after the massacre, he no doubt thought inviting Herzog was a good way to express support for the traumatised Jewish community. But Herzog is a political leader, not a religious leader. He is divisive in Israel and his visit could be divisive in Australia. If the prime minister wanted to support the Jewish community, he would have done better to invite a respected Jewish religious leader.For reasons of law, ethics and social cohesion, this divisive political visit should be stopped. The prime minister is widely acclaimed for his willingness to recognise mistakes and change course before it’s too late. He should recognise that he made a terrible mistake, in the emotional, traumatic days after the massacre, in inviting Herzog to visit. It’s not too late to correct the mistake.Chris Sidoti is a commissioner on the UN commission of inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.

He has, as one advertising lackey puts it, “gotten rich selling people air that’s ‘fresher’ than the stinky stuff outside”.If a recent proliferation of real-life courses, books andonline search interestis anything to go by, the act of getting that air into one’s lungs is also now commodified.Online and in-person breathwork sessions now abound, some charging hundreds of dollars to teach participants a skill most have already acquired as a prerequisite for life: how to breathe.Sleepmaxxing: from red light to mouth taping and nasal dilators, do any of the viral trends work? | AntiviralRead moreThe claimed advantages vary from benefits for which there is solid evidence, such asstress relief, to more dubious ones: advertising copy for various courses includes promises participants will “access states of healing most people never touch”, “unlock your fullest human potential”, and “foster … deep personal growth”.Is there truly a better way to breathe? Is there any evidence for breathwork’s purported benefits – or are the claims just full of hot air?What is breathwork?Breathwork as a wellness trend is difficult to precisely define, because there are “all sorts of different breathwork techniques and protocols that get popularised”, says Dr Vince Polito, a senior lecturer in the school of psychological sciences at Macquarie University.“There genuinely are some physiological effects of changing your breathing,” Polito says, describing it as a means to influence the autonomic nervous system, which regulates unconscious measures like heart rate and blood pressure. “It certainly can change your mood and affect as well.“Some breathwork is about slowing down your breathing and having more of a relaxing effect,” he says, whereas other techniques “involve quite rapid breathing to the point where you really changing the levels of oxygen that are available to … your brain and body”.Some techniques have well established effects on the body. For example,diaphragmatic breathing– also called abdominal breathing or belly breathing – encourages deeper lungfuls of air and has been found toreduce physiological markers of stresssuch ascortisol levels.There’s resistance breathwork, in which the diaphragm is strengthened “to be able to breathe in … and breathe out under resistance”, Prof Mark Hutchinson, dean of health research at Adelaide University, says. “That’s … literally a muscle growing and strengthening exercise to be able to increase your lung capacity.”Onemeta-analysis– which synthesises results from multiple studies – found that “breathwork may be effective for improving stress and mental health”, but cautioned about a need to “avoid a miscalibration between hype and evidence”.“It is important that hype around breathwork is grounded in evidence for efficacy – and effects are not overstated to the public,” its authors wrote.What are the risks and benefits?What fascinates Hutchinson about the process is that our body’s instinct to breathe – known as respiratory drive – is “not actually … because we want oxygen. It’s because we need to get rid of carbon dioxide”.That drive is central to the Wim Hof breathing method, which involves rapid breathing and breath holds. “You breathe off carbon dioxide by hyperventilating, which creates a hypoxic [low oxygen] state for your body … your breath systems do not kick in, and so you can hold your breath for minutes,” Hutchinson says.Research suggeststhat Hof’s techniques – which combine breathing exercises, cold exposure training and meditation – may reduce levels of inflammation in the body, and that cold immersion training and breathing exercises may alsoincrease people’s pain thresholds.Hutchinson is now conducting aclinical trialon whether the Wim Hof method could help control pain in women with endometriosis.Experts havepointed outthat techniques such as the Wim Hof method are not without risk. “All of these things should be … [done] under constant supervision and guidance by medical practitioners,” Hutchinson says, especially those in at-risk groups, such as people with respiratory conditions. He points to the need for further research to be able to create evidence-based guidelines for certain breathwork techniques.‘Breathing is free’“Particular breathing exercises that often get very popular can also … lead to some sort of alteration in consciousness,” Polito says. “That’s why I think you see all sorts of remarkable claims about breathworking.“The complication of having altered states involved is that … sometimes people in those settings genuinely have transformative experiences.“But it’s so uncontrolled a lot of the time,” he says, and others “can have destabilising experiences”.“There’s also a business motive sometimes as well,” he says. “You can end up with these promotions of breathwork that are claiming more about what it’s able to do than what has been rigorously empirically demonstrated at this point.”Ultimately, Hutchinson says, “breathing is free”. And while “there is an opportunity here to harness other parts of our physiology” through specific techniques if people are interested, “that is not a complex, hundreds-of-dollars activity”.“When I … see people charging large amounts of money for very expensive things that are not actually grounded in any evidence, my alarm bells go off,” he says.As an advertisement for the fictional bottled air company in The Lorax advises: “Please breathe responsibly.”Donna Lu is an assistant editor, climate, environment and science at Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

We need a second chamber the public can trustJenny Jones is a Green party peerWed 4 Feb 2026 07.50 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 13.01 ESTSharePeter Mandelsonhas resignedfrom the House of Lords, but even if he is sentenced to prison for misconduct in public office he can still use the title Lord Mandelson until either an act of parliament, or death, takes it off him. Keir Starmer today said his govenment is indeedseeking to strip him of it. But that it takes a direct intervention from the prime minister sums up the problem with living in a semi-feudal system.Patronage first lifted Mandelson into the Lords in 2008, despite his being forced to resign twice as a minister. The first resignation came in 1998 when hefailed to declarea home loan from a millionaire backer; the second time, in 2001, was because he helped amillionaire funderfor the Millennium Dome get a British passport. So elevation to the Lords allowed him to maintain influence despite his conduct losing him two ministerial positions.Keir Starmer’s patronage lifted Mandelson up again,to the US ambassador job, despite his links to Jeffrey Epstein being well documented in mainstream and social media. Mandelson’s career is littered with dishonesty and scandal, but many (so-called) sensible voices in the media and politics argued he was the right man to represent our country on the world stage. The truth is that everyone knew the risks, but no one cared – because everyone assumes that corruption is the norm.In a world dominated by rich and powerful men, Mandelson was a go-between, close to important people and the corridors of power. His elevation to the Lords undoubtedly increased his stature, and with it his access. Mandelson will not return to the Lords, but among the remaining peers, what amounts to cash for access is often done subtly and within the rules. So where are the political checks and balances that voters used to expect?A report last February showed that nearly 100 members of the Lords were paid togive political or policy adviceby commercial firms. One former ministerearned millions of poundsby working for 30 companies. Multiple peers arebeing paidby foreign governments, including repressive regimes.Politics and business are bound together in the Lords, with peers able to book plush rooms to pursue their private interests. Perhaps that is why the Earl of Shrewsbury forgot he couldn’t claim travel expenses to attend a business conference. He gotbanned from the Lordsfor the second time in three years.Last year, Ian Duncan, a deputy speaker of the Lords, was found to havebreached the rulesby providing a parliamentary service for Terrestrial Energy when he facilitated an introduction between its chief executive and a new energy minister. Several others have apologised for similar slip-ups, such as promoting their cryptocurrency companies and seeking to profit personally from their membership of the second chamber.In November, the Lords conduct committee suspended David Evans and Richard Dannatt after finding thateach had breached rulesprohibiting members from offering parliamentary services for payment or reward. They will be back at work by Easter.How much did the Epstein poison infect Britain? Starmer had better find out, and fast | Gaby HinsliffRead moreFinally, it’s unbelievable that Michelle Mone still has a peerage, despitelying aboutbeing closely involved with a company run by her husband that sold faulty Covid PPE gear, and cost us taxpayers more than £100m. The pandemic cost the government an estimated£11bn in fraud and error, not helped by the fast-track scheme for contracts set up by the Conservatives that bypassed the usual checks and safeguards.Then, of course, there are the peers who don’t do any work – those who turn up only rarely, while loving the prestige that comes from being part of this grand but semi-derelict club.Reforming such an ingrained workplace culture of treating politics as a business opportunity requires taking away peerages. I don’t say that lightly. I am honoured to be a peer. As someone from a poor working-class background, born and bred on a council estate, I get furious at the people who don’t take the job seriously. It comes with an obligation to work to improve legislation and help our society to function better.Many peers feel the same way, and see the second chamber as a workplace where you do an important public service. We have some success, but we lack the democratic legitimacy to challenge the government. And, of course, all of us peers are here because of political patronage, or inheritance. For all the good we are able to do, it would be better still to tear up the system and rebuild it in a more democratic way.The talk is Mandelson today, but the real question is why the system of patronage and an unelected second chamber is still allowed to exist. It’s way past time to abolish it and urgently replace it with something elected and modern.Jenny Jones is a Green party peerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

All the party has left are threats about ‘splitting the vote’Wed 4 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 06.42 ESTShareDon’t let theLabourparty say one more word about “splitting the vote”, in the forthcoming byelection or at any other time. With proportional representation, no one would ever need to worry about splitting the vote again. No one would need to choose the lesser evil to keep the greater evil out of office. We could vote for the parties we actually wanted. But the Labour government won’t hear of it. It insists we retain the unfair, ridiculous first-past-the-post system, then blames us for the likely results.This is not because proportional representation is unpopular – far from it. Last year’s British Social Attitudes survey showed that 36% of people want to keep the electoral system as it is, while 60%want to change it. But as we are not allowed to vote on how we should vote, the decision is left in the hands of the corrupt old system’s beneficiaries.In 2022, the Labour party conferencevoted in favourof proportional representation. At the end of 2024, so did a majority of MPs, includinga majority of Labour MPs. Keir Starmer himself, while vying to become party leader, pointed out howunfair the current system is. But from the moment he was chosen, he refused to countenance any attempt to change it.Why? For the very reason he highlighted: that the system is unfair. First past the post allows the two traditional parties of government to threaten and cajole us, warning that we’ll split the vote if we don’t support them. The splitting-the-vote argument is not a result of the system. It is the point of the system.But now of course, as the old alliances shatter, first past the post has a different effect. An analysis in October suggested that on just 27% of the vote (roughly in the middle of its polling over the past year), Reform UK would win48% of the seats, allowing it to take power with a small coalition partner. If Reform UK forms the next government, it will be for one reason and one reason alone: our electoral system.So why is Starmer’s government so determined to keep it? Before the last election, the reason was obvious. In 2024, Labour gained just 33.7% of the vote: the smallest share for any party winning a general election since the second world war. Yet it took 63% of the seats in parliament: a massive majority.But now the reason has changed. Thanks to Starmer’s Merdas touch, which has turned the golden opportunity (grossly unfair as it is) of a 174-seat majority into a great steaming pile of excrement, Labour knows it is highly unlikely to win the next election. But it also knows this: that under proportional representation, it would be more or less wiped out.This is what we’re seeing in the opinion polls ahead of May’s Welsh Senedd vote. That election will be conducted under a new and much fairer voting structure, called the “closed proportional list system”. The number of seats will be quite an accurate representation of the number of votes. What do we learn? That in Cymru, where Labour has been almost hegemonic for a century, it will, on current trends, end up withabout 10% of the seats. Cast into theouter darkness, in other words.But under the existing system, in a general election in 2029, Labour could channel its efforts into particular constituencies and emerge – despite a very small share of the total vote – with a respectable minority. It could be the official opposition. It might even be able to cobble a coalition together and limp on in government for a while. In other words, the difference between a fair system and an unfair one is the difference between Labour being booted into theKuiper Belt, and Labour continuing to look like a serious player.There is no way Reform UK could, on current trends, win a general election under proportional representation. The last election was tilted unfairly against that party: it took just five seats, despite winning14.3% of the vote. Nigel Faragecomplained bitterly about it. Now, he has changed his tune. Last year he pointed out that “first past the post can be your enemy, but there comes aninversion point at which it becomes your friend”.So this is how the real horror show begins: with Reform UK taking office on an even smaller share of the vote than Labour received in 2024. The only reason the UK did not become ungovernable after the grotesque results of the last election is that Keir Starmer’s government is so elusive and so bland. We might detest many of its works, but not so fiercely as to occupy the capital, refuse to pay our taxes, call a general strike or use the other tactics deployed by people in countries where their will has been thwarted.But if Farage’s extreme and divisive party were to win on a similar proportion of the votes, the response would not be so muted. We would find ourselves in a country in which the great majority of people adamantly did not want to live under aReform UKgovernment, voted to ensure they did not, but found themselves doing so anyway. If that happens, it will be entirely on this Labour government, and its self-interested refusal to change the electoral system. So much for “country before party”.But hey-ho: this horrific prospect grants the current government leverage over us. It can use the existing system to threaten that if we don’t vote Labour, we will get Farage. In our panic, we might forget that it is this system, and this system alone, that makes the threat real. As the Gorton and Denton byelection approaches, Labour is getting its excuses in early: if Reform wins, it will be the Greens’ fault, for “splitting the vote”. It warns us that “only Labour can beat Reform”. This isn’t true: the bookies currently thinkthe Greens will win. If so, it will be because, whileLabour offers disappointment and frustration, and Reform offers hatred and division, they offer hope and inspiration.There’s only one way we are going to get the electoral system we want, and that is to vote for the parties we want. Organise. Defy the threats. Vote in hope. Recognise that the situation has changed. And then we might never need to make a depressing choice again.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectoral reformOpinionProportional representationLabourReform UKGreen partyKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

The 1997 Labour and Conservative manifestos both included pledges to connect schools to something they called “the information superhighway”.That metaphor soon fell out of use, unmourned, although it contains an interesting policy implication. Roads need rules to prevent accidents. Superhighways do not sound like the kind of places where children should play.The comparison falls short because the hazards in a flow of information traffic are harder to define than reckless driving. Legal restrictions on what can be published online are a more contentious constraint on freedom than speed bumps and breathalyser tests.Every society recognises that words and images, in certain contexts, do harm and that incitement to commit crime can be a criminal act. There is a spectrum of tolerance and enforcement. Repression of free speech is a symptom of tyranny, but all governments regulate it to some degree.The threshold for intervention is lower when children are involved. That is why the idea of banning under-16s from social media, alreadyoperational in Australia, is catching on elsewhere. Spain this week announced it would do the same. The French parliamentvoted for a banlast week. The UK government isconsidering one.Even Kemi Badenoch, a self-styled crusader for freedom of expression,suspends her routine horrorat state interference when it comes to shielding malleable young minds from “violence, pornography and extremist content”. Such material is “optimised to capture attention and maximise engagement”. The result is “rising anxiety, poor sleep [and] reduced concentration”.The Conservative leader doesn’t think those effects are harmful to over-16s. Quite the opposite. She argues that keeping young people away from social media would mean “more freedoms to adults online”. There would be no need for infantilising moderation. Let the kids play outside while the grownups imbibe as much sex, violence and fanaticism as their anxious, sleep-deprived brains can take.Badenoch reasons herself into this muddle by conflating content, volume and rate of consumption. It is not controversial to want to protect children from hardcore pornography. In analogue times it was assumed there would also be limits for adults. The new element identified by the Tory leader, although she doesn’t pursue the thought, is unconscious manipulation and short-circuiting of critical faculties. The digital delivery apparatus – the combination of phones, apps and algorithms – turns us into compulsive consumers.There is a political dimension to this phenomenon that is subtly but crucially different from the discussion of whether to ban what, before there was an information superhighway, used to be called “video nasties”.Lurid images are more compelling than reasoned arguments. Aroused emotions drive engagement. The most shocking sight is the most shareable content. Outrage is addictive. By that mechanism, social-media platforms resemble engines of radicalisation, accelerating any opinion towards its most extreme iteration, shrinking the pool of agreed facts, atrophying a society’s capacity to empathise with alternative perspectives.That disruption to the democratic operating system isn’t addressed by arguments about free speech. Free speech is the lens that tech companies apply because it gives a democratic inflection to their commercial interests as oligopolists in an under-regulated digital realm. Far-right politicians adopt that frame because they are in the business of undermining the norms and institutions of liberal democracy. That agenda is well served by communications infrastructure that privileges frenzied intolerance.Hatred promoted as heroic defiance of censorship, daring to say the unsayable, is a poisoned arrow aimed at the achilles heel of liberalism – its dutiful tolerance of illiberal opinion.These issues would be hard enough to navigate if it were just a challenge of balancing state control, public interest and private enterprise in a single jurisdiction with clear lines of democratic accountability. It is far from that.The concentration of digital power is an ocean away, wielded by companies whose bosses are, at best, quietly complicit in Donald Trump’s assault on the US constitution and, in the case of X’s Elon Musk and Palantir’s Peter Thiel,vigorous advocates and enablersof the new US despotism.The alliance of Maga politics and Silicon Valley oligarchy has a double influence on British politics. First, it dictates terms of debate in the windowless chambers where formerly mainstream politicians on the right hallucinate the nation’s collapse into criminality and Islamification. Second, it feeds into Trump’s trade policy as pressure not to implement existing online harms legislation or do anything else that may impede US business interests, under threat of tariffs. Such imperial coercion is, of course, expressed by Washington as part of a global crusade in defence of free speech.How the left can win back the internet – and rise again | Robert TopinkaRead moreTo see the cynical dishonesty in that formulation is not to dismiss the need for liberal vigilance whenever the state takes an interest in rules governing information. Laws drafted with good intent and the promise of a light touch can form a suffocating grip in the wrong hands. But coding the question of tech regulation exclusively in terms of that risk is a wilful misdirection. It steers attention away from the question of who controls the digital plumbing on which British democracy depends and whose interests they serve.Is it a problem that Musk, the world’s richest man, uses his personal social-media megaphone to promote racist conspiracy theories andboost far-right insurrectionacross Europe? Is it relevant, when Palantir is awarded contracts to develop IT systems for the NHS and MoD, that the company hasbuilt apps for ICE, Trump’s anti-immigration militia; that it feeds them federal data to locate potential targets? Does it matter how much leverage an elected prime minister has if those tech behemoths take against him? Those are not questions of free speech but sovereignty, which is something Conservatives used to care about.The current debate around social-media bans for under-16s barely skims the surface of these issues. More optimistically, it indicates growing awareness that the mass migration of human activity online is an epoch-defining political event and the default settings on the tools and platforms involved may not be designed with citizens’ best interests in mind. The implications for democracy cannot be reduced to a facile equation of regulation with censorship.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat is Labour from both the Green party and Reform and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour party?

The effort required to get them out of the house for football practice, a museum visit or a swim at the beach can often outweigh any potential reward (a temporary reprieve from holiday boredom, for example).Couples talk about love languages. Parents are more familiar with the multifarious languages of no. These range from blunt refusal through to nuclear meltdowns and very temporary and highly specific vision loss – the latter rendering essential objects such as clothes and shoes invisible, even within a high-contrast setting.So much of parenting is about teaching our children to say yes. To vegetables. To swimming lessons. To situations that might – at first – edge them out of their comfort zone. Basically to say yes to whatever it is that we as parents have decided might be best for them.Travelling with children: the blood, sweat and tears – and the determination to keep going | Lucille WongRead moreThere are, of course, perils with this approach. Our youngest came home from primary school a few weeks ago with a wounded hand after being told she had to complete 50 lengths of the monkey bars to be admitted to an exclusive “club”. She was not comforted when I suggested, given the evidence, that this might be a club for morons. The first rule of Moron Club, I reminded her, is don’t try to join Moron Club.At a time when we are more conscious of consent, empowering our kids with the confidence to say no feels increasingly important. Thinking back to my own young adulthood, there were so many poor decisions made because it felt socially fatal – not to mention rude – to turn someone down.It doesn’t help that so much of our culture is centred around the joy of saying yes. You don’t have to be Yes Man (comedian Danny Wallace wrote a memoir about the life-changing power of saying yes to everything) to feel that to decline an offer is to lose out on a potentially enriching or indulgent experience. This is the purpose of marketing, after all – to create a desire and immediately weaken your ability to resist it. Eat the chocolate. Bet on the horses. Buy the car. Our whole economy is driven by the power of yes.When I was an early career teacher, the best advice I was ever given was “don’t respond until you’ve received the same email three times”. Obviously, this excluded genuinely urgent communications and emails from concerned parents, but did provide a buttress against any obligation to overcommit.As with many care-based organisations, schools tend to rely on good people doing too much. My mentor had sensed in me an eagerness to please that, unprotected, would have seen me press-ganged into every committee and volunteer gig going.If there’s one good reason to empower children with the confidence to say no, it’s to help them resist impulsiveness and build reflection into the decision-making process. After all, there is an inherent pause to the word “no”. Not every decision has to be made in the moment. It’s OK to ask for time to consider. Parents of overly impulsive children will probably be familiar with the importance of mindfulness, freezes and “stopping” skills.Starting from a position of “no” is really asking children – however their brains may be wired – to think further into the future than the next 10 seconds. There is value too in teaching them it is OK to change your mind. That a tentative yes can become a firm no – and vice versa.The neat trick here, from a parent’s perspective, is this is also how we get them to say yes to the unpleasant things. There are rewards – and even pleasures – to eating vegetables, to maths homework and to football practice that might not be immediately apparent. Rewards that, on pause and reflection, transcend the impulsive no.In other words, by teaching our kids that they have the ability to say no, we’re giving them better reasons to say yes. Learning to say no won’t necessarily mean they’re cutting themselves off from new friends or experiences. The sad truth is, since becoming a No Person, I haven’t really ended up doing less things. I still end up ridiculously overcommitted.What has changed is I now feel happier about these commitments. When I know I could have said no, I have to accept that, on some level, I must have wanted to say yes. Knowing that I chose to do something difficult or without obvious pleasures can be a salve and means I have to look a little deeper at my motivations. The reward – or at least, the purpose – must be there somewhere.Helping children take the time to identify that reward might just be the key to helping them say yes to broccoli and no to Moron Club.Myke Bartlett is a writer and criticExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingSharing the LoadcommentShareReuse this content"

But this time, the system largely operated as we needed, despitesome outages.On Australia’s main grid last quarter, renewables and energy storagecontributed more than 50%of supplied electricity for the first time, while wholesale power prices were more than 40% lower than a year earlier.Australia’s long, complicated and difficult energy transition is finally working. As our recent research suggests, if these trends continue – and nothing new goes wrong – we shouldbegin to seelower retail electricity bills by mid-2026. As more coal plants close and new transmission and storage infrastructure is delivered, electricity prices could rise again. But overall, shifting demand from gas and coal for power and petrol for cars is likely to deliver significantly lower energy bills for households.It’s not yet job done and challenges remain, but the immediate trends are positive.Australia’s grid now relies on renewable energy as much as coal. Those who doubted it look foolishRead moreRenewables and batteries up, wholesale prices downLast quarter, wind generationwas upalmost 30%, grid solar 15% and grid-scale batteries almost tripled their output. Gas generation fell 27% to its lowest level for a quarter century, while coal fell 4.6% to its lowest quarterly level ever.Gas has long been themost expensiveway to produce power. Gas peaking plants tend to fire up only when supply struggles to meet demand and power prices soar. Less demand for gas has flowed through to lower wholesale prices.That doesn’t mean consumers will see immediate benefit, as wholesale prices are onlyabout 40%of a power bill and most retailers move prices once a year. But if lower wholesale prices are sustained, it should begin to bring relief to consumers.Power system holding up under strainLast quarter wasunusually goodfor the system. In recent years, many ageing coal plants have becomeless reliable. But the old plants held up at critical times. Rain filled Snowy Hydro’s reservoirs, giving hydro power a boost, while solar and wind produced well.In early January, intense bushfires ripped through grasslands, forests and several Victorian towns. Some areas lost power when timber power polesburnedor when trees fell on transmission lines. Sustained heat can cause power substations or transformers to fail more often. But these issues were mostly localised.Until recently, summer heatwaves put real strain on the power grid, as millions of people fired up their air conditioners at once. But this summer, the system largelydealt fine. Not only were most fossil generators available most of the time, but high output from rooftop solar pairs exceptionally well with demand for air-conditioning.Electricity storage expandingUntil very recently, electricity had to be made immediately before use. Storing it was only possible in expensive and uncommon pumped hydro facilities. This is why batteries are proving revolutionary. For the first time, power can be made and easily stored for later use.Plummeting battery prices have led to asurge in installationsin Australia. Since 2024, close to 4,000 megawatts of grid storage has come online. Until recently, grid batteries found more usestabilising the gridthan powering it. But the growing fleet of grid-scale batteries is now beginning tooutcompete gasby soaking up surplus solar and wind and releasing it during evening peaks.View image in fullscreenThe Australian government’s home battery rebate has been hugely popular.Composite: Getty ImagesAt smaller scale, the government’s home battery rebate has been hugely popular, leading tocost blowoutsand very rapid uptake. Many householders have found thema lifelineduring power outages.In the future, medium-scale community batteries able to power towns or suburbs could helpboost grid resilience.Transmission delays mean coal is needed longerHitting higher levels of renewables will requirenew transmission lines. Some of these are on track, but others arewell behind.This is one reason NSW’s Eraring coal plant will sensiblykeep runninguntil 2029. Delays completing the new NSW-South Australia transmission line, EnergyConnect, also pushed back theplanned closureof the Torrens Island gas power plant near Adelaide.Gas plays an important roleGas will be needed for longer than coal, given it can fire up quickly and fill gaps when wind and sun aren’t abundant. It won’t be used much, but will be an essential backup.The role of gas is changing, but the gas market has its own challenges. Governments are trying to address longstanding gas market problems. Late last year, the federal government flagged a mandatory east coastgas reservation scheme.Victoria at the pointy endThere are problems looming for Victoria, Australia’s most gas-dependent state. Bass Strait wells arerunning dryand most of Queensland and WA’s gas is exported as liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Victorian governmentrecently openedup new areas for gas exploration after previously rejecting the idea.Anew planby federal, state and territory energy ministers may see the Australian Energy Market Operator gain more power to intervene in the gas market, potentially through contracting for new infrastructure such as pipelines and import terminals.The state government is trying toshift away from gas, but it’s a slow process.The Victorian government has high hopes for offshore windfarms to take advantage of the stronger and more reliable winds whipping across Bass Strait. But progress towards the goal of 2 gigawatts by 2032 has been slow and no turbines have yet been installed.Some developers have withdrawn applications amidglobal uncertaintyand delays to the auction process. Last week, Victoriaannouncedthe process would finally begin in August. The question is whether there’s enough time left to replace retiring coal plants with new offshore wind.Yes, it’s progressIt wasn’t so long ago it was popular to claim Australia’s grid could never accommodate more than 20% renewables. Now we’re at 50%.That’s not to say it will be smooth sailing. The government’s goal of 82% renewables in four years looks to be a stretch. But it’s clear real progress is being made – and not a moment too soon.Tony Wood is the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute.

A closeup of that face, with its distinctive halo of dark hair, the lipstick-smeared pout and lush, overgrown eyebrows, is perhaps the most striking scene in her new filmThe Moment. Charli peels a strip of ugly stick-on gems from her lower lash line, regret and shame flashing across her face. It’s a rare raw few seconds in Aidan Zamiri’s clever and knowing satire of 21st-century pop stardom, which wonders what would have happened if the singer had lost her head after the success of her 2024 album Brat. The film is billed as a mockumentary, but its ambitionto be taken seriously is no joke.The Moment is already being positioned as Charli’s pivot from pop to the silver screen, after a buzzy premiere at the Sundance film festival last month. Charli was there to promote it, alongside two other films she’s starring in. I Want Your Sex, a dark romp of a comedy from new queer cinema pioneerGregg Arakiwas mostly warmly received, though early consensus has declared The Gallerist, which stars Natalie Portman,something of a dud.The real Charli probably wouldn't let a guy in prayer beads direct a documentary about herWhen Peter Ohs’sindie drama Erupcjapremiered at the Toronto film festival last year, the New Yorker praised the “classical canniness” of Charli’s onscreen presence, singling out her “energetic yet poised performance” as emotionally avoidant party girl Bethany. She has a small but significant role in this week’s new release100 Nights of Hero, Julia Jackman’s charming feminist fairytale, and will also appear on the soundtrack for Emerald Fennell’s adaptation ofWuthering Heights. According to IMDb, Charli the actor has roles in nine feature films and counting (other forthcoming ones include Dakota Johnson’s directorial debutA Tree Is Blue, and a remake of the 1978 mondo shockerFaces of Death). Why is she suddenly in everything, everywhere, apparently all at once?Other pop musicians intrigued by Hollywood tend to begin by dipping a toe in the water. A bit part in Christopher Nolan’s 2017 second world war drama Dunkirk proved Harry Styles could be compelling in closeup, but did not provide the training necessary for carrying a feature-length film. When he appeared in leading roles in two movies in 2022,Don’t Worry DarlingandMy Policeman, there was a sense of the singer breaking into a sprint before he had learned to walk. His performance in the former is particularly vacant and one-dimensional and his acting career seems to have since petered out.Charli’s approach to film may seem maximalist by comparison but, really, she’s starting small. As a pop star she commands the stage with main character energy, but on screen, at least so far, she seems quite happy in a supporting role. Her parts in The Gallerist, as the girlfriend of an art influencer, and as Mother Nature in Romain Gavras’s celebrity satire Sacrifice have been described as cameos. She is not top billed in I Want Your Sex either, although early reviews have praised her for playing against type – she stars as the prudish girlfriend of a young man drawn into an affair with a kinky performance artist twice his age.View image in fullscreenEffortlessly selling it … from left: Olivia D’Lima, Charli xcx and Kerena Jagpal in 100 Nights of Hero.Photograph: Vue Lumiere/PA100 Nights of Hero is set in a medieval fantasy world operating under strict patriarchal rule. Charli’s scenes are confined to a story within a story. As Rosa, she comes across as cute; unselfconscious, stripped of her usual vampy makeup and projecting a purity of spirit before she has even said a word. There is an unexpected softness to Rosa’s gestures, as when she runs a brush through her sister’s hair or lays her head on her father’s chest. A smiling storybook heroine forced to pretend she doesn’t know how to read is a million miles from Charli’s scowling, stomping, cigarette-smoking persona. But she sells it effortlessly.The Moment, in which she has her first proper leading role, takes that all-powerful pop persona and gamely attempts to skewer it. She takes the piss out of her hair, her brand deals and even her old songs. She is the star but also the butt of the joke. The actual Charli probably wouldn’t be talked into letting a guy who wears prayer beads direct her concert documentary because Kylie Jenner said it was a good idea.A hilarious (if not quite plausible) plotline featuring an ill-advised branded credit card is an example of the script’s typically tongue-in-cheek tone, but Charli’s performance as an artist under pressure is nuanced. At an event to promote the credit card, a fan enthusiastically tells Charli her music stopped him from killing himself. Charli looks stressed and caught off-guard, playing her reaction for real instead of for an easy laugh.View image in fullscreenCameo ... from left: Jenna Ortega, Natalie Portman, Cathy Yan and Charli xcx at The Gallerist premiere.Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty ImagesHer ability to manipulate her face is one of her greatest gifts as an actor. In Benito Skinner’s TV comedyOvercompensating, she mines it for comedy. Deadpan micro eye-rolls and an insincere close-mouthed smile are deployed as she plays a parody version of herself who begrudgingly performs at a college concert. “ARE YOU JO-KING?” she shouts at her hapless tour manager, exaggerating her vocal fry to brilliantly droll effect. During the concert, closeted college student Benny imagines a gleeful Charli leading the crowd in a humiliating chant. “Benny. Likes. Boys!” she yells, her eyes widening like a crazed and goofy demon.If these roles don’t necessarily showcase a huge range, they do reveal her canniness. So far, Charli has been drawn to independent films that are playful and in line with her tastes, and to directors with a strong point of view. A lot of musicians turned actors go wrong by assuming their charisma will automatically translate to a different medium, and shooting straight for “prestige” movies. Beyoncé’s stiff turns inDreamgirlsandCadillac Recordsare two classic examples of a star who exudes charm but hasn’t quite honed her on-screen craft.The right roles are as important as the right collaborators. In A Star is Born, Lady Gaga ascends from club singer to arena headliner, a story that dovetails satisfyingly with her own. In the trashyHouse of Gucci, she is somehow still plausible, though she couldn’t quite transcend the dourJoker: Folie à Deux. Elsewhere, Ariana Grande was a perfect fit for the peppy but fragile Glinda inWicked, and Tyler, the Creator’s natural exuberance was harnessed brilliantly by Josh Safdie inMarty Supreme. The musicians who are having success in the film world are the ones who seem as if they actually watch movies. Just look at A$AP Rocky, who recently gave two great performances in Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest and in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, the new film from Safdie brothers collaborator Mary Bronstein.View image in fullscreenAvoidant party girl ... in Erupcja, one of the films Charli is starring in.Photograph: Courtesy of TIFFCharli’s taste is her secret weapon. The singer’s love of movies has been well documented onher Letterboxd account, which went viral for its eclectic, cine-literate watchlist (Jacques Rivette’s fabulously surrealCeline and Julie Go Boatingremains in her top four films). In an interview on the Deeper Into Movies podcast, she told the host that watching films “is all I do, if I’m not partying or working”. Still, it’s one thing to be a fan of movies and another to make them.“I always prefer when the initial spark is coming from me and my fellow collaborators rather than … outsourcing,” Charli told Variety when asked how she chooses her roles. In 2014, Charli cast Rose McGowan, star of Araki’s The Doom Generation, in the music video forBreak the Rules, so it feels like a full-circle moment to see Charli landing a part in an Araki film.Many of the films she has lined up seem to have come directly via her social circle rather than from the brain of a clever casting director who knows her presence will generate buzz. Charli met Ohs through their mutual friend, the playwright Jeremy O Harris. Zamiri had directed several of Charli’s music videos before they decided to make The Moment together, and Skinner said he initially connected with her at a party.View image in fullscreenNext stop on the route to screen domination … Charli, far right, with the stars of the film at the Wuthering Heights premiere.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesInSacrifice, which received lukewarm reviews after its Toronto film festival premiere, she has a self-declared “tiny part” alongside her “baby brother”, the Swedish rapper Yung Lean. These smaller, low-stakes acting roles seem to be more about her having fun with her friends than shoring up her standing in Hollywood. My sense is that this attitude will take her far.The next stop on Charli’s route to screen domination is Fennell’sWuthering Heights. The divisive director of Promising Young Woman and Saltburn blends twisted humour with blunt, girl-boss feminism. Her glossy studio adaptation of the beloved Emily Brontë novel doesn’t, at least to my mind, seem like an obvious fit for Charli, but attaching herself to the project via its soundtrack makes sense. It allows Charli to flirt with Brontë’s brooding gothic aesthetic (and to ride the coattails of the film’s hype), while remaining safely adjacent to its director. The deft, even genius move suggests that Charli the movie star may turn out to be an auteur, rather than a vessel.The Moment is released in UK cinemas on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmCharli xcxWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellGregg ArakiMusic documentaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Throw the book away and step into the madness of undeniable chemistry and explosive toxic desire.”Veteran film writer Anne Thompsonpredictedthe film “will open well and soar at the box office”, calling it “a rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd pleaser. Both Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie will come out ahead. Audiences will fall for Emerald Fennell’s garish visuals and unrestrained direction. Everything is BIG.”Box office pundit Scott Mendelsonconcurred, saying that the film “rocks” and praising its “big-budget production value and cinematic style value we once took for granted” but also suggesting “it works on its own terms as a nuanced romantic tragedy”.A slight note of caution was voiced by Brandon Norwood, whocalledthe film “a tad too long” but said its stars are “explosive together. Their chemistry leaps off the screen.” “And yeah it’s hot,” he emphasises. “It’s horny.”Fennell’s film has already been met with some scepticism by Brontë purists for its anachronistic approach to costume design, apparent embrace of BDSM, and the casting of 35-year-old Robbie as the 19-year-old Cathy and the white Elordi as Heathcliff, a character generally understood to be of Romany origin.Fennell has defended her approach, saying: “There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it”, and emphasising that her adaptation is a personal take, and one among many.“The great thing about this movie is that it could be made every year and it would still be so moving and so interesting,” she said. “There are so many different takes. I think every year we should have a new one.”The film is released worldwide on 13 February.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

She enjoyed laughing at her own jokes, revelling in the misfortunes of others, and telling people off. If an event combined opportunities for all three activities, so much the better.When my father was six, he refused to eat the meatloaf that his mother had given him for lunch. Gisela took the piece of meatloaf, now rapidly turning rancid in the Zimbabwe afternoon heat, and served it to him for dinner, and breakfast, and every subsequent meal until he forced himself to eat it. It was the late 1950s – tyrannical parenting was de rigueur, and uneaten meatloaf was the hill that Gisela was willing to die on.Fast forward 30 years, and I am six years old, surveying the horror-movie tableau of my grandmother’s dinner table in Freiburg: the pungent pink slab ofFleischkäse, the trembling white sausages in a bowl of what appears to be lukewarm dishwater, the slimy cold herrings in pickle juice, the brick of black rye bread that takes 20 minutes to saw through and three days to digest. “I don’t want to eat anything on this table,” I announce to the room, and promptly retreat to the floor, crawling between the table legs to wait out this so-called dinner.My parents exchange a pained look and shrug in resignation. Gisela is apoplectic, channelling her rage towards my father for being a permissive weakling, but ultimately powerless to exert her will over the next generation. She exacts her revenge for the next two decades: every time we are in company, she recounts this story in detail, my food refusal getting wilder and her reaction more saintly with each retelling, as she works her way up to the punchline. “Then she sat under the table for the whole meal … LIKE A DOG!”View image in fullscreenIrreverent and transgressive … Kieran Culkin as Benji and Jesse Eisenberg as David in A Real Pain.Photograph: Courtesy of Searchlight PicturesAs I spent the last few years researching and drawing Gisela’s life story for my graphic memoir The Crystal Vase, I found these recollections of her gleeful humiliation tactics and self-aggrandising anecdotes slipping in to the gaps between the heavy facts ofHolocausthistory. Each generation relates to their family history differently, and as the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor I found I had a certain critical distance from that lived experience that my father did not have.In recent years, telling serious Jewish history through family comedy has become the dominant approach for third-generation survivors.A Real Paindirector Jesse Eisenberg summed it up as follows in a recent interview: “First generation builds the house. Second generation lives in the house. Third generation burns it down.” “A movie can simultaneously have great reverence for the history while also creating an irreverent and sometimes transgressive tone, because that’s the full and honest way I experience history,” he elaborated.The centuries-old tradition of self-deprecating Jewish humour was all but stamped out of German culture in the HolocaustNowhere is this tension more apparent than in the scene where the impulsive Benji (Kieran Culkin) persuades the rest of his Holocaust tour group to pose for photos as Polish fighters next to the Monument to the Heroes of Warsaw statue. His uptight cousin David (Eisenberg) protests, “Doesn’t that seem disrespectful?” as he is forced to be their official photographer, juggling everybody’s phones while they merrily reenact heroic moments from the Warsaw Uprising, imaginary guns blazing. David’s discomfort is played for laughs, while Benji’s allergy to the tour guide’s repetition of dry facts manifests as this disruptive urge to feel the history bodily, to welcome in the fun and allow it to sit with the pain.In fellow “grief tourism” tragicomedyTreasure, prickly Ruth (Lena Dunham) travels to Poland with her Auschwitz-survivor father, the exuberant Edek (Stephen Fry), to see where his family used to live. Their exasperated bickering undercuts many of the film’s more solemn moments. When Ruth finally manages to buy back her murdered grandmother’s tea set from the Poles who took over Edek’s apartment in 1940 after the family were deported, Edek is unimpressed. “You have no idea how much this means to me, Dad,” she tells him. “Before this we had nothing, nothing from your past.” “And now,” he deadpans, “you have a teapot.”View image in fullscreenBickering … Stephen Fry and Lena Dunham in Treasure.Photograph: Anne WilkElsewhere, writerJoe Dunthorne goes on a research trip to Munich with his mother in the 2025 book Children of Radium, a wry family memoir about his German-Jewish great-grandfather, a scientist who developed chemical weapons for the Nazis. Dunthorne and his mother (who he describes as a Birkenstock-wearing “cut-throat bastard”) stay in the same apartment rooms where his great-grandfather spent his wedding night. “I don’t think we gained much from this immersive research, eating bowls of our own overcooked spätzle while trying not to visualise the newlyweds going at it in the corner.”As the last generation to grow up around adult Holocaust survivors and hear their accounts first-hand, it is not surprising that we now have the impulse to record our grandparents’ stories for posterity, and reflect on how they affect us. But why are we choosing humour as our medium? Perhaps it is just our generation’s default mode of presentation, busily maintaining an ironic distance from difficult subjects. Are we so fragile that we need to use humour as a buffer, to make even the bleakest history cosy and palatable?The bare facts of my own grandmother’s story certainly don’t read like a comedy. Gisela escaped NaziGermanyin 1939 at the age of 18. Her family home in Bad Homburg had been destroyed on Kristallnacht, and her father was beaten, arrested, and taken to Buchenwald. He did not survive the war. Many other family members were trapped in Germany and eventually killed in the camps at Sobibór, Mauthausen and Theresienstadt.But Gisela went to Amsterdam – where several of her Frankfurt cousins were already living in exile, including her second cousins, Margot and Anne Frank – before sailing to South Africa. She took a train north, and ended up in the first place that would take her: Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. Her passport was confiscated when the war broke out, so she was stuck there. So began Gisela’s new life in colonial Africa. She married German-Jewish émigré Hans Goldschmidt, and had three sons.View image in fullscreenA detail from The Crystal Vase.Illustration: Astrid GoldsmithThey stayed in Bulawayo for almost four decades, until the political situation in 1970s Zimbabwe forced them to flee again. My grandparents returned to Germany in 1976 and settled in Freiburg, chosen for its strategic location close to the borders of two other countries: even in retirement, these lifelong refugees were keeping their options open.After their deaths, our family had to decide how to divide the remaining precious belongings that had been saved from the Nazis. My initial intention was to write a reverential book that honoured my grandmother, who was vivacious, elegant, and a great raconteur (as long as you were interested in stories about how incredible she was).But in the aftermath of her funeral, my family’s eccentricities rose violently to the surface and irrevocably coloured my experience. I took a fraught road trip acrossEuropewith my father to clear out Gisela’s flat and distribute her belongings to the rest of the family. My aunt deemed four-course lunches more of a priority than packing heirlooms, and my uncle smuggled the family silver across borders in his underwear. I brought Gisela’s collection of moth-infested Persian rugs into my pest-phobic sister’s house, and have never been forgiven. Family secrets were uncovered, everyone fought over heirlooms, we all fell out. In the end, an approach that embraced the humour alongside the tragedy felt like the only way to tell this story.View image in fullscreenInitial condemnation … Volumes I and II of Maus by Art Spiegelman.Photograph: sjbooks/AlamyMaking light of one of the darkest horrors of the 20th century is a risky business. Even Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer prize-winning Maus was initially met with condemnation in Israel due to the perception of comics as vulgar, funny and inappropriate. Spiegelman’s frustrations with his Auschwitz-survivor father are palpable throughout Maus, as he details their complicated relationship.By being one generation removed, my relationship with Gisela was different – I could be both amused and terrified at a safe distance. The centuries-old tradition of self-deprecating Jewish humour was all but stamped out of German culture in the Holocaust, and this new wave of Jewish diaspora stories is embracing it. Humour and solemnity can coexist while examining tragic events, and I found both helpful when dealing with the mixed bags passed down by survivors. Humour is not a buffer here, but a doorway: it allows access to a narrative. The third generation are taking ownership of our family histories, drawing our own conclusions, and making space for the humour of human foibles, even in our darkest stories.As for me, I await the eventual tell-all memoir of my own son, who we are raising vegetarian, in which he complains bitterly that his mother never fed him meatloaf.Astrid Goldsmith’sThe Crystal Vaseis published by Jonathan CapeExplore more on these topicsBooksComics and graphic novelsHolocaustSecond world warGermanyEuropeA Real PainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pair had separately hitchhiked to a gay bar, with fake IDs, in Sunset Beach, California. They connected, they danced and stepped outside for a kiss in the thick fog. “I was only 18 but I knew I had just met my soulmate,” says Ely.The pair remained a couple until 2015 when Taylor, who was nicknamed Spider, died from liver cancer. A new collection of Taylor’s music, Surge Studio Music – electronic pieces he composed for gay porn films – has just been released. “I was like: wait, there’s a fanbase for 80s gay porn music?” laughs Ely. “I had no idea. When Josh contacted me, I found the cassette tapes in a box in the back of the closet. They’d been there for ever.”Josh Cheon runs Dark Entries, a San Francisco-based record label that focuses on celebrating overlooked gay artists, including many who died from Aids-related illnesses, and releasing their lesser-known forays into the world of soundtracking gay porn. As well as Taylor’s Surge Studio Music material, there have been releases by the Hi-NRG and disco pioneer Patrick Cowley and the electro innovator Man Parrish, and the compilation Deep Entries: Gay Electronic Excursions 1979-1985, described as “10 tracks of obscure queer synth bliss”.“This had been on my docket since day one of the label,” Cheon says. “There were all these compilations of people doing rare Australian synth pop or Japanese new wave but I’m like: ‘What about gay? Where’s the gay voice in all of this? It’s all been erased, forgotten, lost to Aids or thrown out.’ So I’ve literally been working on this for 16 years trying to amplify this underground gay music scene.”The proceeds from many of the releases get donated to Aids charities but it’s also an opportunity to direct some money towards artists who maybe weren’t all that business savvy when they first took on the scoring work. “Man Parrish was like: oh, I think I got $50 and a blowjob,” laughs Cheon. “Which he then spent on drugs.”Working with queer film historian Elizabeth Purchell to track down and unearth old films and scores, Cheon has found a niche within a niche. “There is so much amazing stuff out there,” he says. “If I wanted to, I could switch to just being a gay porn soundtrack reissue label.” As if by magic, his phone rings to prove his point. “Oh my God, this is crazy,” Cheon beams after quickly taking the call. “It’s another gay porn soundtrack composer that everyone thought was dead. No one has talked to him in 30 years. I literally have goosebumps right now.”It was at a Los Angeles glory hole club, Basic Plumbing, where Taylor’s Surge Studio Music material was born. He was working at the club in the early 80s when he met Al Parker, who ran porn production company Surge Studios with Steve Scott – both of whom would die due to Aids-related illnesses – and began making soundtracks for their films. Previously, “Al and Steve really went out of their way, for the most part, to source original material for the music,” Cheon says. “But they also stole music from Brian Eno, B-52s and the Human League. They would cut up the Human League’s Being Boiled, loop it and slow it down, taking out the vocals to manipulate it as an instrumental. I guess today it would be called a cosmic or Balearic remix.”View image in fullscreenSurge Studios head Al Parker.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsTaylor’s film music has a similar vibe – slow, moody, textural, synthy – but despite its enduring appeal, Ely recalls it just being “a side job”, he says. “Neither one of us were really into porn. It was just something to earn as we were starving musicians.” Taylor was more known for his impressive guitar playing, with Eddie Van Halenreportedly sayinghe was the greatest guitar player he’d ever heard. Taylor and Ely were also in the post-punk outfit Red Wedding at the time (1981-85) which was made up entirely of openly gay men – a rarity in the scene.The pair had been living openly from the off, even when same-sex relationships were still illegal in California. “We were very bold and part of a wave of young gay couples living out in the open just a couple of years after Stonewall,” Ely recalls. It was not without its challenges however. “I pretty much lost my family,” Ely says. “We encountered a lot of hostility and a lot of really fucked things happened to us over the years.” He then tells me a harrowing story of their cat being stolen, killed and returned in a cardboard box with “faggots” written on it and a noose around the neck of their pet.But by the mid-80s, when these film scores were being recorded, they had a beautiful community of like-minded friends and were part of a thriving underground music scene. “Then Aids reared its ugly head,” recalls Ely. “One moment it was a little blip, something we heard was going on in San Francisco. The next thing friends of friends are dying, and then our friends are dying.” It was so traumatic that the pair ended up moving to Arizona and starting a new chapter away from bands and music. “We lost so many friends, and it did something to us,” Ely says. “We didn’t want to be in LA any more. There were too many ghosts. Everywhere we looked it reminded us of people that we loved that died these horrible deaths.”View image in fullscreenAlbum cover for the soundtrack to Turned On, a film by Al Parker, with music by Forbidden Overture AKA Man Parrish.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsAnother release the label has just put out is Fallen Angel by Brandy Dalton, a collection of soundtracks – spanning melodic electronica to squelchy electro via minimal industrial techno – to the award-winning series of porn films under the same name. Dalton, who died from an Aids-related illness in 2006, had his roots in the more extreme and experimental part of the gay community in LA. His band Drance, an industrial and EBM outfit, would play venues such as the legendary Club Fuck!, a home for the leather, tattoos and body piercing crowd.“It was absolutely wild,” says Dalton’s bandmate John Munt. “Drance was a very sexual band and we would have go-go dancers who were painted gold or accompany performance art pieces which would involve pretty extreme mutilation and mummification. I say it with affection, but we would always find out where all the freaks were and play there.”View image in fullscreen‘He carried on making music, but things got tough for him’ … Brandy Dalton.Photograph: Dark Entries RecordsWith so much of this type of music forgotten, or never released in the first place, it’s significant to have the work of these late artists being celebrated. “It’s so nice to have Brandy’s work out,” says Munt. “He carried on making music, but things got tough for him. Aids really ravaged him and he needed to use a lot of drugs for the extreme pain. I loved him as a really close friend, and it was hard to watch.”Similarly, for Ely this goes beyond just music for porn films. “It means a lot to me,” he says. “It celebrates Spider one more time. I’ll always be in awe of him, and I’ll always be in love with him. He was an incredible, gifted, loving person, and until the day I die I will keep talking about him. I want people to remember him. I want people to hear his music.

And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.Perfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.The earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of beingperceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.View image in fullscreenComedic and satirical … Consume Me.Photograph: HexecutableNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoymaking fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.Perfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.For a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.It is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone elseexperienced those same formative years.What to playView image in fullscreenAm I the baddie? … Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator.Illustration: SteamLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment.

And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’sitems in10 years’ time ...”Once upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.Digital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.Digital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. Andeverybodyhates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And where are the music stands?Wed 4 Feb 2026 09.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 10.42 ESTShareEvents in the United States of Trumpland continue to reveal staggering new dimensions to the possibilities of orchestral music. Trump’s announcement that his “Trump Kennedy Center” isto be shut for a refitis a brilliantly cynical way to stop the noise when artists try to cancel their appearances during the rest of his presidential tenure: it’s shut already!Biglylosers, all of you!But that’s not the new dawn for the artform I’m talking about. I mean the inspirational painting unveiled by the maestro of Trumpian kitsch, Jon McNaughton (and stamped with the presidential seal of approval – ie a post onTruth Social).Tucker Carlson is cheerleading on the cymbals and Elon Musk? He’s on electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral packMaga Symphonydepicts Trump as a conductor of the politicians and cultural figures who are Making the Orchestra Great Again. Who’s in this Maga fever dream of an orchestra? Marco Rubio leads the violins, JD Vance takes the cellos (Melania is relegated to the second desk), his sons and Roger Stone are on double basses, the foundation of the orchestra’s ideological soundworld. A bizarrely configured woodwind and brass lineup features four flutes and no oboes – mind you, there are no violas either, those shape-shifting probable Democrats! – plus Tom Homan on horn, with Tucker Carlson cheerleading on the cymbals. Where’s Elon Musk, you ask? On electric guitar, of course: the joker in the orchestral pack.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s Truth Social post showing the painting.Photograph: @realDonaldTrumpAs McNaughton describes this image, “you can feel it – the music is coming together – rising and stirring something deep inside … When Americans pull together and trust a shared vision, they create something strong, lasting, and bigger than any one person.”And that’s the cultural trope that this ludicrous image burnishes: the idea of the all-powerful conductor, inspiring total command and obedience from their musicians, which has been inspirational catnip for dictators from Hitler to Stalin to Mussolini. As Elias Canetti wrote in his bookCrowds and Power: “There is no more obvious expression of power than the performance of a conductor … He has the power of life and death over the voices of the instruments.”Orchestras can represent an ideal society – if, that is, you’re a wannabe despot. Imagine: one hundred musicians, working in perfect togetherness to realise your vision, with no possibility of dissent, criticism or disagreement. Every tiny movement of your arms and facial expressions is magicked through the force of pure will into the sounds of your deepest desires. Which self-respecting autocrat wouldn’t want that kind of social control?McNaughton’s Maga orchestra takes the idea a stage further. There are no music stands in front of the players – they are performing through Trumpian telepathy, a connection as mystical as it’s musical. It’s not so much a Maga symphony as a political seance turned into sound.This concept of the orchestra didn’t only take hold of the fevered imaginations of dictators in the 1930s and presidents in the 2020s. Words such as McNaughton’s are routinely used in less obviously politically inflamed contexts to describe the potential social good that orchestras can do, from apologists for Venezuela’s El Sistema – its “system” of music education, and its satellites all over the world – to many leaders of orchestral culture here in the UK. If society worked more like orchestras, the story goes, our lives would all be better, because in orchestras everyone’s giving up their individuality for the greater good.An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collectiveBut that’s a deeply problematic idea, because orchestras never work in absolute harmony. An orchestra is created through the tensions between the individual wills of the players and their contribution to the collective. The best orchestras do not function like well-oiled machines, drilled to the finest margins of unanimity. Instead, they’re models of a controlled chaos of human emotions, desires and virtuosities that are held in tension, balance and friction in the moment of performance. They’re made from the transfigured experience of listening to each other. When orchestras really fly, the conductor isn’t an all-powerful musical despot, instead, he or she is an inspirer of a dynamic culture in which everyone responds to where the musical discourse is going, recognising when they’ve got the tune or the accompaniment, creating a permanent state of flux, volatility, and creative negotiation.The Trump image is comic, and troubling, because it reinstates the idea of the relationship between conductors and orchestras as populist shorthands for autocracy and demagoguery. No doubt the Association of British Orchestras’ annual conference,convening in London this week, will inspire a more genuinely collective vision for the future of the orchestra in this country. Or maybe an enterprisingly craven orchestra will sign up Trump as their next music director. Stranger things have happened. And probably will by next week.This week Tom has been listening to:Kevin Puts’s Emily: No Prisoner Be, Joyce DiDonato’s collaboration with Time for Three. It is communicative and urgently powerful in recording and performance.

Did her mother’s howl of distress need to be broadcast?Lucy ManganWed 4 Feb 2026 03.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 4 Feb 2026 11.24 ESTShareThe Investigation of Lucy Letby is at least the fifth documentary that has been produced in the wake of the neonatal nurse’s convictions in 2023 and 2024 on seven counts of murder and seven of attempted murder of babies in her care at the Countess of Chester hospital. Probably the best of them was ITV’sLucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt?last summer. It did a fine job of meticulously explaining the evidence against her – and why a growing body of experts believe that at the very least her conviction on the basis of what was gathered is unsafe, and at most that none of the babies were murdered by her, but were victims of a chronically understaffed and mismanaged unit that might have sought to scapegoat an individual for its failings.The Investigation ofLucy Letbydoes not compare in its attention to detail, preferring a broader-brush, more emotive telling of the story of either one of the most prolific female serial killers in history or one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in recent times. Its publicity has made much of the fact that it contains hitherto unseen footage of Letby’s arrest at her parents’ home. Her mother and father say they were unaware that it would be shown until Letby’s barrister told them. “We will not watch it – it would likely kill us if we did.” When the footage is shown, you can hear her mother howl in distress as the police take Letby away. It is an almost inhuman sound. It is hard to say what value such an inclusion adds except to warn the viewer to brace themselves for sensationalism along the way as the case is pieced together using accounts from the police, people – from both sides – directly involved with the case, Letby’s best friend Maisie and Letby’s current lawyer (not the one who represented her in court), Mark McDonald, along with media reporting from the time and tapes of her interviews with investigators.The first hour of the 90-minute programme lays out the police and prosecution’s case. It includes the spike in infant deaths and catastrophic collapses between 2015 and 2016, the correlation between their occurrence and Letby’s presence on the unit and the fact that they stopped happening when she was removed from the unit. There is also the matter of the 250-patient handover sheets – confidential documents – brought home from work and filed in date order in a box marked “Keep”, plus the Post-it notes found during a police search of her home. On the latter Letby had written “I am evil”, “I did this” and other such apparently conclusively damning phrases. The expert witness brought in by police and who testified at the trial, retired paediatrician Dewi Evans, asserted that certain symptoms in the babies could only point to deliberate attempts to harm, often by inducing air embolisms in the babies.The last half-hour is spent with McDonald and Dr Shoo Lee pulling apart most (not all – we do not get an explanation of the handover sheets, which Letby says she accidentally brought home then couldn’t properly dispose of, despite a shredder being found in the house) of the evidence. McDonald notes that the trial judge was, in a very unusual move, emailed by a court of appeal judge during the trial to state “in robust terms” the latter’s concerns that Evans might be a witness whose evidence could be tailored as needed. The Post-it notes were written on the advice of the therapist provided by the NHS to Letby after the spike in infant deaths. According to Letby at her police interview, they were a product of her terrible fear that “I might have hurt them without knowing, through my practice”. They also contain such phrases as “slander”, “discrimination”, “victimisation”, born of the feeling that the unit – which Maisie says had always been “cliquey” – was using her to distract from systemic failures. The drop in mortality rates when Letby left can be attributed to the fact that the unit was downgraded at the same time and started treating fewer sick children.McDonald (who became involved with the case only after Letby’s convictions) contacted Lee, the author of the paper from which Evans had drawn most of his conclusions, and Lee said they were mistaken and convened a panel of independent experts to go through the clinical notes, finding alternative explanations for all the prosecution’s theories and therefore, as he said to an assembled press, “no murders”.The film includes contributions from the anonymised mother of one of the babies, which are of course heartbreaking. But it is a weighty decision to include them. They are there to make good television for the producers, pull in viewers and tug on their emotions and even if this is not the intention, they run emotional interference between them and a rational appraisal of the facts. Which, even on this partial telling, surely need revisiting in a court of law. Reports are with the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Its decision is expected in autumn. Everyone’s suffering continues.The Investigation of Lucy Letby is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLucy LetbyreviewsShareReuse this content"

They’re poor. They’re unpopular. Their families are a wasteland. But they have each other and their great shared passion: trad rock climbing. Whenever they can, they head to a climbing route – sometimes a boulder at the edge of a disused parking lot, sometimes a cliff an hour’s hike into a national park – and climb, often with no gear but their bloodied bare hands and tattered shoes.This is the premise of Crux, the second novel from Gabriel Tallent, the author of the critically acclaimedMy Absolute Darling. At its heart, it’s a sports novel, and Tallent’s prose here is precise and often exquisite, inching through a few seconds of movement in a way that reflects the unforgiving nature of climbing. We get a lot of closeups of granite and faint half-moons in rock that suddenly become “the world’s numinous edge”. The language of climbing – a dialect of brainy dirtbags – is a gift to the writer. Tallent’s characters talk about “flashing bouldering problems” and “sending Fingerbang Princess”; a list of routes with “Poodle” in the title includes Poodle Smasher, Astropoodle, Poodle-Oids from the Deep, A Farewell to Poodles, and For Whom the Poodle Tolls. Tallent also has an extraordinary gift for descriptions of landscape; a road is“overhung with stooping desert lilies, tarantulas braving the tarmac in paces, running full out upon their knuckly shadows, the headlights smoking with windblown sand”.Crux is a book that wanders from majesty to mediocrity, with occasional spills into outright bathosAnother pleasure of the book is Tamma, a snaggletoothed, dirty, foul-mouthed, acne-ridden, big-hearted, joyful urchin, who expresses her life’s dream as: “I want to climb hard and dangerous routes that make you shit your pants! I want to live in caves and eat dog food!” When a doctor tries to prescribe Tamma birth control, she finds increasingly baroque and allusive ways of telling him she’s gay,until she’s saying: “Will these help me if I exhume the body of Mary Wollstonecraft from her cold, worm-ridden grave and bring her back to life with a lightning strike and the two of us have undead lesbian sex while wearing full-body latex catsuits?” She’s persecuted by mean adults, who demonise her as a stupid white-trash burnout – somewhat improbably, given her quick wit, charm and negligible drug use. As all this suggests, she’s a little too good to be true: sophisticated beyond her years; hotheaded and sensitive, but never unkind or needy. She’s a manic pixie dream girl, in short, always climbing into Dan’s bedroom window “grinning from molar to molar”. Still, even at her most implausible, she has unstoppable charisma.Dan, however, never comes into focus. The fundamental problem is that his plot stakes aren’t convincing. He’s a straight-A student, depressed for as long as he can remember, whose coming-of-age conflict is a choice between becoming a climber (the only thing with meaning for him) and going to college (which his parents, who never got an education, desperately want him to do). It’s hard for the reader to get emotionally involved in this, though, since clearly he could go to collegeandbe a climber. It might be a compromise, but it’s an obvious one that feels like a pretty sweet deal. So it becomes incredibly frustrating that Dan never considers it, instead spending page after page agonising over his either/or decision.Dan’s mother, Alexandra, is an equally unsatisfying character. In her teens, as an unhoused high school dropout working as a diner waitress, she wrote a 900-page bestselling literary novel in eight months. (Tallent delivers this information by having Dan look his mother up on Wikipedia.) Now ill and even more depressed than Dan, she’s given up writing and only leaves her room to deliver self-pitying monologues to her son. “I understood something, then. Lying there in that hospital bed … the truth was that people are nothing to one another and the world in which they live is finally meaningless and empty.” He listens in martyred silence while having equally dramatic thoughts: “Dan could see it, that she was a great artist, hard done by the world, and the keenness with which she felt it, and the hostility with which she now spoke, was apiece with her genius.” There are pages of this stuff, and all it really serves to do is nudge Dan back and forth in his choice between college and climbing.Crux is a book that wanders from majesty to mediocrity, with occasional spills into outright bathos. For many readers, the great sports writing and lovable heroine will make its flaws irrelevant. But anyone who can’t get past B-movie plotting should sit this one out.Crux by Gabriel Tallent is published by Fig Tree (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Each had wings and four faces: that of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle.Similarly, a creature called Buraq, something between a mule and a donkey with wings and a human face, was said to have carried the prophet Muhammad on his journeys; while the ancient Greeks gave us the centaur, the mythical human-horse hybrid recently rebooted by JK Rowling in the Harry Potter books.“The impulse to blend the anatomical traits of other species with those of humans appears to be hardwired into our imagination,” notes Adrian Woolfson in his intriguing and disturbing analysis of a biological revolution he believes is about to sweep the planet. Very soon, we will not only dream up imaginary animals – we will turn them into biological reality.According to this forecast, species shaped by billions of years of natural selection will soon have to share their world with artificial versions designed and constructed by humans, with dramatic consequences. “Synthetic species could be harnessed to produce biofuels, medicines, biosensors, drought-resistant crops and countless other innovations,” he writes. “We may grow houses rather than build them.”This is the stuff of science fiction. Nevertheless, London-born and Oxbridge-educated Woolfson – founder of the San Diego genetics company Genyro and author of two previous popular science books – is adamant that the nature of life on Earth is about to be transformed. He styles his book as a wake-up call. We are facing “a second Genesis” that could bring great benefits but also have profoundly grim, unsettling consequences.So what has happened in recent years to bring us to the edge of such a revolution? How exactly will it manifest? And how can the upsides be maximised and the dangers minimised?In answer to the first question, Woolfson points to two key inventions. The first involves technologies, such as the Sidewinder method developed at Caltech, that can build DNA fragments “of unprecedented size and complexity, rapidly and efficiently”. Entire genomes can now be synthesised in record times. The second comes courtesy of artificial intelligence, which has helped scientists solve previously intractable scientific problems, in particular those concerning the shapes of proteins.Proteins are the building blocks of life. They make up our hair, bone, skin and muscle and are constructed of folded sequences of amino acids. Scientists knew how to create one-dimensional chains but were unable to predict how the resulting strings of amino acids would fold up to form three-dimensional proteins, whose shape determines their function. This greatly restrained their ability to generate new proteins.Then, in 2020, AlphaFold2, drawing on neural-network technology also used in systems like ChatGPT, cracked the folding code. The structures of complex proteins can now be predicted with confidence, and as a result we are able to create novel ones for use in medicine or elsewhere.How will creatures crafted through billions of years of natural selection exist in a world populated by synthetic newcomers?And if we can make new proteins, we can also contemplate bringing into being new forms of life, writes Woolfson. “Biology now stands at the threshold of transitioning from a largely descriptive science into a generative one. In the future, we won’t just catalogue species, we will create them.”It is not hard to imagine that problems might occur when this happens. How will creatures that have been shaped by evolution over aeons exist in a world that also includes synthetic newcomers? Will the latter have the same legitimacy as natural species? Woolfson thinks not, but warns that the distinction between natural and artificial life forms will become increasingly blurred.There might also be opportunities to improve existing Earthly creatures. We are the end products of the haphazard forces of heredity, chance and natural selection – and bear the scars. Take the human spine. “It’s a design disaster,” writes Woolfson, who points out that it evolved in a quadruped and is hopelessly ill-suited for an animal that walks on two legs. So could we now improve it? Why not? Life could be “guided into uncharted landscapes, endowed with entirely new properties that would reinvent the way organisms function”.Woolfson’s descriptions can become overelaborate and laboured. He has a tendency to exaggerate the impact of the so-called second Genesis. But his arguments are compelling and his prose generally clear and straightforward.Of course, many aspects of the coming biological revolution look far less rosy or comforting, and Woolfson catalogues these pitfalls too. Arsenals of human-made pathogens could be assembled with ease by bioterrorists. As benchtop DNA synthesisers and AI tools become ever more accessible, it will become harder to keep track of what is being created and by whom.Fiddling with bacteriophages – viruses that infect bacteria – could inadvertently destabilise the ocean’s carbon cycle and accelerate climate change. And then there are the ethical consequences of humans tinkering more and more with mammal genomes – for example, to make mice more humanlike and therefore better models on which to test drugs. But where do you stop? Could we end up with half-human hybrids worthy of Ezekiel?Woolfson thinks not, and insists we are compelled to proceed. Though he backs a ban on designer babies and parentless humans, he argues that a moratorium on AI-led genomics research simply would not work, while the benefits for humanity, the planet and for the animal kingdom are simply too great to contemplate applying brakes to the science. In this, he is probably too complacent about the dangers that lie ahead. The risks of unintended consequences appear all too real.On the Future of Species: Authoring Life by Means of Artificial Biological Intelligence Hardcover by Adrian Woolfson is published by Bloomsbury (£25).

After 46 years, The Stunt Man looks in some ways like a B-side toLawrence of Arabia, about a possibly, definitely crazy person whose innate gift for leadership is going to endanger the troops much more than himself.It’s a high-concept satire of … what, exactly? Of the movie business with all its hubris and conceit? Yes, it’s perhaps also an anti-war satire – although it’s more a satire of cinema’s inability to be anti-war when the movies have a vested interest in making war look exciting. But the black comedy and the raucousness are interleaved with weird, fierce stabs of extended seriousness and even anguish.O’Toole plays Eli, the imperious director in charge of a spectacular first world war action drama with exploding planes and the like, megalomaniacally swooping around in his helicopter and sometimes perched on the camera crane from which he will descend, godlike, to issue orders and vinegary putdowns. He is over budget, over schedule and overstretched; reckless, irresponsible, cutting corners on safety.When his stunt man drowns driving a car off a bridge into a river, Eli looks for a way of covering up the incident so that he won’t be charged with manslaughter. His prayers are answered by Cameron (Steve Railsback), a troubled Vietnam vet on the run from the police who blunders on to the set and eagerly accepts a job as the replacement stunt man, assuming the deceased’s identity. Cameron’s natural desperation makes him fearless and a natural for stunt work – and droll, capricious Eli decides he is amused by him, and knows he can ask him to do anything and poor Cameron can’t complain. Things are complicated when Cameron falls in love with the film’s leading lady Nina (Barbara Hershey), who has unfinished emotional business with the director himself.In some ways, The Stunt Man is about a blurring of fact and fiction; for this dysfunctional film family with a maniac like O’Toole as its head, it really is life during wartime. Sequences of film-making chaos cut straight in and out of fictional melodrama. But what is so striking about The Stunt Man are those moments which really do look like documentary realism. O’Toole’s Eli presides over a long, boozy dinner (or is it lunch?) with the cast and crew in the middle of filming in the way you could in those days. And when the first AD presumes to call “cut” in the middle of a scene because there is only 33 feet of film left, Eli screams at him with authentic rage.It’s all leading to a strange escapade for Cameron and Nina who feel that they are imprisoned by Eli, though Cameron’s very extended speech to Nina about what he did to get in trouble with the law and how he feels about her is a bit indulgent. Yet they add to the film’s cynical, salty flavour – plus the rooftop stunts really do look very dangerous.The Stunt Man is in UK cinemas from 6 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsThrillersRomance filmsPeter O'ToolereviewsShareReuse this content"

This assembly is a case in point. Cinematic jack of all trades Josh Frank, who has worked as a writer, producer, director and composer and now runs the Blue Starlite Mini-Urban Drive-In Movie Theatre in Austin, Texas, has packaged together Buster Keaton’s immortal 1924 comedy Sherlock Jr with some tracks from REM’s mid-1990s albums Monster and New Adventures in Hi-Fi. It’s all part of Frank’s ongoing Silents Synced project, whichearlier mashed together the 1922 OG version of Nosferatu with Radiohead.Since Sherlock Jr is only about 45 minutes long, Frank has thrown in Keaton’s 22-minute two-reeler The Balloonatic, with a techno soundtrack by Brazilian composer Amon Tobin. Neither musical choice particularly enhances the films they accompany, or even feels suited to the stories, but neither is especially offensive. The whole point of Silents Synced, presumably, is to lure people into cinemas to experience the films, turning viewers on to some of cinema’s finest silent-era auteurs and a few rock dinosaurs as well. It’s not the most original idea of all time, but presumably some real legal artistry went into clearing the rights so this could tour cinemas around the world.In addition, a little bit of jiggery pokery has been applied to the films, such as colourising objects on screen and adding effects. It’s debatable whether Keaton himself would have approved of these additions, but as much as his reputation rests on his astonishing stunt work, shown off well in both films here, he clearly liked messing around with what could be done with in-camera effects, as seen in the fantastic sequence where he falls through a variety of landscapes thanks to the magic of editing. This packaging offers a nice opportunity to appreciate how groundbreaking Sherlock Jr was for its time, as Keaton’s schlubby projectionist falls asleep at work and dreams himself into the film he’s screening: a work of cinema that’s about cinema, meta before that was even a standalone adjective.REM x Buster Keaton’s Sherlock Jr is in UK cinemas from 5 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsREMBuster KeatonComedySilent filmreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is essentially a collection of Halloween-themed shorts, and while they’re billed as “found footage” in keeping with the conceit of the original, the idea that you’re watching found footage has been more or less worn away to a nub at this point. The series would in all honesty be better off ditching that element, and simply leaning into the broader idea of a regular horror anthology of unsettling short films.Among the highlights is a riotous and disgusting chapter called Fun Size, made with grisly flair by Casper Kelly, whose viral masterpiece Too Many Cooks took the internet by storm in 2014 and whose feature filmBuddyjust premiered at Sundance. Fun Size sees a group of young adults stumble into what might best be described as a wrongness zone where they’re pitted against a villain who comes on like the vicious kid brother of the Ghostbusters Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.Less silly and more shocking is Alex Ross Perry’s Kidprint, whose everyday villain hides in plain sight at the opposite end of the spectrum from the flamboyant Pennywise or Freddy Krueger-type child-killers. It’s fair to say that even the less effective chapters all have something going for them, but with the overall run time hitting nearly two hours, a little bit of judicious editing could have kept things zipping along with losing anything.In franchise tradition, there’s also a wrap-around section, Diet Phantasma, to which we return after each section, and which closes out the film; it’s probably the funniest material here, playing out like The Fast Show meets Re-Animator. Conceived by director Bryan M Ferguson, it sees a bunch of amoral scientists attempt to finesse the recipe for a haunted soda, and it is completely absurd, in the most charming way possible.V/H/S/Halloween is on digital platforms from 9 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsShort filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

San Francisco-resident André Ricciardi – a constantly wisecracking former advertising executive, a semi-reformed hard-living hedonist, and father of two teenage girls and loving husband to wife Janice – was only in his early 50s when he realised that he’d made a big mistake when he passed up the chance to have a colonoscopy test with his best friend, Lee Einhorn. Because only a year or so on from when he would have had that colonoscopy, he found out that he has stage four colon cancer which had it been spotted earlier might have been more treatable. Damn.With assistance from director Tony Benna and a film crew, Ricciardi goes on a mission to create, among other goals, an unconventional public service announcement in the form of this film to persuade (American) viewers not to be idiots like him and get colonoscopies whenever possible after the age of 45. (In the UK, the procedure isn’t automatically offered by the NHS, although home faecal immunochemical tests are recommended every couple of years after a certain age.) At one point, Ricciardi even hooks up with his colleagues at his old advertising agency to advise on a witty PSA campaign using fruit and other everyday objects with vaguely anus-shaped orifices to raise awareness.But most of the film consists of Ricciardi fighting against the dying of the light, recounting the discomfort of recovering from chemo (years of hangovers proved useful training, he says), the ridiculous indignities of radiotherapy and other treatments, weird side-effects such as eyelashes growing longer than usual, inept bedside manners from medical professionals, and the administrative screw-ups that punctuate the process. A natural funnyman, Ricciardi is well aware he uses humour as a defence. The film follows suit, even going so far as to create jocular little stop-motion animated sequences showing a mini-André in all his hirsute glory, dressed in sneakers and a hospital gown, enduring assorted treatments.‘It was a little scary at times’: the hilarious, heartbreaking film about one man’s riotous deathRead moreBut as Ricciardi comes closer to the end he opens up on camera about feelings of grief, rage and sadness. Indeed, the therapist encourages him to “be generous and let [his daughters] feel sad”, and reminds him that he doesn’t have to make them laugh all the time. There’s nothing radical or groundbreaking about either that message or the film-making on show here, but Ricciardi and Janice’s honesty and indeed that of all those around him, prove to be very moving in the long run, underscoring that there’s as many ways to face death as there are to live life.André Is an Idiot is out on 6 February in the UK and on 6 March in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCancerHealthA24reviewsShareReuse this content"

Opening with a lengthy fugue, it sprawls across seven movements – although one lasts only 11 bars and several run straight into each other. Moods shift quixotically. Motifs are obsessively repeated and developed. Beethoven supposedly considered it his finest quartet, but two centuries later this remains a work that asks a lot of its listener as well as its performers.No surprise, then, that the Berlin-based Leonkoro Quartet programmed this particular monument for their latest Wigmore Hall appearance since being shot to prominence with multiple wins in the 2022Wigmore Hall International String Quartet competition. It’s an intensely serious statement of ambition from a group whose newest member was born in 2006 and who have recently garneredrave reviewsfor their second album.There was much to be impressed by: the deep, cool incisions of the opening’s fugal subject, the absolute limpidity of texture in the densest passages, the unanimous, chattering pianissimos that seemed to emerge from a single 16-stringed instrument. Details were vivid – from no-frills trills to surgically precise bowing and occasional, anarchically gauche pizzicato – and the tone quality gleamed throughout.Yet the drawback of polishing each bar or fragment to a high shine is that it dodges this work’s weirdness, straightening out its meandering rather than shaping it into a larger narrative. The last movement’s final chords consequently landed with a bump, lacking a sense of inevitable, hard-earned closure. The decision to play a Haydn minuet encore was also telling. Another virtuosic switch from musicians with energy to burn – but, for the listener, not unlike being served another starter at the end of a substantial meal.The first half was ultra-Romantic. Webern’s early Langsamer Satz (all exquisite sotto voce yearning) was followed by a deliciously overwrought take onFelix Mendelssohn’s String Quartet No 2 in A minor Op 13: fast vibrato, huge collective breaths into voluptuous phrases, the players hurling themselves into the tumult as soloistic equals. This was an intoxicating, vital performance – and the Leonkoros are surely stars in the making.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s the outsiders photographed by Diane Arbus, the revelatory motion studies of the human body made byEadweard Muybridge, views of remote Indigenous communities taken by the Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide, or in-your-face shots of heated competition from the sports photographer Walter Iooss, photographs can wow us with transformational dispatches from the fringes of the human condition.Artist Sarah Sze: ‘A work of art is finished when everything teeters’Read moreAll four of those photographers, plus about three dozen more, can be seen at thePhoenixArt Museum’s captivating new show Muscle Memory. It aims to delve into the question of how our human bodies can at once be the focus of so much of our awareness while also being something we frequently ignore.“I was thinking about our bodies as these sites of real contradiction,” said show curator Emilia Mickevicius via video interview. “Sites of pleasure and pain, strength and vulnerability. I was really looking for work where the photographer was grappling with the condition of embodiment, what it feels like to be in a body and move through the world.”View image in fullscreenWalter Iooss – Michael Jordan.Photograph: Center for Creative Photography, University of ArizonaThe results of Mickevicius’s search include a photo of the NBA legends Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley facing off for a rebound, a portrait of a Muxe person known as Magnolia from the Zapotec city of Juchitán, Iranians disappeared by their own government, and basic parts of life such as ageing, death and pregnancy. On a purely visual level, Muscle Memory comes across as a true bounty, as eye-catching an array of photos as you’ll see anywhere.One of the ways Muscle Memory fulfils Mickevicius’s goal to depict embodiment is through moments of remarkable physical exertion. Synchronizing his lens with a strobe light, Harold Edgerton captured the brute force of a tennis serve at 1/1,000th-second intervals – his work Tennis Serve offers a view of a familiar action that renders it both recognizable and utterly new.Edgerton’s innumerable, ghostly repetitions of a singular tennis racket smacks a reader in the face with the blunt force of a masterful strike, forcing audiences to pick up a new visual language when viewing his photo. “It’s funny to think about how, until shutter speeds got fast enough, people literally couldn’t access that with their eyes,” said Mickevicius. “These technologies mandate new interpretive equipment on the part of the viewer.”View image in fullscreenClaire A Warden – Genetics from the series Mimesis.Photograph: Claire A. WardenAnother image that mandates viewers upgrade their eyeballs comes with Claire Warden’s “camera-less” photography, which literally brings her body into contact with film. No 15 (Genetics), from her Mimesis series, shows her fingerprint, which she has etched into the film emulsion by way of her own saliva. “You have an image of her fingerprint that’s imbued with her own DNA,” said Mickevicius.Warden chose to make the atypical “self-portrait” after repeatedly being confronted with the impolite question “what are you?” due to her mixed ancestry. “She turned to camera-less photography to make these images that are so full of information, but that refuse clarity or legibility,” said Mickevicius.Other photos in Muscle Memory come off as more akin to performance art. William Camargo’s As Far as I Can Get series sees the photographer setting his shutter release for 10 seconds, then dashing as fast as he can away from the camera. A homage to the initial idea of conceptual artist John Divola, and instigated by the racially motivated murder of Ahmaud Arbery, Camargo has taken such photos in a variety of locations.“Camargo is bringing his own lived experience as a brown person and what it means to run through the urban environment,” said Mickevicius. “It’s this idea of: ‘I can’t run down an alley as a brown person and have it be read in the same way as you can.’”View image in fullscreenRosalind Fox Solomon – New York, New York, 1986.Photograph: University of Arizona: Rosalind Solomon ArchiveBody modification is also a big theme of Muscle Memory, be it in the many photos of tattooed individuals, George Dureau’s photograph Wilbert With Hook, which shows a man whose left arm has been replaced with a prosthetic with a hook for a hand, Brian Weil’s untitled snap of a bodybuilder, Rosalind Fox Solomon’s photos of her own ageing body, or Lauren Greenfield’s moving photo of three teenage girls holding one another at a friend’s 16th birthday party.“She photographs teenagers and young women and thinks about issues around body image and beauty standards for the Y2K-era girl culture,” said Mickevicius. “It’s something I can certainly relate to, having grown up in that time, and I’m certainly grateful that Greenfield is facing how corrosive those standards can be to our culture.”Part of the challenge to a show like Muscle Memory is the potential for exploitation of often vulnerable subjects who do not get a chance to speak for themselves. Photos like those taken by Arbus or Iturbide, for instance, run the risk of exoticizing their subjects, exhibiting them to audiences as items to be gazed at without the proper context to really understand their humanity.View image in fullscreenDan Young – My Mother’s Hand on My Father’s Head, 1992.Photograph: Dan YoungThis was an aspect of Muscle Memory that Mickevicius did not take lightly, and her hope for the show is that audiences will be able to experience the exhibition as a space in which to have authentic moments of empathy. “I want to believe we can still learn things about fellow human beings by looking at pictures of them,” Mickevicius said. “Why do we look at certain pictures and decide on their behalf that they should be ashamed of who they are? There’s no better place than a museum to consider questions like that.”In addition to being portals into empathy, photographs provide the opportunity to see the traces of a life lived fully. Highlighting the “memory” in Muscle Memory, the photos in this show reflect not just the decisive moment in which they were snapped but also the entirety of a lifetime that has brought a subject right to the instant. Gaze into these images long enough, and you can become engulfed. “To be human is to endure suffering, you can’t escape life without going through that,” said Mickevicius. “I’m thinking about bodies as being pretty big teachers in this life. Our bodies bear traces of everything we’ve endured, they’re these sites where we come up against these limits of what we can do.”Muscle Memory: Lens on the Body is on display at the Phoenix Art Museum until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographyDiane ArbusExhibitionsArtEadweard MuybridgePhoenixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My Egyptian parents were chomping through a bag of dried pumpkin seeds when the assault on our eyeballs took place.The place that stayed with me: after a treacherous route through open desert, at Mina Mina I saw holinessRead moreMuscle bears in backless chaps, shirtless lifesavers in tiny budgie smugglers, chunky women with buzzcuts and saucer-plate nipples revving their Harley-Davidsons down the strip. It was too much for my father, who announced: “Atstaghfurallah: they should not show such things.” Mum just sucked her teeth in dismay. But the sight of all the handsome, gleaming men sent a hot flush of excitement up my 12-year-old cheeks.For the next 20 years, deep in my closet of internalised homophobia, I would struggle with these competing forces of faith, family and community, in silence. Early on, I promised myself I would never be gay likethat, never be so unashamed as those men on the screen. I would be dignified, respectful. A working gay in a collared shirt and sensible trousers. When I landed in Tokyo with my boyfriend for our first overseas holiday last year, I was still dogged by this lingering sense of caution.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningI had often heard that in Japanese culture physical affection is kept to the privacy of the home, and never for public display. With the diligence of a teacher’s pet, I was excessively careful to observe the cultural norms I had read about online. Our first night in Tokyo was tense.View image in fullscreen‘Under the twinkly lights of the disco ball, my boyfriend looked even more handsome’I reprimanded my boyfriend for eating his onigiri open-mouthed on the street; for talking too loudly on the Ginza subway line; and taking “too long” to get ready for the gay bar which, to my surprise, did not close at midnight as advertised. He was not surprised at all, just tired of my demanding itinerary and anal-retentiveness.When we got to Kingdom Tokyo, a club planted firmly in the gay district of Shinjuku, I was even more surprised. We were greeted by a muscular Japanese stripper in a jockstrap and a cute American bartender in a tight-fitting shirt who asked us what we’d like to drink. I began to release my inhibitions. Pretty soon, we had formed a circle of new friends: a San-Franciscan who flew to Tokyo “just for the weekend”, a Japanese flight attendant-in-training who had recently broken up with her lowlife boyfriend, and a Filipino lifestyle influencer who half-slurred Nicki Minaj lyrics all night. We were a motley crew.Under the twinkly lights of the disco ball, my boyfriend looked even more handsome than those men on Oxford Street I’d seen as a child. He drew me close, gyrating against me. He spun me around and then joined me up on the stage, where, half-drunk with vodka Cokes, we performed the entirety of Kylie’s Tension album in a unified dance with local drag queens.The next day, hungover, we made our way to see Mount Fuji. Japan is a country of complex transport systems: train lines are often privately owned, and with so many options, we were quickly overwhelmed.My head was throbbing and my heart was beating hard in my chest. Remembering the joys of the night before, I breathed deep, a few times in and out. With the comforting touch of my boyfriend’s hand on my arm, we found a friendly attendant who showed us where to board the right bus.View image in fullscreen‘We marvelled at the rise of Mount Fuji’s long, sheer slope, leading up to a little hat of clouds’A few hours later at the top of a panoramic ropeway, we marvelled at the rise of Mount Fuji’s long, sheer slope, leading up to a little hat of clouds, white against her grey peak. Visible for only 80 days of the year, we felt lucky, chosen, to see her. We made a promise at a nearby shrine to return.View image in fullscreenThen we held hands and kissed. A Spanish couple asked us to take their photo. A loud middle-aged Japanese man, practising his English, offered to take our photo from a framed lookout of Fuji built for tourists. He shouted, “One-ah two-ah three: delightful!” like it was a gameshow. We laughed loudly, paid for our Polaroid and descended again.I cried at Narita airport later that week, our return flight to Sydney imminent and inevitable. It wasn’t because we would never travel again or because I hated our life in Sydney, but because in tradition-bound Japan I felt free. It was a freedom from shame I am still learning, and it took me a trip to a Tokyo gay bar to find it.Daniel Nour is the author ofHow to Dodge Flying Sandals and Other Advice for Life($29.99; Affirm Press)Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleThe place that stayed with meJapan holidaysAsiaTokyo holidaysRelationshipsGay and lesbian travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This vibrant Welsh market town is a creative spot – it’s where the famous Dinefwr wool blankets are woven and boasts many galleries and antique stores – and is a pretty place to wander. Our eyes land on the rows of handmade cards and mugs stamped with Welsh words. One said:Cwtch. Pronounced “kutch” , it has no direct translation into English. “It’s a big, warm hug,” said the shop owner, “but also it’s a feeling, a sense of belonging,” - and a word that would come to define our weekend.We – I was travelling with my friend, Anna – were here to try outDiscover Carmarthenshire’s new “The Sisterhood” breaksthat tap into the growing trend of women swapping prosecco-fuelled girlie weekends for trips that focus on new skills and wellbeing experiences. For those wanting pre-curated stays there’s a Sisterhood Sorted section on the website, but groups of any size can create a bespoke trip by selecting west, central or coastal Carmarthenshire, choosing from a list of places to stay (from barns to glamping pods ), and then selecting experiences led by Wild Kin, a collection potters, painters, coastal foragers, horse whisperers, walking guides, makers and massage therapists.View image in fullscreenEmma enjoys a jewellery-making workshop with Elen Bowen.Photograph: Anna MooresWe’d chosen Ardderfin Farmhouse on the outskirts of historic Carmarthen, a rustic stone cottage with a clawfoot bath and huge open fireplace . It reminded us of the cottage in the film The Holiday.After settling in, we drove 15 minutes into town for dinner. “Carmarthen is still a community of farmers and the Women’s Instituteis still massive here,” said Rachel Williams, owner ofthe New Curiosity– a weekends-only, seasonal-menu restaurant she runs with her husband-chef, Daniel. “Everyone at our tables tends to know each other – my home is your home,” she said, as I tucked in to a perfectly pink Welsh sirloin.There’s a growing trend of women swapping prosecco-fuelled girlie weekends for trips that focus on skills and wellbeingSaturday brought low sun that splayed silhouettes of the skeletal trees across the frosted fields as we wended up into the hills to meet Yoka Kilkelly, AKA the “Dutch potter on the hill”, who runs herSiramikpottery studioout of a converted barn on a sheep farm. Inside, the slate stone walls were spattered with flecks of clay.View image in fullscreenEmma’s friend Anna captures sunset on the Tywi estuary.Photograph: Anna MooresWe started with wedging – kneading the clay to soften it, make its texture consistent and ensure there are no air bubbles in it. It requires serious heft. “No potter has bingo wings,” smiled Yoka, as we struggled away while she made her clay look as soft as bread dough. We portioned our clay into four, thwacked a lump on to the potter’s wheel and started coaxing it into shape as it span. “A person’s personality shapes their pot,” said Yoka. My clay morphed into coffee cups and Anna’s turned into a bowl, which we later daubed with a glaze. “It’s a mindful practice,” she added. With shards of winter sun spearing through the studio windows and the sensation of earthy clay spinning in my palms, I did feel very present.In the afternoon, we drove toward Llansteffan for a short walk along the sands of the Tywi estuary. Atop a hill was the crenelated shadow of 800-year-old Llansteffan Castle. The tide had drawn back, leaving a trail of bone-white cockle shells and shallow pools that reflected the pinkening sunset. Anna, a keen birder, was scanning for curlews and egrets, camera at the ready. It’s not often I get to see her in her element.In Wales we have a history of women meeting, especially while making food – milking, churning butter, that sort of thingLowri JohnstonWe returned to Ardderfin Farmhouse to find our next activity waiting. Lowri Johnston is a yoga teacher and organicflower farmerbased in nearby Nantgaredig. We lit the fire in the living room and she guided us through a gentle session. Then, fuelled by brownies she’d brought from a local bakery, she taught us to make willow wreaths gilded with ivy, eucalyptus, pine cones and dried dahlias foraged from her own farm, slowly warming the willow first to coax it into a circle.“I love doing this because it embeds people in the seasons and land,” Lowri said. She told us that the Welsh word for sisterhood ischwaeroliaeth. “It means ‘sisters together.’ In Wales we have a history of women meeting, especially while making food – milking, churning butter, that sort of thing.”View image in fullscreenAnna and Emma found there was plenty of time to get outside and explore between sessions.Photograph: Anna MooresAfter Lowri left us, Anna and I dined on a gourmet picnic of homemade meatballs in tomato sauce followed by ginger cake with toffee sauce that had been delivered byWright’s Food. We revived the fire, and sat in deep sofas talking until the wee hours as the embering wood hissed and crackled.Sunday dawned with rain drifting across the fields. I nudged the car toward Newcastle Emlyn to meet primary school teacher turned jewellerElen Bowen, who runs silver and gold jewellery making workshops at her home. She only turned her hand to it in 2023 after having twin girls and deciding on a career change. “I thought, heck, I’ll start an Instagram page and see how it goes – and it snowballed!” This year, she was selected to craft the crown for best story writer in theNational Eisteddfod– Wales’ largest annual festival celebrating Welsh literature, music and arts.Anna chose to make a bracelet; I decided on a ring. And with Elen’s guidance, we hammered, soldered and polished, bringing our own personalities to the piece, as we had with the pottery. After, we gathered around the table to share bowlfuls of her homemadecawl– Welsh stew.By the time we left, and had hugged goodbye every woman we’d met, I thought back to the mug printed withcwtch– how it wasn’t just a hug, but a sense of being gathered in by each of the creators we’d spent time with. It was the perfect word for a weekend crafted together with fun, food and a deeper sense of closeness to each other.The trip wasprovided byDiscover Carmarthenshire’s Sisterhood Campaign.Ardderfin Farmhousesleeps 8 adults, from£772for two nights.

Food styling: Tom Hunt.Waste notBiscuitsHow to make moreish cookies from store-cupboard odds and ends – recipeAlmost anything goes with these thrifty and delicious cookiesTom HuntWed 4 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTShareIoften eat a bag of salty crisps at the same time as a chewy chocolate bar, alternating bite for bite between the two, because the extreme contrast of salt from the chips and the sweetness of the chocolate fire off each other and create an endorphin rush. The same goes for these cookies, adapted from a recipe byChristina Tosiat New York’s legendaryMilk Bar.Compost (AKA larder) cookiesChristina Tosi writesin Gourmet Traveller Australia how she first learned to make these cookies at a conference centre on Star Island, New England, where they’d bake them each week with a hodge-podge of different ingredients. Being on an island, they didn’t always have access to what they wanted, so they had to come up with a new recipe every week using whatever they had. In the spirit of the recipe’s origins, I’ve adapted Tosi’s recipe for the UK, and made it flexible, so you can raid your own store-cupboards and adapt and invent your own version from it.The two main revelations I had when devising this recipe (both of which I’d highly recommend you include) are, first, use fresh coffee grounds, because they impart an incredible depth of flavour without overpowering the cookie. And, second, the addition of salty snacks (salted crisps, pretzels and/or peanuts, for example) is totally delicious in combination with the sweets. You can also try adding other ingredients such as cereal, tortilla chips or roasted fava beans.Tosi makes a Graham cracker crumb to mix into her cookie dough, but I’ve simplified that to an optional biscuit crust made from crushed biscuits (I used malted milk biscuits, but any will do) brought together with a little melted butter.MakesAbout 20For the cookie dough225g room-temperature butter350g sugar– I used a mixture of 250g granulated sugar and 100g dark brown sugar50g golden syrup, or liquid glucose or extra sugar1egg½ tsp vanilla extract225g flour(bread flour, plain flour or a mixture including wholemeal)40g rolled oats2½ tsp fresh coffee grounds(notinstant coffee; optional)½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda, or more baking powder1 tsp sea saltOptional extras50g biscuit crust(eg, graham crackers, Lotus biscuits, digestive biscuits) crushed to a crumb and mixed with 1 tbsp melted butter150g chocolate chips, or roughly chopped chocolate100g other sweets or bars(toffee, fudge, butterscotch, Snickers; I usedRocky bars), roughly chopped100g mixed salted snacks(crisps, pretzels,peanuts)First make the cookie dough. Vigorously beat the butter, sugar and golden syrup for a few minutes, then add the egg, vanilla extract, flour, rolled oats, coffee grounds, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and sea salt, and beat well to combine.Fold in any biscuits, chocolate or sweets that take your fancy, then gently fold in any more fragile salted snacks. Divide and roll the dough into 20 evenly sized balls and place these on a tray in the fridge for at least an hour, and ideally overnight.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line several baking trays with baking paper (unbleached, for preference). Arrange the dough balls evenly on the trays, leaving plenty of room (at least 10cm) between them, to allow for spreading. Bake from cold for about 18 minutes, until lightly golden around the edges, then remove and leave to cool on the trays. Store in an airtight container for several days (or in the freezer for up to three months).Explore more on these topicsBiscuitsWaste notFoodFood wasteBakingSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blood oranges are simmered whole until soft, perfuming your home as they do so, then they’re sliced, skin and all, mixed with sugar and a fragrant cinnamon stick, and embellished with a shot of amaro. Squirrel the jars away for a grey morning, give a few to deserving friends, and be sure to keep at least one to make this elegant mocha marmalade mousse tart. A cocoa biscuit crust topped with a chocolate marmalade mousse and crowned with a cold brew coffee cream, it’s a delightful trifecta of bitterness that no one will ever guess is an easy no-bake dessert.No-bake mocha marmalade mousse tart (pictured top)If you’re not up for preserving, make this using shop-bought thick-cut marmalade.Prep10 minChill10 hrCook1 hrServes8-10For the topping300g whipping cream50g coffee beans15g icing sugarA pinch of saltFor the crust230g digestive biscuits15g cocoa powder, plus extra to finish, if you like1tbspcaster sugar, plus extra for rolling½ tsp espresso powder¼ tsp salt115g unsalted butter, meltedFor the mousse170g whipping cream175gdark chocolate, roughly chopped1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk¼ tsp salt120g blood orange marmalade with amaro and cinnamon(see recipe below ), or shop-bought thick-cut marmalade, plus extra to decorate1 tbsp amaroStart the topping the night before. In an airtight container with a lid, mix the whipping cream and coffee beans, then cover and refrigerate overnight. If you like, you can also make the crust and mousse the night before to get ahead.Grease a 23cm springform tin and line the base and sides with baking paper. To make the crust, put the digestive biscuits, cocoa, sugar, espresso powder and salt in a food processor, then pulse until the biscuits are finely ground. Add the melted butter, pulse again until combined, then press the mix evenly into the base of the lined tin; refrigerate while you make the mousse.In a medium bowl, whisk the whipping cream to medium peaks, then cover and put in the fridge.In a food processor, pulse the chocolate to chop it finely, then add the egg, egg yolk and salt and pulse again to combine. Put the marmalade in a small pan, add 60ml cold water, then bring to a boil over a medium-high heat, stirring to combine. With the motor running, pour the hot marmalade mixture into the food processor, scrape down the sides and keep pulsing for about a minute, until the chocolate mix has melted and slightly cooled. Add the amaro and pulse again to combine.Gently fold a third of the chocolate mix into the chilled whipped cream, then fold in the remaining chocolate mix until no streaks remain. Pour on to the biscuit crust in the tin, then chill in the fridge for at least two hours (and up to overnight) to set.To decorate the tart with sugared peel, rinse the jelly off a few tablespoons of marmalade, then dry the pieces of peel on a rack until tacky. Once dried, roll in sugar.Just before serving, strain the coffee-infused cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, then discard the beans. Add the icing sugar and salt, and whip to firm peaks. Spread or pipe the coffee cream over the chilled mousse, then dust with optional cocoa powder and decorate with the sugared dried peel, if using. Serve at once or chill for up to three hours. Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to three days.Blood orange marmalade with amaroView image in fullscreenCamille Wynne’s blood orange marmalade with amaro and cinnamon.Prep5 minCool34 hrsCook2 hr+MakesAbout 5250ml jars1kg blood oranges1kgwhite sugar100g lemon juice1 cinnamon stick45g amaroWash the oranges, then put them in the base of a large pot in a single layer. Add enough water so the fruits float freely, then cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium, then simmer for one to two hours, until the oranges are soft. Take off the heat and leave the oranges to cool in the cooking water overnight.The next day, set a food mill or fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl. Drain the oranges, then halve them and scoop the insides into the food mill or sieve; reserve the peel. Push the flesh and juice through the mill/sieve and into the bowl, then discard the seeds and membranes. Cut the peel into 25mm x 6mm lengths.Add the sliced peel to the bowl with the flesh, then stir in the sugar and lemon juice and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes, and preferably overnight (or up to a week, in which case cover and keep in the fridge).When you’re ready to cook the marmalade, sterilise clean jars by putting them in a preheated 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½ oven for at least 20 minutes. Have new lids ready and put a couple of saucers in the freezer.Transfer the marmalade to a large pot or preserving pan, add the cinnamon stick and bring to a boil, stirring often, over a medium-high heat. When the froth subsides and the bubbles become regular and splutter violently, test the marmalade for doneness by putting a teaspoon of it on the saucer from the freezer. After two minutes, the marmalade should have formed a skin that wrinkles when prodded; if it doesn’t, cook a little longer and test again.Take the pan off the heat, add the amaro and fish out and discard the cinnamon stick. Ladle the marmalade into a heatproof measuring jug, then pour into the sterilised jars, filling them to just below the rim. If any marmalade strays, wipe the jar rims with damp paper towel, then top with the lids, seal tightly and invert for a minute or two.Leave the jars to cool for another 24 hours, then check the seals before storing them somewhere cool, dark and dry, where the marmalade will keep for at least a year.Camilla Wynne is the author ofAll That Crumbs Allow, and Nature’s Candy, which is published by Appetite By Random House at £26.99.
