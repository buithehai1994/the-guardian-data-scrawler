Big numbers were involved, with Microsoft hailing its $30bn (£22bn) investment as a major commitment to the UK – and adding, in an apparent swipe at its rivals, that it was not making “empty tech promises”.Here is a breakdown of the announcements in the UK-US “tech prosperity deal”, spelling out what is explicitly new in them.1.Microsoft invests $30bn in UKMicrosoft’s president, Brad Smith, hailed the “single biggest announcement” in the pact and insisted it was not an empty promise. The $30bn (£22bn) sets out the company’s UK budget over the next four years and refers not just to artificial intelligence infrastructure but also “ongoing operations” across the UK.Microsoft said the number included $15bn in capital expenditure – such as on equipment, land and buildings – for AI and cloud services, areas where datacentres are key components. The other half will go on day-to-day operations such as research, sales and product development.Top UK artists urge Starmer to protect their work on eve of Trump visitRead moreAs part of the package, the US company said it would back an already announced project, an AI datacentre in Loughton, Essex, by becoming a core customer of its owner, the UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale.Smith had criticised the UK in 2023 as being “bad for business” after Microsoft’s takeover of the video games maker Activisionwas blocked– a move that was later unwound. He told reporters on Tuesday that Microsoft had been “encouraged” by steps taken by the governments of Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, with the latter helping on planning permission and energy access.“We have a more stable opportunity to accelerate investment in the UK,” Smith said.The £22bn is a significant chunk of the £31bn value the UK government placed on the pact, which also includes £5bn of expenditure from Google that the search company described as “additional investment over the next two years”. The Google figure includes capital expenditure, research and development, and related engineering, as well as work at the AI unit Google DeepMind.2.AI growth zone in north-east EnglandThe north-east will host an AI “growth zone”, an area that will receive special support in planning permission and energy provision for hosting AI infrastructure such as datacentres. The government said this could unlock more than 5,000 jobs and bring in £30bn in investment, although this is all hypothetical for now.One of the datacentre sites, Blyth in Northumberland, has already been announced and is receiving £10bn in financial commitment from the US investment firm Blackstone.The other site mentioned, at Cobalt Park in North Tyneside, features a new development: a domestic version of the US “Stargate” datacentre project championed by Trump. Nscale, OpenAI and Nvidia will develop a platform that will deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK. The idea is that Stargate UK will help develop “sovereign” AI, where cutting-edge technology is developed and used in the UK’s interests.As part of the first phase of Stargate UK, OpenAI will use 8,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the powerful computer chips that underpin AI tools such as ChatGPT. Cobalt Park will be one of several UK sites under the plan.3.Nvidia’s £11bn announcementNvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker, touted an £11bn injection into the UK economy as part of the pact, providing up to 120,000 of its powerful Blackwell GPUs to projects that will be built over the next couple of years in the UK. So, there is a degree of overlap with other announcements in the pact.Clarifying its investment on Wednesday, Nvidia said the £11bn referred to the total “end-to-end value” its partners were delivering, encompassing the chips they have bought from Nvidia, land and buildings involved in constructing the datacentres, and supercomputers that will house the GPUs. Nvidia, at $4tn the biggest company in the world’s biggest economy, isalso investing £500m in Nscale.4.Other announcementsCoreWeave, a US datacentre company, said it would invest a further £1.5bn in the UK including a site in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The US software company Salesforce is investing an additional $2bn in the UK, adding two years to a financial commitment to the UK that will now run to 2030. Nvidia will also invest an undisclosed amount in the UK’s AI startup scene.5.Tech-boss influxThe pact, and Trump’s visit, is being accompanied by an entourage of US tech bosses, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI travelling across the Atlantic to symbolically reinforce their ties to the US president. Since Trump has been in power, US tech leaders have lined up to express loyalty and support for him and this is another opportunity to do so – as well as to support the projection of US leadership in AI. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is also reportedly attending Wednesday’s state banquet.6.AI and energyThe government claims that the US-UK agreement will “turbocharge” the UK’s low-carbon economy by encouraging the build-out of new nuclear power stations to power the datacentres and supercomputers that underpin the technology.Specifically, the tech pact is expected to bring forwardmultibillion-pound investments in new nuclear technologies,which would create thousands of jobs under a string of separate transatlantic agreements revealed earlier this week.Google announces £5bn AI investment in UK before Trump visitRead moreThese new pledges build on Starmer’s existing plan for a once-in-a-generation nuclear expansion that he revealed earlier this year alongside an open invitation to tech companies such as Google, Meta and Amazon to invest in AI datacentres in Britain, which could be powered by small modular reactors.Growing the UK’s low-carbon energy supplies is considered essential if it hopes to host the energy-hungry datacentres required for an AI industry while staying within its net zero carbon budgets. But it will need to add enough new low-carbon energy generation to match the needs of the datacentres, as well as the growing demand for electricity from the rest of the economy, if it hopes to avoid adding extra gas power to the energy system in the future.Many global tech companies, which are also under pressure to satisfy their own carbon-cutting commitments, are turning to nuclear power because reactors generate electricity at a steady rate, which mirrors the energy use of a datacentre. This summer, Meta signed a 20-year deal with anuclear power stationin Illinois, while Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy in the race for AI dominance.Still, the latest AI plans are likely to raise further questionsover the UK’s under-pressure water supplies– which are needed to cool down some energy-intensive datacentres.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingNvidiaOpenAIMicrosoftEnergy industrykey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

PicturesMoviesReviewOne Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperAnderson updates Thomas Pynchon for the era of Ice roundups, pitting shaggy revolutionary Leonardo DiCaprio against cartoonish forces of reactionPeter BradshawWed 17 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 12.33 EDTShareOne of the great creative bromances has flowered again: Paul Thomas Anderson and Thomas Pynchon. Having adapted Pynchon’sInherent Vicefor the screen in 2015, Anderson has now taken a freer rein with his 1990 novel Vineland, creating a bizarre action thriller driven by pulpy comic-book energy and transformed political indignation, keeping his pedal at all times welded to the metal.It’s a riff on the now recognisable Anderson-Pynchonian idea of counterculture and counter-revolution, absorbing the paranoid style of American politics into a screwball farcical resistance, with a jolting, jangling, nerve-shredding score byJonny Greenwood. It’s partly a freaky-Freudian diagnosis of father-daughter dysfunction – juxtaposed with the separation of migrant children and parents at the US-Mexico border – and a very serious, relevant response to the US’s secretive ruling class and its insidiously normalised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) roundups: the toxic new Vichyite Trump enthusiasm.Pynchon imagined the subversiveness of the 60s having its contested sequel in the Reaganite 80s; Anderson brings the time gap between these eras into the present day, although there isn’t the a cultural distinction between what are evidently the last days of Obama and contemporary Trump pomp. Specific references such as Maga and BLM aren’t mentioned.Leonardo DiCaprio is Bob, a dishevelled revolutionary, who is to become even more dishevelled in the future when he will do a great deal of panicky running through the streets in his dressing gown, whining that he has nowhere to charge his phone. Bob is part of a heavily armed activist cell that attacks migrant holding prisons on the Mexican border; Bob’s (humble) job is to set off fireworks as a diversionary-slash-celebratory tactic, and he is less important than his comrades, such as badass Deandra (Regina Hall) and cerebral Howard (played in cameo by composer and Yale academic Paul Grimstad).Bob is passionately devoted to his partner and charismatic comrade, interestingly named Perfidia (Teyana Taylor). And Bob is not the only one. When the group attack the military compound, Perfidia captures and humiliates the aggressively reactionary Col Steven Lockjaw – played bySean Pennwith all manner of lizardly head-jerking, chin-jutting geezer mannerisms – who clearly derives sexual excitement from the whole business, and his creepy, cartoony unwholesomeness is another driving force. With the cold calculation of a born leader, Perfidia sees how she can toy with Lockjaw’s infatuation, using him to control and divert military opposition. Does she take it too far? Does the idea of taking things too far in fact have any meaning in this context? Perfidia deafeningly firing an assault rifle while in the ninth month of her pregnancy is one of the film’s most amazing images.It is poor, befuddled Bob’s destiny to bring up a daughter he thinks is his, as a single dad. Sixteen-year-old Willa (Chase Infiniti) is as smart and focused as her mom, instructed in martial arts by her sensei (Benicio del Toro), while Bob gets more messed up on drugs and booze all day, watchingPontecorvo’s The Battle of Algierson TV, grumpily refusing to remember her friends’ preferred pronouns. But the forces of darkness encircle them once more, and when his old revolutionary friends re-emerge to contact him, Bob realises his brain is too fried to remember the all-important code words on the phone. As for Willa, she is now stuck with troubled thoughts about her mother and a mortifying question concerning Bob and Lockjaw, like the heroine of Mamma Mia! The Movie.One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen – an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream?Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.One Battle After Another is out on 25 September in Australia, and on 26 September in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmPaul Thomas AndersonThomas PynchonLeonardo DiCaprioBenicio del ToroSean PennJonny GreenwoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Keir Starmer doesn’t have that luxuryMartin KettleThe choice for governments around the world is clear: engage, or fall beneath the US president’s wheel. For now, Britain must do the formerWed 17 Sep 2025 11.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 15.12 EDTShareHas any visiting leader ever seen so little of Britain or the British as Donald Trump is doing this week? The absurdly unrepresentative version of the country offered up to the US president on hissecond state visiton Wednesday was a Windsor parody, a Potemkin version of this country, glistening with protocol and polish, amid a lavish reenactment of the British monarchy’s invented traditions. Just about the only thing that was authentic was the rain.But here’s the unalterable and underlying thing. None of that really matters. What matters is that Trump is the most powerful leader in the world. Despite all the Trumpian shocks, the US and Britain remain allies. Business can and should be done between them. So theopportunity for face-time with Trump, in circumstances designed to soften him up with flattery and engage him over this country’s own priorities, is to be seized. Not to do this would be perverse.No, it is not ideal. The era of shared values is ebbing fast. Keir Starmer did not need to play thestate visit card so soonor so generously. He should have made Trump wait for the invitation, extracting a higher price for it, and offering hints that it might be offered in return for the right deal. But Starmer is not alone in struggling to read a president who is both unserious and utterly serious at the same time. All nations arestill trying to work out how to respond.The justification for inviting him for a second state visit is thus pureraison d’état –a reward for bad behaviour that is nevertheless in the British national interest. This may not be personally agreeable to some of those taking part, or to millions of others at home or on the streets. It may even not be very moral. Many – perhaps from the king downwards – will bite their tongues over these two distasteful days. All the same, it is necessary work.Keir Starmer is betting everything on an America that doesn’t exist any more | Rafael BehrRead moreIt is also even more necessary in Trump’s second term than it was in the first. Trump’s victory in 2024 was more emphatic than in 2016 and his preparation for his White House return was far more thorough. From day one, his agenda, at home and abroad, has been more radical, more audacious, and in many respects is also proving more successful. Let others denounce this. Governments must engage or fall beneath his wheel.Three things will matter in particular whenTrump meets Starmer on Thursdayfor the political half of the visit: trade, the Middle East and Ukraine. Views will differ on the top priority. The majortechnological investmentthat Peter Mandelson nurtured in his months as ambassador in Washington seems already locked in, a material legacy of a job done well, if briefly. On the Middle East, meanwhile, the immediate goal must be to prevent Trump exploding when Britain and others recognise Palestine next week.Soraison d’étatsays that pressure on Trump over Ukraine needs to come first. Russia’s threat to Europe is existential. Long term, the solution to that is in Europe’s own hands. The idea that the US should continue to be primarily responsible for Europe’s security 80 years after the second world war is now barely credible. But Starmer still needs to do whatever he can to press Trump to arm Ukraine more now. If nothing else, the prime minister should stress the shocking inconsistency between the administration’stough sanctions on China and Indiafor buying Russian gas while not going after Russia itself on the battlefield.Many will recoil from the engagement with Trump. Those of us who are not government ministers or diplomats have the luxury of being able to do so. That’s not an option for Starmer. Since it is in the national interest to try to influence Trump, it is part of Starmer’s duty to try. He clearly accepts that it is part of his job. He is right. If Starmer visits China in the coming weeks, he will be right about that part of it, too.There are, of course, multiple reasons why Trump’s state visit can and should be criticised. The principal reason is that Trump is doing harm – a lot of it. So his visit is not an occasion for celebration but for damage limitation. That is the unspoken reason why it is taking place behind steel walls and closed doors. But that does not invalidate it. A realist might even say it makes the visit more necessary rather than less.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A decade ago, China’s paramount leader, Xi Jinping, wasgranted the full gilded coach treatmentalong the Mall – not to mentiona trip to Manchesteras well. Back in 1978, even the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, a man with blood on his hands,rode through London with the royalsin an open-topped coach. No such treatment for Trump this time.It may all go off the rails, perhaps at Thursday’s Chequers press conference, where journalists will try their best to provoke Trump. Even if that does happen, though, the visit will still have been worthwhile. At best, it may produce the trade and tech agreements worked on by Mandelson, and perhaps help generate greater US robustness towards Russia and Israel. Even at worst, it will be another reminder to Britain and its more dependable allies that a new version of the international economic and security order is still salvageable from the damage being done by Trump. The important thing is to keep options open, not to close them off.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerKing Charles IIILabourMonarchycommentShareReuse this content"

From her bed, flanked by pills and cigarettes, Ireland’s grande dame looks backWed 17 Sep 2025 11.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 12.47 EDTShareBrenda Fricker is sitting up in a bed plumped with pillows, wearing a sapphire blue blouse and a head of grey-golden ringlets. One bedside table has her medication, 25 pills a day. Another has a cup of water, an ashtray and her cigarettes. Above and on either side of her are shelves jammed with an eclectic hoard of books: Salman Rushdie, Edna O’Brien, Brian Aldiss, Alex Ferguson. Meanwhile, gazing out from framed black and white photographs on the walls, are writers, producers and actors from another era, plus a young, luminous Fricker herself.The current version of Fricker is 80 and not so well, happy to be interviewed but only from the bed of her Dublin home – not exactly a common setup with stars, but then she is no ordinary star. “I’m out of breath just talking,” she says. “I’ve never known tiredness ever in my life. Weary. Will I ever get up again?” She will, but the question is not entirely rhetorical. “I’m having a dreadful death,” she says. “I’m just dying, every day in pain.” This is said in a matter of fact tone, only to be undercut by a rueful prediction: “I’ll probably live to be 100.”When she was eight, the man who gave her elocution lessons made her expose herself as he masturbatedThe grande dame of Irish and British theatre, TV and cinema – Fricker was a staple ofCoronation StreetandCasualty,and won an Oscar forMy Left Footin 1990 – is an authority on survival. It is something of a miracle, in fact, that she made it into adulthood, let alone pensionable age. Fricker lit up the screen with warmth and light but her life was often cold and dark. At times she tried to end it, only to rediscover a hunger for love and joy and adventure. That spirit endures even though frailty has ambushed her and confined her to bed. She leans forward, blue eyes blazing. “Do everything while you’re young,” she says with fierce urgency. “Just do it.”Her younger self needed no urging. After stumbling into acting, she forged a remarkable career and collaborated with luminaries such as David Hare, Dirk Bogarde, Richard Harris andDaniel Day-Lewis, and in her Hollywood spell encountered Macaulay Culkin, Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. Her greatest affection is for London’s bohemian yesteryear. “It was a drinking culture,” she says. “Everybody was pissed most of the time. Happy days.”View image in fullscreen‘It was like I’d jumped in a pigsty. I met Donald Trump in an elevator after and he was very polite about it’ … Fricker as the ‘pigeon lady’ in Home Alone 2.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe reason for this interview, however, is Fricker’s new memoir,She Died Young: A Life in Fragments, which reveals a life scarred by abuse and sexual assault. Her parlous health means we rendezvous at her terrace home in the Liberties, an area of Dublin’s inner city. It is a bright and airy place, jumbled with books, plants, a dog and mementoes, including her Oscar, which props open a bathroom door. Carers visit daily. “They’re so good. Great, great women,” says Fricker.I sit down, a copy of her book peeking from my bag. “Did you read it?” she asks. I nod. “Oh God, this is terrifying,” she adds. “I don’t know how to do interviews about this.” The motivation for the memoir was not ego but money – to end a tangled saga of disputed debt – and it took four years of hard graft. “Every line I deleted and started again. It was murder for me. It was kind of ironic because I was talking about things I had paid a fortune to psychiatrists to make me forget. So it was very painful bringing them back. I thought they were a bit morbid. I think I’m a bit morbid. I’mIrish.”Harvey Weinstein put his arms around me and I thought I'd vomitFricker was born in 1945 and grew up in the south Dublin suburb of Dundrum. Her father, Desmond, a journalist with the Irish Times and RTÉ, was an aloof, detached figure with his nose forever in a book. Her mother Bina was a schoolteacher who would on occasion erupt and assault Brenda. “She’d beat the shit out of me.” Decades later, doctors detected a brain tumour that they said might have caused erratic behaviour.Despite love and solace from relatives in Kerry and her free spirited, sparky older sister Gránia, Fricker was an anxious child prone to bed-wetting. At the age of eight, she befriended a 30-year-old bachelor – the memoir calls him Séamus S – from a theatre group. When he offered private elocution lessons, her delighted parents delivered her each week to his home.View image in fullscreen‘I mean, we all have a method’ … Fricker with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesPerched on his sofa, she devoured cake while he taught her poems and read her books and answered her myriad questions. And then, over time, he had her hitch up her skirt and expose herself while he masturbated. The memoir, however, defends him. “So many of the happiest hours of my childhood were spent with him … our secret was the price I had to pay for the deep friendship that we shared.”I tell her that is shocking. She waseight. She nods. She accepts that she was groomed yet has no regrets. “It was a good deal for me because I was getting so much from him. I was a bright little kid, you know, curious about everything, and he never hurt me. He never touched me, he never frightened me.”Fricker does not imply any connection but from the age of 10 she became obsessed by blood and blades and began to cut and scar herself as a way to assert some control, to have another secret. When she was 14, a horrific bicycle accident – she hurtled face-first through a car windscreen – landed her in hospital for two agonising years. The driver was to blame but his political connections meant the incident was hushed up, she says.Fricker had excelled at Latin and algebra but the accident derailed schooling and she left without any qualifications, which bequeathed a lifelong inferiority complex. “A chip this size,” she says, arcing a hand over a shoulder. Decades of voracious reading have not filled the void. “It still wounds me. That’s how deep it goes.”Her memoir details a rape by an English actor named James Donnelly who, like Fricker, starred on Coronation StreetAged 17, she was raped at a party, an act of violence and cruelty that left her “broken”. Trapped in a cycle of depression, self-harm and suicide attempts, she was institutionalised multiple times. Yet a zest for life endured. She dabbled in journalism, au paired in Spain and got a role on the Dublin stage, which led to theatre and television work on both sides of the Irish Sea.And then violence again found her. The memoir graphically details a rape by an English actor named James Donnelly. Like Fricker, he starred on Coronation Street, but at a different time, and died in 1992. When I mention the name, she goes quiet and reaches for a cigarette. “He was a bastard, yeah.” She did not report the assault to police. “Girls get raped and they’re ashamed of themselves. You think it’s your fault. You really do.”Fricker welcomed the #MeToo movement as an overdue reckoning for abusers but has little confidence in much changing, saying: “It’ll go on for ever.”Which brings us toHarvey Weinsteinand My Left Foot. In 1989, she played the mother in this biopic of Christy Brown, a working-class Dubliner with cerebral palsy who became an acclaimed painter and writer. Weinstein championed the low-budget indie under his Miramax banner, leading to five Oscar nominations. Fricker lauds his promotional genius but still shudders at meeting him. “He put his arms around me and I thought I’d vomit. He just emanated something off. He was just disgusting, like a big, sweating pig.”View image in fullscreenOn the way up … in a scene from Casualty.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesDaniel Day-Lewis won best actor for playing Brown and Fricker won best supporting actress, a triumph that put Irish cinema on the map. For the girl from Dundrum, it was surreal – she rode in gigantic limousines and filled a suitcase with pilfered Beverly Hills hotel spoons as mementoes.Hollywood roles followed, including in the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.Macaulay Culkinwas a charming, beautiful kid, and spoiled rotten by those around him, she says. “Of course he ended up on drugs, what else would he do?” Playing a homeless pigeon-lover, Fricker ended each day “covered in pigeon shit”. Returning to her suite at New York’s Plaza hotel one evening, she met Donald Trump in the elevator. “It was like I’d jumped into a pigsty but he was very polite about it. He just said, ‘How’s it going?’”Her career thrived but loss and grief never released their hold. She had a miscarriage and, without her permission, doctors removed her womb, so she never had children. Marriage to the film director Barry Davies ended in divorce. Her adored sister Gránia died an alcoholic at the age of 68, which inspired the title of Fricker’s memoir. Through it all, Fricker continued working: The Field,Veronica Guerin, I Married an Axe Murderer, Cloudburst, more than 30 films. A forthcoming feature called The Swallow, by Tadhg O’Sullivan, may be her swansong.Falls, broken bones, swollen joints, aches and fatigue keep her in bed. Unable to sleep at night, she binge-watchesThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “It’s better than sex,” she says. “It’s better than getting drunk. I just love it.”Yet a passion for her craft endures, indomitable. She has not quite forgiven Day-Lewis for remaining in character – in a wheelchair, grunting – for the entire shoot of My Left Foot. A disruptive indulgence, she says. “I’m fond of him. A good man, great morals. But he’s a fucking method actor. I mean, we all have a method. I don’t mind another method actor but if they interfere with my little method, then fuck off, like, you know?” Fricker sighs and smiles. “I’ll be getting a phone call from Daniel. He phones me on occasion, tells me I’m being bold.”As I leave Fricker in her bed, a tousled queen in her Dublin kingdom looking back on eight extraordinary decades, it’s not a verdict I would quibble with.She Died Young: A Life in Fragments by Brenda Fricker is out tomorrow.In the UK andIreland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

That was on top of £10bn the company committed to an artificial intelligence datacentre earlier this year.Other announcements include £3.9bn from the investment firm Prologis and £1.5bn from the tech company Palantir. The government said the package would create 7,600 high-quality jobs in sectors including clean energy and life sciences.Starmer said that “with friends like the US” the UK could “help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off”, adding: “These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious and ready to lead.”Downing Street sources said the £150bn of inward investment was higher than the figure for the whole of last year and that the prime minister was feeling “very upbeat” because it exceeded expectations.The announcement followed a separate pledge of billions of pounds of investment from US tech firms, including from Microsoft, which has announceda $30bn (£22bn) spending package– its largest ever outside the US.0:40Thousands of demonstrators protest against Trump state visit – videoBut the careful choreography was dealt a blow on Wednesday when Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who held one of the most senior roles at Meta until earlier this year, described the US-UK tech deal as“sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”.Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said of the US tech companies: “These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway. They’re building datacentres all over the world.“Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal, which is basically just sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”Critics have argued that the tech deal, due to be finalised at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat with Trump on Thursday, does little to support the UK’s homegrown tech industry and have questioned what concessions the government might give US tech companies on regulation and tax.View image in fullscreenQueen Camilla, King Charles, Donald Trump and Melania Trump pose at the state banquet.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAfter landing by helicopter in Windsor Castle’s grounds on Wednesday morning, Trump joined the king in a horse-drawn carriage but the procession remained within the royal estate and out of the reach of the public, with security concerns given as an explanation.The president and his wife, Melania, were later hosted by Charles at a lavish state banquet inside Windsor Castle on Wednesday alongside several top business executives including Apple’s Tim Cook, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.They were served Hampshire watercress panna cotta with parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, followed by Norfolk chicken ballotine and a vanilla ice-cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached victoria plums.A whisky sour cocktail garnished with a toasted marshmallow set on a star-shaped biscuit “evoking the warmth of a fireside S’more” was served, although Trump does not drink alcohol.During his speech the king emphasised the importance of protecting the environment, saying the legacy of both nations over the “next 250 years and beyond” was to ensure future generations can experience “natural treasures”.Trump, meanwhile, used his speech to pay a heartfelt tribute to the US’s relationship with the UK, saying the “word ‘special’ does not begin to do it justice”.The US leader also heaped praise on the king, describing his as a “very, very special man”. He went on to say: “We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny. We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The president came to Britain because he “wants to feel like a king”, Bragg claimed.The comedian Nish Kumar launched a blow-up ball with the vice-president JD Vance’s face on it into the crowd. “Donald Trump is a lightning rod [for] white supremacist groups and racists around the world,” he said.Every effort was put on to impress Trump in Windsor but a flypast of F-35 jets above Windsor Castle had to be cancelled due to poor weather and at times the president appeared bored.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer has come under fire for inviting Trump on a second state visit.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianTrump laid a wreath at the late Queen Elizabeth’s tomb inside St George’s Chapel and he was given a tour with his wife that included Henry VIII’s burial vault and a memorial plate in honour of Sir Winston Churchill. “This was a great honour,” the president said.Trump and his wife also joined the king and queen to inspect artefacts pertaining to British-American relations.“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents about US independence. “That’s fascinating,” said Charles as he pointed out another table, detailing the transatlantic cable used for communication between the two countries. Trump agreed: “That’s so amazing.”Members of the royal family joined the US president for lunch in the state dining room along with the new interim ambassador to the US, James Roscoe, and Trump’s entourage.The president and the king chatted amiably throughout the day but Trump appeared to breach an unofficial protocol by twice touching the monarch’s back.On Wednesday, YouGov released newpollingthat suggested that more than half of Britons think the Trump presidency has been bad for the UK. Fewer than one person in 10 thinks it has been good.Britons were said to be fairly evenly divided between those who think Starmer has been too positive towards Trump (30%) and those who think he has got the balance right (27%), the poll suggests.To mark his second state visit, Starmer will give Trump a bespoke ministerial red box adorned with the presidential seal and title. The first lady will receive a colourful silk scarf based on artwork created by Ukrainian children, in a nod to her work raising awareness of their plight. The Trumps will receive the gifts during their visit to Chequers on Thursday.Two people were arrested in Windsor over public order incidents linked to Trump’s visit, Thames Valley police said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerTrade policyEconomicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

So far,no one has been put on a flight.On Tuesday, a high court rulingblocked the deportationof a 25-year-old Eritrean man who was due to be flown to Paris. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was a victim of trafficking and would be made destitute if sent to France.Following the ruling, officials abandoned plans for a flight on Wednesday. TheHome Officehas announced it will appeal against the decision. Mahmood said: “Last-minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable, and I will fight them at every step.“Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country’s generosity.“I will fight to end vexatious, last-minute claims. I will robustly defend the British public’s priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our border.”A legal source with knowledge of the case said: “The reason [trafficking claims] are last minute is because the Home Office isn’t identifying those from a known slavery route, for example via Libya, and expects vulnerable people to somehow raise it after a torrid journey.“They [the asylum seekers] put in late claims as they only get advice late due to the government’s own rushed detention and removal policies.”Under the deal,signed in Julyby Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, the UK agreed to detain Channel claimants and send them back to France in return for taking a similar number of asylum seekers with family ties to the UK.Tuesday’s high court injunction was granted after the Home Office changed its legal position on the question of whether it could accept evidence from France.The unnamed man has been given extra time to submit evidence to back up his claim that he is a victim of modern slavery because he was trafficked on his journey to the UK.Mr Justice Sheldon, who granted the temporary injunction, said more time was needed to investigate his claim that he was a potential victim of human trafficking.The court was told he and his mother had travelled to Ethiopia when he was a young child and that he had been trafficked from there to Libya in 2023.He said he had then made his way via Italy to France, and arrived in Britain by small boat across the Channel on 12 August after his mother paid £1,000 to smugglers, court papers said.The Home Office still plans to send some failed asylum seekers to France this week, sources said. France has been planning to fly asylum seekers to the UK this Saturday as part of the agreement.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The home secretary is reacting in panic to the collapse of her gimmick returns deal.“On Monday I told Shabana Mahmood in parliament that fundamental reform of human rights and other law was essential. She brushed it off, and now, for the third day in a row, flights to France have left empty. No one is fooled by tough talk fromLabour.”It remains unclear whether asylum seekers will come to the UK from France if reciprocal flights have failed to take off.A solicitor representing asylum seekers questioned why the government had taken an “arbitrary and chaotic approach” to choosing who would be removed, including mistakenly selecting children.Imogen Townley, from the firm Wilsons, said: “There has been quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats without much consideration given, or seemingly any consideration given, to whether they are suitable for return to France.“You would think that the government of the UK working with France would be able to select some people, particularly in a pilot scheme when there is quite a lot of resources aimed at a small group of people.”Campaigners for migrant rights have called for Mahmood to scrap the scheme. Lochlinn Parker, the acting director of Detention Action, said: “The scheme has been beset with foreseeable problems. Screening for vulnerabilities and age is not working and the system designed to get people legal advice has predictably failed.“The only way to end this chaos and the harm it is causing people is for the government to end this deal urgently.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourRefugeesFranceHome OfficeHuman traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

The social mobility charity said it was a “disgrace” that most of the country’s top jobs were still dominated by privileged people.Overall, senior armed forces personnel were the most likely to be privately educated, with 63% of officers of two-star rank (major generals and equivalents in other services) and above attending a fee-paying school, a rise of 14% compared with six years ago.Graph shows proportion of privately educated people in top roles by profession.This was true of a similar proportion of judges, at 62%, followed by male cricketers at 59%, despite independent school attendance being 7% across the population.In business, of the FTSE 100 chief executives who were educated in the UK, 37% attended private school, while this was true of 68% of their chairs after those who were educated abroad were stripped out, making it the most privately educated profession in the report. This represented a 15% rise in six years.Nearly a quarter of MPs and half of the House of Lords were privately educated, and that was also true of half of newspaper columnists – up 7 percentage points since 2019 – 47% of political commentators and 45% of podcasters.Only three categories were below the national average – male professional footballers at 5%, female professional footballers at 4% and the Northern Ireland assembly, where nobody attended a fee-paying school.The report also revealed stark figures on the proportion of the elite who attended Oxbridge, with three-quarters of senior judges attending either Oxford or Cambridge, compared with only 1% of the population.Third of UK parents have sought special needs assessment for their child, survey findsRead moreThose institutions were also dominant among senior civil servants, with 66% of permanent secretaries being Oxbridge graduates.About a third of charity chief executives were privately educated and a fifth attended Oxbridge, showing that even the third sector is not immune to elitism.Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said: “It’s a disgrace that most of the top jobs in Britain are still dominated by those from privileged education backgrounds, representing a small fraction of the wider population.“Little progress has been made in opening up positions of power, with those from private schools maintaining a vice-like grip on the most important roles.“In 2025 you can still buy advantage, massively increasing your chance of getting into the most powerful roles in the country. This is grossly unfair, and a waste of talent on a huge scale. If we want a fairer country and a stronger economy, employers and policymakers must take responsibility for levelling the playing field, where privilege is no longer a passport to power.”The charity is calling on the government to make it compulsory for organisations with more than 250 employees to report their class pay gaps to tackle access and progression problems.The Sutton Trust said in order to find talented individuals and “build a better pipeline of leaders”, employers should also look at education achievements in the context of disadvantage, including attending underperforming schools and less advantaged neighbourhoods, as well as looking beyond a narrow range of universities.Carl Cullinane, the director of research and policy at the Sutton Trust, said “too often, social class is not included” in the diversity conversation.He added: “Making the most of talent, wherever it comes from, means employers can move beyond a narrow cohort of candidates from the most advantaged backgrounds. This can be a win-win for employers, society, and the economy.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mobilityPrivate schoolsSchoolsInequalityFTSECareersnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the Times, Starmer has held off on formally announcing the UK will recognise a Palestinian state until after Trump leaves for fear it could dominate a Thursday news conference the two men plan to hold at Chequers.Meeting with Keir Starmer was ‘tough’, says Israeli presidentRead moreThe prime minister has found himself at odds with the US administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state. However, other nations including France, Australia and Canada have said they plan to take the same step at the UN gathering.In July, Starmer announced he would recognise Palestine’s statehood after mounting pressure from Labour MPs over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. But the Labour leader suggested British recognition was conditional and he would refrain if Israel committed to a ceasefire and long-term sustainable peace that delivers a two-state solution, and allow the UN to restart the supply of aid.All three conditions are, however, unlikely to be met given the Israeli government opposes these terms. Israeli forces are undertaking a major ground offensive in Gaza, with thousands forced to flee in recent days.The state of Palestine is already recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.Starmer condemns Israel’s airstrike on Qatar as No 10 denies prior knowledge of attackRead moreElsewhere, Sadiq Khan has for the first time described the situation in Gaza as a “genocide”. The mayor of London told an audience at a people’s question time event on Wednesday: “I think what’s happening in Gaza is a genocide.“When I see the images of the children starving – 20,000 children have starved because of the policies of the Israeli government – when I see the health system in Gaza collapsed, when I see the lack of supplies reaching people in need, when I see the famine that is manmade, when I read the interim judgment of the ICJ, and then see a UN commission report this week, I think it’s inescapable to draw the conclusion in Gaza we are seeing before our very eyes a genocide.”On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said it had reasonable grounds to conclude Israel wascommitting a genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza.Israel’s foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as “distorted and false”.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Each fully qualified GP costs £430,540 to train during the years of their undergraduate and postgraduate education, the researchers say.The study says: “The gap between GMC-licensed and NHS general practice GPs in 2024 represented an estimated £8.6bn investment in training by headcount and £13.1bn by full-time equivalent GPs lost from NHS general practice, although this figure will be less for the UK after adjusting for [the presence of] international medical graduates.”The findings tally withresearch published last month by the GMC, which regulates doctors in the UK. It has found big increases over recent years in the number of GPs planning to either move abroad, work privately or leave the medical profession altogether.For example, the proportion of GPs across the UK who said they were likely to move abroad to practice medicine more than doubled from 10% in 2020 to 21% last year.Similarly, the percentage who said they were likely to either start working privately or increase the amount of time they spent working as a private GP rose from 23% in 2019 to 29% in 2024 – more than the trend among doctors overall, of whom 23% said they were planning that switch.And the proportion who have taken “hard steps” to leave the UK medical profession completely, such as contacting a recruiter, applying for non-clinical roles or begun moves to retire, soared from 4% in 2019 to 15% in 2024.Female GPs, especially those aged 30-49, younger GPs and those in London and the south-east are most likely to quit, the study of official NHS workforce data found.Deepening GP disengagement from the NHS threatens the government’s plans to move a lot of care out of hospitals into the community and create new “neighbourhood health services”, the researcher added.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the findings reflected the fact that, despite record numbers of newly-qualified doctors starting GP training in England in recent years, the NHS’s inability to retain family doctors meant that new recruits were “pouring into a leaking bucket”.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, should focus more on helping to improve retention of GPs in the NHS than on expanding their numbers through his forthcoming revamp of the NHS’s long term workforce plan, she said.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment directly on the findings.“We are making progress to reverse more than a decade of neglect in primary care , recruiting more than 2,000 extra GPs in the past year, delivering a record £1bn boost and funding vital upgrades to surgeries, as well as cutting red tape so doctors can spend more time caring for patients.“July 2025 saw the highest ever headcount of fully qualified GPs and patient satisfaction with GP services is rising.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthGPsDoctorsEnglandHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

About 40% of colorectal cancer patients have such mutations.“I think this will change clinical practice,” said Prof Anna Martling, who led theAlascca trialat the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “If you had these mutations, the risk of the cancer coming back was lowered by more than 50%. It is a huge effect.”Nearly 2 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year around the world, with more than 40,000 cases in the UK. Many have their tumours removed, but despite advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, the cancer can return if cells are left behind.Rates of bowel cancer are rising worldwidein people under 50, and while the reasons are unclear, scientists suspect junk food, obesity, a lack of physical activity andtoxins produced by gut bacteriaare involved.Previous trialshave shown aspirin can help to prevent colorectal cancer in people who are high risk because of hereditary conditions such asLynch syndrome. But it was unclear whether the drug reduced the chances of cancer recurring after surgery.Martling and her colleagues recruited more than 3,500 patients who had had colorectal tumours removed at hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Genetic tests on 2,980 of the patients found 1,103, or 37%, had mutations in genes that make up a biological pathway called PI3K, which is implicated in colorectal cancer.The patients with the mutations were randomly assigned to have 160mg aspirin a day or a placebo for three years after surgery. Those on aspirin were 55% less likely to have the cancer return than those on placebo, the trial showed.The drug appears to protect against cancer by dampening down inflammation, interfering with the PI3K pathway, and dampening down the activity of blood platelets, which can surround tumour cells and effectively hide them from the patient’s immune system.Martling said the results emphasised the need to run genetic tests on all colorectal cancers so patients who stood to benefit from aspirin could be given the drug. “It’s a widely available drug that is extremely inexpensive,” she said.Aspirin has been on the market for more than a century, but taking the drug long-term still has risks. In the trial, four patients had “severe adverse events” potentially linked to aspirin, including allergic reaction, gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding on the brain. Four patients died across both arms of the trial, with one fatality possibly caused by aspirin. Details are published in theNew England Journal of Medicine.Dr Catherine Elliott, director of research atCancerResearch UK, said: “Preventing cancer cases saves lives, and finding new ways to do this is key to our efforts to beat cancer. There is increasing evidence that in certain groups of people, low-dose aspirin can offer protection from bowel cancer.“The Cancer Research UK-funded CaPP3 trial showed a similar effect in people living with Lynch Syndrome, an inherited condition that increases the risk of bowel and other cancer types.“We need larger, high-quality studies like CaPP3 and this recent research to confirm who would most benefit from taking aspirin to help them live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchCancerAspirinHealthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

But thousands of dodos could soon again populate Mauritius, the species’ former home, according to a “de-extinction” company that has announced a major breakthrough in its quest to resurrect the flightless bird.Colossal Biosciences said on Wednesday it has succeeded in growing pigeon primordial germ cells, precursor cells to sperm and eggs, for the first time. This is a “pivotal step” in bringing back the dodo, which was a type of pigeon, for the first time in more than 300 years, according to Colossal.The Texas-based company, which has made splashy headlines for its plans to reestablishwooly mammothsanddire wolves, said it has also developed gene-edited chickens that will act as surrogates for the dodos. The chickens will be injected with primordial germ cells from Nicobar pigeons, the closest living relatives of dodos, which will in time, after gene edits to recreate the create the desired body and head shape, allow them to breed dodos.“Rough ballpark, we think it’s still five to seven years out, but it’s not 20 years out,” Ben Lamm, Colossal’s chief executive, said about the timeline for the dodo’s return. Colossal is working with wildlife groups to identify safe, rat-free sites in Mauritius where the species could once again roam.View image in fullscreenA woolly mammoth at the American Museum of Natural History in New York on 23 October 2023.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP via Getty Images“Our goal is to make enough dodos with enough genetic diversity engineered into them that we can put them back into the wild where they can truly thrive,” he said. “So we’re not looking to make two dodos, we’re looking to make thousands.”Dodos once plodded the forests of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, without predators until humans started killing them in earnest, a process accelerated by European exploration and expansion.Habitat loss and introduced invasive species, such as macaques, pigs and rats that raided dodo nests, sealed the fate of the largely defenseless, fruit-eating bird. The last reliable sighting of a dodo came from a Dutch sailor, who described it as a “kind of very big goose” in 1662.The dodo has since become a byword for extinction but Colossal has said it is confident its methods, centered on itsCrisprgene editing technology, can turn the clock back and return dodos to their former home.Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s scientific chief who has a tattoo of a dodo on her arm, said the “super exciting” breakthrough came following a year of work to gene-edit birds, which are more complex to work on in this way than mammals.“This isn’t a process where we’re going to one day just throw thousands of dodos into Mauritius. Obviously it will be a slow and careful and deliberate process,” said Shapiro.“If we can put back a large ground-dwelling fruit-eating bird, we don’t know all of the consequences of putting them back on this landscape, but we anticipate that we will have some happy surprises.”Some experts, however, have questioned how to define these gene-edited species and what their roles would be in ecosystems degraded by human encroachment and the climate crisis. Leonardo Campagna, an evolutionary biologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said Colossal has made “some remarkable progress” but its dodo work faces numerous challenges.“It’s hard to know what it took to make a dodo genetically, from its genomic architecture to how its genes interacted with the environment,” Campagna said.“Building an organism that looks like what we know the dodo did or behaved, which may not be the complete picture to begin with, including the unique shape of its face, its funny wings or its overall large size is an arduous endeavor.“I’d be curious to see a pigeon like that. But is this in fact the dodo? We need to acknowledge that there is a lot we don’t know and maybe never will.”About 2m species arecurrently at risk of extinction, with animals and plants beingthreatenedby the razing of habitat, rising temperatures, pollution, invasive species and hunting. The current extinction rate is hundreds of timesfasterthan the historic norm, scientists estimate, due to the impact of humanity.While Colossal claims that its technology can aid endangered species rather than just resurrect lost relics, some experts claim its work diverts attention from threats to the natural world.Rich Grenyer, a biologist at the University of Oxford, said de-extinction is a “dangerous” distraction and that gene-edited animals are “at best a sort of simulation, rather like those unnerving animated AI portraits of dead relatives sometimes see people create”.“By labelling genetically engineered modern species as extinct ones brought back from the dead, if it takes off, it’s a huge moral hazard; a massive enabler for the activities that causes species to go extinct in the first place – habitat destruction, mass killing and anthropogenic climate change,” he said.“There’s also of course the question of where you’re going to put your newly engineered hybrids, if they’re not just going to be curiosities in a zoo, because it’s generally the lack of habitat that caused the problem in the first place.”View image in fullscreenColossal’s ‘dire wolf’ pups Romulus and Remus at 15 days old.Photograph: Colossal Biosciences/AFP via Getty ImagesColossal’s ongoing ascent, though, was underlined on Wednesday when it announced it extended its funding round by $120m, with the company now valued at $10.2bn. Celebrity investors, such as Tom Brady, Paris Hilton and Tiger Woods, haveflockedto the the business.Peter Jackson, the Lord of the Rings director and another investor, appeared in a recent Colossalvideoto promote itseffort to de-extinct the moa, an enormous flightless bird once found in Jackson’s native New Zealand.Lamm said Colossal’s activities should act in tandem with other conservation work and that its recent announcements would help inspire people about science.“The dire wolf is a monumental feat of genome engineering that has never been achieved before by any academic lab or by any other company ever, it is literally a testament to science, it’s a Dolly-esque moment full stop,” he said, in reference to the famouslycloned sheep.“These are dodos, and I’m sure there will be some people who say, ‘Oh, well, we don’t like them. We’re not going to call them dodos,’” Lamm said of the latest Colossal project.“Then don’t. We just don’t care, and the more you don’t call them a dodo, the more controversy you drive, the more my numbers go up. So that’s great. So whatever you want to call them, as long as you’re calling them something.”Explore more on these topicsScienceBirdsWildlifeAnimalsAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I told my GP it often takes me three hours or more to fall asleep, she pulled the kind of face you never want to see on a doctor. She scribbled in her notes, and then said the dreaded phrase: “Have you tried sleep hygiene?”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Like most insomniacs, I’ve sleep-hygiened the heck out of my life. I go to bed at the same time every day in a TV-free bedroom with my phone far from reach and, when necessary, my husband in the spare room. Then I lie there, worrying about my failure to be sleep-hygienic enough.Tired of being tired, I craved real help – ideally not in pill form. In the past, sleeping pills have only worked for me in the short term, and weaker sedatives such as first-generation antihistamines make me sleepy but without sending me to sleep. Social media is brimming with supposed miracle cures, includingblueberries,decaf coffeeandtart cherry juice– but do any of them work?I’m willing to try anything that spares me yet another lecture on sleep hygiene, so I put these and other claimed insomnia cures through their paces for the Filter. Here are the ones that sent me into a deep slumber, and those that just sent me round the bend.Why you should trust meI’ve spent three decades reviewing consumer products, fromheated clothes airersto computer software, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims that we can magically improve our lives by buying their stuff.My recent roundups ofmattressesandhay fever remediesincluded a few items that genuinely helped me sleep better (and snore less – did I just say that out loud?). However, as a fiftysomething woman with a solid background in under-sleeping and overthinking, I need more than a nice bed to achieve optimal slumber. This is the product test I’ve been waiting for.How I testedAfter a quick nap, I started by scouring the internet for the drug-free sleep aids everyone’s talking about. Tart cherry juice gets the most attention, but since even the thought of it makes my bladder heavy, I also sought less liquid options, as well as friends’ recommendations.I bought some of the sleep aids on the list for testing and, in a few cases, requested samples from manufacturers. Where these items weren’t eaten, drunk or dissolved in an attempt to get me to sleep, I passed them on to two local charities:Scratch, which collects homewares for people experiencing hardship, andFarplace, which raises money for animal rescue. I initially tested all the products in June, and then re-tested my favourites during the hottest weeks of August, when I needed all the sleep help I could get.During the initial testing phase, the temperature in my bedroom at night was about 16C, perfect for sleep. I was sleeping on theMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000 mattress, among the most comfortable I’ve ever tested. For the August testing period, I slept on afirm Sealy Posturepedic mattress, another winner in the comfort stakes, but night temperatures occasionally climbed to a sleep-destroying 22C.There were other background variables, too.Sleepblows hot and cold with me: some weeks I sleep well overnight and feel mentally energised by day, while other weeks I struggle to rest, work and play. To ensure I compared the products fairly, rather than just liking the ones that happened to coincide with a good sleep week, I tested them all more than once in different weeks.I also had to bear in mind that not all products work in the same way. Some aim to help you fall asleep, while others ensure you stay sleeping until it’s time to wake. I ranked each one on as many criteria as possible, including how quickly I nodded off, how energised I felt the next day, and whether it felt like money well spent.Here’s a chart rundown of the products that helped me get to sleep and stay there. I’ll start by revealing the most successful sleep aids, tailing off to the products that didn’t cure my insomnia but did make it slightly less boring.The sleep aids that worked for meView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alvaro Medina Jurado/Getty ImagesBlackout sleep maskSunshine is a beautiful thing, except when you’re trying to sleep at 4am. One of the worst nights I’ve ever had was in a B&B where the vertical blinds might as well have been made of tissue paper. Street lights kept me awake until 5am, when sunrise took over.If only I’d had a decent sleep mask. The best masks genuinely block out all traces of light without pulling flat or tight across your eyes. I found my perfect match in the MyHalos mask, whose memory foam insert framed my eyes and gave my lashes plenty of space to move while I settled into REM sleep.On my first attempt I didn’t fall asleep much faster than usual, but I woke up in joyous disbelief at the nine (yes, nine!) hours of shut-eye I’d achieved. Once I’d grown used to wearing the mask in bed, it seemed to hasten my ability to nod off, perhaps because my brain had learned to associate it with good sleep.Time to fall asleep:20 minutesTime spent asleep:9 hoursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMyHalos blackout memory foam sleep mask£12.99 at MyHalos£8.49 at AmazonBluetooth sleep bandBoring speech radio is my favourite grownup equivalent to bedtime stories. “Boring” is key; it can’t be anything that engages my mind. The main question is how to get those soporific sounds into my ears without disturbing my husband, Alan, or breaking sleep hygiene bans on bedside phones.Bluetooth sleep bands aim to do the trick by working a whole room away from your phone, and incorporating unobtrusive flat speakers into a headband that doubles as an eye mask. I tried a couple of models, including the new SnoozeBand Silk. Its cooling fabric proved super comfortable – although my hair did get caught in the Velcro – and its controls paired efficiently with my phone via Bluetooth. Twenty-odd minutes of BBC World Service cricket was enough to send me off, but I did wake up briefly an hour later to push the band off my face.Time to fall asleep:20 minutesTime spent asleep:7 hoursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSnoozeBandSilk£99 at SnoozeBandView image in fullscreenMusicozy sleep headphones£17.59 at AmazonMouldable silicone earplugsUnpredictable sounds such as TV, street rabble and 2am helicopters are sleep-killers (I never had kids, which is probably just as well). Sponge earplugs are useless for blocking these noises, but BioEars – recommended by a friend – genuinely work, reducing external sounds by about 22dB.These mouldable silicone blobs are safe and comfortable to wear in bed because they don’t go inside your ear canal, but rather block the entrance to it. While they didn’t help me fall asleep, I did, in fact, slumber in blissful silence through early morning noises, including No 27’s toddler, No 29’s early morning vacuuming, and my cat requesting breakfast (sorry, Iggy).Time to fall asleep:35 minutesTime spent asleep:8 hoursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBioEars soft silicone earplugs£5.55 from BootsLavender pillow spraySmell is an incredibly powerful stimulatory sense, and numerous studies have confirmed the sleep-inducing power of lavender’s scent – including research that focuses on postmenopausal women, like me. A few spritzes of lavender oil-infused spray didn’t knock me out, but the aroma helped calm my racing mind and turned my pillow into a place of peace rather than insomniac dread. The pleasant smell also encouraged me to breathe deeply, which helped me fall asleep in an unusually quick 20 minutes.Time to fall asleep:20 minutesTime spent asleep:6 hoursView image in fullscreenThis Works deep sleep pillow spray, 75ml£21 at John Lewis£25 at M&SView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFeather & Down sweet dream pillow spray, 100ml£8 at BootsMagnesium bath flakesMagnesium, aproven sleep-enhancer, is widely available in supplement form, and you don’t need a prescription. Go easy, though – taking more than 400mg can cause diarrhoea, as readers ofPrince Harry’s squits-and-all memoirmay recall. You could opt for magnesium-rich foods instead, such as spinach and dark chocolate, but you’d have to eat an awful lot of them. So manufacturers have found other ways to up your magnesium, such as bath flakes that allow your body to absorb the mineral as you soak.I added the recommended 250g of salts to a hot bath before bed, and the effect was significant. My body felt heavy and relaxed, and I felt none of the “restless leg” sensations that see me thrashing around after I’ve failed to nod off. However, 250g is a lot of bath flakes (£4.95 at the link below), and there are no bubbles or fragrance to make your bath more enjoyable.Time to fall asleep:30 minutesTime spent asleep:7 hoursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBetterYou magnesium original bath flakes, 250g£4.95 at Better YouNutrition Geeks magnesium glycinate supplement, 90 x 1,800mg capsules£9.99 at AmazonTart cherry juiceThe juice of sour Montmorency cherries is having a moment amongsleep influencers, who claim it’s “a powerhouse of antioxidants, anthocyanin, naturally occurring melatonin, and tryptophan”.It’s also lip-smackingly delicious. If you’re a fan of fruity craft beer, get on this stuff – it’s like a cherry sour, minus the alcohol. It can also genuinely aid sleep, according toscientific studiesand my own experience. I drank a recommended 250ml serving, just under half a pint, an hour before bed for a few nights, and fell asleep faster than average – although I woke briefly at 2am for the inevitable wee.Time to fall asleep:30 minutesTime spent asleep:7 hours with a loo breakView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBiona organic tart cherry juice, 1l£8.25 at Ocado£6.99 at AmazonDark chocolateThis sounds insane. Chocolate is full of caffeine and sugar, two of nature’s greatest stimulants. But it also contains magnesium and tryptophan, which trigger your body to produce the “sleep hormone” melatonin. According to numerousonline chocolate fans, these soporific chemicals far outweigh the stimulants if the chocolate contains at least 70% cocoa.I couldn’t imagine a couple of squares of chocolate having the same effect as magnesium or melatonin supplements, which I’ve found moderately useful for sleep. (Melatonin isn’t licensed for sale in the UK, but it’s on supermarket shelves in mainland Europe.) But I actually slept very well after my four squares (about 30g) of 85% cocoa chocolate at bedtime, finding it soothing and – surprise, surprise – pleasurable.

According toresearch with babies, the rhythmic hum of a car engine is precisely the kind of white noise that enhances sleep.I’m too old to be driven round the block every time I need help dropping off, so I turned instead to the white noise-style soundscapes of the Calm app, whose 180m claimed downloads suggest it’s getting something right. When I streamed its driving-related sleep soundscapes to a Bluetooth speaker from my bedroom-banished phone, it was more like sleeping next to a busy road than in the womb-like ambience of the car. Its nature-themed mixes proved more soothing. The tweety rustling of “Deciduous Forest” rendered me unconscious long before the 30-minute sleep timer switched it off.If no app works for you, perhaps £349 will be money well spent on the “neuroscience-backed” SleepHub device. I found its soundscapes wonderfully relaxing, but I’d want it to bring me breakfast in bed, too, at this price.Time to fall asleep:up to 45 minutesTime spent asleep:7 hoursView image in fullscreenCalm app for Android and iPhoneFrom £13.49 a month (after seven-day free trial) at CalmView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSleepHub£349 at SleepHubView image in fullscreenZello white noise machine£29.99 at Mamas & Papas£29.99 at KiddiesKingdomLow-decibel electric fanToo hot or too cold in bed, and I’m like Goldilocks spitting out her porridge.

I snuggled it, inhaled it (mylavender pillow sprayhelped there), and certainly didn’t want to share it.

Experts, including theBritish Heart Foundation, recommend “switching to decaf coffee (for) a better night’s rest”, but fall short of saying it actually helps sleep.It was worth a try, but I can’t say my milk- and sugar-free mug of decaf had much impact on my snoozing. It still took me well over an hour to drop off, and I woke for about an hour during the night.

Earlier this year, the caped bloodsucker presided over a “comedy of terrors” at the Menier Chocolate Factory. In a few months, Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo willplay every rolein a solo performance based on Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic. But first, writer Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, director Emma Baggott and a cast of six – often bathed in blood-red lighting – deliver a feminist retelling.Stoker’s book comprises sections from the characters’ journals and diaries, plus letters and newspaper reports, compiled by Mina Harker in a bid to fathom and defeat Dracula. This production uses a variety of audio effects to relay those and adds its own equivalent of footnotes, commentaries and what increasingly feel like mini-essays. Repeatedly telling rather than showing, they interrupt the flow of the familiar story, which now comes with more of a narrative from Mina, whose words were marginalised by Stoker.Mina directs or stage-manages a play within the play, the apparent conceit being that those who lived through the original events are now re-enacting them as cautionary tale and trauma therapy. There are some extra gremlins devilling their production, akin toInside No 9: Stage/Fright, while unreliable narrators and twists abound as the script asks who is demonised in our modern age of division.View image in fullscreenBathed in blood red lighting … Dracula.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt’s one of thoseincreasingly commonmeta productions where scenes are conjured out of thin air (much of the set is on wheels, a storage trunk becomes a coffin) only to be swiftly deconstructed and reframed. That stop-start approach not only demands prior knowledge of the novel but also drains the tension in an interval-free show that drags despite a 95-minute running time. The principal problem, though, is that it is only reasonably creepy and scarcely scarier thanKPop Demon Hunters. This is partly due to some jaunty comedy but also because atmosphere (design by Grace Smart, lighting by Joshie Harriette) often comes secondary to analysis and the fixation on how to tell the story becomes a distraction.Nevertheless, Umi Myers is commanding as Mina, although too often stuck in narrator mode, and Mei Mac is compelling as always, if underused, as her friend Lucy, whose character could be yet more expanded. It’s frustrating because there are potent issues raised about the limitations placed on women in the Victorian patriarchy, our own times and the novel itself. (On her first mention in the book, assistant schoolmistress Mina is squarely placed in the kitchen by her fiance, Jonathan, who reminds himself to get her the recipe for a dish he has enjoyed.) There is a particularly modern resonance when Mina challenges how airily men make decisions over women’s bodies, yet characters are too often flatly lampooned (the ensemble is completed by Jack Myers, Phoebe Naughton, Macy Seelochan and B Terry).As in the bloodless vampire psychodramaApex Predator, there are flashes of a far more gripping treatment of the core idea. These come, maddeningly, at the end of the evening. With illusions by John Bulleid and Gareth Kalyan, it’s a tricksy production but – despite all the talent involved – not much of a treat.AtLyric Hammersmith, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreBram StokerHorror booksMorgan Lloyd MalcolmLyric HammersmithFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the worst time for manipulative, inflammatory television like thisLucy ManganWed 17 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt is 18 years since three-year-oldMadeleine McCanndisappeared without trace from the apartment block in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where her family were holidaying. The suffering of her parents, Kate and Gerry, then and since is unimaginable. It is not clear whether the new documentary Madeleine McCann: Searching for the Prime Suspect was made with their blessing or not. But here it is – an hour-long film led by criminologist Dr Graham Hill, who has been involved in the case since the beginning, about the possible connections between convicted sex offender Christian Brückner and the child’s disappearance. It attempts to evaluate the likelihood that he took and, as the German police investigating him firmly believe, though he denies any involvement with Madeleine, killed her.“There are millions of men with a sexual interest in children. But only a very rarefied group of men who will abduct, sexually assault and then murder that child,” says Hill. It only gets bleaker from there. In 2007, he was a senior detective with Surrey police and arrived in Portugal three days after Madeleine went missing, as part of the UK’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre’s response to the unfolding situation. At their first meeting, Gerry McCann asked him how likely it was that Madeleine was alive. According to statistics, Hill told him, abducted children are usually dead within three to six hours of being taken.The bulk of the hour lays out a story familiar both from coverage of the case and from programmes like this about all manner of terrible cases since. Hill was concerned from the beginning about flaws in the police investigation, and especially by the Portuguese force focusing so quickly on the McCann parents as suspects, instead of casting the net as wide as possible to see who else was in the vicinity with a history of offending that would suggest danger.Other missed details and incomplete records meant that Brückner, despite living nearby and having convictions for indecent exposure in front of young girls, was not identified as a possible suspect until he was convicted in Germany in 2017, and sentenced to 15 months in jail, for the sexual abuse of a five-year-old girl and possession of indecent images of her, that he had made, and others that he had collected. His name had also arisen as part of a German investigation into paedophile rings. Online chat transcripts of him fantasising abouthis desire to“capture something small and use it for days” and documenting “exactly how she’s being tortured” were found, along with a bag full of USB sticks showing him and others engaging in appalling sex crimes with children.In 2020, while he was serving a seven-year sentence for the rape of an adult woman in the same area of the Algarve, German police announced he was also their prime suspect for the murder of Madeleine McCann. A criminal acquaintance claims Brückner told him “she didn’t scream” when they saw a report about the missing child on television. In 2024, Brückner was acquitted of three other rapes and two charges of child sexual abuse after evidence, including the USB sticks, was excluded for technical irregularities regarding the search warrant, and concerns were raised about potentially prejudicial media coverage. He has just been released from prison after serving the seven-year sentence, without enough evidence currently available to bring charges for the child’s murder.Which, if we put all the horror aside for one moment, raises the question: what is this documentary for? What purpose does it serve? It has an exploitative, voyeuristic feel from the beginning – not helped by Hill’s appearance in Sky’s 2022 true-crime series The Murder Detective – and the increasing emotiveness of the assertions that accrue as it goes on make it an increasingly uncomfortable experience. Will this not jeopardise future charges or convictions, as media attention apparently did in 2024? Are they trying to tell us that conviction by the court of public opinion is the best to be hoped for here? Are we really so far gone that this is now to be held out as an option?It ends with one of the women who testified as a victim in Brückner’s 2024 trial saying: “The idea for him to be the last person, potentially, that little girl would have seen in her world – it’s horrendous.” The programme makers borrow her anguish to obscure the double remove we are now at from facts, to manipulate viewers and inflame furies at a time currently so febrile, when rigorous reporting of verifiable truths instead of feelings has never been more important. This is not how wrongs get righted – let alone wrongs of the most harrowing, grievous kind.Madeleine McCann: Searching for the Prime Suspect aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionMadeleine McCannCrimereviewsShareReuse this content"

He never built a swaggering, colourful masterpiece like Renzo Piano andRichard Rogers’s Pompidou Centre. He did not shape the international architectural language of global modernism in the way that Norman Foster has done. But Grimshaw did have the ability to temper his excitement for the potential of shiny, machine-made precision with a passion for skilful craftsmanship at a highly detailed level.He put the two together to build the remarkable international terminal at Waterloo Station, London, in 1993. Its skeletal, serpentine roof demonstrates Grimshaw’s fascination for the exposed structures of gothic cathedrals and the Victorian daring of Joseph Paxton and Brunel that he always loved. Structurally, Waterloo’s roof was the product of the engineering brilliance of Grimshaw’s long-term collaboratorTony Hunt. But it was Grimshaw and his team who lovingly oversaw the fabrication of every component and left them almost unnervingly exposed, like the giant bones of the dinosaur fossils in the Natural History Museum. Grimshaw himself said that his architecture “glorifies construction, and the beauty of the way things go together”.It was Grimshaw’s blend of enthusiasms that made hisEden Projectin Cornwall such a huge and popular success when it opened in 2001. It became a visitor attraction even before a single plant come into bloom in its huge greenhouses.View image in fullscreenGrimshaw in 2004, the year he became president of the Royal Academy of Arts.Photograph: Daniel Lynch/ShutterstockInspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller, the maverick American author of Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, who had planned to cover most of Manhattan with a menacing-looking geodesic dome in order to protect the city from pollution, Grimshaw took what was an awful dystopian warning, and used it to create a welcoming landmark. His and Hunt’s cluster of geodesic steel structures, supporting inflatable transparent cells that could control the climate, transformed an abandoned china clay pit into a sprawling indoor landscape of subtropical gardens and rainforests, and reignited the economy of a faltering Cornish community.For Grimshaw, the high tech approach was the way to turn the messy, earthbound and mud-soaked business of architecture into a kind of magic trick. He wanted to use modern materials to create lightweight, prefabricated components that could be put together in an instant, such as the Meccano construction kits that he had played with as a child.Born in Hove, he was the son of Joan (nee Dearsley), a painter, and Thomas Grimshaw, an engineer. He went to Wellington college, in Berkshire, then studied architecture at Edinburgh College of Art and the Architectural Association in London. On graduation in 1965 he set up the Farrell Grimshaw Partnership with Terry Farrell. Their first commission was to turn a terrace of 19th-century houses near Paddington station into a student hostel. They craned in an ingenious free-standing steel, plastic and glass tower supporting a spiral ramp that contained enough bathrooms to service the whole block. Fuller came to see it for himself, and was impressed. Grimshaw, with his dandyish style, trademark blue spectacles, and flowing cavalier locks seemed to represent the fashionable London of the time.He and Farrell went on to build a pioneering co-operative block of flats overlooking Regent’s Park, in which they both lived with their families for a period. Its crinkly metal skin was modelled on a Citroën van. It was followed by a stream of successful industrial buildings, including the Herman Miller factory in Bath and a number of social housing projects.View image in fullscreenThe Eden Project, Cornwall.Photograph: travelbild/AlamyWhile his contemporaries began to explore other ideas, Grimshaw’s architectural language stayed fundamentally consistent. His inspirations were naked aluminium, the imagery of the airship and the Airstream caravan. It was his determination to stick with one end of the architectural spectrum that contributed to his break-up with Farrell in the late 70s. The partnership ended, but both of them went on to build highly successful practices in their own ways.Grimshaw got his first project outside Britain when Rolf Fehlbaum, owner of the Vitra furniture company, asked him to plan a new industrial campus in Weil am Rhein, Germany, in 1981, setting the scene for work byZaha Hadid, Frank Gehry and Tadao Ando. In 1988 Grimshaw built an impressive printing works for the Financial Times, and the practice later designed massive new airports for St Petersburg and Istanbul, as well as acar factory for Rolls-Royceand the National Space Centre in Leicester.When journalists asked Grimshaw about the “high tech” label that he was unable to escape, he would shrug. “Everybody should be building with the technology of their own age – the Edwardians were very high tech. It’s the way you look at how materials are put together that matters. To me, that is what makes for real architecture as opposed to scenery. Quinlan Terry once said he didn’t care what his buildings were made of so long as they looked Georgian. That just the opposite of what I’m about.”Grimshaw was always more interested in performance than in style or the symbolic meanings of architecture. “I like to think our approach is one you’d get from a good boat builder. It’s not the same boat every time, but you recognise that it’s from the same mind and hands.”Like so many architects, Grimshaw took real pleasure in sailing. He kept his boat in Norfolk, and treated sailing as much a research topic as a hobby. In one of his former studios, the main staircase was fabricated from an aluminium yacht mast. “What I find fascinating about boat design is that you can’t muck around … A boat has to be a boat, if it is not, it sinks. The appeal is the absolute functionality. And boats are beautiful because of that,” he told me.View image in fullscreenThe Financial Times building, East India Dock House, 1988.Photograph: Bildarchiv Monheim GmbH/AlamyGrimshaw’s buildings have proved both functional and impressively adaptable. The FT print building is a data centre now. Miller’s furniture factory houses several departments of Bath Spa University.Architecture is not an easy profession. When Grimshaw decided to stand for election as president of the Royal Academy, aged 65, he confessed that he had begun to weary of the more bureaucratic aspects of architectural practice. “I’ve been an architect for 40 years, and 80% of it is a battle. There are battles on-site, over legal issues, over financial matters, and with the client.” His spa project that was meant to be a glamorous new attraction for Bath remained empty and unused for several years because oflegal wrangles with the contractor. There were also technical and legal issues at Waterloo station. Grimshaw’s plans for remodelling the Royal College of Art had to be abandoned, even though it had planning permission, when a wealthy neighbour threatened a legal challenge that the RCA could not afford to contest.Grimshaw was a highly effective president of the Royal Academy from 2004, bringing calm and stability to what was then a troubled organisation. He put in place financial controls and a professional management structure. He was also generous, making use of the role to give another architect the chance to excel – he abandoned the institution’s previous over-ambitious £50m plan to integrate the former Museum of Mankind building in Burlington Gardens with the Royal Academy,clearing the way for David Chipperfield’s successful remodelling.Grimshaw was knighted in 2002, elected as president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2004 and awarded the RIBA gold medal for architecture in 2019, the year in which he handed over the chairmanship of the practice that he had founded.He married Lavinia Russell in 1972, and she survives him, as do his two daughters, Isabel and Chloe.Nicholas Grimshaw, architect, born 9 October 1939; died 15 September 2025Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe RIBAEden ProjectobituariesShareReuse this content"

Now a twice Sag-award nominated stunt performer, with credits on Doctor Who, Gladiator II and Deadpool and Wolverine, 35-year-old Hussain has her heart set on becoming “the female Keanu Reeves slash Jason Statham”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As part of Hussain’s aim to tackle the lack of representation of south Asian women in the action arena, she joined with Malaysian-British director Jade Ang Jackman to co-found the film collective Babes With Blades. In January, they took over the Rio cinema in London’s Dalston during the London short film festival to showcase a series of action shorts; these included FKA Twigs’ swordsmanship inSad Day, and Nida Manzoor’s teen action-comedy7.2. Babes With Blades has also started a print magazine; and taught classes to children from low income households the basics of boxing.View image in fullscreen‘We certainly did not have the money to ride growing up’ … Ayesha Hussain.Photograph: PR IMAGEThe pair met five years ago when Jackman was looking for the next generation of women of colour in action, and reached out to Hussain about filming a documentary about her life. In the process of making it, they soon became friends. “In most male-dominated fields, in order to be visible you are taught there can only be one. It’s a very competitive thing and it creates competitive edges that make women kind of drown each other out or to use each other as rungs on the ladder,” says Hussain. That’s the complete opposite for what Babes With Blades is all about. “We just constantly uplift each other.”The resulting short documentary,The Croydon Cowgirl, made in collaboration with Levi’s, follows Hussain learning to ride a horse during her training for the British Stunt Register. “We certainly did not have the money to ride growing up,” says Hussain, who first got on a horse at 30. The coach at the stables put her on a pony that needed breaking in. “We often laugh about this. He was unsold at the time because he was deemed too fiery to ride. She obviously heard I was a stuntwoman and was like, ‘Well, you’re either going to learn to ride or you’re going to die.’”Hussain was introduced to cowboy culture through an ex-boyfriend, who was a circus performer. But she soon learned that Hollywood’s eurocentric vision of white cowboys wasn’t accurate. “I realised that post-civil war, the only jobs that were left to people that were soldiers or freed slaves was being a cowboy. So one in every four cowboys was black and I was like, ‘Wow I kind of want to be part of that representation as a brown person.’”That mission is at the core of Babes With Blades. “We are creating visibility for women that are mavericks in whatever their career is, whether it be, you know, action, or sport,” says Hussain. Jackman says that the name of the collective is a “tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that for so long in action, women had less lines than they had clothes on, and that you were kind of the sidekick, the hot girl.”View image in fullscreen‘We just constantly uplift each other’ … Jade Ang Jackman and Ayesha Hussain.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty Images for Warner BrosJackman adds: “Themes of family and femininity are never broken out of. Women are always vengeful because their whole family has been murdered or they have been raped. I was starting to question: what other stories might we have for women in the action genre?”Jackman’s mum is half Malaysian-Chinese and so growing up she says she was exposed to the “amazing female leads” of Hong Kong cinema, where women played “pithy characters and not only sidekicks to men”. She was particularly enamoured with Michelle Yeoh, who grew up in her mother’s home town, and is known for performing most of her own stunts in Hong Kong martial arts films The Heroic Trio (1993) and The Stunt Woman (1996); as well as Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning drama Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At 60, Yeoh won an Oscar for Everything Everywhere All At Once, where she handled most of the fight choreography.Even with the surge of feminist horror movies such as The Substance, representation in action cinema is still lagging behind, says Jackman. “There are more and more diverse roles coming for women of colour but these actresses were not necessarily getting action acting roles, or work as stunt doubles,” she says.In many ways, Hussain says, it was inevitable that she has followed her path; she comes from aline of Rajputs– warrior clans in India that were known for training women in sword combat. But growing up in Croydon in a working-class family with immigrant parents, who were very driven towards an academic version of success, “any pursuits of athleticism were not really on the radar”, says Hussain. As a child, she says, she wanted to be a doctor.“Not seeing people like myself on screen,” she adds, meant “there was nothing to really look up to and be like, oh, that’s possible for me.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her dedication paid off. By the time the march reached her on Saturday afternoon, she was sitting on a wall outside Downing Street, the little girls in camping chairs at her feet, engrossed in their iPads.She had unfurled two banners. One said “Keir Starmer is a wanker” and the other read: “We’re not far right, we are England’s mothers and we will not stay silent. Stop the rape of our children, mothers across Britain are taking a stand.”I asked her why she was there and she looked incredulous. Wasn’t it obvious? “Because Keir Starmer’s a wanker.” Why? “He’s taking our speech away.” Even though you’re allowed to sit outside his house and call him a wanker?“Well he is.”As for the other sign, she made it, she said, “because I’m not far right and I’m sick of being called it. I’m sick of coming to places like this and being called far right. I am here for the right reasons today, for the future of these children. People are coming in illegally and raping our kids and it’s got to stop.”I went toTommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rallyon Saturday to record an episode of the Guardian’s daily podcast,Today in Focus. Robinson called it “the biggest freedom of speech” rally in British history. Others, like Hope Not Hate, prefer todescribe it as“Britain’s largest ever far-right protest”. Unsurprisingly – with the exception of one jovial Welshman who said “well, my viewsarefar right” – no one I met thinks of themselves in that way. “We’re just right,”I heard, over and over. As in: correct.There is no doubt that many of the speakers at the rally were racist, with many delivering variations on the“great replacement” conspiracy theory. Robinson told the crowd: “It’s not just Britain that is being invaded, it’s not just Britain that is being raped. Every single western nation faces the same problem: an orchestrated, organised invasion and replacement of European citizens is happening.”But most of the110,000 marcherscouldn’t hear the speeches. Many couldn’t even fit on to Whitehall to see the big screens. I didn’t get the impression they were there for the speakers anyway: this was about being heard themselves.A few wore their racism with pride, like the man with the misspelled sign that read: “Why are white people dispised when our tax money pays for everything.” But mostly these were “ordinary people” with “ordinary jobs” who “care about our kids”, who said time and again that they’d “had enough”. Usually it was about immigration. But often it wasn’t just that. They’d had enough of a Britain they felt was no longer working.Instead of blamingyears of Tory austerity, or a capitalist system rigged against the little guy, for these people, “illegal immigrants” were to blame. And Starmer was the bogeyman. “Look what he’s done to the farmers, inheritance tax, you know, the NHS is down on its knees,” said a man from Norfolk. “We have potholes in the roads, we can’t get GP appointments, people are actually left in the hallways of some of the NHS hospitals and are not seen to for hours and they’re in critical condition. This country is becoming a joke.”For him it was personal: “I’m starting to lose my teeth, right, because I’m a type 1 diabetic. And it’s the struggle of me trying to get my teeth replaced because of my diabetes. They don’t help people like me. But they would help someone that steps foot on our land from a dinghy and gets everything.”No one used the words “asylum seeker” or “refugee”. It was “illegals” and “fighting age men”. All tarred with the actions of a tiny number of people, like the man in the Bell Hotel in Epping, who was found guilty of sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl and a woman.Everyone claimed that they didn’t have a problem withlegalimmigration: the millions of people who have come to the UK with visas, to study or work. They weren’t blamed for putting pressure on services. Just the people who arrived on small boats – who made up just 4% of arrivals in 2024.I left the rally when too many people on Whitehall were getting aggy and I realised the police had shut off all the side roads, making a quick escape impossible. Since leaving I’ve been grappling with how best to describe what I saw and heard. It was a far-right rally, yes, but many people attended unperturbed by the fact it had been billed as such by many media outlets,including the Guardian. They did not feel alienated by such an extreme, and previously fringe, label. In his speech, Robinson said something that I fear may be true. “They tried to silence us for 20 years with labels,” he said. “‘Racist’, ‘Islamophobe’, ‘far right’. They don’t work any more!”When the far right becomes the mainstream right, what language do we have to describe what is happening? How have conditions led to so many feeling unheard, frustrated and angry? Until the foundations of Britain are fixed – the NHS, schools, potholes, fuel prices – I can’t see this movement doing anything other than growing.Helen Pidd is a presenter of Today in Focus, the Guardian’s award-winning daily podcastThis article was amended on 17 September 2025 to reflect the offences of which the Epping hotel resident was convicted.Explore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionTommy RobinsonProtestLondonImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

The international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague has yet to issue its final ruling inthe genocide case that South Africabrought against Israel last year.Politically, however, thislatest report(officially a “conference room paper”, intended to aid discussion of the themes) may prove to be one of the final nails in the coffin of the shameless but still-continuing narrative from Netanyahu and his allies that any talk of Israeli crimes is part of an antisemitic plot – or, to use Netanyahu’s favourite phrase, “ablood libel”.The commission of inquiry’s findings now stand alongside those ofAmnesty International,Human Rights Watchand the respected Israeli groupsB’TselemandPhysicians for Human Rights–Israel, who have all published authoritative and detailed reports concluding that Israel is committing genocide in the two years since the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023. UN experts andgenocide scholarshave reached the same conclusion.Even when so many have already spoken, however, a UN commission of inquiry brings a particular stamp of authority. The chair of the commission on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel isNavi Pillay, a former president of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. When I first met her, she was a respected UN high commissioner for human rights – not exactly a “Hamas proxy”, to quote Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva when he accused the authors of the report of a “libellous rant”.Keir Starmer’s government has previously said it cannot talk of genocide until “a competent court” (in other words, the ICJ) has given its final judgment. The commission’s findings make clear that line is wholly unsustainable for the prime minister formerly known as a human rights lawyer. “Prevention of genocide” is – as Starmer well knows – a key element ofthe 1948 genocide convention; the president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars is one of many who have pointed out that states arealready failingin that regard.If Labour admitted there is a genocide in Gaza, it would have to admit its own hand in it | Owen JonesRead moreThe commission’s conclusions expose the moral failure of states that were rightly proud to create theinternational criminal court(ICC) in Rome in 1998 but now seek to undermine the rulings of that same court (the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals, while the ICJ addresses the responsibilities of states, including on genocide). The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, hassaid it would be “absurd” to detain Netanyahu, despite the arrest warrant that judges unanimously approved for the Israeli leader for alleged crimes against humanity. France insisted itwould be inappropriate to arrest Netanyahuif he came to Paris (despite applauding the earlier arrest warrant for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin).The commission of inquiry’s conclusion that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu and his government are committing genocide means that governments’ continued refusal to cooperate with the ICC, and refusal to execute its arrest warrants for crimes against humanity, is illogical and dangerous. As part of the Donald Trump-Netanyahu axis of impunity and their shared determination to destroy the ICC, Trump has imposed sanctions on ICC prosecutors, judges and others – including, most recently, on Al-Haq and other respectedPalestinian human rights groupswhose only crime is to have documented the crimes committed by others.An experienced former British military prosecutor was eventually forced to resign from his post as principal trial lawyer at the ICC after death threats and more, saying this had been “the worst few months of my life”. Investigations by the Israeli-Palestinian+972 Magazine,theGuardianand others have revealed the extraordinary lengths that Netanyahu has been ready to go to, including alleged phone taps and attempted blackmail, in order to sabotage the court’s work.The crimes against humanity that Netanyahu stands accused of at the ICC should in any case not be seen as a lesser crime than genocide. Crimes against humanity – which includeapartheid, extermination and forcible transfer of population– differ from genocide not by being less serious but only because of the “special intent” that forms part of genocide.Britain, France, Canada and others are alldue to recognise Palestinian statehoodnext week, following 147 countries which have already done so. Together with the latest genocide findings, that will add to the pressure on Netanyahu, who admitshow isolated his countryhas now become.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There must be consequences for the crimes committed, too – no matter whether those accused of committing the crimes are considered friend or foe. Starmer and other European leaders have rightly been ready to face Trump down in the context of the US president’s dangerous love-in with Putin. But the destruction of the ICC would have incalculable consequences. Once crushed, the court could never be put back together again. Starmer needs to confront Trump directly on these themes this week; the trampling of justice can’t be left to one side, any more than Trump’s earlierhumiliation of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, could be ignored.To quote Tom Fletcher, the former UK ambassador to Beirut and now UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, events in Gaza are a “21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness”. Echoing the earlier words of the international court of justice, Fletcher called on governments to “prevent genocide”.

He offered the BBC the rights to broadcast it live, but the corporation was nervous. Mandela had been in jail since 1962 and, to the extent that he was a well-known figure, he had beenbranded a “terrorist”. Hollingsworth met BBC executive Alan Yentob, who was wavering. “Alan,” Tony said, “you’ve got to bite the bullet.” Eventually Yentob agreed, replying: “I’ll give you five hours. If the bill improves, I’ll increase the time.”Conservative MPs were soon organising a parliamentary motion, deploring the BBC’s editorial decision. Opponents of Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) were right to be worried about the concert. The event was broadcast to a global audience of 600 million people, it made Mandela a household name around the world and, in all probability, hastened his release. Oliver Tambo, then president of the ANC, told Hollingsworth the concert was “the greatest single event we have undertaken in support of the struggle.”View image in fullscreenThe Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium in London, 11 June 1988.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyThe concert worked because, then as now, politics sits downstream of culture. The stories we tell ourselves and each other are how we develop and share our feelings about this world – and other possible worlds. This gives our storytellers – writers, musicians, artists, actors – incredible power to shape the space in which politicians are able to operate.Which brings us toGaza.More than any other conflict since the birth of the modern communications age, more so even than South Africa in the 1980s, the Israeli occupation of Palestinehas been conducted with words and images as well as with bullets and bombs. And for that reason, those artists who oppose the occupation and advocate for justice for Palestinians have been subjected to a cynical, pernicious censorship designed to severely narrow the scope of the stories they can tell.Examples abound. Last year there was aconcerted campaignby supporters of Israeli policy to have Jewish film-maker Jonathan Glazer cancelled. Actor Melissa Barrera wasdropped by a Hollywood production companyafter she posted on social media referring to “genocide” in Gaza. Multiple artists in Germany have had their exhibitions terminated for making entirely defensible critiques of the Israeli government. And the BBC recentlyrefused to showa remarkable documentary about Gaza’s health workers because its broadcast would have risked “theperceptionof partiality” (my italics). It was eventually shown to great acclaim on Channel 4.The BBC’s recent cowardice is the product of a wall of fear constructed by supporters of Israeli government policy, designed to punish those artists whose stories might mould a different culture, one with the power to radically change our politics. But that fear is abating.Take, for example, Together for Palestine, a concertto be held tonight at Wembley Arena– the huge indoor auditorium next to the stadium that hosted that Mandela birthday concert 37 years ago. I and others have been working for a year to bring the concert to life. Even finding a venue proved challenging: the mere mention of the word “Palestine” was a near-certain precursor to refusal. (I wonder what the reaction would have been had it been called Together for Ukraine?) But at some point in the past few months, something changed. Wembley signed a contract, YouTube finally consented to streaming the event, and – most importantly – artists agreed to appear.And so this evening, Wembley hosts the biggest cultural event in support of Palestinian rights since the destruction of Gaza began. Some 12,000 tickets sold out in two hours. Appearing on stage will be, among many others, Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Guy Pearce, musicians Bastille, James Blake, PinkPantheress and Damon Albarn – and Palestinian artists such as Saint Levant and Elyanna. The concert will be opened by Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories,recently sanctioned by the Trump administration.Five years ago, perhaps even as recently as this time last year, it would have been impossible to imagine dozens of notable global artists coming together to support Palestine. But the brutality of Israel’s assault on Gaza, itsdeliberate starvation of the population, and the unabashed public statements of Israeli ministers advocating ethnic cleansing have combined to create deep cracks in the wall of fear. I’m not sure the Israeli government, or indeed the wider Israeli populace, quite understands the extent to which the censorious policing of commentary around Palestine is breaking down. Indeed, the greater risk to some artists’ reputations may now come fromnotspeaking out on Palestine.One foundation of that wall of fear has been the association of the words “Palestine” and “terror” – the result of a deliberate, decades-long campaign to conflate the two. That same conflation was made in the 1980s with Nelson Mandela. Looking back now, it seems preposterous that debate around South African apartheid could have been so effectively policed by its proponents. But times change. What was once disputed can suddenly become suffused with moral clarity, with advocates for one side left stranded on the wrong side of history. In 2006 the then-Tory leader, David Cameron, said his fellow Conservatives were“wrong” in their approach to apartheid. He praised Mandela as “one of the greatest men alive.”Maybe one day future leaders of western political parties will issue a similar mea culpa for their complicity in the brutal violence currently being inflicted on Palestinian families. It will be too late to save manytens of thousandsof civilian victims of this war. But if there is a reckoning it might be, in part at least, because actors, artists, writers and musicians helped us to see Palestinians as human beings, as much deserving of respect and protection as their Israeli neighbours.As the Egyptian-Canadian writer Omar El Akkad says, one day everyone will have always been against this.Brian Eno is a musician, artist, composer and producerExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionBrian EnoPalestinian territoriesDamon AlbarnIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaNelson MandelacommentShareReuse this content"

I’m sorry, but I disagree with the newest suggestion...Adrian ChilesA research paper says people are more likely to believe you if you use long words when asking for forgiveness. I prefer to keep it simpleWed 17 Sep 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 13.25 EDTShareAbloke in a service station once said something really horrible to me. But he swiftly followed it up with one of the most sincere apologies I’ve ever been on the end of. This was at Hopwood Park services on the M42, years ago. I’d just pulled up at the pump. Clocking me, he knocked on the passenger window, and when I opened it he stuck his head in and said something vile. It could have been classed as banter, I suppose, but it was still vile. My two young children were in the back, all wide-eyed in bafflement. Upset more than angry, I got out, filled up and went to pay, only to find him waiting by the car when I returned. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, “I’m sorry mate. I didn’t know you had your kids in the car. I apologise for that.” There was something about the last four words which made the difference, somehow adding just the right amount of emphasis.I wasn’t particularly pleased to have such a memory stirred this week when I read about a research paper,published by the British Psychological Society, on how the length of the words you use when you make an apology are important in conveying your sincerity. Apologies always fascinate me because, as far as I can see, without contrition on one side and forgiveness on the other, we’re all doomed.At middle school I had a science teacher who talked about the concept of decay. He said if leaves didn’t decay, we’d be up to our armpits in them. I feel the same about apologies – if they’re not made and accepted, we’ll all be up to our armpits in bad stuff. Accordingly, I’m one of those people whose anger and disappointment about something somebody has said or done will usually disappear the moment somebody says sorry. I don’t know whether this makes me a nice person, or rather shallow. Conversely, if I’m the one doing the apologising, and the apology isn’t accepted, I get very angry and disappointed indeed, which isn’t really cricket either.How sorry are you? Why learning to apologise well could save your relationshipsRead moreThe study, which looked at written rather than verbal sorries, concludes that people who use longer words in their apologies are more likely to communicate sincerity. So, saying you’re “genuinely” sorry is better than “really” sorry. Apparently the “greater production effort” involved in delivering those two extra syllables does make a slight difference. By this measure, the French are way ahead of us. They really do put their backs into their apologies. When the French for a simple “I am sorry” is something as dramatic and rather beautiful as “Je suis désolé”, you wonder where they go from there. What do you say if you feel more than merely desolate about whatever you’re saying sorry for? A friend of mine in Paris says he’d go for “Je vous prie d’accepter mes excuses les plus sincères”, meaning, “I beg you to accept my most sincere apologies”. Now that’s what I call a production effort. OK, whatever, chill out, je vous pardonne, no problem.Be it in person or on the page, for me less is more. Just “sorry” will do. “I am sorry”, if you must. And OK, if you’ve really done me over you can throw in a very, a genuinely, or even an abjectly. But any more than that and I’ll start to suspect you have wronged me more badly than I realised.I should say that, as with most academic papers, much of the language in which this one is written is quite beyond me. For example, something called iconicity keeps coming up. There are 290,000 words defined in my Chambers dictionary, and iconicity isn’t one of them. But I pressed on regardless and hope I’ve got the gist of it over correctly. If I haven’t, perhaps Shiri Lev-Ari, cognitive psychologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, could get in touch so I can apologise to her at whatever length she desires.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteOpinionPsychologycommentShareReuse this content"

It will play more than 100 of Trump’s lies or misleading statements in a segment called Trump v The Truth. All his greatest hits, from false claims about the price of eggs to disgusting lies about the US spending millions on condoms for Hamas, packaged together.Obviously we’ve got to be fair and balanced here, though, haven’t we? Gotta show both sides. So I think it’s only right that Channel 4 also broadcast a 10-second segment covering all of the truthful and astute things the president has said. It’s not just lies, lies, lies: occasionally the man can be surprisingly wise. Only this week, for example,a video circulated onlineof Trump telling attendees of a gala at one of his golf clubs: “Smart people don’t like me, you know?” He added: “And they don’t like what we talk about.” No lies detected there.Channel 4 to mark Trump’s UK visit with ‘longest uninterrupted reel of untruths’Read moreAnd then there are Trump’s thoughts on the fate of his immortal soul. Last month, early on a Tuesday morning, the presidentdialled into Fox & Friendsand said he is trying to stop the war in Ukraine so that God can save him a spot in paradise. “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible,” he explained. “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.” While it’s impossible to fact-check exactly where Trump is on God’s waiting list, I suspect he has made a correct assessment of the situation. And I think all the dead children in Gaza, which Trump has said he wants the US to take over and turn into a luxury resort, might agree.Trump has also been blunter about the political process than some of his predecessors. While running forpresident in 2015, he matter-of-factly said that he had used his money to influence politicians. “I gave to many people before this,” he said during a Republican candidates’ debate. “And you know what, when I need something from them two years later … I call them. They are there for me. That’s a broken system.” Truer words have never been spoken; certainly not by Trump.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its conclusion is unsurprising, with few states in history having been so brazen about their intentions. To take just two examples: in May, theIsraeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”;a week later, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza, and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return”.At the beginning of this month, Labour’s deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary, David Lammy,wrote a letterto the chair of the international development committee, Sarah Champion, declaring that “the government has carefully considered the risk of genocide”, and has not concluded that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. How can two bodies come to such different endpoints? The British government has not come to a conclusion on genocide, because if it was to, it would have to face up to its complicity.Israel launches ground offensive deep inside Gaza CityRead moreAt the level of foreign and military policy, the British government works in alignment with the US, Israel’s strongest ally. The UK continues tosupply Israelwith crucial components for the F-35 jets incinerating Gaza and its people.Israeli planesinvolved in this bombing have been allowed to land in the UK. The UK government continuesto share intelligencewith Israel. Britain operatesrelentless surveillance flightsover Gaza. And rather than impose sweeping sanctions, British ministers facilitate trade withIsrael worth £6bna year.While Israeli president Isaac Herzog – whose genocidal utterances aboutcollective Palestinian guiltwere repeated by soldiers on the ground – is awarded thehonour of an official visit, hundreds of peaceful protesters holding placards opposing genocidehave been arrestedas though they are dangerous extremists.Every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public. After all,seven in 10 British peoplethink it’s likely Israel has committed war crimes,a majoritysupports an arms embargo,only a fifththink Israel’s attack on Gaza is justified,and over halfsupport Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sanctioning two of the most extreme Israeli ministers – the aforementioned Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – makes no impact on the state’s genocidal war machine, and recognising a Palestinian state amounts to nothing more than a welcome symbolic gesture.The lives of those living in Gaza are deemed less important than maintaining relations with Israel and, by proxy, the US. At the personal level, on Labour’s doorsteps, this approach plays out in the most callous of ways. Dalloul al-Neder is a Palestinian refugee from Gaza, who was a constituent of the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. He got to know her, meeting several times:she visited his takeaway shopin 2019 and posed for pictures, declaring “Palestine must be free”. She took him on a tour of parliament.View image in fullscreenDalloul al-Neder, who lives in Manchester, with an image of his late mother – he has lost several family members in Gaza bombings.Photograph: Sean Hansford/MEN MediaWithin weeks of the genocide beginning, in October 2023, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two young nieces were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Desperate to evacuate his wife and four-month-old daughter – who had been buried under rubble three times by Israeli attacks – he emailed Rayner twice to seek help evacuating his family. He says received no response.In January 2024, he attended a Labour fundraiser in Stockport addressed by Rayner and her colleague, Jonathan Reynolds, and got to his feet, clutching pictures of his dead mother, begging her to support a ceasefire, emotionally declaring “I lost my family in Gaza”. The whole tawdry episode is on camera: he was aggressively ejected from the meeting and on to the street. Rayner did nothing, except to say “thank you, you’ve made your point”. She then unfollowed him on social media. Days later, she wasinterviewed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby, who framed the incident as an example of the threats politicians face, linking it to the murder of the MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Since then, so many of Neder’s relatives have been slaughtered by the Israeli state that their names take up three pages of a notebook.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel deepened its disregard for international conventions bysending 10 fighter jets to Qatar, bombing a Hamas delegation participating in ceasefire talks in Doha. The last meaningful forum for diplomatic negotiation may now have gone up in smoke.At least 19 Russian drones violated Poland’s airspace. For the first time in its history, Nato airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a Nato country. Whetherthe incursionwas a technical mishap or deliberate probing by Moscow, as western experts believe, this was “the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said.And then Charlie Kirk, a firebrand conservative activist and close Donald Trump ally,was shot deadwhile addressing college students and Maga supporters at a Utah university. Without evidence of the shooter’s identity or motives, Trump immediately blamed “those on the radical left,” accusing them of rhetoric “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”Asked how the divided nation could heal after Kirk’s assassination, Trump said he “couldn’t care less”. His explanation for that was chilling: “The radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy.” This is how polarisation hardens into tribalism. This is how the spiral of hatred accelerates toward a point of no return.In reality, more than three-quarters of all extremist-related killings in the US over the last 10 years havecome from rightwing extremists, with the radical left responsible for only a fraction of them. Trump condemned political violence in general the following day – but did not acknowledge therecent spate of attacksagainst Democrats, including several killings. To him, the problem is always “them”, never the “wonderful Americans” who make up his base.The political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk’s death will no doubt unfold in the coming weeks, but the biggest danger in a polarised climate is that the shooting becomes the Reichstag fire of our age. That arson attack on27 February 1933 marked Germany’s pivot from fragile democracy to outright dictatorship. Hitler, freshly installed as chancellor, seized the moment to extinguish the freedoms of the Weimar constitution – expression, press, association, assembly.“Anyone who stands in our way will be cut down,”he said, inspecting the arsoned building. Thousands of communists were jailed, including all 81 Communist deputies in parliament. With the left neutralised, the Nazis swiftly consolidated power.In today’s US, Kirk’s death has gripped the country, galvanising the Maga movement and Trump’s supporters, and he knows it. The white supremacist Matt Forney clamoured for the arrest of every Democratic politician, openly claiming the killing as the movement’sReichstag fire moment.View image in fullscreenThe Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933 was seen as pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany.Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/Getty ImagesThe reality is that here is the event that could rescue an increasingly unpopular presidency scarred by a sharp drop in employment figures, a weakening dollar, and a housing crisis. Trump mourned Kirk as though he were family, but the rhetoric suggested this would be as much about pursuing Trump’s enemies as justice. Right after the assassination, Trump promised to go after “each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity … including the organisations that fund and support it.” He singled out George Soros, the American-Hungarian philanthropist and Democrat donor. “He’s a bad guy,” Trump told NBC News, he “should be put in jail.”Messages released yesterdaygive the clearest indication yet of a possible motive for the attack. The political views of the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appear as muddled as those of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20 year old whoattempted to assassinateTrump in Pennsylvania. Is this truly the radical left attacking the radical right – or is it the strange, chaotic subculture of online niches spilling into the real world? The slogansetched on to the bullet casingsin Utah read less like an ideological manifesto than a crude bricolage of puerile memes and gaming references.But it is hard not to fear that the repression of “unwilling” academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants, military officers, and judges in the US will intensify. Already, reactions on social media have led to awave ofsackingsand US state department officialshave warned foreign nationalsnot to praise or make light of Kirk’s assassination, instructing consulates to take “appropriate action” against any foreigners who do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Where real crises do not exist, he fabricates them – including imagined crime pandemics in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago. Fake chaos fuels his power grab. Now he has been handed chaos on a silver platter. No wonder he couldn’t care less if the nation comes together.The shooting provides the perfect pretext for tightening his grip, silencing dissent, and concentrating power – so that his successors may inherit full state control, regardless of charisma, merit or mandate. After all, any autocratic system has to be built first; once entrenched, it becomes far easier to maintain.Liberal democracy and the rules-based global order are far from perfect, but they have delivered peace, progress and prosperity – the very opposite of authoritarianism. To suggest that the US, the architect of the postwar order, could soon slide into full-blown autocracy, its leaders thinking like Nazis in 1933, may seem far-fetched.But from another vantage point, it is not far-fetched at all. Totalitarianism was still within living memory when many of us, even at the heart of ​modern democraticEurope, were growing up. From Belgium to Bulgaria, most families have some history of the death, destruction, hatred and destitution that authoritarianism leaves behind.

Then the deputy prime ministerresignedover unpaid taxes. On the eve of a state visit by the US president, the ambassador to Washingtonwas sackedover his friendship with a convicted paedophile, and this week a senior adviser to the prime ministerresignedover offensive text messages.Those are just the personnel problems. The new phase is supposed to focus on policy delivery, but that is hard to achieve with a sluggish economy,sticky inflationand shrinking fiscal headroom.This week itwas reportedthat the Office for Budget Responsibility expects to downgrade its estimates of UK productivity in advance of the budget in December. The knock-on effect would be to narrow the chancellor’s capacity for funding public services. The shortfall could be up to £30bn. Much of that will have to come from tax rises. Rachel Reeves’s last attempt to plug a fiscal hole with spending cuts led to a raid on benefits that had to be largelyaborted to quella mass rebellion of Labour MPs.The government still intends to find savings in that area. It is the unenviable job ofPat McFadden, the new work and pensions secretary, to find a way that doesn’t reignite backbench fury.Even if Ms Reeves succeeds in bringing restiveLabourcolleagues on board with her budget, she will face a ferocious onslaught from opposition parties and rightwing media for raising taxes. She will be accused of reneging on promises not to burden “working people” with higher levies, even if she adheres to the letter of the manifesto commitment not to hike income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax.The government will blame its economic predicament on the Tories. It is true that Sir Keir inherited a public realm in disrepair, and wafer-thin margins for fiscal manoeuvre are partly alegacy of Liz Trussincinerating British financial credibility. But they are also a function of choices made by Ms Reeves in opposition. Now, 14 months after the general election, the public wants more evidence of improvement, and fewer excuses.Most people accept that it takes time to fix something that was very broken, but they need confidence that there is a plan; that leaders have a national destination in mind and a route map to get there.Failure to articulate such a thing has badly damaged Sir Keir. It doesn’t account for the full collapse in his poll rating since the general election last year, but the absence of an optimistic message has been an aggravating factor whenever there have been other setbacks. It has accelerated the decline in mood among Labour MPs from anxiety to panic. There are mutterings aboutreplacing the prime ministerif things continue on the current trajectory.It is not too late to stabilise the situation. A sustained absence of unforced errors and scandal would be a start. It would buy space in which to set out a credible offer of economic renewal, narrated with conviction as part of a wider story of national purpose. The ability to make such a case is a core competence in any prime minister.If Sir Keir cannot demonstrate it soon, he should expect his party to advance from doubting his leadership to seeking an alternative.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their deployment had little to do with religious faithWed 17 Sep 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 15.12 EDTShareEngland’s established church has now been leaderless for going on 10 months, following Justin Welby’sresignationas archbishop of Canterbury. The Crown Nominations Commission is finallyexpectedto vote on a successor in the coming weeks. Whoever that turns out to be will face familiar and thorny problems, from disagreement over safeguarding structures to the Anglican church’s seemingly unending arguments over sexuality.After last weekend’s “unite the kingdom”marchin London, a new challenge should be added to the list. Christian nationalism is already a force in the United States, and has played a defining role in European culture wars in countries such as Poland and Hungary. At last Saturday’s rally the strikingproliferationof wooden crosses and flags bearing Christian slogans suggest an ominous and rising influence on the British far right. From the speakers’ platform in Whitehall, crowds were led in chants of “Christ is King” and participated in public prayer recitals, while being urged to defend “God, faith, family, homeland”.The secular co-opting of Christian identity to incite racial intolerance and Islamophobia has a track record on these shores. In 2009, the archbishops Rowan Williams and John Sentamu publiclyadmonishedthe British National party for using the language of faith “to foster fear”. But it used to be a relatively fringe pursuit. The rise of Reform, and the embedding of the far right within a broader revolt against mainstream politics, suggests that we are in new territory.As anti-migrant sentiment in Britain is both normalised and radicalised, figures such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known asTommy Robinson, are successfully adopting the Viktor Orbán playbook, casting themselves as defenders of a Christian country under existential threat from outsiders. The crosses, Bible verses and prayers on display at the rally – like the Saint George’s flags appearing in streets across the country – placed a patina of false piety on a nativist message brimming with hostility towards the multicultural reality of modern Britain.In academic literature, the use of Christianity as a cultural dividing line has been aptlycharacterisedas “Christianism” – an aggressive and exclusionary assertion of “belonging” that need not have any connection with actual religious belief. Battered and bruised though the Church of England may be after Mr Welby’s unhappy departure, it must explore ways to assert itself against such perversions of the gospel message of inclusion and compassion for the stranger.One key to that may lie at grassroots level, where church and interfaith groups are often at the heart of initiatives aimed at enhancing social cohesion and wellbeing. In astatementissued prior to last Saturday’s march, the Bishop of Edmonton observed that “every day, in our churches and on our streets, we see a very different city to the one that the marchers portray”. By embodying an ecumenical sense of neighbourliness, local churches can help counter the far right’s pseudo-Christian posturing.Church leaders have a duty to do the same on the national stage. Inveighing against the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportations in February, the late Pope Francis waswitheringin his condemnation of ethno-nationalism dressed up in a cassock and carrying a cross. In an ever more febrile public square, the next archbishop of Canterbury will also need to be loud and clear in their defence of basic Christian principles.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters from Redbridge councillorShanelle Johnsonand other readersWed 17 Sep 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 13.24 EDTSharePeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, has said that he was notdisturbedby the Tommy Robinson march on Saturday (Trump has fanned the flames of divisive politics around the world, says Sadiq Khan, 16 September). Well I certainly was. The levels of threatening hate and violence should be a wake-up call, not just for government ministers but for all of us. Stand Up to Racism has done its best to mobilise people to tackle this threat, but it’s clear that we have to find a new way forward to reinforce this work. I am urging people in all civil society organisations to start talking about the situation and in each sector to start talking to each other.I believe there is a fairly widespread understanding of the causes of the views and activities that the far right are exploiting. After Saturday, perhaps there is now a greater understanding of the urgency of the situation. Leading bodies and individuals in each sector of our society should take the initiative in convening urgent discussions of the role they can play in bringing our community together.As the discussions develop, we will see what ideas different sectors of civil society have about what organisational form will be best to reinforce the work of Stand Up to Racism. It may be a series of coalitions that network and reinforce each other’s interventions.Different groups and sectors will have very specific contributions to make and will have their own views on what national networking they would be most comfortable with. I can only stress the dangerous urgency of the current situation.John McDonnell MPIndependent, Hayes and HarlingtonI was at the counter-protest at the weekend. I saw first-hand who the crowd attending the far right protest was made up of. It was not people who had boiling-over anger or who were expressing legitimate concerns about immigration. It was pure, gleeful racism. Drunk, laughing and jeering, then belligerent and violent, hurling verbal abuse, smoke grenades and the occasional Nazi salute at anyone who dared stand up to them – no matter that we were outnumbered 20 to one.Anyone who went to that event wanting to express legitimate concerns about immigration should not be surprised to be labelled a racist when keeping company with racists and listening to racist speeches from known racists. Luckily, 100,000 is still only 0.14% of the population. So, everyone else – it’s up to us to firmly say that whatever else happens, we will not legitimise bullying, bigotry and fascism on our streets.Name and address suppliedI understand and agree with Diane Abbott (What I saw at Saturday’s rally was racism, pure and simple. Labour won’t tackle it until we can call it what it is, 14 September), and would even say that racism is probably beyond “bubbling up”. Day to day, I am subject to overt and unashamed racism in casual conversation and see people I know and have counted as friends expressing open support for, and sharing content by extreme racists.Earlier this year I had to deal with the school after my mixed-race daughter was racially abused in class – repeatedly called an “illegal immigrant” and asked “if you cut yourself, will curry come out?”.The time has come for our leaders to call this out, show some backbone and meet the moment.Name and address suppliedDiane Abbott is right to warn of the dangers in ignoring racism at events like Tommy Robinson’s rally. But we also need to rebuild the community spaces where people can meet, talk and find common ground. The loss of libraries, youth clubs, community centres and pubs has left many without places for face-to-face connection. In their absence, people turn to social media, where anger is amplified and exploited. Too often, the only remaining gathering points are closed, single-use spaces, whether faith buildings or private venues, which can deepen separation.I think we should invest in community assemblies. Open up churches, mosques, temples and local halls to everyone – without a hire fee. This should be a national priority. I know first-hand that restoring peace may not suit a political climate that thrives on polarisation, but it will be our biggest downfall if we don’t listen to the grassroots. Rebuilding our “public square” is about restoring the habit of listening to one another as neighbours, and recognising that we have more in common than those who profit from our division.Shanell JohnsonIndependentcouncillor, London borough of RedbridgeExplore more on these topicsFar rightLabourTommy RobinsonLondonlettersShareReuse this content"

Interest paid on those borrowings varies, but can exceed 5%.While we are largely in the hands of these “bond market bullies”, we have our own bond market that is available to tap into. At the moment about £130bn is held inpremium bonds, which pay out an equivalent interest rate of 3.6%, almost entirely to UK citizens.Almost half of that £130bn is in the hands of individuals holding the maximum of £50,000. If that maximum holding limit were to be increased, the government would receive a considerable influx of funds at the cost of a relatively low interest rate.UK banks and building societies might complain about unfair competition, but surely the need of the exchequer for additional funds (without raising taxes) comes first.Phil SpenceTenby, PembrokeshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It has rejected the advice calling for radical change (Ofsted to press ahead with new inspection regime despite opposition, 9 September).The new toolkitruns to 80 pages and lists 314 standards over seven areasthat institutions will be judged on. It’s like deciding to repaint the Titanic after it’s hit the iceberg.Anger is mounting about the opportunity being lost to create a humane and effective system of inspection. If the government accepts Ofsted’s gargantuan framework, the coming months will be consumed by conflict with the professionals.There’s an alternative way forward. Ministers should set up a commission of teachers’ leaders, experienced inspectors and experts in inspection to produce a different model. It would support teachers to improve the quality of students’ learning, while dealing firmly, but sensitively, with the weaknesses that undeniably exist.Why not test whatever model the government chooses by running alongside it a pilot of the best ideas on inspection, culled from national and international research? The pilot could take place in an area chosen to be as representative as possible of the country as a whole. Whatever system proved to be the more effective could become the makings of a new evidence-based approach.The opportunity to enact reform comes round seldom. This one must be seized with both hands to end the decades of failure to raise standards. Will the government rise to the occasion and transform inspection for good? Over to you, Bridget Phillipson.Frank CoffieldEmeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of EducationWhen the secondary school that I led was first inspected by Ofsted in 1997 it involved 16 inspectors spending the best part of a week in school, going everywhere and seeing everything they needed to. The outcome report, though it pulled no punches, was thorough and largely accurate and provided a sound basis for our own development plan. Long before I retired, an inspection involved a mere four inspectors and lasted barely two days, with oral “feedback”, such as it was, being given after lunch on the second day.Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector, says Ofsted’s new traffic light report card will give parents the information they deserve and ensure that the work of education professionals is fairly assessed. The sad truth is that, like the one it replaces, this report will be done on the cheap and provide the very flimsiest of evidence on which parents or professionals could base any worthwhile judgments. Even worse, it will continue to be used punitively in judging headteachers and their staff and do nothing to relieve the unrealistic pressures, which see nearly a third of newly qualified teachersleave the professionwithin five years.Chris DunneLondonExplore more on these topicsOfstedSchoolsPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsStudentslettersShareReuse this content"

This is what everyone expects of Liverpool this season; the captain’s header was only their third latest decisive goal in five straight victories.Arne Slot’s side have won every Premier League game so far with goals scored after the 80th minute. Liverpool looked as if they wanted to do things differently in theChampions Leagueand were two goals ahead within six minutes thanks to Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah. If they thought they had done the business before anyone had broken a sweat, they were very much mistaken. Atlético’s goals came from an unlikely source in the full-back-cum-midfielder Marcos Llorente, who now has four Champions League goals at Anfield to his name.Simeone blames fan row after Liverpool winner on ‘getting insulted all game’Read moreThere was greater concern on the faces of supporters than at Burnley on Sunday but they know their team are masters in the art of going until the end. Van Dijk rose highest and powered the ball past Jan Oblak to test the foundations of the Kop and put their Champions League start on a par with their domestic form.Diego Simeone fumed at the referee within a split second of the net rippling for a fifth time. The Atlético head coach offered general frustration in the direction of Maurizio Mariani but there was no obvious evidence why he was upset. The Italian was not up for a debate and sent him off. Simeone should have been more annoyed about Alexander Sørloth heading over a glorious chance to equalise. The Argentinian then confronted a home supporter before being escorted down the tunnel by stewards. He said he was insulted on the touchline.Atlético had started aggressively, in a classic 4-4-2 formation. They wanted to frustrate and irritateLiverpoolbut that cunning plan headed down the Mersey in the fourth minute when Ryan Gravenberch was clumsily tripped on the edge of the box. Salah went with pure power from the free-kick and Robertson sprang a surprise when the ball ricocheted in off his calf.If luck and ferocity brought the opener, skill and guile made the second. The superb Gravenberch was once again at the centre of it, exchanging passes with Salah, ­laying the ball into the Egyptian’s path having bustled through the defence. ­Delicate touches got Salah into the perfect position to slot under Oblak. It felt like the job was done.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah fires past Jan Oblak to double Liverpool’s lead early on.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAtlético did not look in the same league as Liverpool, whose confidence grew as the passes fizzed between red shirts. Alexander Isak, the British record signing, made his Liverpool debut but it was Salah and Gravenberch who were at the heart of the hosts’ performance. Salah could have added two more before the break.Liverpool did not need help but Mariani tried to offer some by bizarrely witnessing a phantom handball by Clément Lenglet from Jeremie Frimpong’s ball into the box. A word in the ear and a check on the monitor forced the referee to overturn his original decision and return Simeone’s blood pressure to something closer to normal.There were glimmers of hope for Atlético, who threatened on the counter but without the injured Julián Alvarez they could not find anyone to convert their chances until Llorente popped up in first-half injury-time to reduce the deficit through a schoolyard toe-poke that when through Ibrahima Konaté’s legs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The centre-back was booked for his recklessness, while Isak was given treatment and a few moments of rest to get his breath back. He received a huge roar when he got to his feet; the fans are desperate for a heroic new No 9. He returned for the second half but looked tired and shook hands with his replacement Hugo Ekitiké in the 58th minute. The substitute’s task was to help finish the fixture as a contest but Liverpool struggled to test Oblak, with Salah’s shot against a post the closest they came to making it 3-1.Alexander Isak’s Liverpool debut provides box-office glamour despite the rust | Barney RonayRead moreWith one goal in it, Atlético offered energy in abundance. Their hard work paid off when Llorente, who moved into midfield, watched a looping ball land perfectly on his foot, allowing him to volley at goal from 20 yards. It was Atlético’s turn to enjoy some good fortune, as Alexis Mac Allister deflected the shot beyond Alisson to silence Anfield, apart from one small corner, who thought they were about to leave with a point.Liverpool, however, are not interested in giving up. When Dominik Szoboszlai stepped up to lift a late corner into the box, anticipation had been replaced with desperation but the emotional effort was rewarded by Van Dijk. Slot won his first seven Champions League games last season and with Galatasaray, Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, Inter and PSV to come before Christmas, this victory was vital to build momentum.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolAtlético Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Yet while there was defiance afterBayern Munichwent 2-0 up inside 27 minutes, Cole Palmer halving the deficit with typical nonchalance, the problems at the other end were too great for Chelsea to overcome.Van Dijk’s late header earns Liverpool dramatic win against Atlético MadridRead moreThe defending must improve if Enzo Maresca’s young side are to make a serious impact in this competition. They have a lot to learn after two years out of the big time. There were simply too many mistakes fromChelsea, exposing their inexperience at this level, and ultimately that was always likely to prove fatal given that Bayern had Harry Kane ready to remind Premier League opposition of his ruthlessness in front of goal.Even Palmer could not steal centre stage from Kane. England’s captain is Bayern’s talisman. Their hopes of ruling Europe for the first time since 2020 rest on his shoulders. The numbers are ridiculous. Kane has already scored 11 times for club and country this season, while he has Moisés Caicedo and Malo Gusto to thank for helping him to extend his record in the Champions League to 42 goals in 58 appearances.Chelsea pressed the self‑destruct button twice, handing Kane his goals. Bayern were not wholly convincing despite opening the league phase with a 3-1 win. Chelsea competed. Maresca was pleased with the effort but rued a failure to take care of the details. Chelsea’s head coach raged, too, at Jonathan Tah not being sent off for a cynical foul on João Pedro in the buildup to Palmer’s goal.The positive for Maresca was that reverting to the formula thatflummoxed Paris Saint-Germainin the Club World Cup final made sense. Deploying Reece James alongside Caicedo added ballast in midfield. Chelsea looked balanced in the early stages. They tested Bayern’s high line, Gusto’s raids from right‑back offering encouragement, and it took a vital intervention from Konrad Laimer to stop Enzo Fernández from giving Chelsea an early lead.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane goes down under Moisés Caicedo’s challenge, resulting in a penalty for Bayern Munich.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APYet Bayern brought their own threats. Serge Gnabry schemed in the pockets and there was danger whenever the ball reached Michael Olise on the right.Chelsea needed no introduction to Olise given that they twice tried to sign him from Crystal Palace. Knowing about the winger’s threat is not the same as knowing how to combat it, though. The marking had to be tighter when Joshua Kimmich played a free‑kick out to Olise in the 20th minute. Instead João Pedro was isolated by the Frenchman, who breezed round the outside before firing in a cross that Trevoh Chalobah turned into his own net under pressure from Dayot Upamecano.Chelsea lost focus. A mix-up on the left invited further trouble .Caicedo had given away the free-kick before the opener and he was soon at fault again, clumsily fouling Kane as Bayern’s No 9 turned in the area.Kane made it 2-0, beating Robert Sánchez with a cool penalty. Game over? Not quite. Chelsea have tasted adversity in this stadium before, fighting to defeat Bayern in the 2012 final. Here the response came from Caicedo winning possession off Olise. Suddenly, with Tah colliding with João Pedro on halfway, Palmer was surging through. A one-two with Gusto followed, leaving Palmer to mark his 100th appearance for Chelsea and his first for the club in this competition by clipping a lovely finish past Manuel Neuer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maresca was booked for complaining about Tah seeing only yellow for his foul on João Pedro. Gusto almost equalised before Laimer went close at the other end. Both teams were a mess at the back.‘It’s a red’: Enzo Maresca fumes after Bayern defender Tah avoids sending-offRead moreVincent Kompany responded by replacing Tah with Kim Min-jae at half-time. There was another defensive alteration when Josip Stanisic limped off. Sacha Boey came on at right-back and Laimer moved to the left. Yet Bayern remained menacing. Luis Díaz was lively on the left and there were two huge let-offs for Chelsea before the hour, Sánchez making fine saves to stop Kane and Olise from making it 3-1. Olise ought to have been furious with himself for finishing so casually. No matter. With Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlović restoring calm in midfield Bayern raised the tempo again and Chelsea cracked when Gusto did the worst thing a defender can do: give the ball to Kane in your own area.This time there was no reprieve. The finish was pure Kane: composed, impossibly smooth, utterly deadly. Kompany praised the forward’s hunger and work off the ball. Maresca, meanwhile, bemoaned self-inflicted wounds. Gusto lay on the turf, aghast with himself. It was a long way back now. Bayern had too much nous. It was not a disastrous performance from Chelsea but they will have to be sharper in defence when they host Benfica in their next game.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I sensed the players thought it was going to happen automatically. We should have been a lot more prepared for what was going to come and handled it a lot better.”Until Zan Vipotnik, on as a substitute for Swansea, equalised in the 93rd minute – the Slovenia striker converting Liam Cullen’s cross for his fifth goal in his past five matches – it seemed that Postecoglou would chalk up his first win as Forest head coach, in filthy conditions and contrasting surrounds toBilbao in May.

Forest were stunned when Vipotnik levelled and staggered when Swansea’s captain, Cameron Burgess, scored his second goal in style. Ethan Galbraith, the impressive Northern Ireland midfielder who signed from Leyton Orient in the summer, cracked a shot against the upright from 25 yards after a corner was cleared to the edge of the box and Burgess thumped in the rebound, his unerring strike sparking delirium in the stands.“I had Malick Yalcouyé jumping on my back but I was quite calm,” Alan Sheehan, the Swansea head coach, said. “I was looking at the clock because with 30 seconds left they are a team that can put the ball in the top corner.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Ireland put up 196, some serious work was required as the 21-year-old became his country’s youngest men’s captain.Enter Phil Salt, ready to make headlines once again. The opener followed his141 not outagainst South Africa last Friday with 89 off 46 balls as England secured victory in the first of three Twenty20 internationals with 14 balls to spare.Ireland v England: first men’s T20 cricket international – as it happenedRead moreIreland’s bowling effort could not live up to their strong display in the first half, when Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker combined for a third-wicket partnership of 123 off 11.2 overs, the former top-scoring with an unbeaten 61 off 36 balls.Salt, hammering with the pull shot, showed he can do it in the chase, too. Another rollicking opening stand with Jos Buttler – they amassed 74 inside five overs – made the remainder comfortable, a spurt of late wickets causing little bother.“Coming off at half-time it certainly wasn’t an easy target to chase,” said Salt. “[There was] a little bit there for guys taking pace off the ball, a little bit two-paced when they went hard into the wicket.” But he made it look a stroll, helping Bethell to a bit more history: this was England’s first win against Ireland in a men’s T20.Malahide was a lovely, leafy sight in the early afternoon, overnight rain making way for a poking sun. This was much needed for Ireland,short on fixtures at homebecause of a tight budget and with a three-match series against West Indies in June – their last assignment – including two washouts.View image in fullscreenRoss Adair high-fives Harry Tector after taking a catch to dismiss England’s Jacob Bethell.Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/ReutersPaul Stirling was grateful for the autumnal opportunity, putting on 57 for the first wicket alongside Ross Adair, no early release provided to Bethell.

Tector had the experience of being out in the middle five years ago, in his first one-day international series,when Ireland beat Englandin a pandemic bout at Southampton. The two twentysomethings had no reason to be fazed.Tector pumped Rashid over the leg side, the fourth six conceded by the leg-spinner, and reached his half-century off 31 balls. There was further joy at the death; Ireland hit 45 off the last three overs, George Dockrell’s only-ball six providing the perfect finish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They immediately threatened to match that effort, taking just three overs to bring up 50; Buttler took 22 off one Graham Hume set, turning the 34-year-old’s medium pace into throwdowns.Matthew Humphreys’ left-arm spin forced a miscue from Buttler on 28 to bring in Bethell. Any nerves were understandable as the left-hander searched for the middle, his first 12 balls returning just 10. Salt appeared out to Tector’s part-time spin on 51 after finding a fielder, but a no-ball call kept the right-hander’s cruelty coming.Bethell finally clicked with a series of boundaries off Tector, but fell in the same over with a chip to cover for 24. Rehan Ahmed emerged for his first England appearance of the year, granted an opportunity at No 4, but was a touch too eager when he charged Gareth Delany and was bowled for eight.Salt fell short of a fifth T20 international hundred – he would have joined Glenn Maxwell and Rohit Sharma at the top of the list – finding deep point off the expensive Hume at the end of the 16th over. But England, with 16 runs required, were in no position to fall from there.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamIreland Cricket TeamnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 31. His body was breaking down so often that he felt he had post‑traumatic stress disorder. And he feared his best days were behind him. Yet, just three days later, what had seemed like a final hurrah became a glorious resurrection.What a fighter. What an athlete. What a 1500m final. Most expected this to be a shootout betweenBritain’s defending champion, Josh Kerr, and the young Dutch star Niels Laros. Instead the script was flipped on its head and ripped into pieces. Twice.USA’s Katie Moon rises again to claim third successive world pole vault goldRead moreA slow burner of a race finally ignited with 200m remaining when Wightman charged from third to first, leaving others flailing. Around the final bend Laros was beaten. Kerr was long gone too, and was hobbling badly after injuring a calf.Wightman smelt gold. But then Isaac Nader from Portugal, unheralded and unfancied, swooped from the gods in the final metres.“I ran my perfect race,” Wightman said after winning a brilliant silver medal in 3min 34.12sec – just 0.02sec behind Nader, with the Kenyan Reynold Cheruiyot claiming bronze. “I thought I’d written my own perfect fairytale. But there’s nothing else I could have done. He [Nader] ran an unbelievable race.”Most people had thought Wightman was finished as a top athlete after a slew of injuries that began when he fractured a foot while doing plyometrics in 2023. A year later he sustained a calf tear and then a hamstring tear that ruled him out of the Paris Olympics. In February a torn meniscus led to surgery and a dramatic ending to the 15-year coaching relationship with his father, Geoff.“You can’t just keep hammering the same stuff and expect the same outcome,” Wightman said.“I was just getting these big injuries. I wasn’t getting niggles. I was getting two-month injuries every single time, and it wasn’t the same recurring one.“I probably got a bit of PTSD from what’s happened with these injuries. Even before this I felt like I was getting ill. I had a couple of little problems and thought: ‘My season’s not going to carry on here, this is going to be the end.’”Quick GuideFurlani leaps to long jump gold and Cherotich wins steeplechaseShowA 20-year-old Italian long jumper and a 21-year-old Kenyan steeplechaser added their names to the list of athletics world champions with sensational performances on Wednesday.Mattia Furlani (pictured) underlined his status as the coming man in long jump when he won gold with a personal best leap of 8.39m on Wednesday, as big favourite Miltiadis Tentoglou failed to make it to the second round of jumps. Furlani, the world indoor champion, became the youngest and first Italian winner of the title with  his fifth attempt.Jamaica’s Tajay Gayle, world champion six years ago and bronze medallist in 2023, took silver with 8.34m, ahead of China’s Shi Yuhao (8.33m).“This is a most special evening. I worked so hard and put so much determination into getting a medal,” Furlani said. “At the beginning I had a small problem with my run-up, but as usual I tried to stay calm and save the best for last. Now I am here with this gold medal. This is a perfect year for me.“Faith Cherotich overhauled defending champion Winfred Yavi on a dramatic last lap of the women’s 3,000m. Cherotich added gold to her bronze medals from Budapest two years ago and last year's Paris Olympics.Cherotich nailed the final water jump, which Bahrain’s Yavi stumbled over, in the final half lap and stormed clear in the straight to victory. Her winning time of 8:51.59sec was a championship record despite the oppressive humidity at the National Stadium.“I am so happy to win today. Improving from bronze to gold is amazing to me,” Cherotich said. “I believed in my kick. In the last 400, I said: ’This is my moment.’ Olympic champion Yavi took silver in 8:56.46, while bronze went to Ethiopia's 20-year-old Sembo Almayew in a personal best of 8:58.86.ReutersPhotograph: Andrzej Iwańczuk/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Wightman knew he needed to take drastic action, so he moved to Manchester where he is now coached by John Hartigan, the father of his fiancee, Georgie. His training has been revolutionised, too. He runs fewer miles a week, brought in more cross training, and cut back on the number of intense sessions. Suddenly something that was broken has been fixed again.There were still mental battles to overcome in Tokyo, however, with Wightman wondering whether he could ever return to the form that made himworld champion in 2022.View image in fullscreenJosh Kerr hobbles over the line 37 seconds back after injuring his calf with about 600m to go.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA“I can’t put into words how much I battled my own head this year,” he said. “The self-doubt has been immense. I’m 31 years old. I’ve got all these feelings about am I going to be able to do any more in my career?“I’ve reached the point where a lot of people have retired. Am I going to be able to come out and still get my best? Literally, it was only these heats and semi-finals that I really felt like, this is me again.”Before the final, Georgie even visited a shrine in Tokyo to get Wightman a good‑luck cat figurine – which her father then gave him in the warm‑up. Wightman said: “I was like, ‘This is heading towards something special.’” It certainly was that – and more – as Tokyo witnessed a 1500m final for the ages.And while his relationship with his father has been complicated, it was Geoff who messaged him beforehand to tell him he had a real chance of glory. For good measure, Geoff also tried to warn him of the lurking dangers when he was commentating on the track in the National Stadium.As Wightman spoke to reporters afterwards, his father suddenly appeared. “I was giving you the scoop that he was coming!” he told his son.“Do you think it’s the genes?” Geoff then asked him, before saying he had thought for a brief moment that history was about to repeat itself. “I thought: ‘This is it; first man ever to regain the title, the only one of the current era to win two,’” Geoff said. “But then I saw the speed that Nader was coming, and you think: ‘There’s nothing you can do.’ You couldn’t have done any more.”View image in fullscreenTimothy Cheruiyot of Kenya (bronze), Isaac Nader of Portugal (gold) and Jake Wightman (silver) celebrate (left to right).Photograph: Andrzej Iwańczuk/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThat much was certainly true. Wightman ran the last 100m in 12.9sec; Nader in 12.3sec. But having had so many painful ups and downs in the past three years, Wightman could see the broader picture.“I could have very easily not even made a British team again,” he said. “I could have not got near a podium. Even on the bus on the way over, I was like: ‘This could go so many different ways.’“The way I was performing in August I never expected to come away with anything from these championships. But I just feel like I’m a racer and I know that when I go out there I’ll do everything I can to leave it on the track.”Wightman did that all right, and more, on a sweaty, messy and thrilling night in Tokyo.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Wada previously slammed the event as “dangerous and irresponsible”.Kerley joins several elite swimmers who already signed on for the competition, including the Olympic silver medallistswimmer Ben Proud, the first Briton to sign on.“Fred’s choice to compete with us not only demonstrates our goal of hosting the most exciting athletic competitions out there, but also solidifies the growing appeal of the Enhanced Games as the future of elite sporting competition,” the Enhanced Games chief executive, Maximilian Martin, said.The inaugural Enhanced Games is set for Las Vegas in May 2026.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But it might just workRead moreThe concerns centre on the financial sustainability of a 14-team Super League and the RFL’s failure to share a detailed business plan with the clubs. The Guardian has learned that while theRFLleadership gave a presentation at an informal owners’ meeting before the vote in July, multiple requests from several clubs for a detailed financial analysis underpinning expansion have gone unanswered.No documents were provided at the formal shareholders’ meeting where the vote took place, and the minutes of that meeting have not been shared.There has been some discussion among the unhappy clubs about calling an extraordinary general meeting to demand a revote, but their efforts are focused on lobbying behind the scenes. Informal meetings between some clubs and the RFL are understood to have been scheduled for this week.“We’re not against going to 14 per se, but it has to be done properly,” one club source said. “We went to a meeting without being given any papers and haven’t received the financial modelling. The whole thing is being rushed and the process has not been robust enough.View image in fullscreenHull FC’s Jordan Rapana makes a break against Hull KR on 7 September. Both clubs voted against expansion.Photograph: Steve Mower/ProSports/Shutterstock“An expansion process in other competitions, such as the NRL in Australia, takes years but the RFL are trying to do it in a matter of weeks. The panel appointed to determine Super League membership have not been given enough time to scrutinise the applications properly. We should press the pause button to make sure our sport is financially viable for the long term.”The application process for a place in Super League next season closed last Friday, six weeks after the vote for expansion. The decision on the new Super League clubs, which could number three if thefinancially troubled Salford Red Devilsare expelled from the competition, will be announced on 16 October, five days after the grand final this year, after assessments by an independent panel chaired by the Conservative peer Jonathan Caine.In addition to the quick turnaround there are also concerns about how the expansion will be funded.Sky Sportshas made clear it will not increase its rights fee, and there are fears the company will lower its offer when its three-year contract expires next season, having already cut its annual rights fee from £40m to £21.5m since 2021.“Sky don’t want expansion, and we should be wary of alienating them,” another source said. “Most clubs are losing money, and the main broadcaster doesn’t want it, so why are we expanding? It doesn’t make sense. If theSkymoney goes down, then some clubs may have to go part-time.“The finances of Super League clubs are fragile, and one of our shareholders is facing potential insolvency. In that context, I find it perplexing that we have not been provided with a rigorous financial analysis of the impact of expansion.”An RFL spokesperson said: “The clubs have been considering an expansion of Super League for over a year and across many meetings. This led to the meeting at Headingley in July at which the 12 Betfred Super League clubs received the rationale, including financial, and voted overwhelmingly in favour.”Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leagueRFLSport politicsSky SportsSkyTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But the decision is unlikely to satisfy Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for acting “too late” and called for a far bigger cut.“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” Fed chairJerome Powellsaid during a closely watched press conference. At the same time, he warned, inflation has picked up.It is “reasonable” to expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to “a one-time shift” in prices, Powell suggested. “But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,” he said. “Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”Last month,Trump moved to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, claiming she committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary resident on mortgage applications. But Cook has denied wrongdoing, and insisted the president has no authority to remove her.A federal judge and an appeals court haveblockedTrump from removing Cook from her post, though the White House has appealed to thesupreme court.Fed rate line chartAmid the fiasco, a separate Biden-appointed Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, suddenly resigned from her post in August. Republicans quickly moved to replace her with Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. The SenateconfirmedMiran on Monday.Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting”.The dilemma for the Fed is that loweringinterest rateswill make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during hisspeechat the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.At the same time,Trump’s tariffshave caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Labestimatesthat tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “stagflation”.For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget OfficetoldCNBC on Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump tariffsShareReuse this content"

A total of 26 police officers were injured in clashes as projectiles were hurled, and the Met said on Sunday that 24 people had been arrested for a range of alleged offences including common assault and violent disorder.The force said a post-event investigation was under way, with officers working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.Speakers included the owner of Tesla and X, Elon Musk, who was condemned by Downing Street for using “dangerous and inflammatory” language at the event. The billionaire, who appeared via a live link, told a crowd of protesters that “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”.Marchers had travelled to London by train and coach for a demonstration, which was billed as a “festival of free speech”, but by its conclusion had amplified racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim hate speech across Whitehall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It found that shareholders of Britain’s privatised energy companies have taken at least £70.7bn in dividend payouts between 2010 and 2025, rather than reinvesting that money or reducing bills.Mathew Lawrence, director of Common Wealth, said the public was paying a high price for the “privatisation premium”.“They are lumped with higher energy bills that fund billions of pounds of shareholder payouts. That money should be invested to build homegrown clean power and help reduce costs.”The analysis found that £416 of the average bill of £1,719 was taken as pre-tax profits by the major electricity generators, networks and household suppliers last year.It also calculated that the energy networks that distribute gas and electricity to the UK’s homes and businesses had a profit margin of 55% between 2020 and 24, compared with a FTSE 350 average of 14%.Graphic showing the components of the average household electricity and gas billGraph showing changing UK energy sector profit margins over timeChris Hayes, the Common Wealth chief economist, said the UK’s energy system was unfit for the challenges the country faced amid an escalating climate emergency and cost of living crisis.“Networks running natural monopolies have systematically underinvested in maintenance and expansion. A splintered retail sector has allowed generators to capture windfall profits. Meanwhile, our clean energy investment regime has been blown apart by the last few years of economic uncertainty. Public investment and vertical reintegration are desperately needed to overcome these challenges.”The study calculates that in the era of public ownership, investment in the energy system was twice as high relative to GDP as under the privatised era, helping deliver what the report describes as a period of “innovation and ambition, when Britain led the world in new nuclear power, rapidly rolled out the modernised ‘Supergrid’ and built the world’s first ocean-receiving LNG terminal at Canvey Island”.‘Birmingham is up the road but there are no buses’: privatisation a dead end for LudlowRead moreThe privatisation of the energy sector was a key plank of the Tory government’s broader policy of reducing state involvement in the economy during the 1980s and 1990s.Supporters argued it increased efficiency, improved choice and attracted private investment – therefore reducing the burden on the state.However, the Common Wealth report found that investment and innovation have stalled, bills have gone up and tens of billions of pounds have been taken from hard-pressed consumers and given to shareholders and corporations.Sandy Hager, from the University of London, said energy was not a luxury but “the lifeblood of our economy and daily lives”.“Households face soaring bills, over a quarter of which now goes to company profits, while investment has withered. If we’re serious about energy security and decarbonisation, the model is indefensible. We need an energy system organised around the public good, not shareholder dividends, which means bringing our networks and generation into public hands.”The analysis found that the nine largest electricity generators that account for two-thirds of total UK electricity generation, and the energy networks which transport electricity and gas from generators to homes and businesses, made £17.8bn in operating profits in 2023 – £10.4bn for generation; £7.4bn for networks.The analysis found that much of this profit was going to servicing company debt and shareholder payments rather than investment.In 2023, the last fully reported financial year for the companies analysed, they spent a total of £8.02bn on dividends, buybacks, and interest payments, of which £3.8bn came from the generation companies and £4.2bn came from the networks. This amounted to 9% of the typical 2023 energy bill.The report argues that money from bills – which leaks out of the energy system as dividends and expensive debt servicing – should be reinvested to build clean and affordable homegrown power.A spokesperson for the energy regulator, Ofgem, said itregulated the energy market to “ensure that any costs passed on to consumers are fair and accurate, and that the sector isn’t making excessive profits”.They added: “We also work hard to bear down on costs while attracting the investment needed to upgrade the system and move away from volatile international markets that drive the fluctuations in energy bills we’ve seen in recent years.”They said Ofgem had collected almost £500m “in payments from energy companies for not meeting our rules”.Lawrence Slade, the CEO of ENA, which represents the UK’s electricity network operators, said: “The £100bn of private investment made by network operators into the future of the UK’s energy grid to deliver the government’s clean power 2030 targets comes with regulated returns of 5% per year. This investment ensures the UK has the clean, secure and affordable energy it requires in the years ahead, money that UK taxpayers would otherwise need to find, whilst also maintaining one of the most safe, stable and resilient energy grids anywhere.“Cherrypicking figures from annual accounts of major long-term UK infrastructure spending risks giving a misleading picture of investment that is essential to the UK’s clean energy future.”In the UK, domestic prices were among the highest in Europe in the first half of 2024 and industrial users face some of the highest electricity prices in the world. Average household energy bills are now 63% higher than before the energy crisis.A recent YouGov survey found 71% of the electorate backed public ownership of energy companies.There are signs that the political consensus around privatisation is breaking down. The Labour government has established thepublicly owned GB Energyand has completed the renationalisation of the grid, with the creation of the National Energy System Operator.The new Green party leadership and the new Your party vehicle have both made public ownership of energy central to their agendas, and even rightwing Reform UK has called for the renationalisation of privatised utilities like water.Mathew Lawrence said support for publicly owned power was “not about nostalgia”.“It is a proven and effective tool – from our own past and in comparator economies today – to deliver a more affordable and effective clean energy future. As the consensus on the status quo fragments, just like in the past, whoever seizes the mantle of change will reap the rewards.”Sophie Flinders, senior data analyst at Common Wealth, said the politics of energy was at “an inflection point”.“Attacks on the cost of the transition are increasing,” she said. “But higher bills are the result of private economic power not renewable power. The best response is to deliver new era of public power based on more coherent, certain, and cost-effective investment. The political prize is great: reducing a key driver of the cost of living crisis, delivering more homegrown clean power, and renewing consent for an ambitious transition.”Explore more on these topicsPrivatisationEnergy industryEnergyEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsPrivate sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He was released from jail after an investigation did not produce enough evidence to support a charge over Madeleine’s disappearance under German law.Rowley, theMetropolitan policecommissioner, said: “They’ve got to a particular point in their inquiry where the prosecutor doesn’t feel they’re able to prosecute. We’re now at a stage where he remains a suspect for us. We’re taking stock.“The Germans have done everything they possibly can do within their law. He has a track record for very serious offences. He remains a suspect in our investigation into Madeleine McCann being missing.”Asked if Brückner could be extradited to face trial in the UK, Rowley said that an offence as serious as murder need not be tried in the country where the crime took place.Rowley, Britain’s most senior police officer, said: “There are hundreds of questions. One of the reasons we are involved is that murder is in many situations extraterritorial and potentially a murder of a British subject can in certain circumstances be charged in the UK.“There’s lots of maybes, so at the moment we are taking stock with the Germans and Portuguese.”Brückner denies any blame for the disappearance of Madeleine, whose family are from Leicestershire. It emerged earlier this week that he hadrefused a request from the Metto interview him over the case.The Met says it will continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry and that its investigation is continuing.The former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, Nick Vamos, said: “Yes, it is feasible. The main obstacle is you need enough evidence to charge before you can extradite.”Rowley oversaw British police efforts to resolve the case of Madeleine’s disappearance early in his career at the Met. He said a previous appeal involving British police had led to Brückner being identified as a suspect, which led to German police joining the investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Observations of the apes in the wild show them imbibing the alcoholic equivalent of a half pint of beer a day through the vast amount of fermented fruit in their diet.Researchers arrived at the first estimates of wild chimp daily alcohol intake after measuring ethanol levels in fallen fruit that the apes gather from the forest floor in Kibale national park in Uganda and in Taï national park in Ivory Coast.While individual fruits contained less than 0.5% alcohol, the chimps’ daily intake swelled as they devoured the ripe fruit pulp. The apes were particularly fond of figs, which contained some of the highest levels of alcohol the team recorded.Aleksey Maro, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said at both African sites, males and females consumed about 14g of pure ethanol per day through fermented fruit. That is equivalent to one standard US drink or half a pint of 5% ABV lager.“The chimps are eating 5 to 10% of their body weight a day in ripe fruit, so even low concentrations yield a high daily total, a substantial dosage of alcohol,” said Prof Robert Dudley, also at UC Berkeley.Dudley believes the chimps’ consumption of alcohol in the wild supports his “drunken monkey” hypothesis, which posits that the human penchant for drink has roots in our primate ancestors’ need for energy-rich, ripe, fermented fruit. The human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this “dietary heritage”, Maro said. Details are published inScience Advances.Octopuses prefer to use different arms for different tasks, scientists findRead moreThe observations are not the first to capture chimpanzees’ booze habits. In 2015, researchers said a troop in south-eastern Guinea were the first known to indulge inregular, habitual drinking. Some of the apes started at 7am before knocking it on the head before bedtime. In footage this year, chimpsappeared to bondover fermented African breadfruit.Chimps are not the only ones. Areview of evidencepublished last year found alcohol consumption to be commonplace in the animal kingdom. And looks can be deceiving: slow lorises, known for being wide-eyed fur balls, will downthe strongest alcoholic drinksthey can get their hands on.Although chimps devour impressive quantities of fermented fruit, working through about 4.5kg a day, they show no obvious signs of inebriation. According to Maro, to feel the full effects of alcohol, the apes would need to eat enough fruit to make them bloated.As for humans, the NHS recommends people haveno more than 14 units a week, where a unit is 8g of pure alcohol, to keep health risks to a minimum. But studies show there isno healthy levelof alcohol consumption.Explore more on these topicsScienceAnimal behaviourAnimalsWildlifeAlcoholBeerBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

Wepublished the US National Climate Reportin full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests is funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt tobreak down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns.Our reporters hold the corporate enablers of fossil fuel interests to account: from thepublic affairs firms lobbying on their behalf to water down climate policyto thebanks financing “carbon bomb” projectsthat will blow through the dwindling carbon budget.In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: theleaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil”, the taskforce dreaming upradical climate solutionsand the campaigns that remind us thatthe overwhelming majority of peoplein the world want more ambitious climate action.2. We will report on how climate breakdown is already affecting people, the natural world and other species, as well as what to do about itOver the past year, alongside our daily reporting on climate impacts and extreme weather events, several new series shone a light on the people whose lives are being directly altered by the climate crisis, and the solutions people are creating in their own homes and communities.ForThis is climate breakdownour reporters worked alongside researchers and humanitarian workers at theClimate Disaster Projectin Canada and the International Red Cross to compile a series of testimonies from survivors of recent extreme weather events.My DIY climate hackshared inspiring examples from readers who are creating their own solutions to the environmental challenges they face – inspiring individuals who have turned their gardens into micro-farms, started free clothing swaps, organised low-waste weddings, invented energy-saving gadgets and more.Our ongoingAlternativesseries highlighted the local communities and political parties coming up with low-carbon ways of living that might actually scale.And our one-of-a-kind survey highlightedthe fears and concernsof hundreds of the world’s leading scientists, and their views on themost powerful climate actionsyou can take.3. We will publish up-to-date global indicators that point to the urgency of the situationAs climate records continue to be broken, we reported on new data that illustrates how planetary conditions are changing rapidly:2024 was the hottest year on record, driving the annual global temperature above the internationally agreed 1.5C target for the first timeWinter temperatures at the north polereached more than 20C above the 1991-2020 average in early 2025, crossing the threshold for ice to meltTheplanet’s remaining carbon budgetto meet the international target of 1.5C has just two years left at the current rate of emissionsHumans are driving biodiversity loss among all speciesacross the planet, according to the largest syntheses of the human impacts on biodiversity ever conducted worldwideTipping points– in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth’s system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects. We asked the experts about the latest science – and how it makes them feel4. The Guardian will eliminate two-thirds of its emissions by 2030 and reduce our impact on natureSince 2020, our company greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 48%, putting us well on track to achieve our target of a 67% reduction by 2030. In the last reporting year, emissions fell by 9%.The biggest reductions so far in our plan have come from our print business, which now accounts for 64% of our total footprint, compared with 73% in 2020. As our business becomes more digital and more global, emissions from our digital products, IT operations and business travel will account for a larger proportion of emissions.We are committed to reducing all areas of our footprint, which is why we have developed a bespoke climate literacy course for our staff to empower all colleagues to take action in their area of the business.5. We will seek to decouple our business and finances from fossil-fuel extractive companiesThe Guardian has refused advertising from all fossil-fuel extractive companies since January 2020.The Guardian is supported by the Scott Trust and the returns from its endowment fund. The fund’s environmental strategy is focused on contributing to a reduction of emissions in the real world and to protecting nature and biodiversity. The fund has made significant investments in environmental solutions, with more than £100m now invested in areas ranging from cutting emissions in manufacturing processes to increasing the resilience of food systems in a warming world. Additionally, the fund has made a commitment to invest at least 3% of its value in natural capital and biodiversity solutions.The endowment’s environmental focus builds on work started in 2015 to divest from fossil fuels.6. We will be transparent with our progressWe believe transparency is the key to tackling the climate crisis. By sharing our data, our successes and our challenges, we can be part of the global movement to make businesses accountable for their climate and nature impacts.In the past year we have:Publishedour annual company emissions data, explaining what drives our emissions and where they have risen and fallenCreated a digital course, as part of an initiative by theSustainable Journalism Partnership, sharing examples from experts across the Guardian of how to embed sustainability into journalism and media commercial operationsContributed our time and knowledge to working groups in the advertising industry that are working on better ways to measure the emissions impact of advertisingWe open ourselves up to scrutiny by independent third parties, such as theScience-Based Targets initiative(SBTi) and B Corp, so they can assess the robustness of our targets and our internal policies."

The remaining 25% is split in half, leaving 12.5% of revenues for Guyana, with the government also receiving 2% royalties on all production.Such“one-sided” dealsmake Guyana highly attractive to energy multinationals, industry experts say.Costs average about $30 (£23) a barrel, making it one of the cheapest and most profitable countries to drill for oil in the world.Guyana hasrevised fiscal arrangementsfor new contracts over the past year, introducing better terms for the country, including a new 10% corporate tax rate not included in the 2016 agreement.However, by taking over Hess and its stake in Stabroek,Chevronhas avoided the need to bid independently for its offshore blocks under the new, less favourable terms.View image in fullscreenVenezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, with a map of the oil-rich region of Guyana that his country claims.Photograph: AFP/Getty“They will obviously benefit from buying into the block, asGuyanahas to abide by the existing agreement,” says David Patterson, the parliamentary opposition’s spokesman on energy.Patterson sees the only potential benefit for Guyana being geopolitical – if the company succeeds in enhancing the Guyanese government’s relationship with neighbouring Venezuela.Since the discovery of oil in 2015, President Nicolas Maduro has stepped up his government’s hostility towards Guyana, withthreats to annex and invadeits smaller English-speaking neighbour (which only hasabout 4,000 military personnelcompared withVenezuela’s 300,000-strong security forces).The border demarcation dispute is now before theinternational court of justicefor a final settlement, with a ruling anticipated next year.“Chevron may bring some benefit as they are now in Guyana and Venezuela, where there is a border controversy,” Patterson says. “Chevron might well be able to ease the situation and enable exploration in a larger part of the basin without aggravating Venezuela.”Still, any potential geopolitical gains have not inspired much enthusiasm in Georgetown. At cabinet level, the government has made little comment on Chevron’s entry. Prior to his re-election on 1 September, President Irfaan Ali simply told the local newspaperStabroek News: “We welcome Chevron.”Bharrat Jagdeo, a former president and now oil minister, believesChevron’s arrival will benefit Guyanaby keeping Exxon in check, amid government allegations of cost inflation.View image in fullscreenPort facilities to support offshore oil production being built near the mouth of the Demerara River in Georgetown.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/AP“Chevron is one of the shareholders now in Guyana.

Chevron is answerable to its shareholders, not to usElizabeth Deane-Hughes, activistHowever, environmentalists fear the government may be too weak to regulate and enforce restrictions effectively on the two leading global fossil fuel companies.Elizabeth Deane-Hughes, a lawyer and environmentalist, says: “We are simply going to get clobbered on the head more and more with two giant companies running the oil sector in Guyana.“My activism is not against Chevron,” she says, “but we have difficult days ahead. Chevron is answerable to its shareholders, not to us.”Aside from environmental concerns, many Guyanese complain that the benefits promised from the country’s transformation into a petrostate with ahigh GDP per capitaare not reaching marginalised groups.Recent data from the Inter-American Development Bank shows that 58% of the 800,000Guyanese live in poverty, earning less than $6.85 a day, and 32% in extreme poverty, earning under $3.65.Rajesh Singh, a 46-year-old painter and maintenance worker, says the benefits of the country’s oil bounty are not reaching the average Guyanese.“The government has built roads and improved the infrastructure, but it needs to do much more,” says Singh. “I have a heart condition and can’t do heavy work, so more money should come to help people like me.“People must live comfortably now that we have big oil money but it is clearly not happening yet. The big boys are looking after themselves too much.”Byron Pedro, 18, a mechanic and welder, says the government must act swiftly to ensure benefits reach young people. “The government has to provide greater opportunities for youths so they will stop the killing and violence many are involved in,” he says. “Youths need to be elevated with all this oil money flowing.”View image in fullscreenThe oil multinationals say they bring jobs and prosperity to Guyana but more than half of the population is living in poverty.Photograph: Andrei Netto/The GuardianData from the oil consortium suggests there are11bn barrels of recoverable oil, or nearly 50 years at the current rate of output.The 650,000 barrels produced daily originate from three oilfields, while permits for four more have already been granted or are at an advanced stage. Exxon says that by 2027, Guyana could be producing nearly 1.3m barrels daily, making it one of the world’s highest per capita producers.‘This is something that divides us’: Ecuador’s turbulent transition from oil dependenceRead moreExxon has said it welcomes Chevron to the joint venture and “looks forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties”, while Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, said: “The combination enhances and extends our growth profile well into the next decade.”ExxonMobil and Chevron recently highlighted their commitment to the existing commercial terms governing the Stabroek block, though contested by local public opinion.Until 2015, when oil and gas were discovered, Guyana’s primary exports were gold, bauxite, sugar, rice, timber and seafood.

Older people were hit hardest by punishing temperatures, the study found, with 85% of the dead over the age of 65, and 41% over the age of 85.“The vast majority of heat deaths happen in homes and hospitals, where people with existing health conditions are pushed to their limits,” said Garyfallos Konstantinoudis, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “But heat is rarely mentioned on death certificates.”A handful of victims who died outside were named by local newspapers. Manuel Ariza Serrano, a 77-year-old former councillor in La Rambla, Spain, died after collapsing during a walk in August, according to the town council and former colleagues in the Córdoba region, which had highs of 45C that weekend.Brahim Ait El Hajjam, a 47-year-old father of four who ran a flooring company in northern Italy, died while laying the concrete of a school building near Bologna, where temperatures reached 38C that day. He died two days before a regional order to stop outdoor construction work in the early afternoon was set to take effect.“He called my mother to tell her that he’d come home to prepare lunch,” his 19-year-old son, Salah, told the Italian TV station Antena 3 after his death. “That he’d be home by noon.”Konstantinoudis said the public health risk from heat was still being underestimated, despite the dangers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Today we have been listened to and the improvements to the legal system are going to make it fairer and clearer going forward.”In 2022-23, the not proven verdict made up 61% of rape and attempted rape acquittals, compared with an overall rate of 22% for all criminal offences. She added: “To know that another rape victim isn’t going to experience what I had to go through after my criminal trial ended is the very reason I’ve invested so much time and energy into this campaign.”The final vote on the Scottish government’svictims, witnesses and justice reform billpassed by 71 votes to 46 after a lengthy debate considering more than 160 amendments.Constance told MSPs on Wednesday afternoon it was “time to come together” to support the bill, which also changes the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction, establishes a specialist sexual offences court, and enshrines in Scots law the right to lifelong anonymity for rape complainers (the Scottish legal term for complainants).She said: “By changing culture, process and practice across the system, it will help to ensure victims are heard, supported, protected and treated with compassion, while the rights of the accused will continue to be safeguarded.”The bill will also establish a victims and witnesses commissioner and provide an automatic right to publicly funded, independent legal representation for complainers to oppose applications asking questions about their previous sexual history.But Liam Kerr, the shadow justice secretary, told the Holyrood chamber the bill “misses so many chances to do better”. He said the Scottish Conservatives voted against the “half-baked” final bill after their amendment to establish an inquiry into grooming gangs inScotlandfell, as did their “no body, no release” proposal to require the parole board to consider whether killers have provided information on the whereabouts of their victims’ remains.The chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, commended the “many positive steps” in the new law but reiterated “serious concerns” about the increase to the jury majority. “Research shows a reluctance to convict rape cases and deep-rooted prejudices around sexual violence affect public attitudes and jury decision-making every day. An increased jury majority will undoubtedly make survivors’ fight for justice even harder.”TheFaculty of Advocates and theLawSociety of Scotland have also cautioned that the increase from a simple majority to two-thirds, and how that would act in conjunction with the abolition of not proven, could “cheapen the guilty verdict”.Explore more on these topicsScotlandRape and sexual assaultScottish politicsLaw (Education)newsShareReuse this content"

Officers are continuing to appeal for information about the incident which police have described as “racially aggravated”.The victim is being supported by officers, the force said, as they trawl hundreds of hours of CCTV and carried out “extensive” forensic inquiries. Detectives are urging anyone who saw two white men in the area to come forward. The first man is reported to have had a shaved head, a heavy build and was wearing gloves and a dark coloured sweatshirt, while the second was wearing a grey top with a silver zip.Chief Superintendent Kim Madill, police commander at Sandwell, said: “We are working closely with key partners and we absolutely understand the concern of local people.“We need the public’s help to bring us information on who has carried out this horrendous attack. I can reassure you that we are doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice on this young woman’s behalf.”A letter in the joint name of more than 450 UK Gurdwaras and Sikh organisations is being sent to Keir Starmer expressing disappointment at the lack of progress with the case.The campaigners say there is an increased threat and, citing a number of recent high-profile racist attacks, call on Starmer “to encourage the new home secretary and new communities secretary to address anti-Sikh hate”.Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Tuesday evening to support the woman. Salman Mirza, one of the organisers, told the Stourbridge News: “We feel there’s been a rise in racism and we want unity because we believe this is a good area. We’ve seen the hotel protests and there’s a lot of division at the moment and we want solidarity.“People are outraged and frightened at what’s happened to this woman – we wanted to get together and get women to speak. There’s a connection between the far right and misogyny.”The woman has released a statement thanking the community for its “love and support”. She said: “I would never wish this on anyone. All I was doing was going about my day on my way to work, and what has happened has deeply affected us.“Through it all, my family has been my rock and my community has stood strong beside me.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

These engagements are routine and reflect our commitment to constructive dialogue on issues that matter to our members and the wider sector.”Business leaders have been closely watching Reform after its sweeping local election victories this year and as opinion polls suggest it could win hundreds of seats at a general election. But while Reform said it had welcomed hundreds of businesses to its annal conference in Birmingham earlier this month, most groups sent junior staff, with bosses still concerned about being associated with the rightwing party.All of the UK’s “big five” trade bodies – including the CBI, British Chambers of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses – dispatched public affairs executivesto the conference.Heathrow sponsored an airport-style lounge for business delegates and First Group provided double-decker buses for meetings. JCB, the digger-maker owned by Lord Bamford, the billionaire former Conservative donor who is now backing Reform, was also an exhibitor, and other corporate attenders included Airbnb and Japan Tobacco International.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russian officials insist he died of a mixture of diseases, including heart arrhythmia triggered by hypertension.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday he was unaware of Navalnaya’s claims.Navalnaya, who lives abroad, posted a video on X in which she said biological material from Navalny was smuggled abroad in 2024 and then examined by two laboratories.“These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,” Navalnaya said, urging the two laboratories to release the findings.“These results are of public importance and must be published. We all deserve to know the truth,” she said.Navalnaya also said the surveillance footage from the final day of her husband’s life had vanished, despite the opposition leader being under near-constant camera monitoring throughout his imprisonment.She did not specify what poison the laboratories had found.Navalny’s allies also released previously unseen photographs they said were taken inside the prison cell after his death. The images show a cramped cell with what appears to be vomit and blood on the floor, next to a notebook and an Oxford dictionary.Leonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny, wrote on X that the opposition leader had been “murdered in an agonising way, with poison”.He added: “No matter how much they tried to erase details from the medical records or cover their tracks, we know everything about his final day and the method of his killing.”The regional penitentiary service said in a statement at the time of his death that Navalny “felt unwell after a walk and almost immediately lost consciousness”.Last year, the investigative outlet the Insider also raised the possibility that Navalny had been poisoned, citing medical records that appeared to have been altered to support the state’s claim that he died of cardiac problems.The Insider published what it said was the original report, which stated that on 16 February Navalny “complained of severe abdominal pain, began vomiting, suffered convulsions and lost consciousness” – details, the Insider said, that suggested possible poisoning.A second version of the report, which appeared to have been edited, omitted those symptoms.The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.In 2020, Navalnyfell into a comaafter a suspected poisoning using novichok by Russia’s FSB security service and wasevacuated to Germany for treatment.He recovered andreturned to Russia in January 2021, where he was arrested on a parole violation charge and received the first of several jail sentences that would have amounted to more than 30 years behind bars.Explore more on these topicsAlexei NavalnyRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Cleaning staff detected the break-in later that day and museum teams saw that four to six pieces of gold were missing.The thieves are believed to have used an angle grinder and blowtorch to force their way into the riverside museum that sits on the edge of Paris’s Jardin des Plantes. It is an unprecedented theft from the high-security museum.A museum spokesperson said thieves took “several specimens of native gold from the national collections held by the museum”. The spokesperson added: “While the stolen specimens are valued at around €600,000 based on the price of raw gold, they nevertheless carry an immeasurable heritage value. The museum laments this inestimable loss for research, heritage and for a collection accessible to the public.”Native gold is a metal alloy containing gold and silver in their natural, unrefined form.The museum’s director, Emmanuel Skoulios, told BFMTV: “We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment. It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items. Beyond the material value, for the museum this is above all about pieces in the national collection whose historic, scientific and heritage value is incalculable.”View image in fullscreenA case in the geology and mineralogy gallery in the French natural history museum.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe museum’s mineralogy gallery remained closed on Wednesday while the organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police led an investigation. Security was increased at the museum and staff were checking the collection for other losses.One of the museum’s treasures, according to its website, is a native gold and quartz sample measuring 9cm by 8.5cm that originated in the Donatia mine in California and was donated by a wealthy French collector.Earlier this month the Adrien-Dubouché National Museum in Limoges, central France, wasbroken intoand thieves took three objects worth a total of more than €6.5m and classed as “national treasures” in France. They were two 14th- and 15th-century China porcelain plates and an 18th-century China porcelain vase.The mayor of Limoges, Émile Roger Lombertie, told Agence France-Presse on the day the robbery was discovered: “Criminality is increasing, we always have to be one step ahead. All the great museums of the world have had pieces stolen at one time or another. It is seemingly collectors giving orders to established criminal gangs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I mean if you want closer ties with us then why participate in exercises that are an existential threat to us?”She said there were “clear areas of disagreement” that were obstacles to deeper cooperation, but Europe did not want to pushIndiainto “Russia’s corner”.View image in fullscreenEuropean Commission presents package of measures on Israel, in BrusselsKaja Kallas, the European Commission’s high representative for foreign affairs.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersCommenting on India’s purchases of Russian oil and military exercise participation, Kallas added: “We will definitely always raise these questions and currently we don’t have a mutual understanding here.”The European Commission also objects toIndia’s purchases of discounted Russian oil, which helps Vladimir Putin fund his war on Ukraine.Meanwhile the EU is grappling with demands from Trump to imposeup to 100% tariffs on India and China, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.The EU has said it intends to tighten secondary sanctions on non-European actors that are helping Russia evade western restrictions when it publishes its next set of sanctions proposals.But privately, officials havebalked at 100% tariffs, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.Šefčovič did not respond directly to questions about whether the EU would agree to US demands for 100% tariffs, but said the bloc already had strong measures aimed at stopping circumvention of sanctions.He added: “We are of course coordinating very closely with the United States, but also with other G7 partners because we believe if the G7 acts in the same manner, of course, the impact, then it is much stronger.”View image in fullscreenRussia conducted military training drills simulating conflict with Nato this week.Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/Sputnik/Kremlin pool/EPAAsked about the link between the trade talks and India’s relations with Russia, Kallas said: “Negotiations are negotiations and until we agree about everything then nothing is agreed.” She added that the EU had to take into account its interests, concerns and “problematic issues”.The strategy paper was published shortly before the Kremlin announced Putin had had a phone call with Modi, where they discussed plans for the Russian president’s visit to India in December.Šefčovič, who is in charge of trade talks, said trade between the EU and India had grown by 90% over the last decade, making the bloc India’s largest trading partner, ahead of the US and China, as well as one of India’s top investors – “and yet I am absolutely convinced that we have only scratched the surface”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He explains how he became the ultimate activist-actorWed 17 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 11.01 EDTShareAmid the hustle of midtown Manhattan on Wednesday 11 May 2022, James Cromwell walked into Starbucks, glued his hand to a counter and complained about the surcharges on vegan milks. “When will you stop raking in huge profits while customers, animals and the environment suffer?” Cromwell boomed as fellow activistsstreamed the protest online.But the insouciant patrons of Starbucks paid little heed. Perhaps they didn’t realise they were in the company of the tallest person ever nominated for an acting Oscar, deliverer of one of thebest speeches in Succession, and the only actor to utter the words “star trek” in a Star Trek production. Police arrived to shut down the store.“No one listened to me,” Cromwell muses three years later. “They would come in, hear me at the top of my lungs talking about what they were doing with these non-dairy creamers, and then they would go around to the far corner, get their order in and stand there looking at their cellphones. ‘It’s the end of the world, folks! It’s going to end! We have 15 minutes!’”Undeterred, Cromwell remains one of Hollywood’s greatest actor-activists – or maybe activist-actors is more accurate. He marched against the Vietnam war, supported the Black Panthers and took part in civil disobedience protests over animal rights and the climate crisis. He has lost count of how many times he has been arrested, and has even spent time in prison.But now, at 85, he could be seen as the avatar of a disillusioned generation that marched for peace abroad and progressive goals at home, only to see, in their twilight years, Donald Trump turn back the clock on abortion and many other gains.Cromwell certainly looks and sounds the part of an old lefty who might have a Che Guevara poster in the attic and considerBernie Sanders to be too softon capitalism. When the Guardian visits his home – a log cabin in the farming town of Warwick, upstate New York, where he lives with his third wife, the actor Anna Stuart – he rises from a chair at the hearth with a warm greeting and outstretched hand (it is a big hand that would have required a generous dollop of glue).Cromwell stands at 6ft 7in tall like a great weathered oak. “Probably 10 years ago, I heard somebody smart say we’re already a fascist state,” he says. “We have turnkey fascism. The key is in the lock. All they have to do is the one thing to turn it and open Pandora’s box. Out will come every exception, every loophole that the Congress has written so assiduously into their legislation.”Cromwell has seen this movie before. His father John Cromwell, a renowned Hollywood director and actor, was blacklisted during the McCarthy era of anti-communist witch-hunts merely for making comments at a party praising aspects of the Russian theatre system for nurturing young talent and contrasting it with the “used up” culture of Hollywood.This seemingly innocuous observation, coupled with his presidency of the “Hollywood Democrats” which later “moved slightly to the left”, led to John Cromwell being called to testify to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He had nothing substantive to say but a committee emissary still demanded an apology.John Cromwell refused and, with a $1m cheque from Howard Hughes for an unrealised project, moved to New York, where he acted in a play with Henry Fonda and won a Tony award. James reflects: “My father was not touched except for the fact that his best friends – a lot of them – cut him out and wouldn’t talk to him because he had been called to testify. They didn’t care whether the person was guilty or not – sort of like today.”Cromwell’s mother, Kay Johnson, and his stepmother, Ruth Nelson, were also successful actors. Despite this deep lineage, he was initially reluctant to follow in their footsteps. “I resisted for as long as possible. I was going to be a mechanical engineer.”View image in fullscreenCromwell at home in his log cabin in Warwick, NY.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/The GuardianHowever, a visit to Sweden, where his father was making a picture with Ingmar Bergman’s crew, proved to be a turning point. “They were creating something and my father was engaged and was working things out. It was very heady stuff for me. I said: ‘Oh, I gotta do this.’”Art and politics collided again when he joined a theatre company founded by Black actors, and toured Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot for predominantly African American audiences in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia. Some performances took place under armed guard in case white supremacists tried to firebomb the theatre.Godot struck a chord. At one performance in Indianola, Mississippi, the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer urged the audience: “I want you to pay attention to this, because we’re not like these two men. We’re not waiting for anything. Nobody’s giving us anything – we’re taking what we need!”Cromwell says: “I didn’t know anything about the deep south. I went down and the rooming house had a sign on the outside, ‘Coloreds only’. I thought: ‘That’s a historical marker, obviously, back from the civil war.’ A wonderful Black lady took us to our rooms.“We went out to have dinner, and the owner of the restaurant came over and said: ‘You’ll have to leave.’ I’d never been thrown out of a restaurant before, so I immediately stood up with my fist balled. I would have done something stupid. John O’Neal [one of the company’s founders] informed the man that he was violating our civil rights and that they would get to the bottom of it.”But then, mid-anecdote, Cromwell stops himself and breaks the fourth wall of our interview. “I’m listening to myself,” he says. “These are not just stories about an actor doing his thing growing up, trying to get the girl, trying to keep his nose clean, trying not to get hurt. People were dying, people were being beaten, people were being shot, people had crosses burned on their lawns.“I feel strange recounting it always with the points that I think an interviewer would be interested in: ‘My story’. People ask if I should write a book because I have all these stories and I’ve done a lot of different things as well as acting.”Later, his wife will confide that she is among those lobbying Cromwell to write a memoir. But he has little appetite for such a project, he insists, since he fears it would be formulaic and“because my father tried it and it was so bad even his wife, who adored him, said: ‘That’s really stinky, John.’”We push on with his story all the same. Cromwell had been notching up film and TV roles for decades when, at the age of 55, his career took off thanks to his role as a farmer in Babe, a 1995 film about a pig that yearns to be a sheepdog. It was a surprise hit, grossing more than $250m worldwide.View image in fullscreenCromwell with the eponymous Babe in 1995.Photograph: Universal/Everett/ShutterstockCromwell funded his own campaign for an Oscar for best supporting actor in Babe, spending $60,000 to hire a publicist and buy trade press ads to promote his performance after the studio declined to fund it. The gamble paid off when he received the nomination, the kind of accolade that means an actor is offered scripts rather than having to trudge through auditions.“I wouldn’t be here if I had not gotten a nomination,” he says, “because I was so sick of the dance that had to be done when you did an audition. I finally asked a director: ‘What was it about the audition that made you give me the part? I did it no differently than I’ve done anything.’ He said: ‘Jamie, it has nothing to do with your performance; we just want to see that you’re the kind of guy we want to spend four weeks with.’“It was the chip on my shoulder which, because I knew him, didn’t show as much as it did when I went in to audition with a stranger who I identified as my father. I had the thing from my father – there he is again in me, telling me I’m not good enough, I’ll fail in the reading. I was just fucking sick of it.”View image in fullscreenWith Helen Mirren in The Queen.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThe recognition for Babe led to roles including presidents, popes and Prince Philip in Stephen Frears’ The Queen, as the industry tried to categorise him. In Star Trek: First Contact he played the spacefaring pioneer Dr Zefram Cochrane, who observes of the Starship Enterprise crew: “And you people, you’re all astronauts on … some kind of star trek.”Cromwell views Hollywood as a “seamy” business driven by “greed” and “the bottom line”. He criticises the focus on “asses in the seats”, the lack of genuine debate on issues such as racial diversity and the increasing influence of online followings on casting decisions. He has “no interest in the parties” and sees the “game” as secondary to “the deal”. He also admits that he can be a handful on set: “I do a lot of arguing. I do too much yelling.”He offers the example of LA Confidential, which he describes as a “genius piece of work”. In one scene, Cromwell’s menacing Captain Dudley Smith asks Kevin Spacey’s Jack Vincennes, “Have you a valediction, boyo?” before shooting him dead. Spacey, by then an Oscar winner, disagreed with director and co-writer Curtis Hanson over what Vincennes should reply. A quietly defiant Spacey won their battle of wills.This spurred Cromwell to try a line change of his own. Hanson objected. “Sure enough, he stands behind me and says: ‘Jamie, I want you to say the line the way it was written.’ But not having Kevin’s experience and his propensities, I said: ‘You motherfucker, fuck you, you piece of shit! You don’t know what the fuck you’re doing.’ I kicked dirt on him. I punched a camera car.“He had his arms crossed and he looked at me and said: ‘You asshole, I’m going to cut it out in post [production] anyway – it’s not going to be in there and you’ll never work in this town again.’ I learned: ‘Oh shit, you’d better perfect this technique because they’re not necessarily going to like this.’”View image in fullscreen‘A genius piece of work’ … Cromwell with Russell Crowe in LA Confidential.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThirty years on, of course, it is Spacey who has been banished to the Hollywood wilderness over sexual misconduct allegations, though he was not convicted of any crimes. Actors such as Stephen Fry, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone have argued that Spacey paid the price and that unproven allegations should not permanently end his career.Asked for his take, Cromwell at first demurs. “No, I can’t do that, man,” he protests. “I can’t talk about a fellow actor.”But then he brings up the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting that the convicted sex offender’s elite social circle has received more lenient treatment than Spacey. “They have one set of rules for them and another set of rules for Kevin. Kevin gets whacked, it means the end of his career. They [the Epstein associates] all fly down there on their Lolita Express, they do whatever they want. What happens to them? Zilch happens to them. The justice department is turned upside down. That’s what pisses me off. The duplicity of it. It’s disgusting.”In a varied TV career, Cromwell has won an Emmy award for American Horror Story: Asylum and earned Emmy nominations for roles in RKO 281, ER, Six Feet Under and most recently Succession where he played Ewan Roy, the estranged brother of the Rupert Murdoch-style patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox).Cromwell spent an hour talking with Jesse Armstrong, creator of Succession, before agreeing to take on the role, insisting that Ewan Roy’s break from the family should be based on political morality rather than financial jealousy. “I figured out he was a Vietnam veteran. He went in for two tours. I said: ‘Nobody comes back from two tours in Vietnam unblemished, untouched by the havoc, the chaos of that place.’”Cromwell adds, however, that Armstrong is a “smart” writer who managed to write around his objections and get him to play the character that Armstrong wanted. The arc culminated in a powerhouse eulogy delivered by Ewan at Logan’s funeral – a perfect marriage of the crafts of acting and writing.Ewan’s formative experience in Vietnam was an inversion of Cromwell’s own political awakening as an anti-war protester. He was arrested for the first time at a huge demonstration in Washington in 1971. He recalls: “I took a swing at a cop because he hit this woman right in front of me, across the face with his baton, smashing her glasses, and I said: ‘That can’t be.’“I grabbed him and came away with his baton, and then they all jumped on me, but nobody hurt me. As I was being loaded into a van, the cop I jumped came at me with his fist, he threw it and it glanced off me, and then they shut the door and nothing happened to me.”View image in fullscreen‘I do too much yelling on set’ … Cromwell in Succession with Brian Cox, right.Photograph: HBOThere have been dozens of arrests since then. After a sit-in protest in 2015 at a natural-gas-fired power plant in Wawayanda, New York, Cromwell refused to pay a $375 fine and ended up in prison. “The guy who did the interview didn’t know who the fuck I was and said: ‘Are you afraid you’ll be raped when you’re in here?’ I said: ‘Not unless they’re a lot hornier than I think they are,’ because it didn’t make any sense.“He said: ‘Are you afraid that you’ll rape someone?’ Will I catch the disease of the class system in prison in order to protect myself and put myself in a position of finding some defenceless young men sent in there for some reason, and get a couple of guys to hold him down while I fuck him? That’s the thinking.”Cromwell describes his three days inside as “moving”. He went on hunger strike and had the poignant experience of seeing “Oh God, get me out of here” written in the grout by another inmate. Soon after, he was arrested again, this time for disrupting an orca show at SeaWorld.He is a vegan and an honorary director of People for the Ethical Treatment ofAnimals(Peta), which he calls “the most ethical organisation I have ever been involved with”. He insists that society must “stop killing animals, start creating vegan foods, which are nutritious, tasteful and don’t involve killing another animal”. He sees animal agriculture as a significant contributor to global heating, which “is going to kill us. It’s going to kill our children. It’s going to kill the planet”.View image in fullscreenCromwell leads a Peta protest against Air France’s Cruelty To Monkeys in 2014.Photograph: Joe Kohen/FilmMagicCromwell got the Starbucks glue idea from Extinction Rebellion, the British-founded movement that aims to compel government action through non-violent civil disobedience. Extinction Rebellion’s road blockades, and the group Just Stop Oil’s attacks on artworks, have been criticised by some as counterproductive. He disagrees.“If you don’t push back, they eat you alive,” he insists. “Now, is pushing back going to go to excess? Sometimes, yes. We’ve got crazies; we have double agents, we have people infiltrated. You think the East Germans, the communists had it? They don’t have anything to put up with compared to what we’ve got going on in this country as the ratline for taking people out, misinformation, throwing elections, buying elections. Every fucking thing that they can do, they do.”But did he ever worry that activism would hurt his acting career?“I don’t think they give a shit what – no, I take that back. Enough people know me now because of my animal activism that the studio might consider I’m a troublemaker and, when it comes to the press junket, instead of talking about the movie I’m going to talk about veganism or Gaza.“So the best way to shut him up is just to shun him, and that’s true forWill Geer[an actor and activist blacklisted during the McCarthy era] and that’s true for a lot of people who had something to say and wanted to say it, and could have been able to say it.”View image in fullscreenCromwell’s ‘Dinosaur protest’, calling on world leaders to ‘Stop the Human Asteroid’ at Cop15 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2022.Photograph: Graham Hughes/APIn Cromwell’s worldview, the descent of the US into tyranny runs much deeper than one president. It is an amoral system designed to benefit oligarchs, exploit loopholes and grind down the working class and the planet. Trump is merely “the frontman”, he says.“He’s the guy outside the theatre saying: ‘Come on in! You’re going to love this show, I got the best people.’ That’s who he is. He’s a shill for this shit. While Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and those guys walk around, they don’t give a rat’s ass about any worker, about any environmental issue. They don’t give a shit.View image in fullscreenCromwell with his 2018 Audi TT at home in Warwick, NY.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/The Guardian“The governmental system that we have, the societal system we have is so corrupt and so full of mendacious, egregious lies that it’s very hard to know how to look at it and say: ‘Well, what do I do?’”Cromwell’s generation must have thought they had won significant battles for women’s rights, civil rights and the environment. Yet, now, in old age, they are forced to watch Trump and his allies unravel that progress. After all the years, all the protests, all the arrests, does he still have hope?‘I went vegan on the second day of filming’: James Cromwell on making Babe, the talking pig classicRead moreHe citesstudents protesting at New York’s Columbia University, civilians protesting in Israel and a few American politicians who are still fighting the good fight. He also talks about his T-shirt, which is black and printed with the words “Dare to be an artist” in red.He explains: “If celebrity is stuffed in your pocket, it burns a hole in your pocket. You have to spend celebrity so that people can learn something from it and they can hear you and you can speak for them. This is the advantage that I have that somebody in Texas does not have. You come and stick a microphone in front of me and it goes someplace and somebody listens to it.”Starbucks, by the way, capitulated last year and announced that it will no longer charge extra for vegan milks.

Growing up, her father was an amateur photographer, and her father’s cousin owned a photo studio, and seeing them photograph people as a child created a desire in her to become an image-maker.At seven years old, she discovered the book The Sweet Flypaper of LifebyLangston Hughes and Roy DeCarava; upon seeing its cover image, she had a revolution. “Fast forward, I wanted to be a photographer,” she says.Ultimately, her passion for photography would result in pioneering research for her in-depth undergrad paper, which included about 300 names and works by Black photographers. Publisher Richard Newman would recognize the importance of her findings, and together in 2000 they would create Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers: 1840 to the Present – the first comprehensive history of Black photographers.Their book reshaped the narrative of America through showcasing to the nation images that centered the point of view and life of the everyday Black person in the moments in which they were facing discrimination and subjected to subhuman treatment.View image in fullscreenA Harlem newsboy in New York, New York.Photograph: Gordon Parks/Library of CongressOn 18 November, a new edition of the book will be released; in coordination she has curated an exhibit titled Reflections in Black: A Reframing on view in New York City.

She has also published many other books and held several teaching positions and, in a full circle moment, she was curator of photographs and prints at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture which served as her guiding light as she did her undergrad research.She hopes Reflections in Black allows people to rethink their stereotypes of Blackness. “I want people to see that this work that the artists are making is about freedom, freedom to express that voice that James Baldwin always talked about,” she says. “Freedom to think of progress and to see the new narratives that are not based on others who only see Black people as othered and demeaning … and see it as an intervention.”Open gallery|0Throughout the book, she guides the audience through pivotal moments that informed the image-making process of Black photographers. First, daguerreotypes invented by Louis Daguerre were the first successful photographic process introduced to the public in 1839. This new image-making technique that shaped photography from 1840 to 1900 allowed Black photographers such as James P Ball, Glenalvin Goodridge, and Augustus Washington t​​o make portraits of the everyday African American.From 1900 to 1940, Black photographers started to have their own studios, allowing photography to become more accessible during a time in which Black people were facing segregation and discrimination.“One need only peruse the visual representations of Black people commonly produced on postcards and sheet music to realize that the exaggerated features and demeaning situations depicted there left an enduring negative impact, one that has endured to this day,” Willis writes in Reflections in Black. “Most of their African American clients wanted to celebrate their achievements and establish a counter-image that conveyed a sense of self and self-­worth.”From 1930 to 1940, Black photographers such as Gordon Parks, Vera Jackson, and Arthur Eddie Williamson began working as photojournalists for local newspapers and magazines, such as Our World, Ebony, Sepia and Flash, which were marketed to Black readers. Their photographs became a more comprehensive coverage of political events and protests, with the help of smaller handheld cameras in the 1930s.View image in fullscreenPortrait of a couple, circa 1899.Photograph: Daniel Freeman/Courtesy of the Estate of Dr James K HillBlack image-makers in the 1950s to 1960s, such as Doug Harris, Elaine Tomlin, and Bobo Fletcher, began to study photography in workshops, art schools, and community centers. “Many of these photographers were determined to awaken social consciousness,” Willis notes in the first edition of Reflections in Black. “Their work is a testimony to the depth of understanding and love these photographers have for humanity.”From the 1980s to the 1990s, work by photographers such as Coreen Simpson began to be viewed as fine art, combining graphic abstraction and conceptual photography. Many of these images were “informed by their families and explored how they dealt with social issues like racism, unemployment, and child and sexual abuse”, Willis writes. Photographers ask their viewers to “contextualize his or her own experience within the visual referents offered by the photographer, and in doing so to find her or his own historical perspective, interpretation, or meaning in these works”, Willis writes.Currently, she is intrigued by photographers who are asking difficult questions about their personal and family lives while creating abstract photographs and using colors to photograph their environment. “Photographers are documenting, but they’re also making and asking questions about the future,” she says. “At the same time, they’re finding ways to celebrate the lives that have been lived and using new technologies to make three-dimensional images, making them monumental.”View image in fullscreenAll American Family Portrait, 2018.Photograph: Courtesy of Tyler MitchellThe Black New Vanguard, a term coined by Antwaun Sargen, a writer, editor and curator, recognizes the current decision by photographers like Tyler Mitchell and Adama Delphine Fawundu to move photography forward by adding film-making, memory studies and historical references to their process. Willis says in this movement, “you just find pleasure, you just find passion, and so I see that in some other ways that the new vanguard, that they are looking at ways to find pleasure and joy in their experiences, as they experience the difficult moments”.As the photographers adapted and changed their style, for Willis the concept of beauty has an everlasting presence in the work of Black image-makers. She began to notice the presence of everyday beauty in her mother’s salon growing up. “I learned beauty matters for women of all ages and all disciplines,” she says. But her experiences in 2001, transformed how she defined beauty. That year was a “shocking, awful, and surprising experience”, as she describes it.After winning the MacArthur award that year, her 27-year-old nephew was killed during an altercation at a nightclub in Philadelphia when he was on his way to help her install an art exhibit she curated in DC. The first thing she said to herself upon hearing about his death was, “These kids did not know love. How could you not know love? How could they not see his beauty? How could that happen?”View image in fullscreenNtozake Shange in October 1977.Photograph: Anthony BarbozaMonths later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and as a result she began to lose her hair, and noticed how uncomfortable people became with her bald head and lack of eyebrows. “Even in illness, beauty is important, because people would say some horrible things, and be insensitive to the fact that I’m dealing with my mortality,” she notes.“I thought about Toni Morrison and her work, and she said, ‘Beauty is,’ and then just those two words meant so much to me,” she says. “I started thinking about images from the 19th century, how Black women who were enslaved, how they began to adorn themselves, and why it was important for them to see themselves as human.”In the new edition of Reflections in Black, she continues her mission by not portraying beauty as a performance, but by illuminating the quiet everyday moments of Black life that are full of hope, struggle, resilience and joy“I’m hoping people will see that [Black] people are not performing” Willis says. “[and] that we are human.”Reflections in Black: A Reframing is now on display at New York University’s Cooper Square Gallery until 15 October"

They also had some surprising help from Jonathan Aitken …Wed 17 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareYou know how it is with films about inspirational teachers: the teachers in question are always cool. Whether they’re sexy, like Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds and Sidney Poitier in To Sir, With Love, or as defiantly unorthodox as Paul Giamatti in The Holdovers and Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society, they’re larger-than-life in a way that marks them out as Hollywood characters.The teacher in Brave the Dark is cut from a different cloth. Directed by Damian Harris, and starring his brotherJared Harris, the film tells the true story of Nate (Nicholas Hamilton), a self-destructive teenager who keeps getting into trouble in small-town Pennsylvania in the mid-1980s. Harris plays Stan Deen, the English teacher at Garden Spot high school, who cares enough to help. So far, so conventional. The sweet-natured, quietly radical twist is that Stan is far from cool. He dresses drably. He makes bad jokes. He sings Broadway show tunes to himself. And the closest he gets to delivering a rousing speech is saying “This too shall pass” so often that it gets on Nate’s nerves.View image in fullscreenNicholas Hamilton and Jared Harris on the set of Brave the Dark.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockThe first draft of the screenplay was co-written by the real Nate, now a photographer and theatre producer in his 50s, so when I speak to him and Damian Harris on Zoom – Harris from his home in Los Angeles, Nate from Germany, where he is promoting the film – we soon come to the issue of Stan’s uncoolness. “It’s easier to make a movie that uses the cool, hip, funny, wisecracking guy,” Harris says, “easier to make and easier to sell. But Jared and I, guided by Nate’s script, just had to remain strong [in our belief] that this was the story that we were telling.”Jared Harris: ‘Dad knocked out an Irishman then brought him round by throwing Guinness in his face’Read moreThe story is that the 17-year-old Nate is an orphan who has bounced from foster home to foster home, and has ended up sleeping in his car. After he is arrested for robbing an electronics shop in New Holland, Lancaster County, he is forced to leave school and work on his grandparents’ farm. It is not a healthy environment, to say the least, and Stan then comes to the rescue – specifically, he drives to the rescue, singing show tunes. He persuades his fellow teachers to give Nate another chance, invites the boy to sleep in his spare room, and he keeps talking to him until he opens up about his horrific childhood traumas. It’s all true, says the real Nate – and he was so grateful that he eventually changed his name to Nathaniel Deen in honour of his mentor, who died in 2016.View image in fullscreenBrave the Dark.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockStan was also the person who encouraged Nate to write down his experiences, whereupon he and a friend decided that they should collaborate on a screenplay rather than a prose memoir. “I just wanted to get the story on paper,” says Deen, “and that was good enough for me.”Oddly enough, the story might well have stayed on paper if it weren’t for Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who was imprisoned for perjury in 1999 after suing the Guardian for libel. As students of Irish-British acting dynasties will know, Richard Harris was married to Elizabeth Rees-Williams, with whom he had three sons, Damian, Jared and Jamie. After that relationship ended, Rees-Williams married Rex Harrison, and then in 2003 married Aitken. So, how did Harris get the script? “Weirdly,” he says. “My stepfather Jonathan Aitken wrote a book when he was in prison that two New Zealander producers optioned to make into a television series. He said, ‘If you’re ever in Los Angeles, look up my stepson,’ which they did. About a year and a half later, Nate’s script arrived, and they asked if it was something I’d like to direct – and it was. It’s rare to be really emotionally moved by a script, but I definitely was.”View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Jamie Harris, Damian Harris, Richard Harris and Jared Harris in the film The Ghost of Richard Harris.Photograph: Harris ArchiveFrom then on, the project continued to be a family affair. “I often give my scripts to my brothers, who are both actors,” says Harris, “just to get their feedback on how the characters are working. I worked with Jared on it, and it just became really clear that he should play Stan. The sales agents and the producers were very happy about that.” Students of Irish-British acting dynasties may know that Damian directed Jared in his first screen role, in 1989’s The Rachel Papers; and that the youngest Harris brother, Jamie, plays Nate’s parole officer in Brave the Dark.Watch the trailer for Brave the Dark.With some input from Jared, Harris set about cutting down Deen’s screenplay to a manageable length: “I used to tease Nate that he’d written a Dickens novel. It really was an epic.” But he resisted the temptation to glamorise the narrative at its heart. “When you look at it objectively, you’ve got a teacher in a school you’ve never heard of, and a student who is difficult. They seem completely ordinary. But when you go with the story, you realise how extraordinary they actually are. You can find extraordinary people in the most ordinary circumstances.”And so it was that Brave the Dark became that rarest of things: a sincere celebration of kindness and decency. “As I was reading Nate’s script,” recalls Harris, “I thought, is this going to turn on Stan? Are we going to find out some ulterior motive of Stan’s? But that is my problem, not his. It was a story about somebody who works out of altruistic motivation, which I thought was worth telling. It’s a story about the goodness in people.”Brave the Dark review – delinquent teen drama comes off as if James Dean met Mr ChipsRead moreStan may sound too virtuous to be true, but after the decision was made to shoot the film on location in Lancaster County, Harris soon discovered how accurate Deen’s script was. “When I was scouting, the manager of the hotel that I was staying in had been in a similar situation to Nate, where he was really down on his luck and thinking dark thoughts. Stan took him in and let him sleep on his sofa for 18 months and helped pull him out of that dark place. And now he was married and had kids and was running a hotel.”View image in fullscreenDamian and Jared with their father, February 1966.Photograph: Stephan C Archetti/Getty ImagesThis proved to be a pattern. One running joke in Brave the Dark is that everyone in New Holland is willing to do Stan favours because they or their children have been helped by him. In reality, that was the case. “We were able to get 47 investors in Lancaster County to back us, and most of them knew Stan,” says Deen, who was on the set every day of production. “We got to shoot at the school where Stan taught, and former students let us use their farm for the grandparents’ house, and a lot of food and different things were provided by different people. The town just poured in everything they could to make it happen.”Typically for a drama that shies away from the usual “inspirational teacher” tropes, Brave the Dark doesn’t give Stan a triumphal final scene in which the pupils stand on their desks, or the whole town throws him a surprise party. It’s heartwarming, then, that this kind of fairytale Hollywood ending took place in real life, years after his death, when the community banded together to make a film about a teacher they loved. It turns out that he was pretty cool, after all.Brave the Dark is on UK digital plaforms from 15 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJared HarrisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then there is silly, sadistic trash like this: a micro-budget ripoff of cannibal-killer franchise The Hills Have Eyes, its lousy sequels and suchlike. It even features an actor from the original 1977 Hills’ cast: Susan Lanier here plays Martha, a blowsy barmaid with a taste for human flesh. But Hills at least attempted to craft some sort of backstory for its mayhem; Martha and her skeezy friends’ tastes are just a given, as if encountering cannibals is just one of the hazards of the boating life, like sharks or equipment failure.The lambs to this slaughter are a quintet of mostly stupid young people in their 20s, who get together for partying purposes on the yacht of rich boy Chad (Zachary Roosa). Passengers include Chad’s permanently bikini-clad girlfriend Dana (Meghan Carrasquillo), stag buddy Franklin (Jamal R Averett), and lesbian couple Brandy (Amy Byrd) and Jess (Caitlin Rose). Yards of cocaine are snorted, gallons of booze consumed and makeouts embarked on as teasers for the film’s real idea of fun: putting the young’uns at the mercy of the tattooed boatyard body-eaters, who bring them ashore when the yacht runs out of gas at sea.In the end, this isn’t anywhere near as gory as the Hills films at their worst, but there’s something much more dispiriting about The Boatyard’s pointlessness, its lack of wit, empathy, or basic film-making skill. The acting achieves such a finely tuned pitch of atrociousness it’s impossible to endure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he has made his feature debut with this complex, beguiling and often brilliant movie, co-produced by Anthony Chen; it manages to be part futurist satire, part coming-of-age dramedy, part high school dystopia. It combines the spirit of John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club with Lindsay Anderson’s If.… and there might even be a trace memory of Paul Schrader’s Mishima, only without the seppuku.In a high school in Kobe in the future, students are oppressed by the reactionary xenophobia of their elders; periodic earthquake warnings, and actual earthquakes themselves, create a widespread air of suppressed panic which the authorities believe justifies a perpetual clampdown. The prime minister has taken to claiming that undesirable elements are taking advantage of the earthquakes to indulge in lawlessness. In the school, there is an almost unconcealed racist disdain for students who are not fully ethnic Japanese as well as those who have unorthodox or rebellious views.One morning, the principal (Shirô Sano) is infuriated to see that some prankster has turned his shiny new yellow car up on its end in the school grounds, like a Stonehenge monolith. With some reason, he suspects the school’s cool-kid gang of rebels who, encouraged by liberal teacher Mr Okada (Ayumu Nakajima), have been allowed to hang out together in the “music research room”. They are Yuta (Hayato Kurihara), Fumi (Kilala Inori), Korean-Japanese Kou (Yukito Hidaka), Chinese student Ming (Shina Peng), African-American student Tom (Arazi) (who plans on joining his family in Detroit on graduation), and nerdy Ata-chan (Yûta Hayashi).However the glowering principal can’t prove anything, and the film itself does not show exactly who did this stunt or how on earth they managed it. But in a spiteful and retaliatory spirit he installs a video surveillance and face-recognition system in the school, brand-named Panopty (clearly afterJeremy Bentham’s panopticonprison design) which spies on the students’ every move. This Orwellian setup creates a massive dysfunction in the school, like a collective nervous breakdown, perhaps especially for Yuta and Kou, for whom the school’s calamitous loss of privacy perhaps means that, even as they heroically challenge this new oppression, they cannot acknowledge their feelings for each other.This is a movie that refuses to give us clear storylines, clear characterisations, clear meanings; even the fierce principal himself might not be quite so strict as all that. It’s a very stylish, thoughtful, heartfelt movie in which regular teen heartbreak might be quite as important as any political commentary.Happyend is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.

Release the penis-shaped balloons! Uncork the Château les Norks! But for pity’s sake conduct your celebrations quietly: Godolkin University’s clipboard-clutching new dean is in no mood for frivolity.“Let’s be real,” he drawls during his inaugural campus address. “The previous human administration was full of shit. We can’t trust humankind. And that is why, as your new dean, I will be preparing you for this brave new world,” he continues, as the assembled superheroes-in-training – or “supes”, as they’re called – variously gulp, whoop and clench their bum cheeks.So! New God U, new you. Specifically, new Emma (the wonderful Lizze Broadway), whose relief at her sudden release from the Elmira Adult Rehabilitation Center is tempered by the discovery that her lightly tyranny-padded seat of learning has gone full fascist.A brief recap, then, before we get our Speedos wet. The first series of this wildly irreverent spin-off of the sublime, R-rated superhero satire The Boys ended with Emma and fellow supes Marie, Andre and Jordan being stitched up by Homelander after their discovery of the clandestine, Vought-run medical/torture facility known as the Woods. (Homelander, for those not yet au fait with The Boys, is the psychopathic superhero figurehead of dastardly corporate cabal Vought International. Think, if you can stomach it, Trump in tights.) Got it? Good. And now? Marie (Jaz Sinclair) has escaped from Elmira and is on the run. After a valiant struggle with the powers that be, Andre (Chance Perdomo), alas, was not as fortunate. (FollowingPerdomo’s death in 2024, the decision was made not to recast the role.)Back at Godolkin, Emma and fellow releasee Jordan (London Thor/Derek Luh) are greeted by a grinning wall of suits and forced to read to the press a Vought-approved “victory” speech that turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be rubbish. Jordan, understandably, is suspicious. Not least of Dean Cipher (yes, Cipher), whose densely bearded presence Jordan is convinced they spotted “more than once” at Elmira. “He was a doctor or something,” the bi-gender shapeshifter tells a characteristically open-mouthed Emma. “And now he’s the dean? I mean, who the fuck is this guy?” Who indeed. Facts, discovers Emma, are thin on the ground. “I mean, the name ‘Cipher’ is a little on the nose, honestly …”View image in fullscreenExtravagant creepiness … Hamish Linklater as Dean Cipher.Photograph: Jasper Savage/PrimeCipher is played by Hamish Linklater, which is in itself a little on the nose, honestly. Is there anyone as adept at extravagant, nay, luxuriant creepiness as Hamish “Midnight Mass” Linklater? Let us discuss. Actually, let’s not. Let’s just accept that there isn’t. And then allow ourselves a gander at the actor’s spectacularly unnerving MO, albeit from a safe distance (the International Space Station, say; or crouched behind Emma during one of the bits where she suddenly goes big and all her clothes explode off). In addition to his stocks-in-trade (not blinking, being tall, speaking slowly in a sad voice before suddenly blurting out something unconscionable very quickly indeed), this particular Linklater performance comes with a range of Gen V-appropriate accessories. These include a set of ample action-eyebrows and a proclivity for calling those few, brave young supes who disagree with his belief in supe-supremacism “race traitors”. So, y’know, yikes.Unsurprisingly, campus unrest begins to mount. Humans are subjected to increasing harassment from the loutish, Cipher-emboldened frat-supes, while hopelessly naive activists scamper around daubing the word “Resist” over posters of Homelander’s spray-tanned fizzog.Elsewhere, as this second series unfurls its cape, it’s a joy and a relief to discover that it is business as usual. There are several outrageous, monocle-fogging set-pieces, including a gratuitous full-frontal male locker room scene complete with prosthetic thunder-dong. (What is it with Gen V and penises? Have 5,000 words on my desk by evensong.) There is an enormous amount of swearing and violence, much sweet-natured navigating of still-unformed teenage belief systems, several mildly confusing references to events in The Boys (the fifth and final season of which arrives next year) and many, many perfect jokes about the endless commodification of mental health and gender identity.But isn’t all this zippiness, this pinging between tones and genres a bit, well … throwaway? Ultimately, yes! But then, aren’t most things these days, when you think about it? Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm. It’s all part of its pinball patchwork of superhero tropes, romance, comic book baddies, thumpingly broad political satire and penises. Oh, so many penises. Enjoy!Gen V is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

After breaking through making music for ads and animations, the revolutionary film-makers of the 1960s Czechoslovak new wave asked him to soundtrack their movies, which he took as his greatest inspirations. With the help of radio engineering enthusiasts at Czechoslovakia’s film powerhouse, Barrandov Studios, he could imitate the whoosh of a spaceship or birds chirping. He composed underwater electroacoustic symphonies and music to be played on typewriters. Despite his innovations, he famously proclaimed: “I only write music under the pictures.”Liška was as productive as he was innovative: from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, he would score eight feature films a year, as well as numerous shorts and TV series. He could go camp or avant garde, channel Disney-like beauty and loved a waltz. His peers recall him composing on the night train or sketching the next cue while the orchestra was still recording the last one. Czechs from across the generations can whistle some of his melodies, such as the carnival-style theme from crime series The Sinful People of Prague.The longer he worked, the more he saw things in these films that their directors hadn’t even noticed. Liška scored 10 of surrealist directorJan Švankmajer’s short films. “He didn’t attempt to go with the mood of the film,” the director once said. “He was able to discover rhythms that even directors weren’t aware of.” Liška would compose with a stopwatch at the editing table, and often took on the additional role of film editor, suggesting cuts to fit his music. No other musical figure could match his influence on the Czech socialist film industry.Zdeněk Liška: Ikarie XB​-​1 – videoFinders Keepers label head Andy Votel first discovered Liška through the Czechoslovak new wave, and later rereleased his scores for Ikarie XB-1 and The Little Mermaid. He likens his impact to that ofEnnio Morricone. “He was solely committed to the film score medium and should be credited as someone who revolutionised how film music is made, despite his music being behind politically landlocked,” he says. He also sees parallels between Liška and electronic music pioneerDaphne Oram: “They were here to communicate with emotion and humour. The process was merely a vessel. But in Liška’s case, the history books, via the setbacks of socialist secrecy, are in need of a remix.”When Liška died of complications resulting from diabetes in 1983, aged just 61, his work had been almost forgotten. During his lifetime, only two records of his music – including his score for the 1965 Oscar-winning movie The Shop on the Main Street – were released. He wasn’t interested in live concert presentations, believing the sound shouldn’t be disconnected from the vision. He also produced communist propaganda, which complicated his legacy for Czechs.More than 40 years later, archivists and composers have been restoring his reputation. His music has been staged live on numerous occasions, including by the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Scholars study his electroacoustic inventions, his famous editing table is on display at the Czech Museum of Music and a 2017 Czech documentary, Music by Zdeněk Liška, told younger Czechs his story and underscored the reverence in which he is held. Last year, the Czech label Animal Music launched an archival vinyl series of Liška’s work, promising to open up his archive and release a new album every year. The first was dedicated to his collaborations with Švankmajer; the second, Music to Films by František Vláčil, arrives this month.View image in fullscreenA scene from Karel Kachyna’s 1975 adaptation of The Little Mermaid, scored by Liška.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPetr Ostrouchov is the label’s curator and composer. Compiling these releases has been a challenge that entails trying to get inside Liška’s head. “Thanks to the trust of the family, I was able to study his sheet music and understand his compositional logic a bit better,” he says. “Later, I was entrusted with access to his personal archive, and I retrieved digitised tapes from an old computer sitting in one recording studio’s cellar in Prague.” For each volume, Ostrouchov digs unnamed files from the hard drive and compares them with the film and sheet music. “A bit of detective work,” he says.Liška was born to a mining family in central Bohemia in 1922. His father led the miners’ brass band, giving Liška a close connection to music (and inspiring the countless brass motifs in his scores). After the second world war, he began his career at the Baťa shoe factory and its film studios in Zlín, far from his home town, where he composed music for commercials. (The studios were originally founded as the factory’s marketing department, but after the company was nationalised by communists and the city renamed to Gottwaldov, it continued separately as a counterpart to Barrandov.) Liška honed his craft on puppet stories by Hermína Týrlová, a Czech animation film pioneer, and befriended her then assistant, Karel Zeman, whose steampunk style can be seen in the craft of Terry Gilliam and Tim Burton.After the award-winning success of Zeman’s adaptation of Jules Verne’s Invention for Destruction, Liška became Czechoslovakia’s number one film composer, in demand by the likes of Věra Chytilová and Juraj Herz. The government also took notice. During the Normalisation after 1968, when four Warsaw Pact countries jointly invaded the country, Liška composed a symphony celebrating the Persian empire for Iran’s Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and scored the TV detective series 30 Cases of Major Zeman, a propagandist project overseen by the communist ministry of the interior. But he never joined the party or any artistic union. As a composer, he didn’t feel the same pressure as directors or writers.View image in fullscreenA scene from Ikarie XB-1, 1963.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“I think he was neutral to the regime,” says Liška’s oldest daughter, Hana. “He composed no matter the political system, and he was left to do his job, because his music was an important export and brought significant money back.” (The state agency Art Centrum arranged for him to work on multiple international expos, among other jobs for western countries. Liška also soundtracked expos in Montreal, Canada, and Osaka in Japan.) Prague Symphony Orchestra programme director and longstanding Liška scholar Martin Rudovský suggests that he was a “conformist”, albeit one who “doubted, in private, some of the propaganda films or TV series he scored. Certainly, he was not in opposition, for instance, as composers like Jan Novák.”Liška was making capitalist money in communist times, which attracted the attention of the politburo, but Liška was too successful to be persecuted. “Having a microwave or washing machine – let alone a swimming pool – was an unimaginable luxury for many at the time,” his daughter Barbora remembers. But not for Liška’s family. “We were used to these odd things.”At the end of Liška’s life, his daughters remember him spending “more time between hospitals and the recording studio than anywhere else”, until his death in July 1983. His legacy trickled through the iron curtain. Julian House – Ghost Box Records co-founder and then art student – had his first encounter with Liška when the Brothers Quay’s 1984 stop-motion short filmThe Cabinet of Jan Švankmajer, a surrealist tribute to the director that featured Liška’s music, was shown in the UK. “Liška’s compositions seem to have strange angles; they fit together in an odd way,” he says. House is also a graphic designer: “Something about them reminds me of collage, similarly to the film posters of the Czech new wave.”When the Berlin Wall came down, Oscar-winning film editor Joe Walker, a close collaborator of Denis Villeneuve, started noticing Liška’s name attached to many extraordinary films, he says. “It became, for me, a guarantee of quality. For a few years, when the editing work I hoped for was out of reach, I wrote music for documentaries, dramas and lots of children’s programmes. I tried to honour Liška every day by providing a diet of good music – serving up advanced harmony and jagged rhythms – even when the images were relatively banal.”Trailer for the documentary Music by Zdeněk Liška – videoVisionary composer, polymath and ‘true cosmopolitan’: Greece finally pays tribute to Iannis XenakisRead moreAnimal Music’s newest archival volume presents two lesser-known scores from Liška’s late career, collaborations with director František Vláčil. It’s personal for the curator, Ostrouchov: Vláčil’s 1967 existential medieval tale Markéta Lazarová introduced him to Liška in the early 1990s, when the movie won a critics’ poll for the greatest Czech movie of the century. Liška’s darkly ambient score pairs monumental choral music with tape manipulations and distant screams and whispers. (It’s so epic and timeless that the contemporary Czech post-hardcore band Lvmen have sampled bits of the score on every one of their albums since 1999, bringing Liška’s legacy into punk venues.) His score for Vláčil’s 1976 Smoke on the Potato Fields is the complete opposite, using melancholic string arrangements to tenderly guide the narrative about an émigré doctor who returns home in his twilight years.The archive still presents a gargantuan task for the future: Ostrouchov is imagining albums focusing on Liška’s music for documentaries or children’s programmes. His dream is to release Liška’s score to the questionable detective series 30 Cases of Major Zeman. “Liška scored a lot of schlock, but on the musical side, it was always ingenious,” he says. “He never phoned in.”Music to Films by František Vláčil (Archives Vol 2) is out now on Animal MusicExplore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicCzech RepublicSlovakiaElectronic musicClassical musicCommunismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the end of 1980 and Dolly Mixture were supporting the Jam for a second time, having piqued the interest of Paul Weller. Despite the shaky start, the teen trio made it through the set to appreciative applause. “Everyone is your friend when you support the Jam,” Wykes recalls in her new memoir, Teenage Daydream: We Are the Girls Who Play in a Band.Dolly Mixture paired girl-group harmonies and pop sensibilities with scuffed-up combat boots and charity shop dresses. Their intricate arrangements remained playfully punk, displaying a songwriting craft well beyond their years. Although beloved by the Undertones and John Peel, as well as becoming the first group to release a single on Weller’s label, Respond, the band never found the success of many of their peers. “I think people were confused,” says Wykes. “One: we were girls, and girls often didn’t play in bands. And if you’re not dressed in jeans and leather, you must be crap and cute. There was no subtlety allowed.”Dolly Mixture had arrived on the scene a few years ahead of the jangling indie wave, and right before bands such as Shop Assistants and the Pastels would bring precious pop back into vogue. In 1980, the band didn’t quite fit in with the cynicism and aggression of post-punk. “We had this pop mindset; we wanted to be on Top of the Pops,” Wykes says. “It was just an antidote to grey – and punk, which was getting boring.”View image in fullscreen‘We were trying to be unique’ … Debsey Wykes in 1979.Photograph: © Rich GunterBonded by a shared obsession with punk, 60s pop, and Eddie and the Hot Rods, Cambridge school friends Rachel Bor (guitar), Hester Smith (drums) and Wykes (bass) formed Dolly Mixture in 1978. They eschewed labels like punks, skins or mods to create their own tribe, naming them and their fans “Dolly Rockers”. “We were trying to be unique,” says Wykes.The band quickly gained local support. They had only been together about a year when they were asked to open for the Fall in Cambridge. A friend named Dave Goodman (producer and live engineer for the Sex Pistols) had offered to tune their guitars ahead of their set. “We went on and we just heard this awful noise and we didn’t know what it was,” Wykes says. “By the third song we realised it was us.” It turned out Goodman had tuned the guitars “pissed out of his head”, says Wykes. “The lower strings were higher than the highest strings, it was completely mental.”They also earned the respect of peers: luckily, Robyn Hitchcock, who had recently become a fan and friend, seized their instruments and quickly got them back in order. The band never let anyone tune their guitars again.The trio began splitting their time between Cambridge and London, playing as much as they could. It was at a London gig that they met Eric Faulkner, former guitarist for their tween idols the Bay City Rollers. Faulkner had liked their show and offered on the spot to produce a single. Several weeks later they were staying overnight at his glamorous apartment at the top of Kings Road, rehearsing for the next day’s studio sessions.Faulkner graciously woke the girls up each morning with tea and toast. “That was probably all he could make,” says Wykes. At the end of the day’s rehearsal, Faulkner gave the girls some cash and told them to go down to the supermarket. They returned with groceries, cooked some sausages and watched Eurovision together. “It was really bizarre – nice guy!” says Wykes.And a backstage encounter with the Undertones led them to invite Dolly Mixture to play with them in a nearby town. A week later, Wykes was at home playing piano when her mother announced: “There’s an Undertone on the phone for you.” It was guitarist John O’Neill, calling to ask if the band could join them on the remainder of their tour dates. They were elated and quickly said yes.Undertones fans were rowdier – and spittier – than any that Dolly Mixture had previously encountered. It was even worse when the band joined Bad Manners for a month-long tour a year later, when their shows were drawing some far-right fans. “We came across so many National Front people and they really hated us,” Wykes says. “They were sieg heiling and spitting and trying to get us off the stage. And we would not get off the stage.”View image in fullscreen‘The National Front people hated us – but we would not get off stage’ … Debsey Wykes and Rachel Bor of Dolly Mixture at the Marquee, London, in 1982.Photograph: Erica Echenberg/RedfernsThe band remained determined. “We found it quite an interesting challenge, to not get off, and to annoy them. Which we certainly did.” Plus they knew they had backup if anyone tried anything. “There was always someone backstage who would quite happily lump somebody – a fucking massive skinhead in the wings just waiting for the chance.”Wykes estimates the band played about 190 gigs in 1981 alone. It was a last minute drop-out by the Nips that landed Dolly Mixture their first show with the Jam. A mutual friend had advocated for the band despite Weller’s apparent disdain for their 60s girl group sound. But the trio won him over that night; they had entered the Jam’s orbit and soon began discussing recording some songs for Weller’s newly minted Respond Records. But despite two singles on the label – produced by their new friend Captain Sensible – a proper record deal never materialised. Wykes says when major labels expressed interest in the band, it was always followed by a sexist insistence that other musicians record the music for them. Dolly Mixture always refused. Or, says Wykes, they would say “they already had a ‘female’ on their books”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Happy Talk, Sensible’s first solo single, crashed the Top 100, and all of a sudden the band found themselves on Top of the Pops after all – as his backup singers when the song hit No 1. “It was very odd to step in through the door and have a little look around, get a few free drinks and be treated likeyou’reNo 1,” Wykes says.Soft sandwiches, street fights and surrealism: Marlene Marder’s memoir of Swiss punks Kleenex/LiliputRead moreWhile doing TV appearances and music videos for Sensible’s album, Dolly Mixture had plateaued, playing the same kinds of shows as ever without any label backing them. Frustrated, they decided to release an album themselves. The result was Demonstration Tapes, a two-disc LP of brilliant demo recordings limited to 2,000 copies. The band packaged the records themselves and signed them in pink pen. Today, copies are sought-after collector’s items.In 1984 Bor and Sensible announced that they were having a child, and Dolly Mixture started to wind down. Wykes continues to play music, including a longstanding role as a live member of Saint Etienne. In the interim, Dolly Mixture found fans in K Records founder Calvin Johnson, as well as younger bands such as Alvvays and Tchotchke. Demonstration Tapes has been repressed a number of times, and a rarities LP released in 2019 quickly sold out.Wykes’s book now adds a few more details to the band’s growing place in punk history. “I wrote this because I wanted to feel better about the whole thing, and put us on the map,” she says. “If I’ve done a little towards that, then it’s a really great thing.”Teenage Daydream: We are the Girls Who Play in a Band is published by New Modern on 25 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiePunkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

During his 35-year career fronting Swedish band At the Gates, he never toed the line, never grunted about loving violence and hating Christianity because the genre dictated that you do so. Rather, he ripped up the rulebook with both his messaging and his delivery, setting a new standard for distinctiveness in extreme music.Lindberg – who has passed away aged 52 after being diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare oral cancer – was fascinated with suffering. Yet, unlike his peers, he was seldom concerned with the suffering caused by a chainsaw or organised religion. It was the suffering inside of us, rooted in our own expectations, trauma and follies. “Twenty-two years of pain and I can feel it closing in,” goes the bridge of 1995’s semi-autobiographical fan-favourite track Cold. “The will to rise above, tearing my insides out.” And Lindberg delivered each line not with a typical, guttural rumble, but with a wailing screech that made all that anguish feel even more real.Born on 16 October 1972, Lindberg co-founded At the Gates in Gothenburg in 1990. They started as a somewhat lumbering musical entity, with early albums The Red in the Sky Is Ours and With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness attempting to push the death metal envelope using extended run times, structure-agnostic songwriting and violin solos.The band tightened up after guitarist/composer Alf Svensson left in 1993 and broke into a thrash metal-inspired sprint on the 1994 EP Terminal Spirit Disease. But Lindberg’s agonised poetry remained a constant. The singertold Invisible Oranges in 2010: “The whole concept of writing lyrics for me has always been to work myself through different subjects and to try to find my own standpoint, to not be guided by already fixed ideas.”At the Gates: Blinded by Fear – videoIn 1995, not long after a disastrous UK tour left the band furious and near penniless (at one point the band were left stranded in a Norwich car park for several days), At the Gates recorded their magnum opus, Slaughter of the Soul. Their frustration manifested across a blisteringly quick 34 minutes, ignoring all frills and breaking extreme metal down to its bare components: two or three riffs per song, chugging rhythm guitars comparable to Metallica, and histrionic harmonies influenced by Iron Maiden. With Lindberg at his most lyrically introspective (“Sweet nauseating pain, is death the only release?” he sang on Blinded by Fear) the material was as relatable as it was high-octane, and it became a surprise international hit.‘Israel and Iran’s governments aren’t good. Neither is ours’: Lowen, the metal band confronting a troubled Middle EastRead moreAt the Gates barely got to enjoy the fruits of their labour, breaking up in 1996 after lead guitarist and co-founder Anders Björler and his brother, bassist Jonas, stepped down. They didn’t return until 2007. “We were so young, inexperienced and unused to coping with outside, or internal, pressure,” Lindbergexplained during a 2014 Guitar World interview. “There’s no real communication when you’re 20.” However, their absence lent their music a quasi-mythical quality, and it piqued the intrigue of future members of such US bands as Trivium, Killswitch Engage and Lamb of God. Openly inspired by At the Gates’ fusion of power and melody, they became some of the biggest stars in metal during the midtolate 2000s.Once At the Gates returned, they put out three more albums and toured frequently, while Lindberg balanced the band with other musical projects and a job as a social studies teacher, not that his pupils were fussed. “What’s interesting is that it’s usually other teachers who think you’re cool,” hetold Loudwire in 2021. “They want to know about touring stories [but] I’m like, um, no. I’d rather be the nice-but-a-bit-boring teacher.”Lindberg was diagnosed with cancer in December 2023 but kept his condition hidden from fans until last month, when At the Gates issued a statement saying that he was “being closely monitored around the clock”. Three decades after Slaughter of the Soul made his band global idols, the singer’s cliche-breaking words and passionate screaming still feel like a benchmark that no death metal vocalist is likely to touch again.Explore more on these topicsMusicMetalcommentShareReuse this content"

You know, it’s not Bobby Gillespie or Gwen Stefani, it’s fuckingCilla Black. I’ve got no idea how she ended up there, but I’ve heard since that she was apparently a bit of a party animal.”It seems fair to say that a visit from Our Cilla was not what Melton expected when he started Nag Nag Nag in London in 2002. A former member of 80s goth band Specimen who DJed under the name Jonny Slut, he’d been inspired by a fresh wave of electronic music synchronously appearing in different locations around the world. Germany had feminist collective Chicks on Speed and DJ Hell with his groundbreaking label International DeeJay Gigolos. France produced Miss Kittin and The Hacker, Vitalic and Electrosexual. Britain spawned icy electro-pop quartet Ladytron and noisy, sex-obsessed trio Add N To (X). Canada spawned Tiga and Merrill Nisker, who abandoned the alt-rock sound of her debut album Fancypants Hoodlum and, with the aid of a Roland MC-505 “groovebox”, reinvented herself asPeaches. New York had performance art inspired duo Fischerspooner and a collection of artists centred around DJ and producer Larry Tee, who gave the sound a name: electroclash.The lyrics tended to be witty, occasionally foul-mouthed and very camp. The sound had house music, techno, 80s synth-pop and electro in its DNA, but boasted a rough-hewn, punky edge, the latter partly down to attitude and partly down to the era’s technological advances. “It isn’t like today, where you can take an idea to a playable version in five hours on a laptop,” says Larry Tee, “but you could record something releasable in your bedroom, you could get a Juno 106 [synthesizer] and alter the sounds and fry and burn them. I’m convinced the best electroclash tracks happened because people made mistakes, the levels were too loud or there was something wrong.”View image in fullscreenSweat and sparkle … Casey Spooner of Fischerspooner.Photograph: John Sciulli/Getty ImagesIt was audibly a reaction to something. In Britain, it felt a world apart from the increasingly slick dance scene of superclubs and superstar DJs. In New York, Larry Tee suggests it was a shift away from “trance and tribal house”. For Peaches, who had recorded her 2000 album The Teaches of Peaches in her bedroom, “lying in bed, smoking weed, masturbating and making beats”, it was music made by “marginalised, queer people … who were fed up with a system that was telling us ‘rock music has to be by four beautiful boys down the line from the Rolling Stones, electronic music has to be completely serious like you’re doing brain surgery while turning buttons’. Where was the punk? And for me, I can’t think of another time in music history where women were so at the forefront – Chicks on Speed, Miss Kittin, Tracy + the Plastics. It’s always like, ‘This dude did this’, you know?”Whatever it was an answer to – superclubs or rock’s traditional patriarchy – electroclash seemed to find an audience quickly. It wasn’t the only music Melton and his fellow DJs played at Nag Nag Nag – as underlined by a new 5CD box set, When the 2000s Clashed, they were equally wont to drop old punk singles, early industrial music or the Neptunes’ exploratory R&B – but electroclash was the club’s sonic backbone, and the night was an immediate success. Boosted by approving reviews first in the gay press, then the style magazines, its initial clientele – “a few old goths and some art students in their mum’s old curtains,” according to Melton – were soon joined by a succession of celebrities: Kate Moss, Alexander McQueen, Pet Shop Boys, Boy George, Björk. Perhaps inevitably, it attracted comparisons to celebrated New Romantic hangout the Blitz. “But there was no door policy, no guest list,” demurs Melton. “I didn’t want any of that exclusivity shit. It wasn’t posey at all, there was more a feeling of abandon. It was very hedonistic.”“It was the epitome of amazingness, this incredible melting pot of every kind of character,” says Concetta Kirschner, better known as rapper Princess Superstar, who turned up at Nag Nag Nag while promoting her 2002 UK hit Bad Babysitter. The club had an immediate impact on her sound. “It gave me a shot of freedom. I felt like there were a lot of tightly defined rules in hip-hop. But after Nag Nag Nag, I felt I could experiment, be whatever I wanted, rap over dance music or crazy new rhythms.”View image in fullscreenGreat one-liners … Peaches.Photograph: Jo Hale/Getty ImagesThe newly electroclash-adjacent Princess Superstar had a Top 3 hit with Perfect (Exceeder), a collaboration with Dutch producer Mason, but it was the exception that proved the rule. For all the excitement and press coverage it generated, electroclash noticeably failed to produce a major crossover star, although it wasn’t for want of trying in some quarters. The Ministry of Sound’s record label famously spent vast sums signing New York duo Fischerspooner, but their debut album #1 failed to catch light. “Electroclash didn’t work in hygienic conditions,” offers Mark Wood, a DJ and Nag regular behind the new box set. “It worked in clubs that were dark, hot, grubby, full of smoke, all sorts of things going on.”Peaches, meanwhile, went out on tour as a support to hard rock artists, including Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age: their audiences, she says, were “horrified”. “I think a lot of [electroclash artists] were offered these more traditional tours and thought ‘I can’t handle it’. On the Marilyn Manson tour I was spat on every night, but I rapidly developed some prank skills and some great one-liners.”But in Britain at least, electroclash entered the mainstream regardless, audibly impacting on the way existing pop stars sounded. Sugababes rebooted their career with Freak Like Me, a Richard X-produced reimagining of the old Adina Howard hit backed by the music from Tubeway Army’s Are Friends Electric? Another Richard X mashup, Being Nobody, which melded Rufus and Chaka Khan’s Ain’t Nobody with the Human League’s Being Boiled, was a Top 3 hit for Popstars runners-up Liberty X. You could hear echoes of electroclash in Goldfrapp’s platinum-selling 2003 album Black Cherry, Rachel Stevens’ 2004 hit Some Girls and Madonna’s 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor. Even Fischerspooner ended up on Top of the Pops, in the company of Kylie Minogue, performing their remix of Come Into My World.It was girls, gays and theys – and the music industry didn’t invest in those categoriesIn America, however, the movement provoked a backlash. “It was unfairly beaten up after three or four years,” says Larry Tee. “Electroclash was girls, gays and theys, the music industry didn’t really invest in those three categories, and I think they were as anxious to kill it as they were disco. I think the reason they wanted to burn electroclash so fast is that it didn’t really include that soccer bro culture, which EDM did.”Nag Nag Nag eventually closed its doors in 2008 – the club that hosted it, Ghetto, was demolished to make way for the Crossrail development. It seemed symbolic of the end of something bigger than electroclash. “It was Soho’s last stand as a grubby nightclub place – that’s all literally gone, everything moved east,” says Wood. “It was around the same time that smartphones arrived, which changed everything too. All that happened around the same time electroclash was being put to bed. Nothing lasts for ever if it’s worth having in pop music.”But recently, Jonny Melton noticed something odd. He was being sent new dance tracks that self-described as electroclash, while club nights, including London’s Shackled By Lust and Bloghouse, also use the term to describe what’s on offer. “That would never have happened before,” he laughs. “At the time electroclash was like goth – no one who was in a goth a band would ever admit to being a goth band.”View image in fullscreen‘At the time electroclash was like goth’ … Jonny Slut, centre, at Nag Nag Nag.Photograph: © Dale CornishMeanwhile, in 2023, Peaches embarked on a tour performing her debut album: it was both rapturously received and attracted an audience noticeably big on twentysomethings too young to remember its release. Princess Superstar, whose “career sort of died” in the 2010s, has watched with baffled delight as her electroclash-era hits unexpectedly enjoyed a new lease of life. First, Perfect (Exceeder) belatedly went gold in the US after it was used on the soundtrack of the 2023 movie Saltburn. Then, last year, her 2008 collaboration with Larry Tee, Licky, unexpectedly went viral on TikTok. “I think they thought it was by Britney Spears,” she says. “So I put a video up like, ‘Hey dudes’ and it all went crazy.”She’s currently making new music, some of it in collaboration with Frost Children, a US duo among a wave of younger artists who bear the influence of electroclash: you can hear its strains in Snow Strippers, Confidence Man and the Dare. Larry Tee, who’s currently planning an electroclash documentary, suggests there’s an influence in the music of both Lady Gaga and Charli xcx’s Brat.The music on When the 2000s Clashed still sounds remarkably fresh. Perhaps that fact that most of it remained underground, never dominating the singles chart or the radio playlists helped; so too does the fact that it’s informed by a lot of ideas that were subsequently mainstreamed: it was gender fluid before anyone talked about gender fluidity, sex-positive before anyone used that term either. “I think the younger generation get it,” nods Larry Tee, “because it was like the resistance: we’ve had enough of homophobia, enough of misogyny. For a moment, the door was open.”When the 2000s Clashed: Machine Music for a New Millenniumis out on 17 October on Demon/EdselExplore more on these topicsMusicDance musicElectronic musicIndiePeachesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Find out in this mind-expanding exploration of thought and consciousnessStuart JeffriesWed 17 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 06.24 EDTShareThis book is a trip. Among other things, it copiously details all the drugs that the US-born professor of history and philosophy of science at the Université Paris Cité has ingested. They include psilocybin, LSD, cannabis; quetiapine and Xanax (for anxiety); venlafaxine, Prozac, Lexapro and tricyclics (antidepressants); caffeine (“I have drunk coffee every single day without fail since September 13, 1990”); and, at least for him, the always disappointing alcohol.The really trippy thing, though, is not so much Justin Smith-Ruiu’s descriptions of his drug experiences, but the fact that they’re written by a tough-minded analytic philosopher, one as familiar with AJ Ayer’s Foundations of Empirical Knowledge as Aldous Huxley’s mescaline-inspired The Doors of Perception. Moreover, they’re presented with the aim of melting the minds of his philosophical peers and the rest of us by suggesting that psychedelics dissolve our selves and make us part of cosmic consciousness, thereby rendering us free in the way the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza defined it (paraphrased by Smith-Ruiu as “an agreeable acquiescence in the way one’s own body is moving in the necessary order of things”).The melting metaphor is apt, since the primal scene of early modern western philosophy came when the 17th-century French thinker René Descartes melted a piece of wax. The lump may change its form, smell, length, breadth, and yet, Descartes supposed, we still claim to know that it is the same piece of wax. The knower can be wrong about all their perceptions involving this wax but not, Descartes argued,thatthey are thinking: this is the basis of his famous “I think therefore I am” – by means of which the French thinker made us the rational, science‑venerating beings we have been ever since.Smith-Ruiu, discombobulatingly, flips the script on the Cartesian thought experiment: what if, instead of melting the wax, Descartes had “melted his mind” with acid, or one of those hallucinogens starting to arrive in Europe across the Atlantic along with potatoes and tobacco, such as peyote or ayahuasca? What if he had not foregrounded rationality and instead extolled the imaginative powers that, Smith-Ruiu suggests, are unleashed by psychedelics? The west might have ended up seeing the world completely differently, and human beings as “infinite reservoirs of light and wisdom”.There’s more in Smith-Ruiu’s psychedelic experience, one might say, than is dreamt of in strait-laced colleagues’ philosophies. His thinking seems kin to such voguish, mind-blowing movements as Markus Gabriel’s new realism, and Timothy Morton’s implosive holism and object-oriented philosophy. Immanuel Kant claimed the transcendent was by definition behind an impenetrable veil, inferable perhaps but never knowable. We could never, in this world, see God. For Smith-Ruiu, psychedelics might help lift that veil. For that thought alone I’m amazed – and cheered – that he got tenure.It’s worth mentioning at this point that this is not one of those gonzo books typed while the author is out of their gourd. Smith-Ruiu is no Hunter S Thompson. It is called OnDrugsbut it was not written on drugs (apart, presumably, from some of the prescription meds he details above and the odd espresso hit). “I am as I write, sober, lucid, and entirely focused on the task at hand.”The book ends with a remarkable plot twist (philosophical spoiler alert!). In 2023, Smith-Ruiu attended Catholic mass for the first time in 40 years at the church next door to his Paris apartment. His claim here is that the psychedelic experience is analogous to that of ritual worship: ordinary time is interpreted as a distortion, and during mass one might perceive, as he did on mushrooms, something like eternity. Another parallel is that one submits one’s will in church as on a psychedelic trip. He writes: “Psychedelics, like religion, like poetry are among other things an abandonment of the will to go it alone.” Smith-Ruiu is self-aware enough to note how absurd this sounds: that psychedelics have become his gateway drug to the Catholic church.And you don’t even need to take magic mushrooms from some geezer in a Dutch head shop (as Smith-Ruiu did) to melt your mind. He cites the opening of Proust’s novel À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when little Marcel dreamily imagines that he has become some of the things he has been reading about before nodding off – a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V – as an example of everyday psychedelia.That isn’t the only non-pharmaceutical way to expand your consciousness – you could try reading this extraordinary book, whose riches I can only hint at in this review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

What Le Guin proposed is that human culture, novels included, didn’t begin with technologies of harm, such as flints and spears, but with items of collection and care, such as the wicker basket or, nowadays, the carrier bag. And so, if we make them that way, novels can be gatherings rather than battles.Tom Cox’s third novel fashions an escape from the dangerous outside world into something soft, comforting and unfashionable. It might once have been a Neanderthal’s armpit, but now it’s more likely to be a cosy cardigan. Or a deeply comforting story.This shambling but intricate yarn of friendship, loyalty, alienation and record collecting features a depressed nature writer called Billy Stackpole, who bears a parodic resemblance to such woodcut-on-the-cover authors asRobert Macfarlaneand Tom Cox. His debut was called Will the Stone Circle Be Unbroken: A Journey Around Britain Through Deep Time. Billy is sitting around his hand-forged firebowl when he utters the woeful/hopeful plea: “This sounds weird but I’ve never had a big sloppy cardigan and I wish I did … Just something you can throw on, at a time like this. Maybe in a nice earthy green, a bit mossy.”Within earshot is a magical sea creature capable of passing for a dog, but also of hoovering, gardening and reading Barbara Kingsolver novelsAs far as Billy knows, he’s speaking to a group of eight human beings. However, also listening in, incognito, is the novel’s cosiest and most unusual character. How you react now is probably a good indication of whether you’ll like Cox’s affable, quirk-heavy brand of literary knitwear. Because also within earshot of Billy is a long-nosed, sleek-haired magical sea creature with 24 fingers who is capable of passing for a large brown dog, but also of hoovering, gardening, reading Barbara Kingsolver novels, speaking six languages, giving wise life advice, and most excellent knitting. Meet Carl – who, because he’s nice, will secretly knit Billy a cardigan.Carl is one half of a charming odd couple along with Liverpudlian record dealer Eric. Eric and Carl live peripatetically, though they’ve ended up in rural Dorset; and everywhere they go, and whatever mild scrapes they get into, they meet furiously nice people. Everything Will Swallow You is the story of Eric’s life, without and then with his supernatural companion. But it’s also a materially hopeful “state of England” novel. Our social fabric may be fraying, but we’re still warm and woolly, most of the time.Eric’s vocation is nicely chosen. Over the years, his personal fortunes follow those of the long-playing record, and we see it become an index for values of decency and kindness. When vinyl is prized, not just priced, things look up in society. The cynical mid-1990s were a low point, but with gen Z’s fond infatuation with analogue, things have been getting better.One way of reading Cox’s work, from his Stackpolish nature writing in21st Century Yokelto his recent novels,Villagerand 1983, is as a counter to cartoonish Brexitshire views of the countryside. Look beyond the M25, and there’s folklore, nature, history, yes, but most important of all there are nice people; even if increasingly they spend most of their time looking at phone screens and getting angry with one another. His country, he insists, can still be a loving and lovable place.Like vinyl records, England may go through periods of neglect, but as a nation, as afolk-nature-history-haunted land, there’s still something warm and ultimately dependable about us. As Eric writes in his notebook, and his words equally apply to comfy-cardigan fiction such as Everything Will Swallow You: “Records never did a lot of what I thought they’d do for me. They didn’t make me cooler or more handsome or help me solve the secret of the universe. But they helped get me through some hard times and taught me that magic is real.”Everything Will Swallow You by Tom Cox is published by Swift (£16.99).

From Street Fighter’s “hadouken!” to Call of Duty’s “remember, no Russian” to BioShock’s “would you kindly?”, there are phrases so creepy, clever or cool they have slipped imperceptibly into the gaming lexicon, ensuring that whenever they’re memed on social media, almost everyone gets the reference.But there are also odd little phrases, sometimes from obscure games, that stick with us for seemingly no reason. I recall most of the vocal barks from the second world war strategy game Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, even though I haven’t played it for 20 years. Why is it that I’ll lose my headphones, wallet and phone on a daily basis, but I have absolute recall when it comes to the utterances of burly soldier Samuel Brooklyn? Why am I doomed to “Finally, some action”, “Consider it done, boss” and the immortal “okey dokey” echoing through my head? What is wrong with me?Fortunately, when Iposted about this on Bluesky, I discovered I was not alone. Hundreds of gamers got back to me about the random game dialogue lodged in their own heads. Some were lesser-known quotes from famous titles: comic book writer Kieron Gillen is haunted by the line “I’ve not seen such bravery” from Gauntlet, while video game academic Kat Brewster wrote that she thinks about the game’s “ah, sustenance!” line all the time. Matthew Castle, of the gaming podcastThe Back Page, simply cannot forget the way Beedlesays thank youin The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Game designer and artist Anna Hollinrake cannot escape the voice of the random Pokémon trainer who said: “Whether hot to trot or cool cat not, chill at my papa’s shop.” “It runs around in my head again and again,” she said. “Drives me mad.”Some games came up again and again. Worms, Grand Theft Auto, House of the Dead and Monkey Island seem to be filled with memorable lines, sometimes because they’re funny, but often because they’re simply ludicrous. One fan of Bungie’s shooter Marathon has been unable to forget the phrase “Frog blast the vent core!”, only later discoveringits strange origin. Many players had adopted these lines of dialogue into their every day lives – several respondents admitted to thinking “wizard needs food badly” whenever they open the fridge door.View image in fullscreenIn my head … Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.Photograph: Pyro StudiosSo why have so many obscure lines remained in our brains all these years? Partly it’s about sheer repetition: in a 20-hour action-adventure game filled with non-player characters, you’re going to hear the same “barks” (quick pieces of NPC dialogue that express surprise or provide contextual information) over and over again. This is why so many people recall everything the merchant says in Resident Evil 4 – by the end of the game, you’ve heard “What’re ya buyin’?” several hundred times. There is also an element of echolalia, the repetition of certain comforting words and sounds as an act of self-soothing.Gamesare built around rhythm and repetition, so it is perhaps natural for us to adopt elements of these patterns into our lives.Game dialogue can also become an in-joke with friends, enforcing bonds and shared interests and memories in the same way as quoting pieces of movie dialogue. Bluesky user Steve O’Gorman wrote this about F-Zero GX: “Samurai Goroh’s line delivery of ‘You stole the prize money from us last time’ while flailing his arms has randomly stuck with my friendship group for 20+ years.” With video games, our own subjective experiences in the worlds can often be as memorable and valuable as the intended narratives. Sometimes, the idea that we could be the only player to have encountered an obscure character, or heard a specific snatch of dialogue, creates a connection with the game that becomes personal.I don’t think I have a deep connection with tough Samuel Brooklyn, despite the number of times I sent him to his death while he yelled the immortal words: “No problem, man.” But clearly, I was going through something when I was playing that game, or I was just amused by the disparity between the seriousness of the fight against the Nazis and the daft, repetitive phrases that accompanied my every mouse click. We never really know what makes a moment of our life memorable, or why a line from an old episode of Gilmore Girls, Twin Peaks or Scarface sticks around in our subconscious. But it’s nice to know we’re not alone with our weird little aural collections.What to playView image in fullscreenScoundrel’s tale … Star Wars Outlaws.Photograph: UbisoftUnfairly maligned on its original release and now available in a lush Nintendo Switch 2 conversion,Star Wars Outlawsis one of my favourite ever Star Wars games. Choosing to eschew all the mysticism and vainglorious posturing of Jedi lore in favour of a scoundrel-turned-resistance hero story, it’s an exciting romp across familiar planets, against familiar Imperial bad guys.The design of the worlds and the various bases and spacecraft you explore is incredible, capturing the slightly battered futurism of those early Ralph McQuarrie concept sketches, and the dialogue is often genuinely funny. Lead character Kay Vess is a nobody in the Star Wars canon, but that’s the whole point, and the relationships she forges on her quest to pull off the ultimate heist against the Empire reflect the themes and ideals of the original movie. For such a big story, the Switch 2 screen makes a wonderful venue, allowing you to carry a whole galaxy with you wherever you go.Available on:PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxEstimated playtime:25+ hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenBugged out … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryEurogamer haskicked off a series of featuresabout contentious topics in video game design, and the first looks at the subject ofboss runbacks– ie the length of space and gameplay between a checkpoint and a boss battle. Silksong has been challenging (frustrating?) gamers with its lengthy, often difficult runbacks, which can seem like a sadistic insult after you’ve failed a boss fight for the 56th time. But are they, in fact, a legitimate part of the rhythm of games? In my opinion, they are theworst, but don’t get me started.I didn’t think I’d ever link to the United Nations on this newsletter, but the organisation hasjust featured a pieceabout video games anddemocracyon its website to mark the International Day of Democracy (15 September). The piece looks at the history of persuasive games and advergames made by charities to highlight campaigns and asks if games have a role in informing players about democratic rights and participation.The wonderful retro gaming zineForgotten Worldsis back witha new issue, this time dedicated to Sega, or more specifically the company’s “blue skies” period of the late 80s and early 90s when its arcade and home console games invariably took place in super-bright, sunshine-lit worlds.

So, for a long time, Whitemore and Jacobi’s portrayal of Turing formed his public image, which was inevitably tragic, given that he remained a convicted criminal for loving men and his theories had not yet been fully realised.View image in fullscreenJoe Usher, behind, and Mark Edel-Hunt in Breaking the Code.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBut Turing is now officially pardoned and features on aBritish banknotein a world that owes much to him for the evolutions in digital technology and now AI (in which Turing saw both the gains and dangers). So Jesse Jones’ smart revival offers a more redemptive portrait of a true genius who lived in an age that proved fatal to him.Starting in a Northampton theatre 23 miles from Bletchley Park, where Turing saved British shipping by cracking German naval codes, this touring production will end in Manchester, where he died. It adds a new epilogue by Neil Bartlett, set in the present day at Sherborne School, Turing’s alma mater. The punchy, touching speech follows Ian McEwan’s 2019 novelMachines Like Mein finding a way to give Turing some degree of posthumous triumph over his destruction.Most important to this Turing 2.0, though, is a superb performance by Mark Edel-Hunt. It is tempting to play Turing as if he always knew he was in a tragedy but, shown extracts out of context, an audience might think this were a comedy. Edel-Hunt also delivers long speeches of mathematical and computing exposition with immaculate clarity, exuberantly suggesting the humour and sensuality that Turing found in numbers and nature, his body and tongue tangibly loosening when his great brain engages.Acting of matching quality comes from Peter Hamilton Dyer as Dillwyn Knox, the cryptographer who recruited Turing to Bletchley; the men’s enthralling dialogues about reality and pretence are, as often in Whitemore’s writing, only fully understood in retrospect through later data. Carla Harrison-Hodge as Pat Green, a Bletchley colleague on whom Turing’s mother hopes he is sweet, radiates braininess and the pain caused to her by the play’s sub-theme of humans being harder to read than machines. Joe Usher, as two of Turing’s love interests, is especially impressive in a brilliant scene in Greece where a language barrier allows Turing to spill his secrets without truly doing so. Joseph Edwards does a nice double as a Sherborne student in the 1920s and 2020s.

Its effects are cumulative. The Histories charts the 69-year-old painter’s intellectual as well as practical development, his themes, his switches of media and of focus and attention. Everything is here for a reason.How engaging Marshall’s art is, from the first. He takes us from the bar to the bedroom, to the Middle Passage, from the studio to the academy, from the beauty parlour to the dancehall. He paints scenes of kidnappings and of enslavement in Africa and of a black cop sitting on the hood of his squad car – I love the jagged stylised flare of the streetlights in the background. Marshall knows that everything is contended and complex and that there are no innocent images. Pustules of paint, like litter between the blocks, decorate the spaces between the housing projects, like flowers blooming in a riot. On an idyllic day in the park, black folks picnic, practise a golf swing, play croquet, water-ski on the lake and listen to the Temptations, the lyrics floating up like ticker tape from radios on a sunny afternoon. It is an absurd, impossible image. The humour in Marshall’s art is not to be underestimated. In a series devoted to the Middle Passage a Baptist flounders. There are water slides and swimming pools, ocean liners and toy boats and a woman about to dive from a board. The water is filled with drowned maps of Africa and carefully rendered fish, and there’s an exhortation to plunge.View image in fullscreenDetails constantly arrest … Kerry James Marshall, Knowledge and Wonder, 1995.Photograph: Patrick L Pyszka/© Kerry James MarshallThe key early work here, and one that led to several variations, is Marshall’s 1980 egg tempera on paper A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self. The title alludes to James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and the slanting hat, tipped back on the subject’s head, may also echo Wyndham Lewis’s Tyro, from 1921. Gap-toothed and wide-eyed, a black face grins wildly. Dressed in black and wearing a black fedora, he looms from a black background. Only the white triangle of shirt at his collar, those eyes and that smile, punctuate the dark. This small work on paper is cartoonish, but also reserved and confrontational, bounded by a white mat in a black frame. He repainted it as an image-within-an-image, hung on a red wall above an old-fashioned upright vacuum cleaner, and called it Portrait of the Artist and a Vacuum. Where does the artist belong? Where’s their milieu, their audience, their culture? Studying at Otis in California, where painting seemed to be definitively over, there was little if any acknowledgment of the artist’s blackness, or of the importance of art to a wider, let alone a wider black, audience. But Marshall was showing that even an old-fashioned egg tempera portrait was as conceptual as anything else. It is an essay in blackness, and also alludes to Ralph Ellison’s 1947 novel Invisible Man. These paintings were both an end point and the beginning of a career in which he has become the pre-eminent painter of black American life.BlackPainting(2003) depicts a bedroom at night, the details only becoming apparent as your eyes adjust to the close-toned gloom. The painting is not black, but filled with tiny shifts in the darkness. Adjustments. There are bulks in there, shifts, bodies troubled in sleep. The viewer’s eye roams the gloom, an interloper, hovering by the pillow, noting the copy of Angela Davis’s If They Come in the Morning. What and who do the sleepers dread? It is a painting that waits and waits, a singularity amid an overwhelming multiplicity of signs, of innumerable crisp and telling details. Marshall’s art rewards attention, to its larger social and political themes, its momentous occasions and to its smaller stories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And don’t forget the shoes: so many closely observed sneakers, mules, sandals, slip-ons, pumps and high heels. Even at his loosest, Marshall insists on the particular. There’s no end to the invention or the details that constantly arrest you.There are near monochromes and sly plays on abstract expressionism, couplings in the park, an Afrofuturist family evening on an interstellar spaceship and a woman with amazing hair happily nursing a drink in a bar. A guy sweeps the stage in a cavernous hall, where a woman stands in effortless emulation of the sad-eyed girl at the counter inManet’s 1882 Bar at the Folies-Bergère. Marshall’s figure clutches her bag and waits, but for what or who we do not know. Like Manet’s barmaid, she’s a witness to her time.A naked guy, dressed only in a jock strap, poses as though for a life class, one arm raised in a Black power salute. On a worktable nearby rests a woman’s handbag and a small doll, apparently ankisi nkondifigure from the Kongo people of central Africa. Already there’s too much to resolve. And what of the knotted rope, rendered in glitter, dropping from above, or the big abstract canvases shunted to the edge of the painting, beyond the white and red and patterned drapes? And we haven’t yet mentioned the model’s blackness, his near impenetrable silhouette, the barely discernible lineaments of his body and face, his big hair, his unknowable expression. You could almost pick up the yellow glass on the table, the bag or the bunch of keys, but the model is somehow out of reach.View image in fullscreenUnknowable expression … Kerry James Marshall, The Academy, 2012.Photograph: courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York/© Kerry James Marshall.And so it goes, from painting to painting, from the studied portraits to the figures in motion, the naked guy lying on the bed, holding the red, black and green Pan-African flag over his genitals (my eyes snag on his patterned socks); the elderly ladies in their parlours, golden-winged like angels at an annunciation, with appliqué “we mourn our loss” tasselled hangings commemorating Martin Luther King, JFK and Bobby Kennedy. Little black kids and teenagers look at art in the museum, and two female black artists, their brushes hovering over palettes heavy with moiled and drooling piles of pigments, look as though they’re threatening to paint us.Many of the larger paintings are unstretched, fixed to the wall with grommets – like the paintings of Leon Golub, one of many ghosts at the feast of Marshall’s art, which is full of licks and nods to other artists. But it is the specifics that finally grab you. Seagulls catch the light on their wings, floating over the small boats drawn up on the shore, awaiting their human cargo destined for the Americas. Marshall’s paintings are filled with the imagined, the feared, the remembered, the repressed and the invented. They’re woven through with black history and culture, with aspiration and loss, a distant past that won’t go away and an entangled present. Everything is always impending. By turns ragged and precise, offhand and offbeat and concise, Marshall’s art is as necessary as it is unmissable.At the Royal Academy, London, 20 September to 18 January 2026Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As Katie Lias’s set design makes clear, these are precarious lives, regularly packed up and moved from one military base to the next. The promise of theMilitary Wives Choirs– originated up the road from York Theatre Royal at Catterick Garrison and the subject of aBBC documentaryand subsequent film from which this show takes inspiration – is that they offer connection in a rootless existence.View image in fullscreenLife-and-death stakes faced by their partners … Military Wives at York Theatre Royal.Photograph: Danny With A CameraWhile based on the true story and hitting some of the same plot beats asPeter Cattaneo’s 2019 film, Isitt’s version has its own cast of fictional characters. The show quickly introduces us to a disparate group of women who are brought together when upbeat outsider Olive arrives to form a singing group for the wives while their partners are on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Though it sacrifices the emotional heft of the movie’s central partnership, this take on the material adopts a fittingly ensemble approach, illustrating the power of community at the story’s heart.Isitt’s storytelling is propulsive and pacy, if somewhat reliant on contrivance and soapy tropes. Each of the women in the choir has her own emotionally loaded subplot – a baby on the way, a round of IVF, a struggling marriage – most of which are quickly and easily resolved (usually with a tear-jerking ballad thrown in). The more striking and moving moments arrive when frontline conflict explodes into the choir’s rehearsal room, theatrically juxtaposing the two worlds these women straddle and reminding us of the life-and-death stakes faced by their partners.The show is transparent in its pressing of emotional buttons, engineering moments of high drama that just as rapidly melt away again, while its comic rhythms start to become predictable. But what comes across most convincingly is the sheer joy found in singing together. Performing a score of familiar pop, rock and Motown hits, the excellent cast bring an infectious energy to this material, lifting the sometimes cliched script and connecting with a story that has deep local resonances.AtYork Theatre Royaluntil 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsMilitaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rage! Blow!”King Lear, Act III, Scene 2A fierce wind and strong swell had turned the Atlantic into a rollercoaster and when the troupe made landfall on the Isles of Scilly, several members felt rather wobbly and looked a little green around the gills.The life of a touring actor is not always glitz and glamour, but the first visit ofthe Royal Shakespeare Company(RSC) to Scilly – to perform King Lear – got off to a particularly rocky start.View image in fullscreenOliver Senton and the touring team reach dry land at last after taking the ferry to St Mary’s.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“It was a rough crossing,” saidOliver Senton, who plays Lear, as the 15-strong cast and crew recovered onthe harboursideofSt Mary’s, the largest of the islands, 30 miles off the south-west coast of mainland Britain. “We’re more used to being in a van or train when we’re going place to place. But it’s wonderful to be here, breaking territory, bringing theatre to new places.”Might he tap into this stormy weatherfor the famous scene in which Lear rages against the storm?“Well, I’d say the storm for Lear is inside him – the weather is a reflection of his feelings,” Senton said. “But when you do a great play like this, you start to see echoes of it everywhere – in things you’re watching and reading and what people say to you, even in the rain and wind.”The show isa pared-down version of King Lear– about a third of the full-length – mainly aimed at young people and their families. Backed by a grant fromArts Council England,the idea is to take the play to audiences who may not usually have access to world-class Shakespearean actors.View image in fullscreenThe visiting theatre production was staged in the Five Islands Academy’s hall.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianBefore the tour, the director,Justine Themen, travelled around England, asking young people from Blackpool to Norwich what was on their minds. “They said they were concerned political leaders weren’t listening, especially around the climate crisis, and they were concerned with relationships with leaders in their own lives – parents and teachers,” said Themen. “All issues of justice, really.”Lear seemed the best play to dig into such themes. Themen said there were “Lear-like” leaders in the world acting in an autocratic way and not engaging with the needs and wants of their modern kingdoms.View image in fullscreenSenton with Vigs Otite, who plays Regan, the king’s middle child.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianLear’s storm seemed a good way to think about the climate crisis, and the youngsters were drawn to the idea of the king asking his daughters to spell out how much they loved him. “They were fascinated by that,” Themen said.The storm meant the visit to Scilly was delayed by a day and once they were there the logistical challenges were many, including getting the troupe to and from their various B&Bs scattered throughout the island.There was an anxious wait as their props were unloaded from the ferry and transported to the Five Islands Academy, where the RSC players were putting on four shows in the school hall. But everything fell into place and the first show, watched mostly by adult islanders (though some children also attended), was warmly received.View image in fullscreenThe RSC is staging King Lear four times in the St Mary’s school hall.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn this reimagining, the tragic ending is softened when the king’s Fool tells the audience to challenge leaders if they do not approve of what they are doing. Asked to shout out what they could do to make things better, Hattie, 11, called: “Work as a team.” Later she said she had liked the play, though found the blinding of Gloucester scary.Jeremy Brown, the creative director forCulture on Scilly,was emotional at the final curtain. “To bring this quality of work to this little corner of the world is unreal and, I think, life changing for all of us,” he said.Rachel Lewin, the headteacher of Five Islands Academy, agreed. “It was so powerful,” she said. “There’s nothing like live Shakespeare. You can study it, as we do, and watch the films, but there’s nothing like being in the room with the raw emotion.”The production is also being taken to schools and community venues on the Isle of Wight and to cities including Southampton and Peterborough. RSC creative assistants also go into schools to work with pupils on the play.View image in fullscreenMichelle Moran, as Gloucester, interacts with the audience.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianJacqui O’Hanlon, the RSC’s director of creative learning and engagement, said access to arts in schools was at a crossroads after years of erosion – but culture was all the more vital as a way of people understanding one another better. “We need a society able to disagree agreeably.”After the performance, Nkhanise Phiri, who played the Fool, was beaming. She had begun the day clinging to the arms of her seat on the Scilly ferry as it lurched, trying to pretend it was a fun rollercoaster. But it had been worth it.“It’s really important to bring Shakespeare to areas like this and make it accessible. It feels different being on an island. You’re aware of the water, the rain, nature. You have to adjust to each space, each audience. It’s a challenge – but good.”Explore more on these topicsWilliam ShakespeareKing LearRoyal Shakespeare CompanyTheatreEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At that time he was establishing Sundance and distancing himself from Hollywood. He was a dolphin among sharks. He was the most kind and wise person one could ever know in this life.Lex,Joshua Tree, CA‘His impact on film-making in New Mexico will have a lasting impact’Robert Redford generously supported the Milagro at Los Luceros project in New Mexico. His generosity and vision helped underrepresented Native American, Hispanic and female writers to create screenplays, books and films under the guidance of writer and director Joan Tewkesbury. His impact on film-making and the environment in New Mexico will have a lasting impact.Jean, New Mexico‘At my PhD graduation, my mum was more excited about being in the same room as Bob’Robert Redford was an honorary graduate at my PhD graduation at Trinity College Dublin in 2008. Despite my four years of hard graft and being the first member of my family to achieve the title “Dr”, my mum was far more excited about being in the same room as her heart-throb, “Bob”. I was a little put out by his presence outshining my special moment until I got called up and was greeted with a wink and a smile from Dr Redford. Yes, I went a bit weak at the knees. But don’t tell my mum I said that.Catriona, 45, university professor, Helston, Cornwall‘Every inch the movie star’In 1978, producer Richard Drewett and I made a film [calledThe Outlaw Trail] with Robert Redford. He was a week late arriving for the shoot, sweeping up the road to his home above Sundance, sun-tanned in blue denim, driving a silver Porscheconvertible – every inch the movie star. His excuse for the wait? “I had the chance to spend some time with my son James.”Alan Ravenscroft, 78, retired documentary-maker‘The waiter told him The Great Escape was his favourite movie’In the 2000s, Robert Redford had dinner with his partner at the Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat in the south of France at the table next to ours. At some point the waiter bent down and told him that The Great Escape was his favourite movie. Robert took it with good grace, thanked the waiter, took a sip of his vodka martini and had a good giggle once the waiter had departed.Susanne, 54, former financial trader, London‘I helped him to an auditorium seat to watch his son graduate’Robert Redford was ‘a principled force for good’, says All the President’s Men reporter Bob WoodwardRead moreMr Redford’s son was a year ahead of me in high school and I served as a junior usher at his class’s graduation. I got to lead Mr Redford and his wife to seats in the auditorium. It was a brief, polite, non-substantive interaction, but it amused me that, after all the movie-house seats to which I had made my way to watch his films, I was helping him find an auditorium seat to watch his son graduate.Robert, 62, lawyer, New York City‘Paul Newman recommended he go to the National Film Theatre’The most memorable event was Robert Redford’s appearance at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London in the 1970s [now the BFI]. I asked him why he had come: “Because,” Redford said, “I called Paul Newman [the actor and co-star in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid] and asked him what to do in London.” “You’ve got to go to the NFT,” said Newman, “they will treat you right and they know how to do it.”Deac, London‘He set up an expectation that I had a lot to look forward to in the navy’View image in fullscreen‘No one ever looked that good in uniform’: Robert Redford in The Way We Were.Photograph: Channel 5I was a senior in college and already in the navy when I saw Robert Redford in The Way We Were. He was dazzlingly handsome in his navy uniform, it took my breath away. He immediately set up an expectation that I had a lot to look forward to in the navy! No one in my whole career ever looked as good in that uniform as he did.Patty, 73, retired navy nurse, Annapolis, MA‘He influenced a whole generation of skiers’He influenced a whole generation of skiers to embrace the sport, to try amateur racing, to leave the East Coast to spend time in the magnificent mountains of the west and to believe that those vistas and wild places deserve our protection. Bravo Downhill Racer.Mary,Pen Argyl, PA‘Did you know he is the narrator at the planetarium in Kolkata, India?’Did you know that the voice of the narrator at the planetarium in Kolkata, India, is Robert Redford’s? I took my kids there and came out of it feeling refreshed and hopeful. He made you believe that it might all turn out well, not by obscuring the truth but with his deeds and presence.Shreya Sen-Handley, author, NottinghamView image in fullscreenRobert Redford in The Natural (1984).Photograph: Tristar/Sportsphoto/Allstar‘He personified what a dignified man is’I first saw Robert Redford in The Natural. He was a beautiful man and I don’t think anyone can compare to him, both on and off screen. He personified what a dignified man is, trying his best to make a better world. I could spend weeks just watching Redford in his movies and learn what it is to try and live a good life – as he tried in his own life.Khalid, Dubai‘He apologised and laughed self-deprecatingly’In early 2000 after working in a major art gallery in London for a few months, those of us on the frontline were pretty jaded when it came to celebrities. Then one evening, just before closing, a ripple went along the line of desks as a man walked past. People burst into fits of nervous giggles, their cheeks flushed. The man asked to buy a ticket to the special exhibition and it fell to my poor boss to tell him the museum was closing. The man apologised, laughed self-deprecatingly and headed for the exit. Even that short exchange demonstrated what a lovely, self-effacing man Robert Redford was. They don’t make them like that any more.Clare, 55, unemployed, Kendal, Cumbria‘Ordinary in his extraordinariness’The guy was a star. He came from an era when the term carried a sense of mystery, excitement and awe that has long since disappeared from our world. Redford had magic. Ordinary in his extraordinariness.Many know him from Sundance, Barefoot, The Sting etc. But I would recommend seeking out some of his lesser-known works. There’sThe Candidate, where he plays a charming political wannabe who is desperate for high office and then unsure what to do when he gets there. Or Three Days of the Condor where he plays an everyman trying to navigate a world where government conspiracy and paranoia run rife.Add to this his concern for the environment, for decency, for humanity and for film through Sundance. And now he’s gone. Looking at the state of the world, perhaps it’s for the best. He seems almost too good for this place.John Socha, 55, English and film studies teacher, Gdansk, PolandExplore more on these topicsRobert RedfordSundance film festivalNew MexicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

I still have it’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 17 Sep 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 13.25 EDTShareIdrove a cab inNew Yorkfor three decades. Riding around, I would meet poets, drag queens and other people who were inspiring. It made me feel good. I started taking their portraits, sometimes with me in the picture. I had several cameras and would often have my strobe hooked on to my visor with a rubber band.This particular evening, in 1990, I had been informed by a friend that there was a book event going on so I went to take a look. It was jam-packed inside. I spotted Allen Ginsberg, so I went over and talked to him a little. He was pretty intense, kind of stressed, so I had to lay back a little but I asked him if he could write an introduction to my book In My Taxi. But he had too much going on.I went out, got in my cab and started driving off, but then I thought: “Hey, I think I’ll cruise back.” People were coming out of the building and I spotted Allen. I guess he recognised me. I was a pain in the ass to him, probably. Anyway he came over and got into my cab – a great, real, joyful moment.I photographed him alone too, but the idea was for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that pictureI stopped at the Bowery to let him out and he was looking at the meter where I have this tape coming out of it, for receipts. He said: “Hand me that tape.” So I tore it off and handed it to him. He’s looking down. I don’t know what he’s doing, but I’m not gonna rush him. A little more time with Allen. Turns out he was writing this poem about me, which I still have.I don’t call myself an artist, I leave that up to the audience. I went to college in southern California, and then Berkeley, for graduate work, and I was doing lithographs and photography. I got to New York in 1980. The rent was unaffordable but nothing was going to deter me from going to the city. I saw some crazy places – one guy was showering in the kitchen sink – but finally I found an ad in the New York Times for a place for $250 a month. I went to see it and was met by this real jovial, heavy-set man. The floor was dirt and it was 250 sq ft. Oh my God, I’d never seen anything like that in my life – but it was manifest destiny, because my dark room fitted into its east corner and right up to the window, so I had fresh air whenever I opened it.Another manifest destiny was that I had a neighbour who drove a cab. When he would hear me opening the door, he’d open his and we’d have a friendly conversation. One day, he says to me: “Do you want to go out with me tonight in the cab?” I said: “Oh my God, yeah, yeah.” So I went out and the rest is history, man. I applied for a hack license.My taxi portraits started with a Latino guy wearing a black kind of derby hat. He had a nice presence about him. I looked at him and said hey. I was nervous. This was my first time I’d taken my camera and equipment with me and he let me photograph him. That was the beginning and it just went crazy, man. I was constantly bombarded with opportunities. I would pick up a fare or maybe something was happening and I’d notice it and take a shot or two, then I’m gone. Or I would drop someone off and there would be something there, some sort of a billboard, a picture of a lady or whatever and the composition all came together. Sometimes, if my equipment wasn’t working properly, I would give the strobe to the passengers and say: “Hey, when you hear the click of my camera, hit the strobe.” So we’d have a dual thing going on.When I had Ginsberg in my cab, I photographed him alone too, but the idea was mainly for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that picture, put my feelings there. I called it Allen Ginsberg, offering me up a fortune cookie.Ryan Weideman’s work is atParis Photo, 13-16 November, with the Bruce Silverstein gallery.Ryan Weideman’s CVBorn:Oklahoma, 1941Trained:California College of Arts & CraftsInfluences:“William Klein and Ansel Adams.”High point:“Getting my first review – a really fantastic one – in the New York Times.”Low point:“I don’t know how to answer this.

His many iconic performances – in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Way We Were, The Sting and more – certainly left an indelible mark on American movies. But he should perhaps be remembered more for his work behind the camera, as the country’s greatest benefactor of independent cinema.Robert Redford: the incandescently handsome star who changed Hollywood foreverRead moreThrough his Sundance film festival and non-profit institute, Redford lent his considerable star power and funds to American independent film, and created what is still its most secure and enduring pillar of support. He provided maverick, cutting-edge film-making with a freewheeling marketplace and crucial buzz, helping to launch the careers of a true who’s who of critically acclaimed directors across generations. With Sundance, Redford played the role of mentor, patron, champion of the small and scrappy, benevolent godfather of independent cinema. It’s through Sundance, rather than his films, that Redford became, as the Black List founder Franklin Leonardput iton X, “arguably the film industry’s most consequential American over the last fifty years”.Redford founded the Sundance Institute, named after his character in the 1969 film, in 1981, as a means to support risk-taking voices outside the Hollywood studio system. The mission was loose, but grounded in the then 44-year-old actor’s real frustration with the movie business. “We started this with no rigid expectations,” Redford told the critic Roger Ebert at an early iteration of the film festival in 1981. “I have no idea what this will turn out to be. I know that it’s getting increasingly hard to get a movie well distributed in this country unless it has the potential to make millions of dollars.” As an alternative experiment, Redford invited 10 screenwriters to develop their low-budget scripts at a cabin in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, where the reclusive star had purchased land and made his home.View image in fullscreenReservoir Dogs.Photograph: Rank/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe tiny Sundance Institute grew into a small festival after Redford purchased the struggling Utah/US film festival in 1984. By 1989, when Steven Soderbergh’s Sex, Lies and Videotape premiered at what had become an annual January gathering in Park City, theSundance film festival(as it was renamed in 1991) represented the creative vanguard. Some of the most influential and enduring films of the 1990s came out of the festival – Reservoir Dogs, Before Sunrise and The Blair Witch Project, as well as the documentaries Hoop Dreams and Paris Is Burning.The festival has built a reputation as a pipeline of diverse talent; top directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Richard Linklater, Chloé Zhao, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, Nicole Holofcener, David O Russell, Darren Aronofsky, the Daniels and Celine Song have all been nurtured at some point in their early career by Sundance. In 2022, Coda, directed by Sian Heder with a $10m budget, became the first festival premiere to win the best picture Oscar. “Coda came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,” its star Marlee Matlin posted on X. “And Sundance happened because ofRobert Redford.”Alongside its renegade narrative features, the festival has also become the go-to destination for hot-button documentaries, particularly those grappling with tough, timely subjects. Thedocumentary streaming boomarguably began at the festival in 2017, when Netflix purchased Icarus, a film on the Russian doping scandal that went on to win the Oscar – Netflix’s first – for a then staggering sum of $5m. For several years after, the festival was a hot marketplace for documentaries large and small. Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Brooke Shields and Michael J Fox debuted films about them in Utah; documentaries on such figures as Christopher Reeves, the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Hillary Clinton generated international headlines and commanded ever-larger sums. Though the market hascooled, the festival remains an incubator for pressing documentaries – this year saw films on Florida’s stand-your-ground laws, abysmal Alabama prisons and US book bans in schools – as well as awards. Institute-supported documentaries havewon a total of 20 Oscars; all but one of last year’s best documentary nominees premiered at the festival.With mainstream acclaim come major celebrities, and with celebrities come crowds, sponsors and influencers. Starting in the 2010s, the festival has been as synonymous with celebrities in trendy winter wear, long lines and pop-up brand houses as independent film. After years of logistical issues – what once drew a few hundred cinephiles to the mountains now courts upwards of 85,000 visitors every January – the festival announced earlier this year that it would relocate in 2027 to Boulder, Colorado.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford at the 2003 Sundance film festival.Photograph: Douglas C Pizac/APBut the institute has remained true to Redford’s founding mission. According to Sundance, more than 11,000 early career artists have received support since its founding, in the form of grants, labs, intensive programs, mentorship and fellowships. I personally know film-makers and writers who have applied to the lab, considered the pinnacle of early-stage mentorship, an imprimatur of taste and trust. And since the establishment of its Native American and Indigenous program in 1994, the non-profit remains one of the pre-eminent supporters of Indigenous film talenttoo-long ignored by institutional Hollywood. The program’s grants, labs and community have helped launch the careers of Chris Eyre (whose film Smoke Signals premiered in 1998), Reservation Dogs’ Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi.In his later years, Redford often groused about the mainstreaming of the festival to which he devoted nearly half his life; “I want the ambush marketers – the vodka brands and the gift-bag people and the Paris Hiltons – to go away forever,” he told a reporter during the 2012 festival. It is true that the festival is not the iconoclastic upstart it once was, and that the festival produces a few imitative “Sundance movies” – spare, underwritten dramas with beautiful vistas and natural light – every year. But the impact of Sundance – in time, in space, in mentorship, money and community – is incalculable to the landscape of American cinema. Redford’s goal, as he said in his 2002 honorary Oscar speech, was to “make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive”. With 40 years of stewardship at Sundance, Robert Redford has done more than most to ensure that it will.Explore more on these topicsRobert RedfordSundance film festivalFestivalscommentShareReuse this content"

But can you look cool – or even just socially acceptable – while wearing them?Lucy KnightWed 17 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 05.01 EDTShareThere was a time when adults who owned collections of stuffed toys were relatively uncommon, weird even. All that has changed recently: the rise in popularity of toys such asSquishmallowsandJellycat Amuseableshas been linked to the growing “kidult” market (adults buying toys for themselves) whichaccounted for almost 30% of toy saleslast year. On the whole, cuddly toys are something people keep at home, on their beds or on display shelves. But that’s changing too – plush toy keyrings such as Labubus are now everywhere. And some “Disney adults” (self-professed grown up Disney fans who might, for example, go to the theme parks without taking children with them) have gone one step further: attaching toys not just to their bags, but to themselves.“Shoulder pals” (variously known as “shoulder plushies”, “shoulder toys” and “shoulder sitters”) are small toys made in the likeness of Disney characters. They have magnetic bases and come with a flat metal plate designed to be placed under your shirt, so the toy perches on your shoulder. Since the first one, baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, was brought out in 2018, these toys have become a common accessory at the Disney theme parks. There are multiple Reddit threads and TikTok videos about how to track down the latest ones (some are sold at the Disney store, but others are only available at specific locations within the parks). There will apparently be 45 official Disney shoulder pals on offer by the end of next year, with characters ranging from Peter Pan’s Tinker Bell to Anxiety from Inside Out 2. That’s not to mention the many, many knockoffs available online, as well as those sold byPrimark, or theDIY palsthat some creative TikTok users have been making.What is it about these toys that makes them so appealing? And what’s it like to actually wear them? As a plush toy novice – the only one I own is my beloved childhood teddy bear, Freddie, who was banished to a box under the bed with the Christmas decorations some time ago – I ordered two from the Disney store: Stitch from Lilo & Stitch, and the Raven from Haunted Mansion, plus three that I tracked down on eBay: the Cheshire cat from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Pascal (Rapunzel’s lizard friend in Tangled) and Ratatouille’s Remy, the most popular shoulder pal to date. I spent more than £100 in total: the Disney store price was £21 per toy, and though I managed to get Remy secondhand for slightly less, the Cheshire cat, which is one of the newer releases, cost me just over £30. Being a Disney adult, it turns out, is not cheap.View image in fullscreenOut and about in King’s Cross, London, with Remy from Ratatouille.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay oneStitch and the Raven are the first to arrive, and are cuter and softer than I was expecting. Though it feels ridiculous to “wear” a toy, there is something very pleasing about the way that Stitch in particular sits flat on my shoulder – the Raven is trickier to balance, being weighed down by an internal battery that produces a cawing sound and makes its eyes light up. There is no off switch – to the delight, I’m sure, of anyone who has bought this toy for a child – but the sound effects do stop after a cycle of three caws is complete, if it is left completely still. I set it on the window ledge where it somewhat creepily watches over me – but does at least shut up. Stitch, meanwhile, perches happily on the shoulder of my wife – Lilo and Stitch was a childhood favourite of hers, and she is instantly taken with him (though not, she stresses, enough to leave the house with him on).Day twoView image in fullscreenShopping with Stitch.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy KnightHaving acclimatised to my new soft toy friends in the safety of my home, it is time to take them out and about. First stop: the food shop. Nobody bats an eyelid as I walk to my local Asda – has nobody noticed I have a bright blue alien attached to me? My first interaction is with the shop security guard, whose face splits into a massive grin as soon as he sees me. “How do you have Stitch on you?” he asks. I explain about the magnet. “So cool!” he responds. I get another compliment as I leave the store – from a customer, who, like the security guard, is a young man. “Lilo & Stitch!” he cries out. “That’s sick.”For a moment, I actually feel a tiny bit cool. “It’s only because people love Stitch as a character,” my wife says, dampening my high spirits. If I had been wearing the Raven rather than Stitch, she says, people would just think: “you’re the weirdo with a crow.”Day threeView image in fullscreenTrying out Stitch’s staying power.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe following morning, I decide to test the magnet’s limits and attempt a run with a shoulder pal mascot. It’s hopeless. Anything more than the gentlest of jogs and the toy goes flying – poor Stitch has to be fished out of a number of puddles, and narrowly misses a dip in the canal. Plus, I get a lot of stares.My shoulder pals fare much better in the office – admittedly, stranger things have been seen on the Guardian features desk – where they seem to put everyone in a good mood. My colleagues have fun trying them on; the Raven (who is frequently misidentified as a crow) is a particular hit. But when I pop out for a coffee, I find that the bird also has the capacity to give people a fright: “Oh my god, I thought that was real!” exclaims the person behind me in the cafe queue, after the Raven’s caw makes her jump.View image in fullscreenRaven caws throughout the meal …Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe reception continues to be frosty as I wander around King’s Cross, this time with a shoulder pal on each arm (Remy and the Cheshire cat). I try to look as nonchalant and unthreatening as possible, but still people give me a wide berth – only a doughnut seller (once again, a young man!) reacts positively, and asks to try one on.Meeting friends for lunch, I am apprehensive about taking the toys into a restaurant setting, but I needn’t have worried. If the staff notice, they don’t seem to care, despite the Raven cawing throughout the meal. One of my friends brings along someone I haven’t met before, which is humbling – it’s hard to come across as a nice, normal person when you are introduced as the girl with a stripy cat on her shoulder – but my new acquaintance seems to see the funny side. One friend, who works mostly in China, thinks the rise of these toys makes sense, given the popularity of south-east Asian toys and accessories – shoulder pals remind her ofChina’s 2015 sprout hair clip trend.Day fourView image in fullscreen‘After a few drinks, we’re all wearing one.’Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy KnightPascal the lizard has finally been delivered, and I try to keep it on for most of the day. Though it’s bright green, it doesn’t attract much attention, thanks to being partly covered by my hair. “I thought it was part of your bag,” one colleague says. Mid-afternoon, I end up taking it off – it feels uncomfortable, and seems to be itchier than the others.After work, I head to the pub. The three of us who get there first decide to each wear one of the pals and see how long it takes our other friend to notice. She arrives and heads to the bar without realising – it’s not until she returns with her drink she asks: “Why’s everyone got shit on their shoulders?” A few drinks later and she’s wearing one too.Day fiveView image in fullscreenLucy and Katherine with Remy and Emile from Ratatouille.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy KnightAfter days wearing the toys around people who have never seen them before, it’s time to meet up with a bona fide Disney fan. I head to Wickford, Essex, to the home of 39-year-old Katherine Potten (AKA@happilykatherine) who posts about Disney’s products and theme parks to her 92.4K TikTok followers.Potten instantly identifies my Pascal toy as “a fake” when I show her my collection. That explains why it’s so itchy. She shows me her softer, smaller-eyed Pascal to demonstrate the difference – all of her 23 shoulder pals are the real deal. She bought most of them from the theme parks – videos in which she “hunts” for the latest release in the parks have proved extremely popular.She tells me about “Disneybounding” – the practice of wearing clothes in the colours of a particular character (full costumes aren’t allowed for park-goers aged 14 and over, because that might cause confusion between guests and the staff members dressed as characters). Wearing the shoulder pal that is the sidekick of the character you’re trying to nod to – so, Pascal, if you’re wearing all-lilac in a nod to Rapunzel – “is perfect to finish that off,” she says.Potten hasn’t yet worn her shoulder pals outside of Disney events and the parks, but she does gamely agree to put on Emile from Ratatouille (to match my Remy) and walk to her local high street with me. Nobody pays us much attention until a woman calls out to let us know that Emile has fallen off Potten’s shoulder. Coincidentally, she knows exactly what shoulder pals are, and tells us she has two of her own at home. “They’re lovely, aren’t they?” she says. Who knew all these shoulder pal fans were hiding in plain sight?Day sixView image in fullscreenTaking in the view …Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianTo get the most brutally honest reaction, there’s only one place to go: to see my family. We’ve planned a weekend in the Cotswolds, the first family trip away for my baby niece. “I hate it,” my brother says when I arrive with the Cheshire cat on my shoulder. His nine-month-old daughter is more keen, pulling Remy’s chef hat towards her mouth. But, then again, that’s her reaction to most objects at the moment.Collectibles are taking over the toy box – but now the grown-ups are playing tooRead moreDay sevenView image in fullscreenRemy sizes up the giant onions.Photograph: Courtesy of Lucy KnightFor my final shoulder-pal-wearing day, I’m off to the Moreton-in-Marsh country show (when in the Cotswolds …). I offer to push the buggy whenever possible to make the tiny mouse on my shoulder seem less out of place – and my brother, correctly, accuses me of using his daughter as a prop to hide my own shame. I feel more confident after the two young adults staffing the RSPB stall call out to compliment Remy – one of them even says she is going to order one as soon as she gets home. Remy gets a shout out in the food and drink tent, too: “I love your Ratatouille,” a farmer says, as he hands out samples of locally grown apples.I’m relieved when I finally take Remy off. I’ve never felt fully relaxed while wearing a shoulder pal – partly out of self-consciousness, and partly out of concern that it might fall off. But I can’t deny that the responses I’ve had to Remy and his friends have been much more positive than I thought they were going to be. Wearing something so silly and unexpected has invited conversations with strangers, made my friends laugh and created, as Potten puts it, “a little bit of joy in a hard world”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsToysDisney ChannelShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.‘Every day is all there is”, as Joan Didion put it, rather elegantly. The words are so smoothly balanced you can turn them over in your mind like a pebble, and the phrase popped into my head the other day when I was thinking about why September is such a powerful month for fashion. September, the saying goes, is January for fashion people. This is sunrise for new trends, high noon for shopping, peak season for glossy magazines packed with breathless style instruction. It is the point in the calendar when an update of what you wear suddenly feels urgent.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This seems, on the surface, like odd timing. After all, once you get to be an adult, nothing much happens in September. It’s not much of a season for parties, or for family holidays. Just the muscle memory of school days makes this the moment to lock back into the routine, the nine-to-five, the tea-bath-bed. But that’s the point. September is all about the everyday.This is what Didion was getting at: that everyday is everything, and therefore worth giving your all to. This is about the stuff that is obviously important – about bringing your best self to your home life, your work, your relationships – but it’s also about the little stuff, too. Style is one of the little ways to elevate the everyday, to make it matter, to take pride in it. Wearing a nice outfit, putting out candles for dinner, a nicely wrapped birthday gift. Not because you have to, but because you and your life are worth it.It shouldn’t be a chore, which is where new season wardrobe updates come in, to freshen things up. Have you done a waistcoat yet? If not, this is your moment. They are brilliant on their own as a sleeveless top – the structure and buttons bring polish – and useful as an alternative to a light jacket, worn open over a shirt. (You want the boxy kind that has breadth at the shoulder, not the snooker-player version that makes bra straps an issue.)View image in fullscreen‘Miuccia Prada, who never gets this stuff wrong, paired tomato with plum at the Prada show in February’s Milan Fashion Week’.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/WireImageBut it is often what you wear on your bottom half that makes the difference between an outfit that looks contemporary and one that looks dated. An airy trouser that doesn’t hug your legs should be the linchpin of your autumn wardrobe. Or, consider a shorter skirt: the miniskirt revival, that began on the catwalks straight after the pandemic, has slowly grown into a real-world phenomenon. I’m not suggesting we go in on those minuscule micro ra-ra numbers the tweens and teens are doing, but if you are still in a calf-grazing hemline, it’s time to dig out the knee-length and shorter skirts lurking in your wardrobe.Rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I am thrilled about. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look deliciousAfter decades of athleisure and streetwear, style has shifted to a more grownup place recently. The details that once seemed dull and fusty – leather belts, ribbed socks – are now the pieces that will put you back at the leading edge. Instead of layering a hoodie under a blazer, try draping a sweater in a contrasting colour around your shoulders: the silhouette is similar, the comfort-level is consistent, but the effect is much more now.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: Forget date night – I’d much rather dress up to party with my friendsRead moreColour is back, too. The era of “quiet luxury” threw a blanket of beige over fashion for a couple of years, but rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I for one am thrilled about. Wearing beige every day was like living on nothing but Rich Tea biscuits: comforting and easy for a bit, but then boring and probably not doing us any favours. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious right now. MiucciaPrada, who never gets this stuff wrong, put copper and pink together at Miu Miu and paired tomato with plum at Prada.Making an effort doesn’t have to mean looking serious, by the way. If you are finding it hard to break out of wearing sweats, try a soft cotton rugby shirt in a bold stripe, untucked over wide trousers. It is about looking intentional, not about looking formal. Layer two different length necklaces over a sweater, or pin a vintage brooch to your lapel. Tiny gestures like this dignify dull days. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, and all that. Summer is over, but the spirit of September can bring the sunshine back.Model: Ellen at Body London.

These include the Nitro-Poached Aperitif, a frozen cocktail puff made with liquid nitrogen, and the Crab and Passionfruit 99′, which reimagines a seaside ice-cream cone.However, portion sizes are reduced by about 20%-30% per dish, and in some cases by up to 50%, while the price is £75 a head cheaper at £275.The offering reflects a rush to accommodate changing tastes as other GLP-1 drugs such as Saxendabecome more common in the UKas treatments for obesity.Blumenthal has himself been prescribed Mounjaro to help manage weight gained as a side-effect of his medication for type 1 bipolar disorder. “What struck me was the feeling of not being hungry,” he tells the Guardian.“I still wanted to eat, but I didn’t feel that drive. It made me think – this is going to kill the restaurant industry, because if people aren’t eating as much, restaurants won’t be as enticing. I’m not sure what will happen to supermarkets either.“I don’t think this change is bad for health. It could actually be very good for people. But it will affect alcohol, wine, food consumption, even supermarkets. I’ve even heard airlines could save money on fuel. This is only going to escalate in the next couple of months, and already millions of people are on these drugs.”View image in fullscreenThe Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire.Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PAAccording to the industry publicationFoodManufacture, 37% of UK consumers now cite weight loss as their top health priority. Research presented at a UKHospitality seminar earlier this year showed that 7% of UK adults, about 3.6 million people, used these drugs.Businesses whose models have been upended include Weight Watchers, which has emerged from bankruptcy protection in the US after amassing more than $1.4bn (£1bn) of debt andis now recommending GLP-1 jabs alongside its usual lifestyle-change advice.The wider food industry is also bracing for change, though the effects could be gradual. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that the consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035.However, some in the industry have said theydo not anticipate a big impact on salesas take-up of the drugs could remain relatively low. Other food manufacturers are already making changes: Nestlé, for instance, is developing higher-protein and nutrient-dense products to meet the needs of consumers eating less overall.The consumer champion Martin Newman says: “We’re already seeing other hospitality businesses pivot. In the US, brands like Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Panera have expanded lighter, protein-rich menu ranges designed for people eating less … Here in the UK, restaurant groups are widening ‘lighter choice’ menus, and delivery platforms like Deliveroo are making calories and protein far more visible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Therefore, eating out must adapt.”Newman says some operators may worry about “spend per head going down” with smaller portions, but that “misses the bigger picture”. He added: “If you can align eating out with people’s health goals, you’ll increase frequency and protect loyalty.”Blumenthal, who has built a career on innovation and exploration of the science of food, says his new menu reflects these shifts. “Millions of people are eating much less food, drinking less, losing interest in restaurants, losing interest even in food,” the chef says. “For more than a decade I’ve been saying that mindful eating is one of the keys to happiness and mental health.”Blumenthal adds that mindful eating can be applied beyond fine dining, even to simple meals. But in the case of the Fat Duck, the new menu is designed specifically to meet shifting appetites. “Sometimes, less really is more.”Trish Caddy, of the analysts Mintel, argues that while weight-loss drugs are beginning to affect dining out in the UK, their impact remains limited. “These drugs are expensive and highly regulated, restricting their use typically to wealthier consumers. Heston Blumenthal’s smaller-portion menu seems tailored to this group, highlighting a shift toward health-conscious dining rather than a mass-market change.”The Fat Duck says the price of both menus reflects the labour-intensive nature of service at the restaurant, which operates with almost as many chefs and waiters as guests during a sitting.The restaurant is celebrating its 30th anniversary, three decades after opening on 16 August 1995. Originally a brasserie, it soon became famous for its experimental molecular gastronomy, producing dishes such as snail porridge and nitro-scrambled bacon-and-egg ice-cream. The restaurant rose rapidly through the Michelin ranks, gaining three stars by 2004, and in the following year was named the world’s best restaurant, the only British venue to ever take the top spot.“Appetite suppressants are here in significant numbers,” Blumenthal says. “The way we eat is changing.Restaurantswill have to change with it.”Explore more on these topicsHeston BlumenthalThe Fat DuckObesityFood & drink industryRestaurantsFoodPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This, however, does taste good,” says chef Carla Lamont as she snips off a piece of orpine, a native sedum, in her herb garden. It’s crisp and juicy like a granny smith but tastes more like cucumber. “It’s said to ward off strange people and lightning strikes; but I like strange people.”We’re on a three-hectare (seven-acre) coastal croft on the Hebridean island of Mull. Armed with scissors, Carla is giving me a kitchen garden tour and culinary masterclass – she was a quarter-finalist in Masterchef: The Professionals a few years back. Sweet cicely can be swapped for star anise, she tells me. Lemon verbena she uses in scallop ceviche.Mull mapShe points out a barberry bush whose small, sour berries, a Middle Eastern staple, she adds to jewelled rice, and a myrtle bush which, I learn, is different from the bog myrtle growing wild on the croft that, when the leaves are crushed, smells gloriously aromatic with hints of eucalyptus. Bog myrtle also protects your woollens from moths, wards off midges – and is a key ingredient in one of her cocktails.“I had never grown anything before I came here. I was in a kitchen in the city and herbs came dried in a tub. Now, if I haven’t heard of something, I give it a go or thrust it at Jonny and say ‘Greenhouse.’”Carla and Jonny, her husband, are part of a new wave of crofter chefs or field-to-fork farmers spreading across Scotland. Crofting is, essentially, small-scale subsistence farming, the crofter traditionally rearing a few animals and growing vegetables on the smallholding, and maintaining a job or two on the side.Now, just as the architect-designed, off-grid bothy is a world away from the bare-bones huts that once gave shepherds shelter, the croft has been reinvented. Our back-to-the-land yearnings, fuelled by programmes such as This Farming Life and Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild, have turned crofting into a modern rural fantasy.View image in fullscreenFishers haul creels off the Mull coast.Photograph: David Gowans/AlamyThe new generation of crofters still juggle jobs, but today, that usually involves tourism rather than working for the local laird. For Jonny and Carla, it’s a restaurant calledNinth Waveand a cute cabin, theSea Shanty(sleeps two from £800 a week).They met 30 years ago when Carla, from Canada, answered an ad for a chef on the neighbouring island of Iona. Jonny’s nickname, Carla smiles, is “the lobster man”. Every day, he hikes two miles cross-country to his small boat, the Sonsie, returning with the catch that Carla cooks in the restaurant. They also cure, smoke and brine seafood and meat on Bruach Mhor croft. When Jonny’s not fishing, he’s working the land.It’s not fine dining. It’s street food presented nicelyCarla LamontThey grow about 80% of the fruit and vegetables for the restaurant in their kitchen garden, everything from cardoons to wasabi, and forage for wild herbs on the croft. They’ve counted more than 150 seasonal greens, herbs and edible flowers growing wild here. Bumping up the dirt track for lunch, the hedgerow is billowing with fluffy meadowsweet. “I’ll be harvesting it later for panna cotta,” Carla tells me.“People don’t realise you can eat so many flowers.” The pots of blowsy blooms by the door, it turns out, are also on the menu. “Marigolds are edible and so are dahlias. You can eat the flowers and the tubers. The Mexicans used them as their main starch crop hundreds of years ago. They’re wonderful roasted; like a cross between a potato and a jerusalem artichoke.”View image in fullscreenA dish at Ninth Wave, MullThe restaurant was once the barn or bothy, with a dirt floor and tin roof, attached to their one-bedroom cottage. And while the produce for the menu might mainly be locally grown, reared or caught, the inspiration for Carla’s dishes comes from her travels. At the end of each season, the couple head off on food adventures, grazing their way through Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.For lunch I’m tucking into a Mexican-inspired dish: Jonny’s lobster teetering on garden-grown roasted corn salsa, a creamy Yucatan avocado and hoja santo soup, laced with lemon verbena and Vietnamese coriander. “It’s not fine dining,” she shrugs, “it’s street food presented nicely.”At the other end of the island, another restaurant on a croft is also making waves as much for its architectural wow factor as its pasture-to-plate menus. Jeanette Cutlack moved to Mull from Brighton in 2008 and ran a pop-up restaurant for 10 years in her home. Her dream, however, was to restore the abandoned croft and ruined barn down the lane.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir. Starters such as crab arancini and lemon mayonnaise are served alongside spicy haggis, cornbread and salsa verde. Haggis is Jeanette’s speciality and she also runs haggis-making workshops.Now that the land has been cleared, the 20-hectare croft is starting to bear fruit. Jeanette has planted a nectarine tree and kiwi vine. In a polytunnel, she and her family grow salad and herbs while a small flock of Hebridean sheep grazes the hill that is part of the land.

Iain and Joyce Hetherington have converted their front room into a restaurant showcasing the local produce – from creel-caught shellfish landed at Croig on the island’s north coast, to organic vegetables grown by Carol Guidicelli on her croft at Langamull, near Croig, along with their in-house smoked venison. On the tiny community-owned island of Ulva, meanwhile, a short boat ride away, theBoathouse, recently revamped by Banjo Beale, winner of a TV interior design show, has become one of the hottest lunch spots, with diners crammed around picnic tables devouring plates of briny langoustine and crab claws on the water’s edge.View image in fullscreenSgriob ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheeseAnd then there is the well established but ever-evolving award-winningSgriob-ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheese, just a few minutes’ drive from Tobermory’s pastel-painted waterfront. The Reade family arrived on the island with five cows in the 1980s and rebuilt a rundown dairy operation, starting cheese production a few years later. The farm’s Glass Barn cafe is a fabulous, foliage-festooned space where you can sample signature cheese and charcuterie platters or a bowl of homemade soup and a cheese scone before taking the far from run-of-the-mill tour.Our small tour group meets the US cheese-maker Troy by the pig pen. After hearing a potted family history, we move on to the milking parlour where he weaves in science and Willy Wonka-style invention. The milk, he explains, is pumped to the cheese-making shed next door via an underground tank. The warm milk, fresh from the cows’ udders, heats the water used by the cafe. Walking us through the cheese-making process, we head underground to the vast cheese cellar, meet newborn calves and piglets and learn about innovative sustainable farming initiatives.10 of the best Scottish island escapesRead moreThe leftover whey from the cheesemaking was once used to feed the pigs – until they found a better use for it. In the farmyard a smart new micro-distillery uses the whey to make gin and “whey-ski” – possibly a pun too far, a barrel-aged spirit. The tour ends with a tasting. The gin has a surprisingly distinctive creaminess, the whey-ski is pure fire water.“It’s not sweet like a bourbon,” Troy says as he pours another dram. “It’s more like an Irish whiskey.” I knock it back, thinking that’s the thing about Mull: for outside-the-box thinking and wild culinary innovation, it’s leading the way.Ninth Wave: four-course lunch £80(not open for dinner).Croft 3: two-course menu £42, three courses £50.The Boathouse:half lobster £25, langoustines £18 (a la carte).Ar Bòrd: three-course set menu £55pp.Isle of Mull Cheese tour: £20Explore more on these topicsFood and drinkScotland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here it makes an unexpected but inspired burrata topperTom HuntWed 17 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhile most Instagram food trends prioritise spectacle over substance, the viral frozen tomato idea that I’m employing today delivers genuine culinary value, and solves a common kitchen problem into the bargain. I’m a bit late to the party, admittedly, but it’s a versatile waste-saving technique.Its origin clearly derives from either Hawaiian shaved ice or granita, that classic Italian frozen dessert made by stirring and scraping or grating a sorbet-like base into shavings, and the approach essentially applies granita principles to fresh produce, while at the same time cutting out all of the hassle: simply pop any surplus or past-its-best fruit or vegetables in the freezer until they’re rock solid, then grate!Frozen fruit and vegetable “granita” with burrataThe freezer is one of the best tools we have for saving waste, so if in doubt, freeze! I especially love the simplicity of this incredibly versatile dish, which can help save on waste by making use of various odds and ends or of wonky fruit and veg at the back of the crisper drawer by simply freezing it for later, then upcycling it into a really special starter.Burrata is the perfect vehicle for the subtlety of this shaved ice. It’s made by stretching a ball of mozzarella into a delicate pouch, and filling it with stracciatella (essentially, strands of mozzarella mixed with cream), and so creating one of the most delicious cheeses known to humankind.One fruit or vegetable is plenty for this, and will stand-alone if you want to create a simple dish, but if you have other ingredients that will work well, by all means go for it. I wanted a Neapolitan-styletricoloregranita on my burrata, but ended with more of a Jamaican flag because I had only a green cucumber end, a red beef tomato and a yellow pepper spare. Other good seasonal combinations are beetroot, balsamic and dill, carrot; fennel, aleppo pepper and orange juice; and fig, balsamic and black pepper.This dish is hard to share so serve a whole burrata per person.Serves11 fruit or vegetable1 burrataSea saltOptional extras (all to taste)Oil: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil or cold-pressed rapeseed oilHerbs and spices: basil, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, sumac, aleppo pepperAcid: orange or lemon juice, plus the finely grated zest, if the fruit’s organic and unwaxed (especially good with carrot and fennel); or aged balsamic vinegar (thicker balsamic sits better on the granita, rather than melting it).Take your chosen fruit or vegetable and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight, until solid.When you’re ready to serve, place the burrata on a plate and grate your chosen frozen ingredient directly over the top. Season generously with sea salt, then drizzle with the oil of your choice. Add a sprinkle of herbs or spices and, if you like, a touch of acidity, then serve immediately because the frozen shavings meltveryquickly.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitVegetablesStarterCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you could quickly find that you have the responsibility of looking after, then clearing out, their home.How their possessions, property and finances will be dealt with should be outlined in the will, if there is one. This should also name who the executor or executors of the estate are – the people legally responsible for carrying out the wishes of the deceased. They will take responsibility for the property.Before the will is read it is important to ensure that it and other important paperwork such as property deeds, insurance documents and bank statements are kept safe if the person’s house or flat is going to be empty.As soon as you can, empty the fridge of perishable food and dispose of plants and flowers from inside the house. Cancel any regular deliveries such as milk and newspapers. Ensure the property is locked up and retrieve any spare keys from hiding places.View image in fullscreenIf you are responsible for the property, ensure it is locked up.Photograph: Ian Simpson/AlamyIf there is no will, the most “entitled” person can apply to be the administrator. This will be the closest living relative, normally the spouse followed by any children over 18.Tell the insurerIf the property is going to be empty it is important to contact the insurer once the homeowner dies.You may need to provide it with evidence that you are authorised to administer the property such as a death certificate or a lasting power of attorney document.You may have to take extra steps to ensure it is secure, such as draining the water system, checking any burglar alarm is working and keeping the heating to a suitable temperature during the winter.Most standard home insurance policies don’t fully cover properties left empty for more than 30 to 60 consecutive days. If that will be the case, an extension to the policy might be needed to prevent against fire, theft or flooding for example. The cost of this depends on the insurer.Sort as you goWhen you start the clear-out proper, be methodical and put items into categories. The will may say that some items such as jewellery are to be given to specific people, and so you may want to begin by finding these things.Just Clear, a London-based house clearance company,suggests you work from room to roomand put items into categories as you go. You could get some cardboard boxes to sort the smaller things into.Some things such as furniture may have to be sold or auctioned off; others may be sent to a charity shop; things that have no use and are not wanted may only be appropriate for the tip. If in doubt about whether an item has any value, look it up online before you sling it in the recycling.View image in fullscreenWhen clearing out someone’s house you could get some cardboard boxes to sort the smaller things into.Photograph: Judith Collins/AlamyEven if you aren’t able to remove the items from the property, because probate is being dealt with, you can make an inventory of what is there. Once probate is confirmed, you can distribute the items to family members and friends of the deceased.Pay for helpThere are lots of reasons why you may want to get the experts in to do it for you. Clearing out the home of a loved one can be a daunting task, especially if you are dealing with a lifetime of possessions. Or you may live far away and may not be able to manage the whole thing yourself.House clearance firms specialise in taking the responsibility of emptying a home away from family or friends.Brendan O’Shea, the chief executive of Just Clear, says people sometimes think they can do the job themselves but then find they are swamped, or simply do not have the time.“We get calls from Australia, America – all over the world,” he says. Some people are very good at getting their affairs in order, others are very different. It is all down to the individual, O’Shea adds.“I’ve got clients who are prolonging the clearance process because they cannot emotionally deal with it. They can’t process it in their head. And when they do try to approach it, it gives them anxiety,” he says.Typically, a professional house clearance service should clear the property, taking over the sorting and recycling and, in some cases, moving items to an auction house. It may also sell items on your behalf, taking a commission in the process. You may also be able to get it to take care of cleaning of the property, too, if this is needed.View image in fullscreenItems can be sent to an auction house.Photograph: geogphotos/AlamyO’Shea says that an average three-bedroom house – in which one person was living – will take his company a day to clear. This would cost the estate £1,700 (plus VAT) and includes recycling charges, and haulage and labour, among other expenses.In some cases, the clearance turns up valuable items that loved ones did not know were there. O’Shea says his company found two Picasso ceramics in a house in Knightsbridge, London – they subsequently sold for £120,000.For those who believe that items in a home are worth more than they are, he says that auctioning them will show what the market values them at.He says an auction is a good way of finding out how much something is worth. You may think something is a valuable antique, but by taking it to an auction you can find out how much the market will pay for it.He says the low bar for entry to become a clearance company means it “is not a nice industry”. In order to distinguish between companies, look at online reviews for them and how long they have been in the business. Recommendations from local friends or relatives will also help you choose a good company.Inform organisationsSome organisations will need to be told of the death. Many councils use the Tell Us Once system, which notifies most government organisations in one go. The registrar will give you the details and a number when you register the death. The system will tell HM Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Passport Office and the DVLA among others. You will need the personal details of the deceased, and possibly documents such as passport and driving licence.You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and opticianAge UKsays if the council is not part of the service, you will have to contact the organisations yourself. The name of deceased can be put on the Bereavement Register, which removes them from mailing lists and stops advertising mail.You should also contact pension providers, banks, trade unions, mortgage providers, their GP, dentist and optician, as well as any charities to which they may have made subscription payments.Don’t rushDealing with the death of a friend or a loved one does not have to be rushed. The insurerL&G advises peopleto clear out a home with someone else and to do it over different days in order to avoid emotional fatigue. Just Clear says it can often take several weeks to sort through the remains of someone’s life and it is vital to give yourself time to reflect.Charities are available to help. Cruse Bereavement Support has helplines to help those who have lost someone, while Marie Curie also has a helpline.Citizens Advice has adviceon the steps that need to be taken after a death.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksBereavementPropertyDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had been running around, putting every acid you can think of on the palm of her hand, then all over her face. One of our estheticians had to tend to her skin. Her parents were nowhere to be seen.”Former Sephora employee KM, 25, has her war stories too. Like the day a woman was caught shoplifting and told the security guard “she was trying to steal because her kid was getting bullied because she didn’t have a Dior lip gloss. [The mom] couldn’t afford it but her daughter told her she is going to get made fun of at school.”When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way’Sephora employeeGaby, 26, worked for Sephora for three years during which time, she said ruefully: “I witnessed so much.” One parent asked Gaby whether her tween “should get a retinol and start preventing anti-ageing now”.Another mother asked Gaby to contour her daughter’s nose to make it look smaller. “When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way.’ It’s not my place to step in and say that, but I really felt like I had to.”The phenomenon of “Sephora kids” – a catch-all phrase for the intense attachment between preteen children, high-end beauty stores and the expensive, sometimes harsh, products that are sold within them – is now well established. In the first half of last year, a third of “prestige” beauty sales were driven by households with tweens and teens, according to the market research firm Circana. The same year, according to Statista, LVMH-owned Sephora racked up around $9bn in US sales, while competitor UltaBeautyreported sales of $11.3bn.‘She has a hyaluronic acid and niacinamide serum’: the curious boom in skincare for tweensRead moreThe trend is driven by skincare content produced by beauty influencers – many of whom are tweens and teens themselves. The videos they post put kids’ sensitive skin at “significant dermatological risk”, according to thefirst peer-reviewed studyon the phenomenon, published in June by Northwestern University. Its analysis found that skincare routines posted by teens and tweens on TikTok containedan average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients per routine, which risked causing acute reactions and triggering lifelong allergies.Sephora has tried to distance itself from the trend (“we do not market to this audience,” said Artemis Patrick, president and CEO of Sephora North America,in a recent Fortune interview). Being seen to sell anti-ageing products to children is not a good look. Last year, the skincare brand Drunk Elephant became intrinsically linked with the trend, when its brightly packaged creams became a status symbol for tweenage kids, some of whom reported skin reactions to harsh ingredients. It recently reported a 65% decline in sales, which most analysts pegged to the brand losing touch with the adult customers it had been designed for.Despite this, the situation has dug its neon-pink nails in this summer, according to a selection of current and former Sephora workers the Guardian spoke to. Every single one of these young women expressed concern about what they have witnessed on the shop floor.Summer is peak time for Sephora kids: school is out and third spaces arenotoriously scarce. The high-shine environment of the beauty store – brightly lit, soundtracked by loud music, full of lotions and tubs in vivid hues – can feel like a magnet for children.View image in fullscreenToddlers run around unsupervised, wreaking havoc with displays, knocking down banners or filling shopping baskets to the brim with testers while their parents were elsewhere in the store, according to the workers I spoke to. Or parents were pacifying kids with “a full-blast YouTube video”, said KM, who calls her store’s tiniest inhabitants “free range kids”.Kennedy works in a Sephora concession within a Kohl’s department store right across from the junior’s clothing section and believes that “cross traffic is very intentional,” she said. Kids stream in all day. “Parents will drop their kids in Sephora and then wander the rest of Kohl’s, and I won’t see them until checkout.” At that point, she said, some parents will materialize, often without looking at the specific products their child wants. “I had that happen with a dad recently. He was on his phone the whole time, swiped his card for $200 not even thinking about it.”Workers I spoke to also said they had tried to dissuade younger kids from buying harsh products from brands designed for more mature skin.Sometimes, even with a parent present, the advice is not always heeded, said Gaby. “They’re just like,‘Well, my daughter really wants this, can you just grab it?’” said Jessica, a former Sephora worker. “I remember one circumstance where a kid who looked about nine wanted to buy a lot of Drunk Elephant products: the retinol, the glycolic acid.” When Jessica warned one mother that the products were too harsh for her child’s skin, she responded: “Well, we just saw it onTikTok,” and “ended up buying everything”.When parents do listen, there are sometimes tense exchanges in store. From tweenagers pleading: “But I saw this online, it’s supposed to be good!” said KM, to “little kid type tantrums. You know: ‘I want a lip gloss!’ And the mom’s like, ‘You’re six, you don’t need a lip gloss!’”View image in fullscreenAll the workers were sure that many of these products were going unused. Once a beauty product is opened and sits on a shelf for a while, it goes bad, points out KM: “It’s just landfill.” Overconsumption has been a concern.Shoplifting – or “shrink” in store parlance – is also a big issue. “I find so many empty boxes of product at work all the time,” said Gaby. There was a “whole trend of ‘borrowing’ on TikTok”, said Erica, 28, referring to a euphemism for shoplifting she believes has contributed to some kids getting very adept at the practice.It is common for kids to use their parents’ credit cards. “They bring out those silver American Express cards, the ones that are metal. And I’m like, ‘That’s definitely not yours,’” said Gaby. Erica said she has seen little girls who look around eight say casually to their parents: “‘I want to get this. Let me just use your card.’”They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks likeSephora employeeThis behavior has tied into an overall impression of preteen children behaving like little adults. Kennedy described it as as a “weird entitlement”. Kids might come in on their phone, holding a Starbucks cup almost as big as they are. She said she has heard preteen girls say phrases like, “I’m going to have to start anti-ageing soon.” They are almost always joking, she said, yet “even if it’s said in jest, it is strange. They want to act mature and have the grownup experience of shopping at Sephora, but there is also this deep seated societal fear of anti-ageing permeating the mind of a 10-year-old.”For Joy, a 25-year-old Sephora worker, the trend is “all about appearance”. The visual landscape of social media is “a lot of pressure” for girls, she said: “Celebrities and influencers in their 50s still look like they are my age,” and kids notice that. “Little do they know, it’s probably a doctor involved.”Erica said baby-faced preteens sometimes approach her in store saying things like, “‘Do you think I have pores?’ They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks like.”Dr Meghan Owenz, a clinical associate professor at Florida International University and therapist specializing in parenting and anxiety, said that it is normal for preteen girls to start caring about personal hygiene at their age. The pressures, however, have shifted for their generation, as they figure out how to deal with questions like: “‘What’s everybody else doing – and how do I fit in there?’ If we insert social media at that time then they’re flooded with this information.”View image in fullscreenChildren cultivating a sense of belonging through products – whether sneakers or Beanie Babies or Pokémon cards – is nothing new. Yet generation Alpha, those born after 2010, is facing a unprecedent amount of marketing messages for years:43% of gen Alpha in the US had tablets before the age of sixand 58% received their first iPhone by age 10, according to one survey.US government research from 2023described social media use as “nearly universal” at 95% use for those age 13 to 17 and nearly 40% for those age eight to 12 (despite the age limit being set at 13 for many platforms). These are platforms on which the boundary between paid advertising and impartial content is blurred to the point of non-existence, particularly in the world of beauty influencers.KM has begun to notice an eerie Invasion of the Body Snatchers language among tiny customers who talk in influencer-ese: “I’m here for my back-to-school glow,” or “I’m here for my back-to-school lip balm,” they might say. Or they just “repeat the actual product name over and over again, like they saw someone promote it but they have no idea what it actually does”.Owenz believes the inundation of paid influencers who “talk about ‘my skincare routine’ and ‘get ready with me,’” leads to children mimicking their behavior as a “developmentally appropriately … way to fit in”. Owenz added: “The problem is for girls is that they cannot possibly live up to what they see on social media financially, physically or otherwise.”“It has gotten harder to say no, because there’s so much advertising to our kids all the time,” Owenz added. “Kids are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure – and they’re going to pressure their parents more.”[The kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same productformer Sephora employeeIt remains the case, she said, that it is the parent’s job to “discern what’s appropriate for them and say: ‘No, it’s not appropriate. Here’s the reason.’”But California assemblymember Alex Lee believes putting the onus should not solely be on parents, in part because beauty companies are not obligated to feature clear labels or warning – only very long lists of ingredients. “Your average parent is not a pediatric dermatologist,” he said. Lee has twice tried to introduce a bill stopping stores from selling products containing ingredients such as retinol and glycolic acid to kids under 18. The Personal Care Product Council – which represents the interests of the beauty industry – lobbied against the bills, which have both failed to pass. In Lee’s view, the industry is unwilling to do anything to disrupt its relationship with children it believes will be customers for life.Many of the workers I spoke to believed that many beauty brands stocked by Sephora had started targeting this customer base, whether or not they would admit it. Kennedy has noticed shifts: brands suddenly redesigning packaging to be more colorful, adding tween-friendly products such as lip oils and blushes to skincare lines initially intended for more mature skin. Some brands encourage a collection mindset, said Gaby. “They will come out with a limited-edition matcha-flavored lip balm, or iced coffee, or pink guava – and [the kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same product.”Why are our children obsessed with anti-ageing treatments? Take a look in the mirror | Barbara EllenRead moreSephora, Ulta and Drunk Elephant did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment for this story. Generally though, the skincare industry’s response has been to launch more product ranges specifically designed for very young skin. Many walk a line between palatable messages for parents and social media-influenced and marketing strategies – such as drumming fingernails on closeup shots of bottles – aimed at preteens.The trend rolls on: children have been hosting birthday parties within some Sephora and Ulta stores on an ad-hoc basis for some time, but last month Ulta made it official with thelaunch of a $42-per-guest birthday party package, offering “75 – 90 minutes of beauty fun” using “healthy, gentle” products formulated “with tweens and teens in mind”. As if to underline the sense that such initiatives are about grooming – in more than one sense – on their big day, the “guest of honor” will be gifted the opportunity to spend yet more money with the brand, receiving a 20% off coupon to use when they return for their next shopping trip.View image in fullscreenSome names have been changed to protect the identities of current Sephora employees.Illustrations by Min HeoExplore more on these topicsChildrenYoung peopleShopping tripsBeautySocial mediaTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I lost a contest – and found the real meI should have been devastated when I came third in a public speaking competition. But the joy that came out of nowhere has shaped the rest of my lifeVerity BabbsWed 17 Sep 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 10.36 EDTShare“Iam a teenager, living in an age with war, corruption, discrimination, racism, sexism. But no one seems angry about it. People see the slight advances towards equal society as having solved our issues entirely and it just isn’t enough.”It’s March 2015, and I’ve done it: I’ve solved inequality. Standing in the basement room of ModernArtOxford for my regional heat of the Articulation prize public speaking competition, I truly believe that I may have just introduced this room full of parents and teachers to the concept of feminism. I’m very pleased with myself.The Articulation prize is a competition for post-GCSE students, aged 16 to 19, who are given 10 minutes to present on a work of art of their choice. I was told about it by my head of sixth form, whose office I had ended up in just weeks before the competition. As a pupil, I was clever but chatty and easily distracted. I felt everything acutely and was frequently overwhelmed and tearful.I also took an all-or-nothing approach to my education: either be the best, or don’t bother. In the office, we discussed my decision to drop history AS-level within weeks of starting because I didn’t think it would be possible for me to finish it with an A. “Not everything is death or glory, Verity,” he implored.Along with my longsuffering art teacher, the head of sixth form recognised that Articulation was exactly the opportunity that I needed – after all, I loved art AS-level, and was suitably gobby as part of the school’s rag-tag debate club. He suggested I prepare something for a preliminary in-school heat. From memory, I don’t think anyone else applied.View image in fullscreenBabbs in 2016.Photograph: Courtesy of Verity BabbsI chose to speak aboutDamien Hirst’s medicine cabinets, which I had seen at his 2012 retrospective at Tate Modern (the poster of which is still stuck on the wall behind my desk). I’d seen Hirst’s work for the first time as a child visiting Ilfracombe, the north Devon town where my grandmother had grown up, and where Hirst had a restaurant, the Quay, full of formaldehyde-imprisoned fish, and wallpaper covered in pills. I loved that his work was funny and contrarian, and that he got away with calling whatever he wanted “art”. I loved that my grandmother hated it. But maybe most of all, I loved that, because the medicine cabinet installations were named after tracks on their 1977 album, I was going to say “Sex” (Pistols) several times during the talk. I truly was the most radical young thinker of my generation.At the regional heat, there were nine other speakers, all of whom had better historical references, made fewer unqualified, sweeping statements, and used the word “bollocks” less. I was awarded third place. As a teenager who put almost all of her self-worth on achievement, this would usually have been a devastating outcome. But, in that moment, the fact that people seemed to enjoy my talk, and had laughed exactly when I had wanted them to, felt enough.By the time Articulation invited me to give my talk again, this time as part of a conference at the British Museum, I had sent in my application to read history of art at Oxford. Before the competition, I had thought I was going to apply for English or German, but certainly not at Oxbridge, where I knew I would never be “the best”. But the competition had emboldened me and made me believe that my opinions were worth sharing, even when I didn’t speak the lingo. I didn’t need to be the best: I just needed to put my spin on things.Talking about art – and finding ways to make people laugh while I do it – quickly became my north star. My Articulation journey came full circle when I was invited back this spring to be the first graduate judge of an Articulation heat.The competition gave me confidence beyond my degree choice: not that I could achieve great things, but that I didn’t have to. I no longer needed to covet perfection; I needed to lean into my own voice. I went from being anxious and easily overcome – passionate but quick to frustration – to someone who believed in their capabilities. I didn’t need to be perfect. For the first time, authenticity meant more to me than flawlessness.I’ll always be grateful to the sixth-form head who made the effort to understand me when I was an obstinate and emotional teenager, rather than simply rolling his eyes (and, looking back, I think an eye roll would have been entirely justified). Not everythingwasdeath or glory; I learned that it is often worth trying, even without the promise of “winning”.The History of Art in One Sentence by Verity Babbs is published by Bloomsbury, £14.99.

Since last week, the propaganda potential of theconservative US activist’s killinghas escaped none of them.Kirk, a rising star of Donald Trump’s Maga movement, washit in the neck by a single bulletas he addressed students in Utah on 10 September. A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson,has been charged, but his alleged motives remain unclear.But that has not stopped far-right figureheads from across the continentseizing on the killingto attack “the left”, presenting Kirk’s death as the logical conclusion of what they portray as a long-running hate campaign aimed at silencing them.“We must stop the hate-mongering left!”said Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Santiago Abascal of Spain’s Vox went further: “Censorship isn’t enough for them – so they resort to murder.”For Jordan Bardella of France’s far-right National Rally(RN), the “dehumanising rhetoric of the left and its intolerance … fuels political violence”. Alice Weidel of Germany’s AfD said Kirk had been shot by “a fanatic who hates our way of life”.The objective, experts say, is to raise Kirk to the status of a martyr to the conservative cause, and a victim of liberal-progressive persecution – simultaneously lending greater legitimacy to the right’s positions, and inflicting damage on the left.“Martyrdom is a social operation to transform a morally and socially unacceptable act of violence into a narrative,” historianPierre-Marie Delpu told Le Monde. “Here, the far right is constructing a plot and a persecution, with one executioner: the left.”Some on Europe’s far rightwere disarmingly open about the business of capitalising on the killing. “We should not be ashamed of ‘politicising [Kirk’s] death’ – or putting a tragedy to good use,” urged Damien Rieu, an adviser to Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal.In the European parliament, the ultranationalist Europe of Sovereign Nations group, which includes AfD and France’s Reconquête, nominated Kirk for the Sakharov prize, awarded annually for “the defence of human rights and fundamental liberties”.Mobilising the baseView image in fullscreenA tribute to Charlie Kirk at Vox’s Europa Viva convention in Madrid.Photograph: Luis Soto/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockAt a far-right gathering hosted by Vox in Madrid last weekend, a stirring video tribute to Kirk wowed the audience. To loud cheers,Abascal toldan estimated 8,500 people that the left “do not kill us for being fascists – they call us fascists in order to kill us”.André Ventura of Portugal’s Chega saidthe killing showed “arguing over ideas” had given way to “hatred, persecution and murder”. Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, told the rallythat Kirk’s “sacrifice … shows us once again which side the violence and intolerance are on … We will continue to fight tirelessly for our people’s freedom.”In London, the 110,000 to 150,000 people who attended Tommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” protest on Saturday – including far-right figures from France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Germany –held a minute’s silence for their hero.A continent on the marchThis all might matter less if Europe’s far right were not already on the march.

In Spain, Vox is surging in the polls and in Portugal, Chega is in the lead ahead of local elections.In German regional elections in North Rhine-Westphalia last Saturday, AfD was well beaten by chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right CDU and his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners – but the far-right party succeeded in almost tripling its vote.More insidiously, hardline far-right policies – on immigration, Islam, the green agenda, EU integration, traditional values – arebecoming normalised across Europeas mainstream parties ape them in a vain attempt to maintain their vote shares.Holding the lineIna passionate op-ed for Le Monde, the French MEP and former European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau – who received death threats after objecting to the far right’s calls for a minute’s silence for Kirk – said that while Kirk’s killing was an abomination, he had “glorified racial segregation and slavery, demanded women return to the home, demonised homosexuality, blamed Jews for promoting immigration … and compared abortion to the Holocaust”.She was, she said, the only one of 720 MEPs “to speak out and demand that a distinction be made between the unanimous condemnation we should all express in the face of a man’s assassination, and the refusal to endorse his ideas”.In the present circumstances, Loiseau said, resisting the concerted call for Kirk’s martyrdom – “keeping our heads, remaining true to what we are” – is of paramount importance.Because “it is not respect for the dead they demand; it’s the right to insult and hate the living who do not resemble them … It is not freedom of speech they defend, it is the normalisation of their extremism.

PeruRail’s local unit also said “third parties” had excavated part of its rail route, which affected the track’s stability and slowed down the evacuation of tourists.Protesters say there is a lack of transparency and fairness in the process of replacing tourist bus operator Consettur after its concession expired, paving the way for different local businesses to benefit from the vital industry.Tourism minister Desilu Leon told local radio that 1,400 tourists had been evacuated on Monday but 900 remained stranded in Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Peru’s most visited cultural site.View image in fullscreenA group of tourists waves while leaving on foot due to a protest by residents in Machu Picchu.Photograph: Carolina Paucar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe protest began last week after the concession ended of Consettur, the bus company that ferries tourists from Aguas Calientes to the entrance of the 15th-century Inca citadel.A neighbouring district commissioned another bus company to provide services in its place, but protesters in Aguas Calientes prevented it from operating.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

The PNG defence minister, Billy Joseph, suggested external players were trying to crash the agreement this week.Even the promise ofa PNG rugby league teamcompeting from 2028 was not enough to close the deal.Both prime ministers will be racing to save the agreement, a week after a similar plan with Vanuatu was delayed because ministers therewant the power to sign infrastructure deals with Beijing.But, whatever the hold up, the latest blow to the government’s Pacific strategy might not be the serious foreign policy embarrassment the Coalition claims.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands program director, Mihai Sora, said the situation might be more complex than Albanese anticipated but a deal could still be reached. He told Guardian Australia that exclusivity requirements in security and critical infrastructure would always be sensitive for newly independent Pacific countries.“Both Prime Minister Marape inPapua New Guineaand Prime Minister Jotham Napat in Vanuatu were fully intending to sign these finalised agreements. They’ve both been telegraphing for the better part of a year that momentum was behind signing the deal,” he said.“They’re all onboard, but not necessarily everybody within their political system is with them. It looks like Prime Minister Marape was as blind-sided by the last-minute lack of endorsement as Prime Minister Albanese was.”Sora said Albanese, with the assistance of the foreign minister, Penny Wong, should continue to press the case, especially since Marape clearly stated Australia remained PNG’s security partner of choice.“I think the reality is that until you get that final signature on the final document, everything is still under negotiation.”Marape was at pains to point out PNG had sought the agreement with Australia, not the other way round. He revealed he goes to sleep at night worrying he could not defend his citizens in the event of a military attack.Albanese stressed that unlike under authoritarian regimes, democracies run on proper process and things take time.The former US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell has warned China is out to frustrate and sabotage Australia’s Pacific efforts, including blocking initiatives like joint agreements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead the two governments signed a joint communique and pledged to continue negotiations on the wider defence pact.It is the second such delay in as many weeks for Albanese.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBefore this month’s Pacific Islands Forum, Vanuatu’s government paused the signing of a joint agreement with Australia, sayingmore work was neededon the question of critical minerals funding from China.The PNG deal is expected to lock the two countries into joint defence arrangements in the event of a military attack, and to allow citizens of both countries to serve in the defence forces of the other.Joint training exercises, better technical interoperability and new cooperation on cybersecurity preparedness are all envisaged.Albanese has pushed adeal for PNG to enter the NRL in 2028, part of the $600m agreement which has served as a major diplomatic sweetener. He stressed there was no delay to the team entering the competition.Donald Trump clashes with Australian ABC journalist and confirms Albanese meetingRead moreSpeaking at a press conference in Port Moresby, Albanese said the text of the defence agreement had been confirmed but both governments had more work to do.“We will go through our respective cabinet processes and expect to finalise the signing of the treaty, the words of which have been agreed, in coming weeks,” he said.“This is very positive, very positive. There is no downside in this whatsoever. This is all upside for Australia and upside forPapua New Guinea.”Marape said PNG’s defence capability was not sufficient to defend the country and its people, making shared security settings with Australia necessary.He stressed that the new treaty was PNG’s proposal, not Australia’s, and that it would not affect PNG’s sovereignty.“A security treaty for Papua New Guinea would be the highest, in terms of secure relations we have given to any country,” he said.“The threats that face us are exposed to Australia. Threats that face Australia are exposed to Papua New Guinea.”But retired major general Jerry Singirok, the Papua New Guinea defence force commander in the 1990s, accused Albanese of trying to “ambush” Marape and the PNG cabinet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia’s threat is not ours,” he told Guardian Australia.“Why can’t they recruit their own?

Ministers are due to meet again next week.The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, accused the government of rushing for photo opportunities, instead of carefully executing foreign policy.“Anthony Albanese failed his own test,” she said. “He has failed to plan for the risks in our region.“This is a serious foreign policy embarrassment on his watch.”The Nakamal agreement with Vanuatu had been expected to be signed earlier this month. That deal would see Australia spend up to $500m over a decadeon climate change resilience, security services and the economy.Labor believes both agreements can still be signed in coming months.China has used infrastructure funding and loan agreements to build influence with Pacific Island countries, undercutting Australia’s ties with the region and testing the country’s diplomatic reach.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyPapua New GuineaAnthony AlbaneseChinaPacific islandsAsia PacificAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was required to submit a binding proposal by Friday.The proposal would have put a portfolio of oil and gas assets, including large operations in Western Australia and the Cooper basin, as well as critical energy infrastructure in the eastern states, under foreign control.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSantos also controls a lucrative stake in a Papua New Guinea liquified natural gas project.The deal was supported by the board of the Adelaide-based Santos, but heavily criticised by Australian unions. The proposal required various regulatory approvals and would have been tested by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which provides advice to the treasurer.In contested deals, bidders would typically receive informal advice from government representatives on their view of the proposal before official processes.Analysts told Guardian Australia that thelack of a major Australian partner in the consortium, such as a superannuation fund, was an obvious drawback to the proposal.In a statement, XRG said it had been prepared to undertake new long-term commitments to Australian energy production “that would deliver meaningful benefits to domestic gas consumers and enhance regional energy security”.“While the consortium maintains a positive view of the Santos business, a combination of factors, when considered collectively, have impacted the consortium’s assessment of its indicative offer,” XRG said.The withdrawal saves the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, from making a tricky diplomatic decision. While a foreign takeover of the assets raised questions over domestic energy security, Australia has a robust trading relationship with theUnited Arab Emirates, which includes a bilateral free trade agreement.Santos said in a statement it had been notified by XRG of the withdrawal late on Wednesday.“The XRG consortium would not agree to acceptable terms which protected the value of the potential transaction for Santos shareholders, having regard to the likely extended timeframe to completion and the regulatory risk associated with the transaction,” Santos said.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

That figure rose to nearly 46,000 bonds claimed completely by the landlord in the year to June.We need to move a lot of the burden of enforcing the law away from tenantsLeo Patterson RossFull refunds have become less common, with the share slipping from 63% to 61% of bonds returned entirely to tenants.InVictoria, the share of bonds fully refunded fell from 68% in mid-2021 to 64% in mid-2024, while in the Australian Capital Territory full refunds fell from nearly 77% in mid-2022 to 73% by mid-2025.Landlords’ bond claims at move-out time have become the second most common reason for renters to contact advocacy group Tenants Victoria, according to its deputy chief executive, Cameron Bloye.“It’s just an incredibly stressful time for renters, and [it] feeds into that power imbalance,” he said.Rent rises and rip-offsExperts say the power gap between tenants and landlords has not been the only reason for the rise in bond loss in NSW, Victoria and the ACT, with Australia’s rising rent prices playing a role.Renters unable to pay off their final weeks of rent have grown more likely to ask landlords to take the money out of the deposit, Bloye said.“We’ve got the most expensive rental market in living memory, and so we’re seeing more and more renters fall behind on rent, [which] perhaps explains the rising claims against renters’ bonds,” he said.NSW data indicates long-term tenants who have leased a home for three or more years are facing particularly significant pressure: just 11,000 long-term bonds were fully withheld from tenants in 2021 but that rose to over 15,000 in the year to June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Outer-western suburbs Camden and Penrith have faced severe deterioration in bond loss, while Fairfield records double the average rate.“People are discouraged from challenging, and even if [a claim] is completely off the wall, it’s rational to acquiesce because you’re trying to protect your future renting,” Patterson Ross said.InQueensland, where bond claim reasons are reported, one in five claims are made over unpaid rent, but another fifth are made for cleaning and yet another fifth for repairs, according to the state’s residential tenancies authority (RTA).However, bond payouts have surged in the sunshine state, with the share of full refunds rising from 50% to nearly 60% and the share of bonds lost completely falling from 20% to 15%, from mid-2018 to mid-2025.Queensland’s tenants union points to renters’ increasing willingness to dispute bonds, as people like Tow take their landlords and agents to local tribunals and demand accountability.Tenant-landlord disputes, most of which are bond-related, rose from fewer than 20,000 a year in mid-2020 to more than 23,000 in the year to June, RTA data showed. NSW data indicates disputes have fallen in 2025.Making it easier for tenants around the country to dispute claims could be the answer, Patterson Ross said.“[Landlords] should have to provide the evidence and apply to the tribunal, paying the fees and making that effort, rather than making the tenant do it … so only claims that are actually legitimate would make it to that level,” he said.“We need to move a lot of the burden of enforcing the law away from tenants … These people aren’t coming together on equal footing.”Explore more on these topicsRentingHousingVictoriaNew South WalesQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was released from jail after an investigation did not produce enough evidence to support a charge over Madeleine’s disappearance under German law.Rowley, theMetropolitan policecommissioner, said: “They’ve got to a particular point in their inquiry where the prosecutor doesn’t feel they’re able to prosecute. We’re now at a stage where he remains a suspect for us. We’re taking stock.“The Germans have done everything they possibly can do within their law. He has a track record for very serious offences. He remains a suspect in our investigation into Madeleine McCann being missing.”Asked if Brückner could be extradited to face trial in the UK, Rowley said that an offence as serious as murder need not be tried in the country where the crime took place.Rowley, Britain’s most senior police officer, said: “There are hundreds of questions. One of the reasons we are involved is that murder is in many situations extraterritorial and potentially a murder of a British subject can in certain circumstances be charged in the UK.“There’s lots of maybes, so at the moment we are taking stock with the Germans and Portuguese.”Brückner denies any blame for the disappearance of Madeleine, whose family are from Leicestershire. It emerged earlier this week that he hadrefused a request from the Metto interview him over the case.The Met says it will continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry and that its investigation is continuing.The former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, Nick Vamos, said: “Yes, it is feasible. The main obstacle is you need enough evidence to charge before you can extradite.”Rowley oversaw British police efforts to resolve the case of Madeleine’s disappearance early in his career at the Met. He said a previous appeal involving British police had led to Brückner being identified as a suspect, which led to German police joining the investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said under his tenure the Met had carried out the biggest ever purge of corrupt and failing officers and staff in British policing history, ousting 1,400 people.He said corrupt cliques still existed and more attention would be put on them as the legacy of bad officers was cleared out.His comments came after revelations last week about Charing Cross police station, whereallegations of excessive force, racism and misogynycame to light not as a result of the Met’s efforts, but because of a media investigation.Nine officers have been suspended and others moved in what Rowley said was another sign of the force’s determination to root out wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsMadeleine McCannMetropolitan policePoliceGermanyPortugalMark RowleyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Police believe the body is that of Daniel but formal identification must await DNA analysis.Specialist teams and a cadaver dog began the search on 1 September after authorities became aware that the child was missing.The case has put renewed scrutiny on child welfare services after it emerged Daniel had been missing for four years without authorities knowing. Another child, Kyran Durnin, disappeared in 2022 but was not noticed by authorities until August last year.The alarm was first raised over Daniel in late August when the department of social protection alerted Ireland’s child and family agency, Tusla, to irregularities in an application for child support payments. Tusla alerted the police, who made house-to-house inquiries at the Gallery apartment complex in Dublin where Daniel had previously lived, before launching what turned into a 17-day search of open ground.Police urged anyone with relevant information to come forward and appealed to the public to beware “speculation, rumours and theories” about what happened to Daniel. “An Garda Síochána appeals to all members of the public to independently verify any information that you are reading on social media and/or messaging apps,” said a statement.The children’s minister, Norma Foley, said the death of a child was always heartbreaking and upsetting. “But it is especially so for those who knew and loved this child. I extend my very sincere sympathy to all involved.”Tusla confirmed earlier this month it had been in contact with Daniel and his parents in 2020. The agency arranged foster care for the boy but his parents then decided to keep him, leading to Tusla closing the case.The case has been referred to the independent National Review Panel for investigation and the government has instructed Tusla to undertake “wellbeing checks” on other cases closed during the pandemic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police took the unusual step of opening a murder investigation even though no body has been found.Simon Harris, who was taoiseach when the disappearance was noticed,called the case deeply disturbing. “For any of us as a human being, for any of us parents, to think that a child can effectively disappear and go unnoticed … is utterly heartbreaking and clearly something went extraordinarily wrong here.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Cleaning staff detected the break-in later that day and museum teams saw that four to six pieces of gold were missing.The thieves are believed to have used an angle grinder and blowtorch to force their way into the riverside museum that sits on the edge of Paris’s Jardin des Plantes. It is an unprecedented theft from the high-security museum.A museum spokesperson said thieves took “several specimens of native gold from the national collections held by the museum”. The spokesperson added: “While the stolen specimens are valued at around €600,000 based on the price of raw gold, they nevertheless carry an immeasurable heritage value. The museum laments this inestimable loss for research, heritage and for a collection accessible to the public.”Native gold is a metal alloy containing gold and silver in their natural, unrefined form.The museum’s director, Emmanuel Skoulios, told BFMTV: “We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment. It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items. Beyond the material value, for the museum this is above all about pieces in the national collection whose historic, scientific and heritage value is incalculable.”View image in fullscreenA case in the geology and mineralogy gallery in the French natural history museum.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe museum’s mineralogy gallery remained closed on Wednesday while the organised crime unit of Paris’s judicial police led an investigation. Security was increased at the museum and staff were checking the collection for other losses.One of the museum’s treasures, according to its website, is a native gold and quartz sample measuring 9cm by 8.5cm that originated in the Donatia mine in California and was donated by a wealthy French collector.Earlier this month the Adrien-Dubouché National Museum in Limoges, central France, wasbroken intoand thieves took three objects worth a total of more than €6.5m and classed as “national treasures” in France. They were two 14th- and 15th-century China porcelain plates and an 18th-century China porcelain vase.The mayor of Limoges, Émile Roger Lombertie, told Agence France-Presse on the day the robbery was discovered: “Criminality is increasing, we always have to be one step ahead. All the great museums of the world have had pieces stolen at one time or another. It is seemingly collectors giving orders to established criminal gangs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection.The next day, jewellery valued at several million euros was stolen in an armed robbery at around 4pm at the Hiéron Museum in Saône-et-Loire in central France.Themost notoriousmuseum heist of recent times occurred at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris in May 2010. Vjeran Tomic, nicknamed Spider-Man, made off with masterpieces by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Amedeo Modigliani valued at more than €100m.The case revealed extraordinary security lapses at the museum, including that motion-detection alarms had been out of order for two months, and three guards failed to spot Tomic, who in 2017 wassentencedto eight years in prison.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Since last week, the propaganda potential of theconservative US activist’s killinghas escaped none of them.Kirk, a rising star of Donald Trump’s Maga movement, washit in the neck by a single bulletas he addressed students in Utah on 10 September. A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson,has been charged, but his alleged motives remain unclear.But that has not stopped far-right figureheads from across the continentseizing on the killingto attack “the left”, presenting Kirk’s death as the logical conclusion of what they portray as a long-running hate campaign aimed at silencing them.“We must stop the hate-mongering left!”said Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Santiago Abascal of Spain’s Vox went further: “Censorship isn’t enough for them – so they resort to murder.”For Jordan Bardella of France’s far-right National Rally(RN), the “dehumanising rhetoric of the left and its intolerance … fuels political violence”. Alice Weidel of Germany’s AfD said Kirk had been shot by “a fanatic who hates our way of life”.The objective, experts say, is to raise Kirk to the status of a martyr to the conservative cause, and a victim of liberal-progressive persecution – simultaneously lending greater legitimacy to the right’s positions, and inflicting damage on the left.“Martyrdom is a social operation to transform a morally and socially unacceptable act of violence into a narrative,” historianPierre-Marie Delpu told Le Monde. “Here, the far right is constructing a plot and a persecution, with one executioner: the left.”Some on Europe’s far rightwere disarmingly open about the business of capitalising on the killing. “We should not be ashamed of ‘politicising [Kirk’s] death’ – or putting a tragedy to good use,” urged Damien Rieu, an adviser to Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal.In the European parliament, the ultranationalist Europe of Sovereign Nations group, which includes AfD and France’s Reconquête, nominated Kirk for the Sakharov prize, awarded annually for “the defence of human rights and fundamental liberties”.Mobilising the baseView image in fullscreenA tribute to Charlie Kirk at Vox’s Europa Viva convention in Madrid.Photograph: Luis Soto/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockAt a far-right gathering hosted by Vox in Madrid last weekend, a stirring video tribute to Kirk wowed the audience. To loud cheers,Abascal toldan estimated 8,500 people that the left “do not kill us for being fascists – they call us fascists in order to kill us”.André Ventura of Portugal’s Chega saidthe killing showed “arguing over ideas” had given way to “hatred, persecution and murder”. Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, told the rallythat Kirk’s “sacrifice … shows us once again which side the violence and intolerance are on … We will continue to fight tirelessly for our people’s freedom.”In London, the 110,000 to 150,000 people who attended Tommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” protest on Saturday – including far-right figures from France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Germany –held a minute’s silence for their hero.A continent on the marchThis all might matter less if Europe’s far right were not already on the march. Populist and far-right parties are in government in Italy, Hungary, Belgium and Slovakia, and the most popular parties in France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Spain, Vox is surging in the polls and in Portugal, Chega is in the lead ahead of local elections.In German regional elections in North Rhine-Westphalia last Saturday, AfD was well beaten by chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right CDU and his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners – but the far-right party succeeded in almost tripling its vote.More insidiously, hardline far-right policies – on immigration, Islam, the green agenda, EU integration, traditional values – arebecoming normalised across Europeas mainstream parties ape them in a vain attempt to maintain their vote shares.Holding the lineIna passionate op-ed for Le Monde, the French MEP and former European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau – who received death threats after objecting to the far right’s calls for a minute’s silence for Kirk – said that while Kirk’s killing was an abomination, he had “glorified racial segregation and slavery, demanded women return to the home, demonised homosexuality, blamed Jews for promoting immigration … and compared abortion to the Holocaust”.She was, she said, the only one of 720 MEPs “to speak out and demand that a distinction be made between the unanimous condemnation we should all express in the face of a man’s assassination, and the refusal to endorse his ideas”.In the present circumstances, Loiseau said, resisting the concerted call for Kirk’s martyrdom – “keeping our heads, remaining true to what we are” – is of paramount importance.Because “it is not respect for the dead they demand; it’s the right to insult and hate the living who do not resemble them … It is not freedom of speech they defend, it is the normalisation of their extremism.

According to the Times, Starmer has held off on formally announcing the UK will recognise a Palestinian state until after Trump leaves for fear it could dominate a Thursday news conference the two men plan to hold at Chequers.Meeting with Keir Starmer was ‘tough’, says Israeli presidentRead moreThe prime minister has found himself at odds with the US administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state. However, other nations including France, Australia and Canada have said they plan to take the same step at the UN gathering.In July, Starmer announced he would recognise Palestine’s statehood after mounting pressure from Labour MPs over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. But the Labour leader suggested British recognition was conditional and he would refrain if Israel committed to a ceasefire and long-term sustainable peace that delivers a two-state solution, and allow the UN to restart the supply of aid.All three conditions are, however, unlikely to be met given the Israeli government opposes these terms. Israeli forces are undertaking a major ground offensive in Gaza, with thousands forced to flee in recent days.The state of Palestine is already recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.Starmer condemns Israel’s airstrike on Qatar as No 10 denies prior knowledge of attackRead moreElsewhere, Sadiq Khan has for the first time described the situation in Gaza as a “genocide”. The mayor of London told an audience at a people’s question time event on Wednesday: “I think what’s happening in Gaza is a genocide.“When I see the images of the children starving – 20,000 children have starved because of the policies of the Israeli government – when I see the health system in Gaza collapsed, when I see the lack of supplies reaching people in need, when I see the famine that is manmade, when I read the interim judgment of the ICJ, and then see a UN commission report this week, I think it’s inescapable to draw the conclusion in Gaza we are seeing before our very eyes a genocide.”On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said it had reasonable grounds to conclude Israel wascommitting a genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza.Israel’s foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as “distorted and false”.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Starting with the 2026 budget, this pathetic ceremony will no longer be funded by taxpayers’ money. Under my watch, Israeli citizens will not pay from their pockets for a ceremony that spits in the faces of our heroic soldiers.”The Sea, which automatically becomes Israel’s entry for the best international film Oscar, was written and directed by Shai Carmeli-Pollak. It stars Muhammad Gazawi as Khaled, a Palestinian boy who goes on a school trip to Tel Aviv to visit the beach for the first time but is denied entry at the border and embarks on a dangerous journey to sneak into the country. Gazawi, 13, won the Ophir for best actor, while co-star Khalifa Natour won best supporting actor. The awards are voted for by members of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.It is not clear, however, if Zohar can carry through with his threat:according to the Jerusalem Post, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel is investigating whether the culture ministry has the jurisdiction to pull funding from the awards.Zohar has a history of confronting Israel’s film industry: in February he introduceda bill to reform film fundingby pushing government money towards commercially successful productions, and said that theOscar-winning documentary No Other Landwas “sabotage against the state of Israel”.Variety reportedthat The Sea’s Palestinian producer Baher Agbariya received the award with a plea for equality and tolerance, saying: “This film was born from love for humanity and cinema, and its message is one – the right of every child to live and dream in peace, without siege, without fear, and without war.” Protests against the war in Gaza were much in evidence at the ceremony, with participants wearing T-shirts bearing messages such as “a child is a child” and “end the war”.Agbariya also thanked the Israel Film Fund for supporting the film.Veteran director Uri Barbash, best known for the 1984 prison drama Beyond the Walls, was given a lifetime achievement award, and also called for an end to the war in his acceptance speech, saying. “It is our sacred duty to return all the kidnapped to the bosom of their families, and immediately, to end the damned war and replace the ‘divide and rule’ regime that declared war on Israeli society.”Responding to Zohar’s statement, Assaf Amir, chair of Israeli Academy of Film and Television, said: “In the face of the Israeli government’s attacks on Israeli cinema and culture, and the calls from parts of the international film community to boycott us, the selection of The Sea is a powerful and resounding response.”The controversy follows a pledge signed by over3,000 international film industry figuresto boycott Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. Olivia Colman, Javier Bardem, Riz Ahmed and Emma Stone were among the high-profile actors and film-makers to put their name to the letter.Representatives of the Israeli film industry called the boycott “deeply troubling”, with Nadav Ben Simon, chairman of the Israeli screenwriters’ guild, saying: “Over the years, we have also collaborated with Palestinian colleagues on films, series, and documentaries that seek to encourage dialogue, mutual understanding, peace and an end to violence … [Boycotts] do not advance the cause of peace. Instead, they harm precisely those who are committed to fostering dialogue and building bridges between peoples.”Hollywood studio Paramount issued a statementon Saturday criticising the boycott, saying: “We do not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli film-makers. Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace.”Explore more on these topicsFilmIsraelAwards and prizesPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel claims the buildings were being used byHamasfor surveillance.On Tuesday nightGazaCity’s al-Rantisi children’s hospital was hit. According to the Gaza health ministry, half the hospital’s 80 patients managed to flee the building but the rest, including four children in intensive care and eight premature babies, remained.Overnight strikes killed 16 people, according to local hospitals, bringing the total Palestinian death toll in two years of war to 65,000. On Tuesday, a UN human rights commissionpublished a reportconcluding that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza.The coast road leading south from Gaza City has been packed with families trying to flee the offensive. On Wednesday, the IDF announced the opening of a second route, through the middle of the Gaza Strip, for two days to try to encourage the exodus.1:06Israeli army drops evacuation leaflets over Gaza City as civilians flee – videoHowever, many residents of Gaza City and the rest of the north are very unlikely to have received any of the text messages or social media posts put out by the IDF because strikes in the region have damaged the telephone network.Of the million Palestinians living in and around Gaza City, the Israeli military estimates 350,000 people have left and moved south over the past month. The UN estimate is 238,000, including about 50,000 in the last 48 hours.The United Nations voiced grave concerns on Wednesday about food and other supplies running out in northern Gaza, where many are already experiencing famine, after Israel closed the only crossing there last week.“There are grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion in a matter of days as there are now no direct aid entry points into northern Gaza and resupply from south to north is increasingly challenging due to mounting road congestion and insecurity,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement.1:12Gaza City residents unable to leave as Israel strikes residential building – videoContrary to Israeli claims, none of the Palestinians interviewed by the Guardian in recent weeks have said they came under pressure from Hamas to stay in the city. Many residents said they had been unable or reluctant to leave formultiple other reasons.Some are physically unable to move, weakened by many months of near starvation, and some cannot afford the costs of transport or the price of a rudimentary plastic sheeting tent at their destination.If Labour admitted there is a genocide in Gaza, it would have to admit its own hand in it | Owen JonesRead moreVery many consider the south to be as dangerous as Gaza City. Israel has frequently bombed the “humanitarian zone” it established at al-Mawasi. The sprawling camp there was hit by an Israeli strike overnight, killing two parents and their child.Many Israeli security officials, including the IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, have privately questioned the wisdom of the offensive, in terms of its human cost and because they think there is little chance it will achieve its stated goal of the total destruction of Hamas.There have been no security checks of the mass of people fleeing south, so most observers believe it probable that Hamas militants will regroup elsewhere. IDF officials have estimated there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters ready for battle in the city centre, but IDF intelligence estimates suggest that is only a small fraction of their surviving forces.Many Israeli observers and commentators believe the real motives for the offensive are political: to keep Israel in a state of war so as to fend off early elections in which Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-right coalition could be unseated, and to make Gaza City uninhabitable so as to put pressure on Palestinians to leave and for other countries to receive them.Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that administers access to Gaza, on Wednesday issued advice to Palestinians in the territory who wanted to leave.Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister,described Gazaas a “real estate bonanza” on Wednesday, Hebrew media reported.Speaking a property development conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said he was talking to “the Americans” and that “the demolition, the first stage in the city’s renewal, we have already done.

The president and his wife, Melania, were treated to the full array of British pageantry.“The bond of kinship and identity between America and the United Kingdom is priceless and eternal. It’s irreplaceable and unbreakable,” Trump said in a speech during a lavish banquet at Windsor Castle.Referring to the so-called special relationship between the US and Britain, Trump said: “Seen from American eyes, the word special does not begin to do it justice.”Trump’s speech will be music to the ears of the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, who proffered a state visit to win favour with Trump, a well-known anglophile and overt royal fan.Starmer hopes the trip will aid his government as it seeks to deepen economic ties,secure billions of dollars of investment, ease tariffs and allow him to press the president on Ukraine and Israel.View image in fullscreenAbove: Donald Trump stands between the Princess of Wales and King Charles, during a toast at the state banquet.Right: Place settings at the banquet table in St George’s Hall, Windsor Castle.Photograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Aaron Chown/ReutersBritain rolled out the royal red carpet, giving Trump the largest military ceremonial welcome for a state visit in living memory. Trump made little secret of his delight at being not just the first US leader but the first elected politician to be invited for two state visits.“This is truly one of the highest honours of my life,” the president said.As the president dined on watercress panna cotta and chicken ballotine, one guest at the banquet came as an apparent surprise to onlookers.Rupert Murdoch, who Trump sued – along with his Wall Street Journal newspaper -over the publication of an article about him and the late Jeffrey Epstein, was on the guest list, which had been drawn up jointly by the British government and the White House.Murdoch, whose media business has long made him a kingmaker in British politics, was spotted mingling with other guests but was sat far along the huge table from the US president.View image in fullscreenRupert Murdoch arrives a the Windsor Castle banquet.Photograph: Evan Vucci/AFP/Getty ImagesThe other guests were more conventional, including Prince William and his wife, Catherine, and Trump’s daughter Tiffany and her husband.Several US tech CEOs were also at the dinner, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Open AI’s Sam Altman, reflecting the billions in tech deals going down during the visit.Over the course of the visit, Britain is hoping to convert Trump’s affection for Britain – his mother came from Scotland – and admiration for the royals into concrete actions. Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI havealready pledged $42bn in British investmentsover the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy.Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to guard against the worst of his tariff hikes. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon.“The United Kingdom was your partner in the first trade deal of your administration, Mr President, bringing jobs and growth to both our countries,” King Charles said in his speech. “And no doubt we can go even further as we build this new era of our partnership.” But while Starmer is banking on the royals to help cajole the president, pitfalls remain.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators holding placards and Trump baby blimps take part in a protest march through central London.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesPolls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain, and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show his royal trump card can reap benefits.While there were some Trump supporters in crowds at Windsor outside London,several thousand people marched to protest against the state visit. The Metropolitan police estimated that there were about 5,000 people at the protest, which culminated in a rally in front of parliament.Wednesday was all about ceremony; Trump and Melania joined Charles, Queen Camilla and other royals and dignitaries for a carriage procession, with the route lined by 1,300 British service personnel.Later, the Trumps viewed historical items from the royal collection relating to the US, and then visited St George’s Chapel, the final resting place of Queen Elizabeth, who hosted Trump for his first state visit in 2019, to lay a wreath on her tomb. She died in September 2022.The focus on Thursday will turn to geopolitics and trade when Starmer hosts Trump at his Chequers country residence.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKing Charles IIIKeir StarmerMonarchyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Each fully qualified GP costs £430,540 to train during the years of their undergraduate and postgraduate education, the researchers say.The study says: “The gap between GMC-licensed and NHS general practice GPs in 2024 represented an estimated £8.6bn investment in training by headcount and £13.1bn by full-time equivalent GPs lost from NHS general practice, although this figure will be less for the UK after adjusting for [the presence of] international medical graduates.”The findings tally withresearch published last month by the GMC, which regulates doctors in the UK. It has found big increases over recent years in the number of GPs planning to either move abroad, work privately or leave the medical profession altogether.For example, the proportion of GPs across the UK who said they were likely to move abroad to practice medicine more than doubled from 10% in 2020 to 21% last year.Similarly, the percentage who said they were likely to either start working privately or increase the amount of time they spent working as a private GP rose from 23% in 2019 to 29% in 2024 – more than the trend among doctors overall, of whom 23% said they were planning that switch.And the proportion who have taken “hard steps” to leave the UK medical profession completely, such as contacting a recruiter, applying for non-clinical roles or begun moves to retire, soared from 4% in 2019 to 15% in 2024.Female GPs, especially those aged 30-49, younger GPs and those in London and the south-east are most likely to quit, the study of official NHS workforce data found.Deepening GP disengagement from the NHS threatens the government’s plans to move a lot of care out of hospitals into the community and create new “neighbourhood health services”, the researcher added.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the findings reflected the fact that, despite record numbers of newly-qualified doctors starting GP training in England in recent years, the NHS’s inability to retain family doctors meant that new recruits were “pouring into a leaking bucket”.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, should focus more on helping to improve retention of GPs in the NHS than on expanding their numbers through his forthcoming revamp of the NHS’s long term workforce plan, she said.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment directly on the findings.“We are making progress to reverse more than a decade of neglect in primary care , recruiting more than 2,000 extra GPs in the past year, delivering a record £1bn boost and funding vital upgrades to surgeries, as well as cutting red tape so doctors can spend more time caring for patients.“July 2025 saw the highest ever headcount of fully qualified GPs and patient satisfaction with GP services is rising.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthGPsDoctorsEnglandHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

That was on top of £10bn the company committed to an artificial intelligence datacentre earlier this year.Other announcements include £3.9bn from the investment firm Prologis and £1.5bn from the tech company Palantir. The government said the package would create 7,600 high-quality jobs in sectors including clean energy and life sciences.Starmer said that “with friends like the US” the UK could “help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off”, adding: “These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious and ready to lead.”Downing Street sources said the £150bn of inward investment was higher than the figure for the whole of last year and that the prime minister was feeling “very upbeat” because it exceeded expectations.The announcement followed a separate pledge of billions of pounds of investment from US tech firms, including from Microsoft, which has announceda $30bn (£22bn) spending package– its largest ever outside the US.0:40Thousands of demonstrators protest against Trump state visit – videoBut the careful choreography was dealt a blow on Wednesday when Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who held one of the most senior roles at Meta until earlier this year, described the US-UK tech deal as“sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”.Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said of the US tech companies: “These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway. They’re building datacentres all over the world.“Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal, which is basically just sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”Critics have argued that the tech deal, due to be finalised at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat with Trump on Thursday, does little to support the UK’s homegrown tech industry and have questioned what concessions the government might give US tech companies on regulation and tax.View image in fullscreenQueen Camilla, King Charles, Donald Trump and Melania Trump pose at the state banquet.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAfter landing by helicopter in Windsor Castle’s grounds on Wednesday morning, Trump joined the king in a horse-drawn carriage but the procession remained within the royal estate and out of the reach of the public, with security concerns given as an explanation.The president and his wife, Melania, were later hosted by Charles at a lavish state banquet inside Windsor Castle on Wednesday alongside several top business executives including Apple’s Tim Cook, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.They were served Hampshire watercress panna cotta with parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, followed by Norfolk chicken ballotine and a vanilla ice-cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached victoria plums.A whisky sour cocktail garnished with a toasted marshmallow set on a star-shaped biscuit “evoking the warmth of a fireside S’more” was served, although Trump does not drink alcohol.During his speech the king emphasised the importance of protecting the environment, saying the legacy of both nations over the “next 250 years and beyond” was to ensure future generations can experience “natural treasures”.Trump, meanwhile, used his speech to pay a heartfelt tribute to the US’s relationship with the UK, saying the “word ‘special’ does not begin to do it justice”.The US leader also heaped praise on the king, describing his as a “very, very special man”. He went on to say: “We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny. We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The president came to Britain because he “wants to feel like a king”, Bragg claimed.The comedian Nish Kumar launched a blow-up ball with the vice-president JD Vance’s face on it into the crowd. “Donald Trump is a lightning rod [for] white supremacist groups and racists around the world,” he said.Every effort was put on to impress Trump in Windsor but a flypast of F-35 jets above Windsor Castle had to be cancelled due to poor weather and at times the president appeared bored.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer has come under fire for inviting Trump on a second state visit.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianTrump laid a wreath at the late Queen Elizabeth’s tomb inside St George’s Chapel and he was given a tour with his wife that included Henry VIII’s burial vault and a memorial plate in honour of Sir Winston Churchill. “This was a great honour,” the president said.Trump and his wife also joined the king and queen to inspect artefacts pertaining to British-American relations.“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents about US independence. “That’s fascinating,” said Charles as he pointed out another table, detailing the transatlantic cable used for communication between the two countries. Trump agreed: “That’s so amazing.”Members of the royal family joined the US president for lunch in the state dining room along with the new interim ambassador to the US, James Roscoe, and Trump’s entourage.The president and the king chatted amiably throughout the day but Trump appeared to breach an unofficial protocol by twice touching the monarch’s back.On Wednesday, YouGov released newpollingthat suggested that more than half of Britons think the Trump presidency has been bad for the UK. Fewer than one person in 10 thinks it has been good.Britons were said to be fairly evenly divided between those who think Starmer has been too positive towards Trump (30%) and those who think he has got the balance right (27%), the poll suggests.To mark his second state visit, Starmer will give Trump a bespoke ministerial red box adorned with the presidential seal and title. The first lady will receive a colourful silk scarf based on artwork created by Ukrainian children, in a nod to her work raising awareness of their plight. The Trumps will receive the gifts during their visit to Chequers on Thursday.Two people were arrested in Windsor over public order incidents linked to Trump’s visit, Thames Valley police said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerTrade policyEconomicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Metropolitan police estimated 5,000 people attended the anti-Trumprallyin Parliament Square, denouncing the US president as a “fascist”. There were other protests allacrossthe country.Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is now an independent MP, also congratulated the four activistsarrestedby police after pictures of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle last night. “There’s something very sinister about our times when peaceful protest becomes terrorism: when an ad van going around Windsor Castle perfectly legally is then stopped by the police, taken away, and those people prevented from expressing a point of view,” he said.King Charles and Trump lauded each other in brief remarks made before a lavish state banquet, where US and UK cabinet members are dining alongside tech and media bosses, along with eight members of the royal family. The king mostly emphasised the shared history and culture between the UK and US, and Trump also stuck to the script, striking a gracious and sombre tone.Notably, the only causes the king mentioned by name were efforts to supportUkraine, enhance thetradingrelationshipand protect theenvironment(Trump is a threat to all three). He praised Trump’s efforts to finding solutions to conflicts around the world, and the US president in return heaped praise and gratitude on Charles for his second state visit.Elements of Trump’s brief remarks were characteristically self-congratulatory, but for the most part he stressed the close bond between the two countries, even declaring “the word special does not begin to do it justice”. That will no doubt be a huge relief for the British political establishment, giving the *awkward* timing of this visit.ShareUpdated at17.07 EDT"

In 2021, California’s poverty rate reached a historic low of 11%, but as pandemic-era policies came to an end, rates surged in the state and across the US, according to the report from theCalifornia Budget and Policy Centerreleased last week.The research and analysis non-profit found that poverty rates in California remained “statistically unchanged” from 2023 levels, and that people of color, renters and children were among the most affected. Child poverty in the state has more than doubled since 2021.“These figures reflect a troubling trend that began with the rollback of historic anti-poverty investments that were created to mitigate the harm of the Covid-19 pandemic – underscoring that poverty is a policy choice,” the report states, adding that policies such as the federal child tax credit were associated with a historic decline in poverty.“When Congress allowed these effective policies to expire, they immediately reversed progress, causing the largest increase in the national poverty rate in 50 years, and a significant spike in California’s poverty rate.”California made significant investments during the pandemic and enacted temporary economic protections for residents, including providing motel rooms to unhoused people, an eviction moratorium and rental assistance. But poverty in the state rose as those programs came to an end.Now cuts at the federal and state levels are likely to cause poverty rates to rise further, the report states. The authors point toDonald Trump’s federal budget, signed into law earlier this year, which will cut healthcare, food assistance and other support for millions of people, as well as a state budget that includes “significant reductions” in healthcare. Experts have warned Trump’s budget will have a major impact on the country’s social safety net, anddescribedit as the “harshest bill we’ve ever seen since budget deficits became an issue 40 years ago”.The report calls for “bold action” from state leaders, including implementing a graduated corporate tax rate and ending some corporate tax breaks, among other recommendations.“For California to be a state for all to thrive – regardless of race or ethnicity, gender, and other identities – state leaders should take bold action to mitigate the rise in poverty and present a different vision for California than the one the federal government has put forth in recent months,” the report stated.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPovertySocial exclusionWest CoastLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement cited by local news outlets, Seals said his office conducted a preliminary examination and concluded the student did not suffer any lacerations, contusions, compound fractures, broken bones or injuries consistent with an assault.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the decision is unlikely to satisfy Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for acting “too late” and called for a far bigger cut.“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” Fed chairJerome Powellsaid during a closely watched press conference. At the same time, he warned, inflation has picked up.It is “reasonable” to expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to “a one-time shift” in prices, Powell suggested. “But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,” he said. “Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”Last month,Trump moved to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, claiming she committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary resident on mortgage applications. But Cook has denied wrongdoing, and insisted the president has no authority to remove her.A federal judge and an appeals court haveblockedTrump from removing Cook from her post, though the White House has appealed to thesupreme court.Fed rate line chartAmid the fiasco, a separate Biden-appointed Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, suddenly resigned from her post in August. Republicans quickly moved to replace her with Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. The SenateconfirmedMiran on Monday.Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting”.The dilemma for the Fed is that loweringinterest rateswill make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during hisspeechat the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.At the same time,Trump’s tariffshave caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Labestimatesthat tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “stagflation”.For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget OfficetoldCNBC on Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump tariffsShareReuse this content"

In August, the bureau revised down initial figures that showed steady job growth in May and June by 258,000. Hours after the release, TrumpfiredMcEntarfer, claiming without evidence that the “jobs numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”.It was the first time a president had fired the head of the data bureau, and it left many economists shaken by what the future of the nonpartisan bureau could look like. Trump has sincenominated EJ Antoni, chief economist at the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation and a co-author of Project 2025, in addition to a vocal critic of BLS, as McEntarfer’s replacement.Antoni has not yet been confirmed by Congress. William Wiatrowski, a longtime official within the bureau, is currently serving as acting commissioner.Conservatives join backlash over Trump pick for head of labor statistics: ‘Not a credible source of information’Read moreMcEntarfer, speaking at Bard College, said that although she trusts Wiatrowski, she is concerned about the future of the bureau.“Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like has serious economic consequences,” she said,notingthat the collection of countries that have gone down a similar route, including Argentina, Greece and Turkey, is “not a good list”.“The resulting loss of trust in economics statistics led these countries to worsening economic crises, higher inflation and higher borrowing costs,” McEntarfer said.Even before her firing, McEntarfer said she was prepared to lead the bureau toward modernizing its data collection. But the bureau’s funding dried up, particularly once Trump entered office. Under cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, the bureau’s staff fell 20% since January after hiring freezes and delayed onboarding.McEntarfer said that, once Musk left the White House, she was hoping that the bureau could “return to some sense of normalcy”.But when July’s jobs report was published, McEntarfer said a journalist reached out to her for comment about Trump’s social media post that said he was firing McEntarfer. At first, she didn’t take it seriously, but then she soon got a short email from the White House announcing her termination.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under that law, Fed governors may be removed by a president only “for cause”, though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal. No president has ever removed a Fed governor, and the law has never been tested in court. Trump has sought to remove her for cause, citing the alleged fraud.A US appeals court on Mondaydeclinedto allow Trump to fire her. The White House has said it will appeal the decision to the US supreme court. Trump’s justice department also has launched a criminal mortgage fraud inquiry into Cook, issuing grand jury subpoenas in Georgia and Michigan, Reuters previously reported.A loan estimate for an Atlanta home purchased by Cook showed that she had declared the property as a “vacation home”, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. The property tax authority in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also said Cook had not broken rules for tax breaks on a home there that had been declared her primary residence.Bloomberg in its report on Wednesday pointed to similar but not identical pledges made by an attorney on Bessent’s behalf on 20 September 2007, agreeing to make a Bedford Hills, New York, house his “principal residence” over the next year as well as another house in Provincetown, Massachusetts.“There are people who think that President Trump is putting undue pressure on the Fed. And there are people like President Trump and myself who think that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, that this should be examined, and that they shouldn’t be serving as one of the nation’s leading financial regulators,” Bessent told Fox Business Network in an interview on 27 August.Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS politicsTrump administrationFederal ReserveUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Cohen said that, amid tensions with Unilever, the brand had tried to engineer a sale to investors at a fair market value of $1.5bn-$2.5bn (£1.1bn-£1.8bn) but the proposal was rejected.“The problem is that Unilever and Magnum don’t want to sell, so they are not allowing any of these potential investors to see the financials,” said Cohen.A spokesperson for TMICC said it would be “forever grateful” to Greenfield for his role co-founding the company, but that the business “disagreed with his perspective” and had sought to engage both co-founders in a “constructive conversation” on how to strengthen the brand.In May, Cohen was charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested whileprotesting against the Gaza blockadeduring aUS Senatehearing.Video footage recorded at the hearing andposted by Cohenon social media showed him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The meeting was the clearest indication yet that China is vying to become a world superpower, aiming to marshal an anti-western bloc. But the foundations of that position partly lie in Africa and the Caribbean, where China has been building relationships for decades.A stable partner or a trap?View image in fullscreenIconic modernist space … the Friendship Hall, on the banks of the river Nile.Photograph: Courtesy of Ahmed OsmanIt’s always odd to me to read about China as “rising” on the global stage. It seems a particularly western-centric view of a country that, as far as many Africans are concerned, had risen a long time ago. China’s cultural outreach was a feature of life in 1980s Sudan, where Chinese entertainment was broadcast on the only national TV channel. (I have a childhood recollection of a mesmeric dragon dance that never lost its dazzle, even though it was rebroadcast for years.)Political delegation trips from China were commonplace. They included school visits and performances at an iconic building namedFriendship Hall,a modernist event space on the banks of the River Nile. The venue, built by the Sudanese government in the early 1970s with financial assistance from China, launched the countries’ “friendship”. Its design was led by the then Shanghai Institute of Civic Architecture and it was built with the help of hundreds of Chinese workers.In hindsight, much of this outreach was political strategy. It was in the midst of the cold war, and China was forging anti-western links and colonial solidarity with newly independent countries. In a huge ramp up of its ambitions, China’s economy liberalised in the 1990s and its investment in Africa and theCaribbeanexploded.During that decade, trade between Africa and Chinagrew by a massive 700%, making it the continent’s largest single trading partner. In the decade after, the 2000s, China became one of the largest trading partners for several Caribbean countries, having been an early aid supporter for Guyana in the 1970s. By the 2010s, trade with China and Caribbean countrieswent from negligible to almost$10 bn annually.A glut of Chinese goodsView image in fullscreenThe default … a worker inspects a Tecno phone at Jagwal electronics market in Maiduguri, Nigeria.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhat that looked like on the ground across Africa and the Caribbean was a vast complex of Chinese investment: roads and infrastructure, healthcare facilities, residential compounds, and a glut of Chinese goods. It has long been the norm that Chinese consumer products, particularly domestic, are the default for many of these economies.I am particularly struck by the mass adoption of Chinese mobile phones in many African countries, where it is rare to find a Samsung or an iPhone outside the ranks of the upper middle classes. Three Chinese phonemakers – Tecno, Infinix and itel – are made only for sale in Africa, andmake up half of phone purchasesthere. Affordable and tailored to the African market (eg with the functionality to use multiple sim cards as users switch between different providers for cheaper bundles), these phones are symbolic of how the Chinese market adapts to target the region.In some instances, China is settling into the very infrastructure. Over the past decade, it has providedfree satellite dishesto thousands of homes in sub-Saharan Africa and, in a throwback to those days of cultural projection, included Chinese content dubbed in local languages in TV subscription packages. The very electricity powering those TVs is also, increasingly, China sourced.AndChinese solar panels have taken off in Africa, bought by people tired of expensive and unreliable grid electricity. The result is thateven in remoteand rural areas, solar panels sit on top of modest homes and shops, and in one instance I saw on the Kenyan coast, a braider’s kiosk.Unmatched domestic influenceskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Khartoum, Sudan, a boom in residential housing in the 00s drew in such a large number of Chinese construction workers that a dedicated housing complex on the outskirts of the city was built. In Nairobi, a gigantichighway completed four years agoand built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation transformed the Kenyan capital overnight, reducing snarling traffic. A similarhighway project was builtin Jamaica, connecting the north and south. China even built the headquarters of the African Union in Ethiopia. Chances are, in many locations in these regions, if there was a construction project, there were Chinese workers and supervisors in their helmets and hi-vis jackets at the helm.China’s belt and road initiative, which funds and executes such projects, sprawls across these two regions. The country is involved in everythingfrom affordable housingunits in Antigua and Barbudato luxury apartmentsin Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. So ubiquitous is China that many of these new skylines arebeginning to resemble those of Chinese cities.An asymmetrical relationship of power?View image in fullscreenPay the price … motorists drive through a Nairobi Expressway toll station in Westlands, Nairobi.Photograph: Zuma/AlamyChina’s success in cementing these industrial relationships is partly the result of a non-interventionist policy that does not bring with it any colonial or high-handed diktats on domestic politics or society. “China treats Africa as an equal,” said the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, last year, adding that the relationship was “based as much on mutual respect as on mutual interests”.There is also the sort of regime and policy continuity that comes from being a one-party state. Thesudden dismantling of USAIDunder the second Donald Trump administration, and how it left many African and Caribbean projects in the lurch, is a vivid example of how ideology and competing domestic forces can have an impact on foreign partners.But China’s attitude, deferential as it may be in terms of politics, is still accused of being exploitative. China’s epic economic ties are not purely for the accumulation of soft power. There is real benefit to China, as it can leverage the debt it extends to countries to build megaprojects, then gain control of strategic assets,expand into extracting raw materials,and trap countries in debt.Ultimately, China is transacting with poorer countries in an asymmetrical relationship of power. But as the US withdraws ever further from the world, the entrenchment of China in parts of it suddenly starts to look like a very large footprint. Whatever political era comes next for China on the world stage, it was built in the cities and villages of Africa and the Caribbean.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsChinaThe Long WaveChinese economyAfricaCaribbeanAsia PacificBelt and road initiativeAfrican UnionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

This is what everyone expects of Liverpool this season; the captain’s header was only their third latest decisive goal in five straight victories.Arne Slot’s side have won every Premier League game so far with goals scored after the 80th minute. Liverpool looked as if they wanted to do things differently in theChampions Leagueand were two goals ahead within six minutes thanks to Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah. If they thought they had done the business before anyone had broken a sweat, they were very much mistaken. Atlético’s goals came from an unlikely source in the full-back-cum-midfielder Marcos Llorente, who now has four Champions League goals at Anfield to his name.Simeone blames fan row after Liverpool winner on ‘getting insulted all game’Read moreThere was greater concern on the faces of supporters than at Burnley on Sunday but they know their team are masters in the art of going until the end. Van Dijk rose highest and powered the ball past Jan Oblak to test the foundations of the Kop and put their Champions League start on a par with their domestic form.Diego Simeone fumed at the referee within a split second of the net rippling for a fifth time. The Atlético head coach offered general frustration in the direction of Maurizio Mariani but there was no obvious evidence why he was upset. The Italian was not up for a debate and sent him off. Simeone should have been more annoyed about Alexander Sørloth heading over a glorious chance to equalise. The Argentinian then confronted a home supporter before being escorted down the tunnel by stewards. He said he was insulted on the touchline.Atlético had started aggressively, in a classic 4-4-2 formation. They wanted to frustrate and irritateLiverpoolbut that cunning plan headed down the Mersey in the fourth minute when Ryan Gravenberch was clumsily tripped on the edge of the box. Salah went with pure power from the free-kick and Robertson sprang a surprise when the ball ricocheted in off his calf.If luck and ferocity brought the opener, skill and guile made the second. The superb Gravenberch was once again at the centre of it, exchanging passes with Salah, ­laying the ball into the Egyptian’s path having bustled through the defence. ­Delicate touches got Salah into the perfect position to slot under Oblak. It felt like the job was done.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah fires past Jan Oblak to double Liverpool’s lead early on.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAtlético did not look in the same league as Liverpool, whose confidence grew as the passes fizzed between red shirts. Alexander Isak, the British record signing, made his Liverpool debut but it was Salah and Gravenberch who were at the heart of the hosts’ performance. Salah could have added two more before the break.Liverpool did not need help but Mariani tried to offer some by bizarrely witnessing a phantom handball by Clément Lenglet from Jeremie Frimpong’s ball into the box. A word in the ear and a check on the monitor forced the referee to overturn his original decision and return Simeone’s blood pressure to something closer to normal.There were glimmers of hope for Atlético, who threatened on the counter but without the injured Julián Alvarez they could not find anyone to convert their chances until Llorente popped up in first-half injury-time to reduce the deficit through a schoolyard toe-poke that when through Ibrahima Konaté’s legs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The centre-back was booked for his recklessness, while Isak was given treatment and a few moments of rest to get his breath back. He received a huge roar when he got to his feet; the fans are desperate for a heroic new No 9. He returned for the second half but looked tired and shook hands with his replacement Hugo Ekitiké in the 58th minute. The substitute’s task was to help finish the fixture as a contest but Liverpool struggled to test Oblak, with Salah’s shot against a post the closest they came to making it 3-1.Alexander Isak’s Liverpool debut provides box-office glamour despite the rust | Barney RonayRead moreWith one goal in it, Atlético offered energy in abundance. Their hard work paid off when Llorente, who moved into midfield, watched a looping ball land perfectly on his foot, allowing him to volley at goal from 20 yards. It was Atlético’s turn to enjoy some good fortune, as Alexis Mac Allister deflected the shot beyond Alisson to silence Anfield, apart from one small corner, who thought they were about to leave with a point.Liverpool, however, are not interested in giving up. When Dominik Szoboszlai stepped up to lift a late corner into the box, anticipation had been replaced with desperation but the emotional effort was rewarded by Van Dijk. Slot won his first seven Champions League games last season and with Galatasaray, Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, Inter and PSV to come before Christmas, this victory was vital to build momentum.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolAtlético Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This time she edged out compatriot Sandi Morris with a final successful leap at a season’s best 4.90m.Morris, a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, placed second on 4.85m, while Slovenia’s Tina Sutej took bronze at 4.80m. Morris has now finished second in four world championships, as she searches for her first outdoor world title.Jake Wightman pipped on line as Isaac Nader surges to 1500m World Championship goldRead moreThe 34-year-old Moon is the oldest woman to win a world championship pole vault title. She has said she has ambitions of competing in a home Olympics, at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, but admitted competing at the highest level is getting tougher.“They’re all special, but I think the older you get, it gets harder,” Moon said on Wednesday. “So to be able to come in here and not just win but to jump [4.90m], I don’t know how many years of that I’ve got in me.”Morris, meanwhile, said she had mixed feelings about another silver medal.“I’ve made it through injuries, I’ve overcome so much over the last few years, I’ve sacrificed so much just to get back to this place,” Morris said. “So, sure, it’s bittersweet, walking away with another silver. But there’s a lot worse things in the world than silver medals at the world championships.”View image in fullscreenKatie Moon clears the bat at 4.90m.Photograph: Paweł Kopczyński/APThe contest for gold looked to be between Moon and Morris from the early stages, the two Americans being alone in clearing the first three heights up to 4.75m on their first attempts. Only two others in the field eventually cleared the height.Morris gave Moon a run for her money in the absence of Australia’s Nina Kennedy, the Paris Olympic gold medallist who had pulled out days before the worlds due to a leg injury. Kennedy had shared the last world championship gold with Moon in Budapest.With the first four heights cleared at the first attempt, Moon got the first edge on Morris, only to have the tables turned when Morris raised the bar to 4.85m and cleared at the first attempt.After failing on her first attempt at that height, Moon went all or nothing by taking her next attempt at 4.90m, which she managed on her final attempt. Morris failed twice at 4.90m, and then with a last hail-mary attempt at 4.95m, to end up second yet again.Moon had an attempt at the 5.01m championship record set by Russia’s Yelena Isinbayeva in 2005, but ran through and decided to celebrate the win.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The weather was sticky and humid. The crowd at Chase Stadium was lively. And on the field, Lionel Messi assisted Jordi Alba, and vice-versa, in a 3-1 win for Inter Miami. That the victory came against the Seattle Sounders, the side that beat Miami in acontentious Leagues Cup finaltwo weeks ago, gave the squad a measure of revenge. But there are bigger factors at play.“It was important to regain positive feelings,” Miami head coach Javier Mascherano told reporters afterward.Indeed, between the Seattle game and a subsequent loss to Charlotte FC, Miami had not just suffered two consecutive shutout losses, but they were depleted due to injuries and suspensions (Luis Suárezdue to his antics in the Leagues Cup finaland Tomas Avilés for a red card against Charlotte). Inter Miami only had six players on the bench on Tuesday; two were 18-year-old academy products and another was 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti, who just arrived from Newell’s Old Boys.Despite this, Miami’s win pushed them to fifth in the Eastern Conference on 49 points – eight behind the leaders, Philadelphia Union. With three games in hand,Inter Miamistill have a chance at repeating last season’s achievement: finishing at the top of the East and winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield, given to the club with the best regular-season record.The ultimate goal, though, is altogether different: winMLSCup.New England Revolution fire head coach Caleb Porter after less than two seasonsRead moreThe league championship has been the most coveted objective for the Herons. There is an argument that winning the Concacaf Champions Cup is perhaps more prestigious due to its continental scale, or that the Shield is the trophy that most resembles league titles in most other competitions worldwide. But MLS Cup is the trophy that matters to the most important people: the fans. From Atlanta United’s tremendous victory in 2018 with Miguel Almirón and Josef Martínez to Carlos Vela, Gareth Bale and the Mexican-American euphoria with LAFC in 2022, and even going back to DC United’s inaugural victory in 1996, winning MLS Cup is an achievement that permeates across a club’s community and history.Naturally, every MLS team wants that title. The difference with Inter Miami is that the stakes are so much higher simply because they have Messi. With 46 trophies to his name, no one in the game has more silverware, and the pressure for him to win MLS Cup is less on him and more on the club as a whole to deliver a championship to add to that list.Because of his arrival and everything that has occurred since, Inter Miami are one of the biggest marketing attractions in the league, second in value to LAFC, per Forbes. According to research firm SponsorUnited, subscriptions to MLS’s Season Pass broadcast package on Apple TV more than doubled since Messi came to the league, and sponsorship revenue jumped 13% last year to $665m. Other clubs have also benefited. Sporting Kansas City, for example, hosted Inter Miami at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium in 2024, drawing a club record crowd of 72,610. In addition, Inter Miami’s new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, is set to open next year and there is hope that Messi will still be around to lead them into their new home.The Bundesliga’s deal with Mark Goldbridge is odd, and exactly what MLS is missing with AppleRead more“I previously said that my wish, my dream would be for the No 10 to inaugurate our new stadium in March,” Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas told ESPN this summer. “This is a decision that rests on Messi. We wish for Messi to finish his career here.”Yet at the time of writing, there has been no official word regarding the extension. The prospect of opening the stadium as MLS Cup champions will no doubt be enticing to Messi, though. He faced a similar dynamic after finally capturing the 2022 World Cup, when he could have retired from the national team at 34 years old but chose to continue playing with his country so he could do so as a world champion.Inter Miami have achieved much in the Messi era, including a points record in a Supporters’ Shield season in 2024 and a run to the round of 16 in the Club World Cup, which featured a 2-1 victory over FC Porto, making them the first Concacaf team to beat a Uefa side in official competition.MLS Cup, though, is an entirely different type of competition – the capstone to playoffs that are a season unto themselves, where results from the regular season don’t mean much aside from determining the matchups. Miami know this as well as anyone, having lost in the first round last year in one of themost shocking upsets in league history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The need to win with Inter Miami is becoming urgent. And some things will need to improve.To maximize their chances of success, Miami must deliver a more consistent tone, both in the playing of the game and the mentality with which they approach it. Suárez’s conduct in the Leagues Cup final doesn’t help things, and he’s not the only one who has had disciplinary issues. Out of 30 clubs, Inter Miami are ninth in the disciplinary standings but with far fewer matches played. Mascherano manages as he used to play – aggressively – and that can be both a strength and a weakness.There’s little doubt that Inter Miami will make the playoffs, and there’s also a chance that the club can top the East again as their remaining matches – aside from Nashville SC on the final day of the season – are against teams in lower positions.But that’s not the goal. The Philadelphia Union, FC Cincinnati, Charlotte FC and Florida rivals Orlando City are among the teams standing in Miami’s way in the East playoffs. All except Philly have beaten the Herons this season, and all are capable of doing so again (and that’s before getting into a potential final matchup against high-flying San Diego FC, Son Heung-min’s LAFC, the tactically clever Minnesota United, history-making Vancouver Whitecaps, a rematch against the Seattle Sounders, or whoever else comes out of the West).The road to MLS Cup is realistic and achievable for Inter Miami, but it comes with numerous obstacles.Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content.

But their relationship catered for eccentrics, misfits, and outsidersLee EscobedoWed 17 Sep 2025 07.12 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 07.13 EDTShareThe internet is frothing. This time, overTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement, a spectacle reminding us how celebrities function as wish machines. Us normies ride shotgun, living vicariously through the highest peaks and, at times, the lowest valleys, making up for our own grayscale lives.But, while Taylor and Travis are about as mainstream as you can get, in the 1990s there was a celebrity couple who catered for the eccentrics, misfits, and outsiders.I remind you of a steamy time in 1998, when Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman married actor, model, and general celebrity Carmen Electra. It was 7am in Vegas. Neon still buzzing. Rodman in sunglasses. Electra in sequins. Chapel of the Flowers. Just nine days later: an annulment. Rodman’s call. His reason? “Unsound mind.” They reconciled but in April 1999 Electra filed for divorce, ending the relationship for good. That chaotic yet brief union affirmed that celebrity love affairs need not be prosaic archetypes. They can be bizarre for those who didn’t see themselves in Disney endings.With Electra, Rodman met his match: a brunette sex symbol with a devoted coterie met the gothNBAhooper who loved Pearl Jam and Lurex crop tops, personifying the grunge era.“With Carmen, it was different. It was nice to be with someone waiting for the right time, right place, right time,” Rodman explained. He expanded on one of their dates: “She was there four or five days, sleeping in my house, in my bed, and we never made love. It was something unreal.”It’s difficult to overstate how omnipresent Electra was in the 1990s. She embodied the decade’s “extreme” media era, when desire and image were pushed to excess. She starred in Baywatch, hosted MTV’s Singled Out, and graced men’s magazines that made her a pop-culture archetype.Rodman, meanwhile, wasn’t conventionally handsome. He was bullied as a kid, pierced and dyed as an adult, but his look gave weirdos hope that they, too, could be desired. Kelce is a perfect jawline and a salon haircut. Rodman is neon hair, piercings, gender-bending fashion, a middle finger to the idea that desirability required conformity.The Last Dance is spectacular but leaves the real Michael Jordan up in the air | Barney RonayRead moreAnd there’s another layer worth naming. Swift and Kelce represent a very white, very anodyne version of American romance. By contrast, Rodman and Electra were an interracial couple at a time when that still rattled tabloids and provoked coded backlash. Their visibility mattered in the 1990s, a reminder that pop culture could bend not just gender and fashion codes but also racial ones.They whipped the media into a frenzy with their overt PDAs and lusty provocation. Much of this waschronicled in The Last Dance, which documented Michael Jordan’s quest for a sixth NBA title with the Bulls. In a documentary about the most competitive player and the most controversial dynasty of all time, Rodman’s antics stole focus. Especially the story about how Jordan himself had to arrive in Las Vegas, and pullRodman’s naked ass out of bedand back to practice during the 1998 NBA finals, while Electra hid in horror behind the couch. Electra later admitted the couple had sex in nearly every room of the Bulls’ practice facility. The Marquis de Sade would have surely worn a Rodman jersey.“To hang out in a gay bar or put on a sequined halter top makes me feel like a total person and not just a one-dimensional man,” Rodman once said. Ironic to some, he has been a role model for boys and men who never fit within the confines of traditional masculinity.So it was destined to be combustible when Rodman first crossed paths with Electra in early 1998 at a West Hollywood nightclub he wandered into while the Bulls were in LA to play the Lakers. A friend brought Electra to the bar, a quick introduction, a minute of small talk, and then she was gone. Rodman shrugged it off: “Carmen Electra was another beautiful woman in a long line of beautiful women,” he said of their first meeting.But in the early morning hours, she reappeared. This time, she stuck around, and the two stayed up until nearly dawn. Rodman later said that in those few hours, he began to see a real, unexpected connection.A year later, things had disintegrated. On an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s show, Electra looked back on her marriage to Rodman, which came shortly after she lost her mother and sister in the space of a few weeks.“People couldn’t understand why I loved him because he had a reputation for being a bad boy,” she said. “What I saw in the beginning was this gentle giant that was in a lot of pain – so in a way we understood each other.” She added: “When it was good, it was amazing. And when it was bad, it was the worst.”The contrast with Taylor and Travis is stark: their engagement is a 2025 fairytale for the algorithm. Electra, and Rodman, far less conventional figures, were granted far less grace.Swift has had her share of public romances: Joe Jonas, Harry Styles, Tom Hiddleston, Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy, and others. Each relationship fueled endless headlines, but crucially, her cultural image was never fundamentally tarnished by her dating history. Nor should it have been. On the other hand, Electra was routinely cast as reckless or degraded for her choices, her desirability weaponized against her. The double standard is glaring: what is framed as a romantic odyssey for one woman became, for another, a scarlet letter.By 1999, the volatility spilled over. Rodman and Electra were arrested after an alleged domestic altercation, thoughthe charges were eventually dropped.Before his whirlwind marriage to Electra, Rodman had dated other well-known figures: Madonna, model Alicia Douvall, actor Vivica A Fox and, at one point,even himself. In 1996, Rodman showed up to a New York City signing for his book, Bad As I Wanna Be, in a full bridal gown, complete with veil, horse-drawn carriage, and escorted by female usherettes in tuxedos. He declared he was “bisexual and married to myself,” a stunt that scandalized and fascinated the press.It’s little wonder: where Swift and Kelce’s engagement photos were sweet but bland, Rodman sought to stir things up. He had always enjoyed eschewing gender norms, not just by wearing women’s underwear and make-up, but by marrying himself in a performance art piece to rival Vito Acconci or Chris Burden. Rodman in a veil. Rodman in heels. Rodman as bride, groom, spectacle. Call it dada. Call it punk. Call it the wedding of the century. Rodman has always shown a level of self-awareness in his appearance. “When you put yourself in a woman’s shoes and look at what she has to put up with, it’s not a pretty picture,” he once said.What could have been dismissed as a publicity gimmick felt closer to provocation. Rodman was queering the idea of marriage and selfhood in front of the world. “A lot of people are scared of me, because I bring out feelings and ideas that they’d prefer to keep hidden,” he said.As is the case with Electra – a talented dancer who has been active in numerous charities – – there are many sides to Rodman. He was a prolific writer. “I think crying is beautiful,” he said in 1997’s Walk on the Wild Side. While most NBA legends have written books, Rodman wrote like a punk Arthur Rimbaud – incendiary and impossible to domesticate. Five memoirs, each one wilder than the last: speaking about his sexuality in a way that was, and still mostly is, inconceivable for a male sports star. “Have I ever given a blowjob, or received one from a man, or had anal sex with a dude? NOT YET.” Followed by: “Would I care about his dick size? Hell yeah, I would!” Rodman writes like a man sprinting out of bounds, falling into the crowd, still holding the ball.Swifties have been waiting years for Taylor to find her dream man. Good for them and better for her, she has. As expected, Rodman has dated many women since Electra. He has been married three times, has three children,including soccer star Trinity Rodman, and has been with rapper Yella Yella since 2022. Electra has been married and divorced since Rodman. If they found their happy ending, they did so on their own terms.Swift and Kelce’s engagement a ready-made narrative of America’s prom queen meeting her gridiron hero. Rodman and Electra were never that simple. Their relationship burned fast and left behind something more inchoate: a reminder that love stories need not conform to marketable templates. For one witchy, neon-lit year in the late 90s, they proved that misfits and mall goths, freaks and romantics, can have our moment; our myth, not theirs.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsTravis KelceTaylor SwiftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The blast pushed Raleigh past Mantle’s mark established in 1961.The myth of the Big Dumper: how Cal Raleigh became a Seattle folk heroRead moreRaleigh, who homered from the left side of the plate against Wacha, batted righty against left-hander Daniel Lynch in the fourth inning and tied the club record with a two-run drive over the center field wall for a 9-0 Mariners lead. Griffey hit 56 homers for Seattle in both 1997 and 1998.“My name shouldn’t be in the same sentence with those guys, Mickey Mantle and Ken Griffey Jr,” said Raleigh. “I don’t really have words for it. ... I’m sure one day it will set in.”Raleigh also doubled and scored in the first inning, and Seattle went on to win 12-5.A first-time All-Star this year, Raleigh leads the major leagues in home runs and paces the American League with 118 RBIs. Earlier this year, he set the single-season record for home runs by a full-time catcher, previously held by Salvador Perez of the Royals, who hit 48 in 20021.“I think he’s approached this from Day 1 with a ton of humility,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. “That’s the kind of person he is. You know, his desire is to win, and that’s what he wants to do here in Seattle is win. And that’s where his drive comes from. And that’s the way he has approached this whole thing. And I think, you know, Cal just continues to check off these milestones, and he does it with such a humble heart. He has handled it all so incredibly well.”The American League record for homers in a season is 62,set by Yankees slugger Aaron Judge in 2022. Judge is also the last player to hit more than 60 homers in a season. The overall record for MLB is 73, set by Barry Bonds in 2001 during baseball’s steroid era.The first-place Mariners (83-68) lead the Houston Astros (83-69) by a half-game in the American League West.

After flying into Portugal on Wednesday he told journalists that he has spoken to Benfica, whom he briefly managed in 2000.“What I can confirm is that, before I caught the plane, Benfica asked me if I was interested in coaching them,” Mourinho said. “I said yes. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal I would have all the interest in talking with them.“My nature is wanting to coach. I told myself that I wanted to balance myself emotionally. I didn’t want to say yes to the wrong club, just because I am a workaholic.“When asked if I wanted to coach Benfica, I did not think twice. It interests me.”Benfica acted to part ways with Lage afterthe side threw away a 2-0 leadat home against Qarabag on Tuesday night.It is understood the president, Rui Costa, is keen to make a big appointment before next month’s election. João Noronha Lopes, who is competing for the presidency, is reportedly keen to prise Ruben Amorim away from Manchester United.Mourinho left Fenerbahce after the club failed to qualify for the league phase of the Champions League. There would be a swift return to Chelsea for him in the competition on 30 September if talks with Benfica end successfully.The former Manchester United and Tottenham coach has not managed in Portugal since he left Porto in 2004 after guiding them to Champions League glory.Mourinho claimed three league titles, one FA Cup and three League Cups across two spells at Chelsea and led Inter to a historic treble in 2010, winning his second European Cup with victory against Bayern Munich.Mourinho has struggled to recapture his former glories in recent years. He won La Liga with Real Madrid in 2012 but has had a series of largely underwhelming jobs since his second spell at Chelsea came to a fiery end in 2015. He did not impress at United and Spurs, who sacked him just before facing Manchester City in the League Cup final in 2021, although he did win a League Cup and Europa League with United.He secured the Conference League with Roma in 2022 but the 62-year-old’s time at Fenerbahce ended unhappily.Explore more on these topicsBenficaJosé MourinhoEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that two athletes claim they had to withdraw from buying a house when prize money was not paid, and many privately believe they will never receive their money.USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world championRead moreHowever a representative for the four-time Olympic champion has told the Guardian that, contrary to the speculation he had been paid $2m (£1.45m) during the event, he had actually lost more than $2m of his own money before pulling the plug. “The rumours that Michael Johnson has received $2m or profited in any way from Grand Slam Track are categorically false,” the spokesperson said.“In fact, Michael has actually put over $2m of his own money into the project. We are working hard in real time to secure additional funds, and Michael has asked for patience while we try to fix this.”The series was launched with great fanfare in Jamaica in April, with athletes promised $100,000 (£73,300) for winning their events at each of the four meetings, as well as additional money for being an official “racer”.However,it was cancelledbefore the fourth event was due to be held in Los Angeles, with Johnson revealing that GST had lost the backing of a big‑money investor after Kingston struggled to attract fans. The next two events, in Miami and Philadelphia, were seen as a success but by then the financial situation was dire.Johnson still believes the series can return in 2026 and hopes to settle GST’s debts by the end of this month. However, lawyers are already understood to be looking at the situation. Sebastian Coe, theWorld Athleticspresident, has said the international governing body is watching the situation closely.Johnson – who is not working as a pundit for the BBC in Tokyo – admitted last month that he had let athletes down. “It is incredibly difficult to live with the reality that you’ve built something bigger than yourself while simultaneously feeling like you’ve let down the very people you set out to help,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet while there was defiance afterBayern Munichwent 2-0 up inside 27 minutes, Cole Palmer halving the deficit with typical nonchalance, the problems at the other end were too great for Chelsea to overcome.Van Dijk’s late header earns Liverpool dramatic win against Atlético MadridRead moreThe defending must improve if Enzo Maresca’s young side are to make a serious impact in this competition. They have a lot to learn after two years out of the big time. There were simply too many mistakes fromChelsea, exposing their inexperience at this level, and ultimately that was always likely to prove fatal given that Bayern had Harry Kane ready to remind Premier League opposition of his ruthlessness in front of goal.Even Palmer could not steal centre stage from Kane. England’s captain is Bayern’s talisman. Their hopes of ruling Europe for the first time since 2020 rest on his shoulders. The numbers are ridiculous. Kane has already scored 11 times for club and country this season, while he has Moisés Caicedo and Malo Gusto to thank for helping him to extend his record in the Champions League to 42 goals in 58 appearances.Chelsea pressed the self‑destruct button twice, handing Kane his goals. Bayern were not wholly convincing despite opening the league phase with a 3-1 win. Chelsea competed. Maresca was pleased with the effort but rued a failure to take care of the details. Chelsea’s head coach raged, too, at Jonathan Tah not being sent off for a cynical foul on João Pedro in the buildup to Palmer’s goal.The positive for Maresca was that reverting to the formula thatflummoxed Paris Saint-Germainin the Club World Cup final made sense. Deploying Reece James alongside Caicedo added ballast in midfield. Chelsea looked balanced in the early stages. They tested Bayern’s high line, Gusto’s raids from right‑back offering encouragement, and it took a vital intervention from Konrad Laimer to stop Enzo Fernández from giving Chelsea an early lead.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane goes down under Moisés Caicedo’s challenge, resulting in a penalty for Bayern Munich.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APYet Bayern brought their own threats. Serge Gnabry schemed in the pockets and there was danger whenever the ball reached Michael Olise on the right.Chelsea needed no introduction to Olise given that they twice tried to sign him from Crystal Palace. Knowing about the winger’s threat is not the same as knowing how to combat it, though. The marking had to be tighter when Joshua Kimmich played a free‑kick out to Olise in the 20th minute. Instead João Pedro was isolated by the Frenchman, who breezed round the outside before firing in a cross that Trevoh Chalobah turned into his own net under pressure from Dayot Upamecano.Chelsea lost focus. A mix-up on the left invited further trouble .Caicedo had given away the free-kick before the opener and he was soon at fault again, clumsily fouling Kane as Bayern’s No 9 turned in the area.Kane made it 2-0, beating Robert Sánchez with a cool penalty. Game over? Not quite. Chelsea have tasted adversity in this stadium before, fighting to defeat Bayern in the 2012 final. Here the response came from Caicedo winning possession off Olise. Suddenly, with Tah colliding with João Pedro on halfway, Palmer was surging through. A one-two with Gusto followed, leaving Palmer to mark his 100th appearance for Chelsea and his first for the club in this competition by clipping a lovely finish past Manuel Neuer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maresca was booked for complaining about Tah seeing only yellow for his foul on João Pedro. Gusto almost equalised before Laimer went close at the other end. Both teams were a mess at the back.‘It’s a red’: Enzo Maresca fumes after Bayern defender Tah avoids sending-offRead moreVincent Kompany responded by replacing Tah with Kim Min-jae at half-time. There was another defensive alteration when Josip Stanisic limped off. Sacha Boey came on at right-back and Laimer moved to the left. Yet Bayern remained menacing. Luis Díaz was lively on the left and there were two huge let-offs for Chelsea before the hour, Sánchez making fine saves to stop Kane and Olise from making it 3-1. Olise ought to have been furious with himself for finishing so casually. No matter. With Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlović restoring calm in midfield Bayern raised the tempo again and Chelsea cracked when Gusto did the worst thing a defender can do: give the ball to Kane in your own area.This time there was no reprieve. The finish was pure Kane: composed, impossibly smooth, utterly deadly. Kompany praised the forward’s hunger and work off the ball. Maresca, meanwhile, bemoaned self-inflicted wounds. Gusto lay on the turf, aghast with himself. It was a long way back now. Bayern had too much nous. It was not a disastrous performance from Chelsea but they will have to be sharper in defence when they host Benfica in their next game.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I sensed the players thought it was going to happen automatically. We should have been a lot more prepared for what was going to come and handled it a lot better.”Until Zan Vipotnik, on as a substitute for Swansea, equalised in the 93rd minute – the Slovenia striker converting Liam Cullen’s cross for his fifth goal in his past five matches – it seemed that Postecoglou would chalk up his first win as Forest head coach, in filthy conditions and contrasting surrounds toBilbao in May. Suddenly the promise from four debutants, including Douglas Luiz and Oleksandr Zinchenko, and five players making their first starts was superseded.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus taps in his and Nottingham Forest’s second goal.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesHad Postecoglou really missed this? Forest were stunned when Vipotnik levelled and staggered when Swansea’s captain, Cameron Burgess, scored his second goal in style. Ethan Galbraith, the impressive Northern Ireland midfielder who signed from Leyton Orient in the summer, cracked a shot against the upright from 25 yards after a corner was cleared to the edge of the box and Burgess thumped in the rebound, his unerring strike sparking delirium in the stands.“I had Malick Yalcouyé jumping on my back but I was quite calm,” Alan Sheehan, the Swansea head coach, said. “I was looking at the clock because with 30 seconds left they are a team that can put the ball in the top corner.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From our part, there’s definitely a desire to understand and to play against these very powerful and important clubs to see how we’re progressing.”De Bruyne signed for Napoli on a free transfer in the summer after departing the club where he played for a decade. Conte said: “I’ve spoken to Kevin, I’ve asked him a few things [about City], he’s been a part of this club for 10 years and had a great coach like Pep Guardiola. Kevin will be excited to be playing but I’m hoping that after the starting whistle he will find his feet and remember that he’s playing for our great Napoli and contribute like he has been doing.”View image in fullscreenAntonio Conte is backing Rasmus Højlund to emulate Scott McTominay and revive his career in Naples.Photograph: Matteo Ciambelli/ReutersScott McTominay joined Napoli from Manchester United in summer 2024 and was integral to Napoli’s title triumph last season, being voted Serie A player of the year. “I knew him when he played with Manchester United because I coached two times in England [with Chelsea and Tottenham],” Conte said.“I saw great potential in this player and was [asking] why Scott McTominay is not dominant in England because he has great potential. When the possibility happened to sign him for Napoli, honestly in the first moment I didn’t believe that it could happen. It happened and now he is enjoying it.“For a player like him, he was born in Manchester United and there is a point in your career and life where maybe you need to change and to try another experience.

The head coach compared the Frenchwoman to the club’s revered former forward as he reflected on the top form Malard appears to have hit before Thursday’s decisive Women’s Champions League qualifier.Manchester United are 1-0 down going into the second leg against the Norwegian side Brann but were boosted by Malard’s double in their 5-1 victory at London City Lionesses in the Women’s Super League on Sunday.Malard is the WSL’s leading goalscorer, with four goals from the first two games. That is as many as her WSL total last season and Skinner described the 25-year-old, who is in her third campaign at the club, as an “extremely talented player”. Assessing Malard’s improvement he said: “She now understands the language happily, so it’s easier to translate quicker in-game for her, so she can get instruction, take it on board, and perform it.“I’d also say, Mel is probably the most ‘Manchester United’ player I’ve ever met. And what I mean by that is, if I look and I go back – and this is a big shout – to the Eric Cantona kind of personalities; she has that personality. She can carry pressure moments and do it with a smile. And I think that psychology is what stands her apart this season.”If United knock out Brann they will in Friday’s 11am BST draw for the new league phase of the Champions League.

Indeed Flick warned of the “intensity” his players must be braced for at St James’ Park on Thursday night.Gianluigi Donnarumma says Pep Guardiola will help him improve with his feetRead moreFlick recalls Paris Saint-Germain being utterly overwhelmed here two years ago when theysurrendered 4-1to formidable yet still slightly naive opponents whose inexperience would ultimately spell group‑stage elimination. Back then Newcastle, at times, looked a little bit like wide-eyed Champions League tourists; now they want to be seen as contenders.“There were a lot of unknowns last time,” Howe said. “There was a feeling we were experiencing something new, we enjoyed it but ultimately we failed. So this time the resolve is stronger to progress. Not just to enjoy the experience but to try to make it a meaningful one. We’ve learned things and tried to add layers.”If Newcastle’s manager has wised up considerably since he watched his first live Champions League game from San Siro’s away dugout, thecreditable drawhis players secured against Milan 24 months ago emphasised that Howe was not as green as he might have seemed.Now, as he prepares to counter the threat of Raphinha, Marcus Rashford, Frenkie de Jong and co, he has the added benefit of familiarity. “Everything that goes into a Champions League game is different from the Premier League,” Howe said.“It feels different, the buildup’s different. We hadn’t done that before but that experience will help us now. Our squad’s arguably stronger than it was two years ago. We’re excited. I’m looking forward to seeing how we match up against them. I’ll back our quality.”It all prompts memories of another visit from Barcelona, back in mid-September 1997.To mark its anniversary a very special guest is flying in from Colombia to take a seat in the directors’ box.Faustino Asprilla’s unforgettable group‑stage hat-trickagainst Louis van Gaal’s side at St James’ Park helped Kenny Dalglish’s Newcastle to secure a 3-2 win against the Catalans as the teams clashed in the Champions League for the first time.

The former England manager’s son, Mark, will, like Asprilla, be looking on from the posh seats as two of the clubs his father coached with distinction face each other for the first time since 2003.Twenty-two years ago Robson occupied Howe’s dugout but proved powerless to prevent Newcastle from succumbing 2-0 against his old friends from Barcelona. If Newcastle’s latest manager hopes for a different result he is not about to banish Robson’s memory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I might tap into the psychology of it.”Back in September 1997 injury kept Pep Guardiola at home in Barcelona but the absence of the generational talent otherwise known as Lamine Yamal on Thursday night leaves an enormous hole in Flick’s starting XI. If Howe – who said he was disappointed not to be facing the prodigy – senses opportunity, he must be mindful of an opposing manager who shares his ability to switch tactical systems with rare fluency.View image in fullscreenHansi Flick has praised Marcus Rashford for his ‘fantastic, unbelievable qualities’.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersLike Howe, Flick is no slave to philosophy and, during his time in charge of Bayern Munich the now 60-year-old former Germany coach was dubbed “Flicki-Flaka”. It was a reference to his ability to combinegegenpressingwith controlled possession and, at Barcelona, the apparently reborn Manchester United loanee Rashford is evidently relishing working for such a subtly flexible tactician.The feeling is clearly mutual. “It’s a real luxury to have Marcus in my team,” Flick said. “He has fantastic, unbelievable qualities.” Barcelona may need them.“I’ve never been here before,” Flick said. “But my players tell me it’s maybe the best atmosphere in the Premier League.

Maresca was insistent that the Bayern defender should have been sent off after bringing João Pedro down during the buildup to Cole Palmer’s goal for Chelsea, who ended up opening the league phase with a3-1 defeat to the Bundesliga champions.Kane at double as Bayern Munich spoil Chelsea’s Champions League returnRead more“It should have been a red card,” Maresca said. “I always said it was a red card when there is no intention to go for the ball just when the intention is to kick another player. Why is it not a red card? The referee said it was not hard or aggressive enough. So to give you a red card, they need to see your blood or they need to see something. If the intention is to go there, it’s a red card. So for me there is not any doubt.”Maresca was booked for his protests and his frustration increased when Bayern took Tah off at half-time. Vincent Kompany, the Bayern manager, admitted it was because the Germany centre-back was on a yellow card.Chelsea at least took heart from a spirited display after two years out of the Champions League. However they paid for mistakes at the back. Trevoh Chalobah scored an own goal and errors from Malo Gusto and Moisés Caicedo led to Harry Kane easing Bayern to victory with two goals, including one from the penalty spot.“I’m happy with the performance, because we knew how difficult it was to come here against this team,” Maresca said. “We knew that it was a very tough game but overall I think we competed very well. In the first 20 minutes, we didn’t concede nothing, we created two chances, then we conceded the goal and [it] changed the game.“I think the players were already aware of the difficulties. You cannot commit mistakes in the way we have done, but I just said to the players, it’s a game that we can learn a lot and build something special from this defeat.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said some users “in some cases or countries” may also be asked to provide ID to verify their age.“We know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff.”How ChatGPT responds to accounts identified as being under 18 will change, Altman said. Graphic sexual content will be blocked. It will be trained to not flirt if asked by under-18 users, or engage in discussions about suicide or self-harm even in a creative writing settling.“And if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation, we will attempt to contact the user’s parents and if unable, will contact the authorities in the case of imminent harm.“These are difficult decisions, but after talking with experts, this is what we think is best and want to be transparent with our intentions,” Altman said.OpenAI admitted in August its systems could fall short and it would install stronger guardrails around sensitive content after the family of 16-year-old Californian Adam Raine sued the company after the teen’s death.The family’s lawyer said Adam killed himself after “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, and the family alleges that GPT-4o was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.According to US court filings, ChatGPT allegedly guided Adam on whether his method of taking his own life would work, and also offered to help write a suicide note to his parents.OpenAI previously said it was examining the court filing. The Guardian approached OpenAI for comment.Adam exchanged up to 650 messages a day with ChatGPT, the court filing claims. In a blog post after the lawsuit, OpenAI admitted that its safeguards work more reliably in short exchanges, and after many messages over a long period of time, ChatGPT may offer an answer “that goes against our safeguards”.The company announced on Tuesday it was also developing security features to ensure data shared with ChatGPT is private even from OpenAI employees. Altman also said adult users that wanted “flirtatious talk” with ChatGPT would be able to have it. Adult users would not be able ask for instructions on how to kill themselves, but can ask for help in writing a fictional story that depicts suicide.“Treat adults like adults,” Altman said of the company’s principle.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpenAISam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The company put most of its broadening operating loss down to “exchange losses”.Because of Temu’s small pre-tax profit, the company paid just $985,000 in UK corporation tax, up from $517,000 in 2023.The company’s UK operation reports its income as a “service fee”, similar to how Amazon UK and Google UK operate, and says it generates revenues “through the provision of corporate support services to its affiliated entities”.While Temu is experiencing explosive growth in the UK, it – and others such as cheap fast-fashion compatriot Shein and e-commerce company Amazon – potentially face having to implement price rises after the government announced in April areview of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free.The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to Britain worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes. UK retailers have said this rule gives companies such as Temu and Shein an unfair advantage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” Trump said on Tuesday, without providing further details.The deal,which was negotiated in Madridbetween US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese vice premier He Lifeng, reportedly see the social media platform transfer its US assets to new US owners from China’s ByteDance.Frequent TikTok users in Taiwan more likely to agree with pro-China narratives, study findsRead moreOne of the major questions is the fate of TikTok’s powerful algorithm that helped the app become one of the world’s most popular sources of online entertainment.At a press conference in Madrid, the deputy head of China’s cyber security regulator said the framework of the deal included “licensing the algorithm and other intellectual property rights”.Wang Jingtao said ByteDance would “entrust the operation of TikTok’s US user data and content security.”Some commentators have inferred from these comments that TikTok’s US spinoff will retain the Chinese algorithm.At arguments in the Supreme Court in January, a lawyer for TikTok ByteDance told the justices how difficult it would be to sell the platform to a US company, because Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.American officials have previously warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.TikTok has said that the US never presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its US platformThe House Select Committee on China says any deal between Beijing and Washington must comply with a law requiring TikTok to be divested from its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S.“It wouldn’t be in compliance if the algorithm is Chinese. There can’t be any shared algorithm with ByteDance,” said a spokesperson for the House Select Committee on China.Trump on Tuesday extended a delay on enforcing a ban against TikTok until 16 December, marking the fourth postponement of a law designed to force the app’s sale from its Chinese owner. His latest delay was set to expire on Wednesday, which would have enabled a US law signed in 2024 by then-president Joe Bidento force the closure of TikTokin the United States because of its Chinese ownership.The legislation was designed to address national security concerns over TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance and its potential ties to the Chinese government.But Trump, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media and who has said he is fond of TikTok, has continued to delay the the ban.The app has faced scrutiny from US officials who worry about data collection and content manipulation. TikTok has repeatedly denied sharing user data with Chinese authorities and has challenged various restrictions in federal court.“We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” Trump said, adding that he would “hate to see value like that thrown out the window.”China also confirmed what both sides on Monday called the “framework” of a deal that would be finalized in the phone call between the two leaders.After Reuters requested comment, a senior White House official said in a statement that details on the framework are “speculation unless they are announced by this administration.“With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaTikTokTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsShareReuse this content"

But if the endless scroll of other people plugging their clown shows has taught us anything, it’s that we have to maintain our digital facade or risk being unbooked and unblessed. And if there’s one thing the world desperately needs more of, it’s clown shows. (We aren’t joking.) So here we are.Will thinks the internet is a demonic, vacuous hole that is slowly stripping him of his humanity :( And Rae is convinced that the internet has made her stronger, hotter, funnier, and in no way damaged her brain :)While these might look like differing takes on the internet, they’re really just ways of coping with the fact that we live in a world of never-ending loops of AI foods eating themselves. Some of us try to pull away, some of us dive in headfirst but in the end we’re all just scrolling through the chaos together and, diva, that’s where the magic happens. Creatively, the internet is our third collaborator. Before anything becomes a multi-award-winning show (we have to show off; see: fear of being unbooked and unblessed), our ideas usually start online. We spend months hoarding vibes: collecting images, videos and random clips that feel connected to the seed of our project.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHere are the 10 funniest things that feel connected to the seed of our funny bone.Will1. Flutterbye fairy toy flies into fireThis is one of my all time favourites. Childhood innocence interrupted by the most dramatic piece of classical music. The perfect accompaniment for Flutterbye Fairy as she does the unspeakable. RIP.2. Lano and Woodley – FlyIn the long lineage of comedic duos, I bloody love Lano and Woodley. I think the care and detail they put into the silliest and simplest of moments, like Woodley’s Oscar-deserving embodiment of a fly, is deeply inspiring. I could nerd out about their technique for hours, and I won’t bore you here, but I do owe them some form of thanks. And you reading this, sure, it is not a 10-second reel, but stick with it.3. Julio Torres’s masterclass on hand actingAllow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueAny time someone shows me a new piece of media from the icon and aspirational twunk Julio Torres, I insist that they see the hand acting masterclass from their Instagram in 2020. It includes classic scenarios and how-tos such as “BRING … ME … THE GIRL!”, “Offering her the potion but warning her that everything has a price”, and, of course, “Basic scenarios for Advanced Hand Acting; Handrail, ascending and descending”.An essential watch for any budding young actor who wants to become a silent clown in the future. There are at least three separate posts of lessons in there. Happy scrolling.4. Jennifer Lopez’s past five years, specifically her inauguration performanceDuring Covid, in the dying days of President Trump’s first term, we had a glimmer of hope – Jennifer Lopez’s performance at Joe Biden’s inauguration. While JLo’s self-funded filmThis Is Me … Now: A Love Storyand itsaccompanying documentary(an incredible double feature) both deserve to be on this list, it’s this moment that takes the cake for me. Specifically, her decision to mash up America the Beautiful and This Land Is Your Land with her 1999 party anthem Let’s Get Loud.The attempt to shift this song from the dancefloor into the political sphere is so beautifully unhinged. Combined with her performance, it makes me scream, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry. I will speak about it for decades and perhaps write a dissertation on it.5. The pet performers who get paid to act like animals“We may not receive the applause because we are doing it for an audience who can’t clap.” Performance for domestic animals is a vital and dignified art form and nothing you can woof will convince me otherwise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this isn’t the most potent look into who I was as a child, I don’t know what is. The ambition. The frustration. The inability to regulate. As someone who is famously a bad singer, I just so deeply relate. Bless this girl and wherever she is now. Thank you for your service, queen.2. Trisha Paytas’s entire body of workTrisha Paytas was probably the first person I truly laughed at online. It was impossible to pick just one video but this is one of the first I remember. Fifteen years later, she’s still producing some of the world’s best, most richest content. It’s delusion wrapped in confidence wrapped in talent wrapped in more talent, dipped in even more talent. Get her on Broadway YESTERDAY.3. Ads for the mobile game Project MakeoverThese ads might not be a hit with everyone but as someone who loves being online I can’t look away. They pop up at least three times a day and every time I want to help her sooooooo much. She’s covered in mud, she needs a shower, NOT MORE MUD! The situations she finds herself in are truly the essence of clowning. I haven’t downloaded the game (yet) but I feel personally responsible for her wellbeing every time. LET HER WIN!!!4.

And her laugh kills me every time.5. Kermit is revealed to be the Snail on The Masked SingerI’m convinced that The Masked Singer exists in the Hunger Games universe: every clip feels like peeking into the Capitol from District 12. This reveal is my favourite. It’s the hands for me – the way they pop out, the way the crowd loses it for a puppet. Imagine the Kermit puppeteer, trapped inside a giant snail costume, singing.

Their struggles – and aspirations – defy the traditional Marlboro cowboy stereotypeKatie HillWed 17 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 13.41 EDTShareSavanah McCarty was not riding across the wide-open prairie when a horse accident nearly killed her.She was in the driveway of her leased farm outside Bozeman,Montana, waiting for a student’s mother to arrive, when her horse seized and flipped over backwards, landing on top of her.The horse, it turned out, had a neurological disorder linked to possum urine. McCarty never imagined it could cause this.“It was an absolute freak accident,” she says. “I thought I was fine because nothing was visibly bleeding, but the EMTs called in Life Flight [emergency helicopter transport] because I was showing signs of a brain bleed.”After her transfer to Billings, McCarty underwent emergency brain surgery and entered a coma. A week later, she woke up.She began sharing her recovery onInstagram, writing about the pain, the strain on her business, and her mounting medical debt. (She was uninsured; a Life Flight bill alone can reach $50,000.) She was also reeling from a miscarriage that had begun a week before the accident and was still occurring throughout her emergency treatment.View image in fullscreenSavanah McCarty.Photograph: Janie OsborneThese are not the traditional struggles of a textbook Marlboro cowboy. They are the challenges modern women across industries face – high costs of living, healthcare gaps, reproductive loss – only layered with an extreme wild west twist.With her non-profit background and outspoken feminism, McCarty has built an online following around a grittier version of cowgirl life – one that makes no money, but defies the male-centered cliches of Yellowstone.If those stereotypes still hold sway, it may not be for long. The gender ratio of ranching and agriculture in the US is changing. With more women entering the field and more men leaving it, asdatafrom the US Department of Agriculture’s 2022 census shows, women now account for more than 36% of all producers in the US. Male producers have steadily decreased since 2007, while the number of women has increased with every survey since 2002.You can exist on your terms and have your dreams, rather than [fitting] society’s version of what a cowgirl or rancher looks likeSavanah McCartyWith that shift in gender demographics comes a reimagined definition of what it means to be a rancher in the west – and a good one at that. Beyond the core components of responsible land stewardship and animal husbandry practices, an emphasis on mental health, economic empowerment, and mentorship is replacing the emotional suppression and rugged individualism of old western lore.This newer version of the ranching lifestyle is just as demanding and dangerous. But many women feel it is exactly where they belong.“This is the hardest I’ve ever lived,” McCarty says. “I stack a ton of hay a week by myself. I’m constantly fixing fences. I do all the housework. Yes, I really wish I had a partner. I still long to be soft and nurturing … but this is all worth it for me.”‘You have to get back in the saddle’Even nine months after the last episode aired,Yellowstonestill reverberates throughout global pop culture. You could not throw a lit Marlboro Red at aBanff skijoring weekendwithout hitting a multimillionaire in Lucchese boots and a Pendleton coat. Everyone wants to dress, drink and party like a Dutton. If they can do so without stepping in cowpies, all the better.Cowgirl culture has risen through more female-centric avenues, as well. From Beyonce’scustom Cowboy Carter Shiaparelli look– a tribute to the long history of Black cowboy culture – to Shania Twain’s latest tour get-ups, these women of extreme social and financial power are wielding it like a pair of pearl-handled six-shooters.But this pop culture persona remains an incredibly far cry from the realities on the ground, something that McCarty points out in areelthat went viral shortly after her accident.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

The contrast makes the point: the glamorized cowgirl fantasy is nothing like the reality.For McCarty, reality was brutal: if she did not return to work quickly, she faced financial ruin. Just three months after surgery – nine months earlier than doctors advised – she was back-breaking colts.View image in fullscreenSavanah McCarty does ranch chores on her property.Photograph: Janie Osborne/The Guardian“I didn’t have a year,” she says. “Should I have gone back that soon? Absolutely not. But I was pushed to the brink of ‘you have to get back in the saddle or you’re going to be homeless.’ I didn’t have any choice.”McCarty’s social media platform grew rapidly throughout this time. The more unfiltered content she shared from her cowgirl-dream-turned-nightmare, the more followers followed, many of them offering words of support and encouragement.Then, in the midst of her recovery, McCarty ran into trouble with her landlord and received an unlawful eviction notice. Suddenly, she had to relocate her life and business – including all her clients’ horses – in a region where agricultural leases are scarce. Gallatin county alone lost 44,600 acres (18,050 hectares) of farmland and 114 farms between 2017 and 2022, much of it to housing developments.Now, McCarty sits on the porch of her prairie farmhouse in Broadwater county, Montana, with a half-shaved head, a new lease on a 200-acre property, a full pen of animals and a new personal brand: the Hellbitch Ranch, a play on a popular moniker for an ill-tempered mare. The name is a fierce nod to the freedom that comes with her choice of occupation.“I want to inspire women to know that they don’t have to live in a box,” she says. “You can exist on your terms and have your dreams, rather than [fitting] society’s version of what a cowgirl or a rancher looks like, or the idea that you have to be born into ranching. I’m trying to push against all these lies that our culture tells us about who we have to be.”‘I am a rancher, not a sidepiece’Women are hardly a minority at the Redwing Ranch outside Gardner,Colorado. Ranch owner Christy Wyckoff, programs coordinator Erin Sheridan, and ranch manager Fiona Jackson piled into the same camera frame to tune into a virtual meetup.“It was never planned to be a majority-woman team, but that’s just how it worked out,” Wyckoff says. “We’re all pretty much first-generation ranchers who have come to the industry from very different paths. Because everyone is on the younger side and we don’t come with tons of history, we aren’t tied to paradigms.”While Redwing’s ecology-informed livestock operation is at the core of their business model, their education program also provides everything from chainsaw classes for women and the LGBTQ+ community to co-ed stockmanship clinics, knife-making and silversmithing.View image in fullscreenRedwing Ranch’s Christy Wyckoff (ranch owner and operator), Fiona Jackson (ranch manager), Erin Sheridan (programs coordinator).Photograph: Rhonda Batchelor /Sagebrush Souls PhotographySheridan and Jackson met as summer employees on a different cattle ranch. Neither come from ranching families, but they have taken to the lifestyle all the same – even if they occasionally run up against stereotypes.Wyckoff points out how unusual it is not only for a ranch to have a female owner-operator, but for that woman to be unmarried. “People tend to assume that women on ranches are just ranch wives, and not working,” Sheridan says. “There’s also this sexualized element to women working in the field. I’ve had a lot of comments. ‘Wow, I can’t believe you’re wearing chainsaw chaps. Those look so good on you.’ No one says that to a man.”“I am a rancher, and that is that,” Jackson chimes in. “This isn’t just a lifestyle. This is the work we do every single day. I am a rancher, not a sidepiece. This is my career.”The trio speak highly of Redwing’s lone male employee, apprentice Gabe Chubb. Chubb spent four years in the Marines as an aircraft technician before seeking a hands-on ranching education at Redwing. Wyckoff, Jackson and Sheridan were instantly impressed by his impeccable work ethic and enthusiasm. But with their otherwise entirely female staff, Redwing remains a major outlier.Wyckoff recalls how often eyebrows raise when she brings up Jackson. “It takes them a second to recognize that my ranch manager is a woman,” she says. “I don’t say outright that my ranch manager is a woman, because that’s not the conversation I want to have. The conversation I want to have is about how we’re running our livestock, and how we’re on our way to being a profitable operation, because of our great practices.”By focusing heavily on landscape ecology in southern Colorado’s changing climate and learning to ranch for profit amid the economic uncertainty of the global food system, the Redwing team is working proof of how women can breathe fresh life into an industry that frequently frets over its own demise.‘I don’t know if I can do this without community’Few have a better grasp on the patriarchal myth of what a “real” rancher looks like than Amber Smith.A lifelong horse girl from central Illinois, Smith now ranches 80 miles (129km) north of Miles City, Montana, with her husband and kids. She is also the executive director ofWomen In Ranching, a non-profit that unites female ranchers from across the country.The topic of today’s meetup is horsemanship. One woman tunes in from her camper van, another from a busy morning of fencing repairs, others still from the Bay Area and Los Angeles.Participants share stories about falling in love with horses both in infancy and later in life. Book recommendations on natural horsemanship and stockmanship light up the chat box. One participant remarks on the unique comfort of an all-female setting for these types of discussions. Her comment is a sign thatWomenIn Ranching is accomplishing exactly what founders Elaine Patarini and Wendy Millet first set out to do in 2016.Whether you’re conventional or organic, or you have 10 head of animals or 1000, it doesn’t matter. Everyone has a seat at the tableJessie Jarvis“These young, first-generation ranching women were all saying, ‘I love ranching, I love agriculture, I’m deeply passionate about this industry, but if I don’t find some community, I don’t know if I can do this,’” Smith explains. “That inspired Elaine and Wendy to get some of these women together for a long weekend, just so they could meet someone to call and have a cup of coffee with when they’re struggling.”In 2018, Smith attended her first gathering in San Mateo county. “I came home fired up,” Smith recalls. “Any educational thing I ever did was with all men. I wasn’t seeing women out on the landscape, participating in the way that I really enjoyed. I came into ranching through a love of horsemanship and the outdoors, so moving and sorting cattle and checking water was just an extension of that joy for me. I didn’t see that in anyone around me until I participated in an all-female gathering.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Janie Osborne/The GuardianBut Smith was shocked to discover that even the most seasoned attendees felt out-of-place in their operations. Women admitted to being nervous about suggesting operational changes to their husbands, who seemed to have the final say in all ranch matters. They feared divorce and losing access to land. They felt imposter syndrome at every stage of their ranching careers.Smith saw this as more than just a source of inequity for female ranchers. She also saw it as a roadblock to the industry’s continued success.“Here we are in agriculture, bitching and moaning because nobody wants to come back to the family ranch, and all the ranches are getting sold to wealthy absentee landowners,” Smith says. “But half the population on these ranches, who want to be actively engaged, don’t see a pathway for themselves or feel isolated.”‘We need everybody’Ask anyone in agriculture about the industry’s greatest challenges and they will use some combination of words like “consolidation”, “buyouts”, and “the kids not coming home to take over the family farm”.That is where Jessie Jarvis’s work comes in. A third-generation Idaho cattle rancher and entrepreneur, Jarvis launched an agricultural job board and networking platform called Of The West in January 2021. In 2023, she addedLeaders Of The West,a podcast spotlighting the next generation of agricultural practitioners.I’m a liberal who loves hunting. Allow me to change your mindRead more“Change is hard and scary,” Jarvis says. “I understand why people are not necessarily receptive to change. There’s a lot of volatility in it. But if we want to see agriculture into the future, and see real families at the root of those operations, we have to diversify ourselves and our operations in some ways.”Jarvis, who has more than 50,000 Instagram followers, has used her social media platform to introduce a lot of outsiders, especially women, to “ranch life”. One of her favorite ways to draw them in is slipping style posts into her steady stream of horses, cows, crops, family and vast Idaho landscapes.Jarvis likes to feel like she is reintroducing some of her followers to the origins of their food system, by showing ranchers doing right by their animals and landscapes. Ultimately, her goal is to create an environment of mutual respect and community across the industry. The only path forward is one with room for anyone who feels compelled to participate.“We need everybody,” she says. “We are 2% of the population trying to feed everyone. Whether you’re conventional or organic, or you have 10 head of animals or 1000, it doesn’t matter. Everyone has a seat at the table.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsWomenFarmingMontanaColoradoGenderInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had been running around, putting every acid you can think of on the palm of her hand, then all over her face. One of our estheticians had to tend to her skin. Her parents were nowhere to be seen.”Former Sephora employee KM, 25, has her war stories too. Like the day a woman was caught shoplifting and told the security guard “she was trying to steal because her kid was getting bullied because she didn’t have a Dior lip gloss. [The mom] couldn’t afford it but her daughter told her she is going to get made fun of at school.”When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way’Sephora employeeGaby, 26, worked for Sephora for three years during which time, she said ruefully: “I witnessed so much.” One parent asked Gaby whether her tween “should get a retinol and start preventing anti-ageing now”.Another mother asked Gaby to contour her daughter’s nose to make it look smaller. “When the mom walked away I was like, ‘Your nose is beautiful, by the way.’ It’s not my place to step in and say that, but I really felt like I had to.”The phenomenon of “Sephora kids” – a catch-all phrase for the intense attachment between preteen children, high-end beauty stores and the expensive, sometimes harsh, products that are sold within them – is now well established. In the first half of last year, a third of “prestige” beauty sales were driven by households with tweens and teens, according to the market research firm Circana. The same year, according to Statista, LVMH-owned Sephora racked up around $9bn in US sales, while competitor UltaBeautyreported sales of $11.3bn.‘She has a hyaluronic acid and niacinamide serum’: the curious boom in skincare for tweensRead moreThe trend is driven by skincare content produced by beauty influencers – many of whom are tweens and teens themselves. The videos they post put kids’ sensitive skin at “significant dermatological risk”, according to thefirst peer-reviewed studyon the phenomenon, published in June by Northwestern University. Its analysis found that skincare routines posted by teens and tweens on TikTok containedan average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients per routine, which risked causing acute reactions and triggering lifelong allergies.Sephora has tried to distance itself from the trend (“we do not market to this audience,” said Artemis Patrick, president and CEO of Sephora North America,in a recent Fortune interview). Being seen to sell anti-ageing products to children is not a good look. Last year, the skincare brand Drunk Elephant became intrinsically linked with the trend, when its brightly packaged creams became a status symbol for tweenage kids, some of whom reported skin reactions to harsh ingredients. It recently reported a 65% decline in sales, which most analysts pegged to the brand losing touch with the adult customers it had been designed for.Despite this, the situation has dug its neon-pink nails in this summer, according to a selection of current and former Sephora workers the Guardian spoke to. Every single one of these young women expressed concern about what they have witnessed on the shop floor.Summer is peak time for Sephora kids: school is out and third spaces arenotoriously scarce. The high-shine environment of the beauty store – brightly lit, soundtracked by loud music, full of lotions and tubs in vivid hues – can feel like a magnet for children.View image in fullscreenToddlers run around unsupervised, wreaking havoc with displays, knocking down banners or filling shopping baskets to the brim with testers while their parents were elsewhere in the store, according to the workers I spoke to. Or parents were pacifying kids with “a full-blast YouTube video”, said KM, who calls her store’s tiniest inhabitants “free range kids”.Kennedy works in a Sephora concession within a Kohl’s department store right across from the junior’s clothing section and believes that “cross traffic is very intentional,” she said. Kids stream in all day. “Parents will drop their kids in Sephora and then wander the rest of Kohl’s, and I won’t see them until checkout.” At that point, she said, some parents will materialize, often without looking at the specific products their child wants. “I had that happen with a dad recently. He was on his phone the whole time, swiped his card for $200 not even thinking about it.”Workers I spoke to also said they had tried to dissuade younger kids from buying harsh products from brands designed for more mature skin.Sometimes, even with a parent present, the advice is not always heeded, said Gaby. “They’re just like,‘Well, my daughter really wants this, can you just grab it?’” said Jessica, a former Sephora worker. “I remember one circumstance where a kid who looked about nine wanted to buy a lot of Drunk Elephant products: the retinol, the glycolic acid.” When Jessica warned one mother that the products were too harsh for her child’s skin, she responded: “Well, we just saw it onTikTok,” and “ended up buying everything”.When parents do listen, there are sometimes tense exchanges in store. From tweenagers pleading: “But I saw this online, it’s supposed to be good!” said KM, to “little kid type tantrums. You know: ‘I want a lip gloss!’ And the mom’s like, ‘You’re six, you don’t need a lip gloss!’”View image in fullscreenAll the workers were sure that many of these products were going unused. Once a beauty product is opened and sits on a shelf for a while, it goes bad, points out KM: “It’s just landfill.” Overconsumption has been a concern.Shoplifting – or “shrink” in store parlance – is also a big issue. “I find so many empty boxes of product at work all the time,” said Gaby. There was a “whole trend of ‘borrowing’ on TikTok”, said Erica, 28, referring to a euphemism for shoplifting she believes has contributed to some kids getting very adept at the practice.It is common for kids to use their parents’ credit cards. “They bring out those silver American Express cards, the ones that are metal. And I’m like, ‘That’s definitely not yours,’” said Gaby. Erica said she has seen little girls who look around eight say casually to their parents: “‘I want to get this. Let me just use your card.’”They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks likeSephora employeeThis behavior has tied into an overall impression of preteen children behaving like little adults. Kennedy described it as as a “weird entitlement”. Kids might come in on their phone, holding a Starbucks cup almost as big as they are. She said she has heard preteen girls say phrases like, “I’m going to have to start anti-ageing soon.” They are almost always joking, she said, yet “even if it’s said in jest, it is strange. They want to act mature and have the grownup experience of shopping at Sephora, but there is also this deep seated societal fear of anti-ageing permeating the mind of a 10-year-old.”For Joy, a 25-year-old Sephora worker, the trend is “all about appearance”. The visual landscape of social media is “a lot of pressure” for girls, she said: “Celebrities and influencers in their 50s still look like they are my age,” and kids notice that. “Little do they know, it’s probably a doctor involved.”Erica said baby-faced preteens sometimes approach her in store saying things like, “‘Do you think I have pores?’ They see everything with filters. They don’t really know what real skin looks like.”Dr Meghan Owenz, a clinical associate professor at Florida International University and therapist specializing in parenting and anxiety, said that it is normal for preteen girls to start caring about personal hygiene at their age. The pressures, however, have shifted for their generation, as they figure out how to deal with questions like: “‘What’s everybody else doing – and how do I fit in there?’ If we insert social media at that time then they’re flooded with this information.”View image in fullscreenChildren cultivating a sense of belonging through products – whether sneakers or Beanie Babies or Pokémon cards – is nothing new. Yet generation Alpha, those born after 2010, is facing a unprecedent amount of marketing messages for years:43% of gen Alpha in the US had tablets before the age of sixand 58% received their first iPhone by age 10, according to one survey.US government research from 2023described social media use as “nearly universal” at 95% use for those age 13 to 17 and nearly 40% for those age eight to 12 (despite the age limit being set at 13 for many platforms). These are platforms on which the boundary between paid advertising and impartial content is blurred to the point of non-existence, particularly in the world of beauty influencers.KM has begun to notice an eerie Invasion of the Body Snatchers language among tiny customers who talk in influencer-ese: “I’m here for my back-to-school glow,” or “I’m here for my back-to-school lip balm,” they might say. Or they just “repeat the actual product name over and over again, like they saw someone promote it but they have no idea what it actually does”.Owenz believes the inundation of paid influencers who “talk about ‘my skincare routine’ and ‘get ready with me,’” leads to children mimicking their behavior as a “developmentally appropriately … way to fit in”. Owenz added: “The problem is for girls is that they cannot possibly live up to what they see on social media financially, physically or otherwise.”“It has gotten harder to say no, because there’s so much advertising to our kids all the time,” Owenz added. “Kids are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure – and they’re going to pressure their parents more.”[The kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same productformer Sephora employeeIt remains the case, she said, that it is the parent’s job to “discern what’s appropriate for them and say: ‘No, it’s not appropriate. Here’s the reason.’”But California assemblymember Alex Lee believes putting the onus should not solely be on parents, in part because beauty companies are not obligated to feature clear labels or warning – only very long lists of ingredients. “Your average parent is not a pediatric dermatologist,” he said. Lee has twice tried to introduce a bill stopping stores from selling products containing ingredients such as retinol and glycolic acid to kids under 18. The Personal Care Product Council – which represents the interests of the beauty industry – lobbied against the bills, which have both failed to pass. In Lee’s view, the industry is unwilling to do anything to disrupt its relationship with children it believes will be customers for life.Many of the workers I spoke to believed that many beauty brands stocked by Sephora had started targeting this customer base, whether or not they would admit it. Kennedy has noticed shifts: brands suddenly redesigning packaging to be more colorful, adding tween-friendly products such as lip oils and blushes to skincare lines initially intended for more mature skin. Some brands encourage a collection mindset, said Gaby. “They will come out with a limited-edition matcha-flavored lip balm, or iced coffee, or pink guava – and [the kids] have to have the next new scent, even though they already have six of the same product.”Why are our children obsessed with anti-ageing treatments? Take a look in the mirror | Barbara EllenRead moreSephora, Ulta and Drunk Elephant did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment for this story. Generally though, the skincare industry’s response has been to launch more product ranges specifically designed for very young skin. Many walk a line between palatable messages for parents and social media-influenced and marketing strategies – such as drumming fingernails on closeup shots of bottles – aimed at preteens.The trend rolls on: children have been hosting birthday parties within some Sephora and Ulta stores on an ad-hoc basis for some time, but last month Ulta made it official with thelaunch of a $42-per-guest birthday party package, offering “75 – 90 minutes of beauty fun” using “healthy, gentle” products formulated “with tweens and teens in mind”. As if to underline the sense that such initiatives are about grooming – in more than one sense – on their big day, the “guest of honor” will be gifted the opportunity to spend yet more money with the brand, receiving a 20% off coupon to use when they return for their next shopping trip.View image in fullscreenSome names have been changed to protect the identities of current Sephora employees.Illustrations by Min HeoExplore more on these topicsChildrenYoung peopleShopping tripsBeautySocial mediaTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While appearing to admit to the murder and describe how he was planning to retrieve his gun, he pivoted to mention why he had carved messages into the ammunition.“Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme,” Robinson texted, according to authorities.Robinson’s shooting of Kirk has put the spotlight on the intersection ofpolitical violenceand an increasingly nihilisticonline world that promotes misinformation and extremism. It’s a confluence that raises fundamental questions about how internet culture influences both extremist attacks and how we understand them, at a time when some of the biggest online spaces are increasingly more divisive and less moderated.Robinson appeared to spend much of his life on the internet and playing video games, withfriends describing himas “terminally online”. He was active on Discord, a messaging platform popular among the gaming community, and as a teenager dressed up as internet memes for Halloween.How memes, gaming and internet culture all relate to the Charlie Kirk shootingRead moreBullet casings from the gun he allegedly firedwere engraved with niche references and internet-speak – “notices bulge OwO what’s this”, a reference to a meme about sex within the online Furry subculture, “if you read this you are gay LMAO”, “Hey Fascist! CATCH!”, as well as the controller movements to use a special bomb in the popular video game Helldivers 2 and the lyrics to the antifascist song Bella Ciao, which has become popular among gamers after featuring in the game Far Cry 6.In Robinson’s exchanges with his roommate, who he was also romantically involved with, he appeared to have been thinking of how the ironic messages would be received.“If I see ‘uwu notices bulge’ on fox new [sic] I might have a stroke,” Robinson texted.With the references, Robinson fits a modern trend of attackers leaving behind messages that not only show they are products of an online culture, but are in conversation with it. In recent years, a growing number of shooters have left behind writings, whether full manifestos or single sentence posts online, that contain nihilistic in-jokes and references that aim to differentiate their extremely online cohort from the “normies” who will struggle to understand them.The manifesto left behind by the neo-Nazi who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 contained both extreme white nationalist ideology and“shitpost”-style ironic referencesto video games and podcasters.The man who opened fire at a supermarket in El Paso, Texas, that same yearannounced his killings on the message board 8chan, prompting users to create memes and encourage others to try to “beat their high scores” in body count.Extremist mass killingsat a supermarket in a predominately Black area of Buffalo, New York, in 2022 and at asynagogue in Poway, California, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. Amulti-newsroom investigation in 2022that pored over tens of thousands of messages from an international neo-Nazi extremist network found that the chats were inflected with memes and gaming slang as they planned to commit violence.In addition to speaking to their online communities, attackers are also often in dialogue with each other, whether in some far-right circles where extremists celebrate individuals as “saints” with their own memorialized days or simply through copying elements of previous killings. Asothers have noted, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter whoattackeda Minneapolis Catholic school. It also echoes the engravings that United Healthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione allegedly left on his bullets, which became a meme to the point itfeatured on shirtsfrom a popular alt-fashion label.Robinson’s engravings themselves don’t offer a cohesive explanation for Kirk’s killing. Prosecutors say Robinson told his roommate he shot Kirk because the conservative activist was spreading hatred. They also allege that his mother told investigators that her son had spent the previous year or so becoming “more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented”.But much about Robinson’s path to radicalization is still unclear. There is an enormous gulf between holding opposition to Kirk’s views and carrying out a targeted killing. And increasingly, experts say, the motivation of shooters, particularly young ones, don’t fit neatly into a traditionalleft-right spectrumbut are shaped by the fractured, heavily online state of modern politics. Ignoring the messier nature of radicalization in lieu of fitting attackers into convenient boxes risks missing what actually drives people to commit acts of extremist violence.The radicalization of being onlineInstead of trying to find precise meaning in the irony soaked, trolling messages that attackers have left behind, extremism researchers argue that it’s often more useful to look at how online mediums are broadly shaping radicalization. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers.Although technological influences are only onepart of rising political violence– along with mental health issues, political polarization and the widespread availability of firearms in the US – extremism researchers are increasingly studying the evolving ways that social media platforms and online spaces can radicalize and isolate users.In a 2023 paper for George Washington University’s Project on Extremism, Jacob Ware, aresearcher described what he calleda “third generation of online radicalization” that emerged in the late 2010s. Some of its characteristics include how meme culture helps radicalize and normalize attacks, as well as how precise ideology or affiliation with an organization becomes less important than lone acts of violence. The online culture around violence and extremism ends up blurring traditional lines of terrorism, Ware argues, as well as encourages making performative content to go along with attacks.“Global grievances are acted upon with great fury in very local contexts – and yet, the main audience is often online,” Ware writes.The growth of social media and erosion of previous gatekeepers have also left it unclear how to counter the spread of online radicalization, especially given social media platforms’ shifttowards shirking responsibilityfor hosting violent and extreme content. What was once the generally accepted policy among media outlets and platforms to not share attackers’ manifestos, part of a public health argument from researchers to avoid copycats, has degraded as social media has given way to amateur sleuths posting every element of someone’s digital footprint for clues. And as messages and memes from attackers spread more easily, they also in turn generate more posts riffing on the violence and turning it into content. It is a particularly dark function of an industry that has built its growth through algorithmically pushing politically divisive and extremist content.The result is that while online culture has enmeshed itself into extremism and political violence, previously secluded parts of the extremist internet culture have increasingly infected the everyday internet. The use of ironic humour connected to violence and extremism is not unique to the digital age –an essay from 1944once discussed how antisemites amused themselves with flippant hateful statements – but it has become an incredibly pervasive part of the online experience. Ideologies and memes that would have once been relegated to obscure comment boards and extremist websites are now essentially the native tongue of the internet and distributed through mainstream social media platforms.Kirk himself was a product of this online world, best known for viral clips of his combative, debate-style exchanges that social media users across the political spectrum shared to either champion or mock him.Videos of Kirk’s killing have since fed into the same online spaces and content machine where he was once ubiquitous, sometimes autoplaying on X without warning viewers. Reactions to his death have become part of the same content mill, with video essays claiming to explain the killing and AI-generated tributes depicting him in heaven proliferating online. An aspiring influencer who was attending the event where Kirk was shot even attempted to immediately farm the killing for content, posting a video of himself promoting his social media channels during the chaos.“Make sure you subscribe!” the TikToker, who later deleted the video, said while flashing a peace sign as attendees around him screamed and fled.Explore more on these topicsInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaCharlie Kirk shootingGun crime4chanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This series is characterised by a pervasive and polarising streak of distinctly adolescent humour. But in Borderlands 4, developer Gearbox has addressed that issue: it features plenty of returning characters in its storyline, but this time around they are more world-weary and less annoyingly manic. Borderlands has finally matured, to an extent. And not before time.Borderlands 4 still flings jokes at you thick and fast, and they are still hit-or-miss, but at least its general humour is a bit more sophisticated than before. It retains the distinctive cel-shaded graphical style and gun and ordnance-heavy gameplay that people have always loved. Indeed, it throws even more guns at you than any of its predecessors, and with a little work at filtering out the best ones, you will find plenty of absolute gems with which to take on hordes of straightforward enemies and more interesting bosses. A decent storyline emerges after the formulaic first few hours, eventually sending you off on some unexpected, fun and sometimes gratifyingly surreal tangents.The action takes place on Kairos, a planet new to the series, which feels more coherent than any of Borderlands’ previous settings. Kairos’s inhabitants are suffering under the totalitarian yoke of the tyrant Timekeeper, so you must rouse the downtrodden natives into joining your resistance movement, liberating tribes of folk by eliminating the Timekeeper’s oppressive lieutenants and removing surveillance-and-control implants from their necks. The deeper you get into the story, the more sidetracks and digressions you find, from dungeon-like vaults stashed with loot to environmental puzzles.You play as one of four vault-hunters – a Siren with summoning powers, an Exosoldier super-soldier, a hammer-wielding tank called a Forgeknight and a tech-wielding Gravitar. Each has battlefield skills that are crucial when you’re up against it, giving you the chance to spawn scythe-wielding phantom reapers, turrets, or defensive shields. The usual high-quality shooting is present and correct, but movement has been greatly improved: you get a grapple, a hover-bike and a huge jump-and-glide, all of which come in handy in the heat of frenetic battleandwhen you’re out exploring. They also translate well to the series’ famed co-op play, which supports up to four players.Borderlands 4 is a big game – the main storyline takes 20 to 30 hours to complete, and there’s plenty to do afterwards. It is not entirely frictionless: sometimes you need to traverse huge distances in its missions, and the directional indicator that helps you along the way is annoyingly erratic. And it has been buggy at launch: playing on PC, it has occasionally crashed on me, even after a huge patch, and early playershave reported problemswith stuttering and other performance issues. But Borderlands needed to grow up a bit, and that’s exactly what it has done, without losing its essential charm. Its top-quality shooter action might be comfortably familiar, but it’s also an awful lot less annoying than it used to be.Borderlands 4 is out now; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesAction gamesRole playing gamesShooting gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

From Street Fighter’s “hadouken!” to Call of Duty’s “remember, no Russian” to BioShock’s “would you kindly?”, there are phrases so creepy, clever or cool they have slipped imperceptibly into the gaming lexicon, ensuring that whenever they’re memed on social media, almost everyone gets the reference.But there are also odd little phrases, sometimes from obscure games, that stick with us for seemingly no reason. I recall most of the vocal barks from the second world war strategy game Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, even though I haven’t played it for 20 years. Why is it that I’ll lose my headphones, wallet and phone on a daily basis, but I have absolute recall when it comes to the utterances of burly soldier Samuel Brooklyn? Why am I doomed to “Finally, some action”, “Consider it done, boss” and the immortal “okey dokey” echoing through my head? What is wrong with me?Fortunately, when Iposted about this on Bluesky, I discovered I was not alone. Hundreds of gamers got back to me about the random game dialogue lodged in their own heads. Some were lesser-known quotes from famous titles: comic book writer Kieron Gillen is haunted by the line “I’ve not seen such bravery” from Gauntlet, while video game academic Kat Brewster wrote that she thinks about the game’s “ah, sustenance!” line all the time. Matthew Castle, of the gaming podcastThe Back Page, simply cannot forget the way Beedlesays thank youin The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Game designer and artist Anna Hollinrake cannot escape the voice of the random Pokémon trainer who said: “Whether hot to trot or cool cat not, chill at my papa’s shop.” “It runs around in my head again and again,” she said. “Drives me mad.”Some games came up again and again. Worms, Grand Theft Auto, House of the Dead and Monkey Island seem to be filled with memorable lines, sometimes because they’re funny, but often because they’re simply ludicrous. One fan of Bungie’s shooter Marathon has been unable to forget the phrase “Frog blast the vent core!”, only later discoveringits strange origin. Many players had adopted these lines of dialogue into their every day lives – several respondents admitted to thinking “wizard needs food badly” whenever they open the fridge door.View image in fullscreenIn my head … Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.Photograph: Pyro StudiosSo why have so many obscure lines remained in our brains all these years? Partly it’s about sheer repetition: in a 20-hour action-adventure game filled with non-player characters, you’re going to hear the same “barks” (quick pieces of NPC dialogue that express surprise or provide contextual information) over and over again. This is why so many people recall everything the merchant says in Resident Evil 4 – by the end of the game, you’ve heard “What’re ya buyin’?” several hundred times. There is also an element of echolalia, the repetition of certain comforting words and sounds as an act of self-soothing.Gamesare built around rhythm and repetition, so it is perhaps natural for us to adopt elements of these patterns into our lives.Game dialogue can also become an in-joke with friends, enforcing bonds and shared interests and memories in the same way as quoting pieces of movie dialogue. Bluesky user Steve O’Gorman wrote this about F-Zero GX: “Samurai Goroh’s line delivery of ‘You stole the prize money from us last time’ while flailing his arms has randomly stuck with my friendship group for 20+ years.” With video games, our own subjective experiences in the worlds can often be as memorable and valuable as the intended narratives. Sometimes, the idea that we could be the only player to have encountered an obscure character, or heard a specific snatch of dialogue, creates a connection with the game that becomes personal.I don’t think I have a deep connection with tough Samuel Brooklyn, despite the number of times I sent him to his death while he yelled the immortal words: “No problem, man.” But clearly, I was going through something when I was playing that game, or I was just amused by the disparity between the seriousness of the fight against the Nazis and the daft, repetitive phrases that accompanied my every mouse click. We never really know what makes a moment of our life memorable, or why a line from an old episode of Gilmore Girls, Twin Peaks or Scarface sticks around in our subconscious. But it’s nice to know we’re not alone with our weird little aural collections.What to playView image in fullscreenScoundrel’s tale … Star Wars Outlaws.Photograph: UbisoftUnfairly maligned on its original release and now available in a lush Nintendo Switch 2 conversion,Star Wars Outlawsis one of my favourite ever Star Wars games. Choosing to eschew all the mysticism and vainglorious posturing of Jedi lore in favour of a scoundrel-turned-resistance hero story, it’s an exciting romp across familiar planets, against familiar Imperial bad guys.The design of the worlds and the various bases and spacecraft you explore is incredible, capturing the slightly battered futurism of those early Ralph McQuarrie concept sketches, and the dialogue is often genuinely funny. Lead character Kay Vess is a nobody in the Star Wars canon, but that’s the whole point, and the relationships she forges on her quest to pull off the ultimate heist against the Empire reflect the themes and ideals of the original movie. For such a big story, the Switch 2 screen makes a wonderful venue, allowing you to carry a whole galaxy with you wherever you go.Available on:PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxEstimated playtime:25+ hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenBugged out … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryEurogamer haskicked off a series of featuresabout contentious topics in video game design, and the first looks at the subject ofboss runbacks– ie the length of space and gameplay between a checkpoint and a boss battle. Silksong has been challenging (frustrating?) gamers with its lengthy, often difficult runbacks, which can seem like a sadistic insult after you’ve failed a boss fight for the 56th time. But are they, in fact, a legitimate part of the rhythm of games? In my opinion, they are theworst, but don’t get me started.I didn’t think I’d ever link to the United Nations on this newsletter, but the organisation hasjust featured a pieceabout video games anddemocracyon its website to mark the International Day of Democracy (15 September). The piece looks at the history of persuasive games and advergames made by charities to highlight campaigns and asks if games have a role in informing players about democratic rights and participation.The wonderful retro gaming zineForgotten Worldsis back witha new issue, this time dedicated to Sega, or more specifically the company’s “blue skies” period of the late 80s and early 90s when its arcade and home console games invariably took place in super-bright, sunshine-lit worlds. There are lots of excerpts from contemporary games mags as well as interviews with key Sega staff and journalists including Gary Cutlack, founder of influential Sega fansite UK Resistance.

It will play more than 100 of Trump’s lies or misleading statements in a segment called Trump v The Truth. All his greatest hits, from false claims about the price of eggs to disgusting lies about the US spending millions on condoms for Hamas, packaged together.Obviously we’ve got to be fair and balanced here, though, haven’t we? Gotta show both sides. So I think it’s only right that Channel 4 also broadcast a 10-second segment covering all of the truthful and astute things the president has said. It’s not just lies, lies, lies: occasionally the man can be surprisingly wise. Only this week, for example,a video circulated onlineof Trump telling attendees of a gala at one of his golf clubs: “Smart people don’t like me, you know?” He added: “And they don’t like what we talk about.” No lies detected there.Channel 4 to mark Trump’s UK visit with ‘longest uninterrupted reel of untruths’Read moreAnd then there are Trump’s thoughts on the fate of his immortal soul. Last month, early on a Tuesday morning, the presidentdialled into Fox & Friendsand said he is trying to stop the war in Ukraine so that God can save him a spot in paradise. “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible,” he explained. “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.” While it’s impossible to fact-check exactly where Trump is on God’s waiting list, I suspect he has made a correct assessment of the situation. And I think all the dead children in Gaza, which Trump has said he wants the US to take over and turn into a luxury resort, might agree.Trump has also been blunter about the political process than some of his predecessors. While running forpresident in 2015, he matter-of-factly said that he had used his money to influence politicians. “I gave to many people before this,” he said during a Republican candidates’ debate. “And you know what, when I need something from them two years later … I call them. They are there for me. That’s a broken system.” Truer words have never been spoken; certainly not by Trump.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Israel deepened its disregard for international conventions bysending 10 fighter jets to Qatar, bombing a Hamas delegation participating in ceasefire talks in Doha. The last meaningful forum for diplomatic negotiation may now have gone up in smoke.At least 19 Russian drones violated Poland’s airspace. For the first time in its history, Nato airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a Nato country. Whetherthe incursionwas a technical mishap or deliberate probing by Moscow, as western experts believe, this was “the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said.And then Charlie Kirk, a firebrand conservative activist and close Donald Trump ally,was shot deadwhile addressing college students and Maga supporters at a Utah university. Without evidence of the shooter’s identity or motives, Trump immediately blamed “those on the radical left,” accusing them of rhetoric “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”Asked how the divided nation could heal after Kirk’s assassination, Trump said he “couldn’t care less”. His explanation for that was chilling: “The radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy.” This is how polarisation hardens into tribalism. This is how the spiral of hatred accelerates toward a point of no return.In reality, more than three-quarters of all extremist-related killings in the US over the last 10 years havecome from rightwing extremists, with the radical left responsible for only a fraction of them. Trump condemned political violence in general the following day – but did not acknowledge therecent spate of attacksagainst Democrats, including several killings. To him, the problem is always “them”, never the “wonderful Americans” who make up his base.The political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk’s death will no doubt unfold in the coming weeks, but the biggest danger in a polarised climate is that the shooting becomes the Reichstag fire of our age. That arson attack on27 February 1933 marked Germany’s pivot from fragile democracy to outright dictatorship. Hitler, freshly installed as chancellor, seized the moment to extinguish the freedoms of the Weimar constitution – expression, press, association, assembly.“Anyone who stands in our way will be cut down,”he said, inspecting the arsoned building. Thousands of communists were jailed, including all 81 Communist deputies in parliament. With the left neutralised, the Nazis swiftly consolidated power.In today’s US, Kirk’s death has gripped the country, galvanising the Maga movement and Trump’s supporters, and he knows it. The white supremacist Matt Forney clamoured for the arrest of every Democratic politician, openly claiming the killing as the movement’sReichstag fire moment.View image in fullscreenThe Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933 was seen as pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany.Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/Getty ImagesThe reality is that here is the event that could rescue an increasingly unpopular presidency scarred by a sharp drop in employment figures, a weakening dollar, and a housing crisis. Trump mourned Kirk as though he were family, but the rhetoric suggested this would be as much about pursuing Trump’s enemies as justice. Right after the assassination, Trump promised to go after “each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity … including the organisations that fund and support it.” He singled out George Soros, the American-Hungarian philanthropist and Democrat donor. “He’s a bad guy,” Trump told NBC News, he “should be put in jail.”Messages released yesterdaygive the clearest indication yet of a possible motive for the attack. The political views of the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appear as muddled as those of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20 year old whoattempted to assassinateTrump in Pennsylvania. Is this truly the radical left attacking the radical right – or is it the strange, chaotic subculture of online niches spilling into the real world? The slogansetched on to the bullet casingsin Utah read less like an ideological manifesto than a crude bricolage of puerile memes and gaming references.But it is hard not to fear that the repression of “unwilling” academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants, military officers, and judges in the US will intensify. Already, reactions on social media have led to awave ofsackingsand US state department officialshave warned foreign nationalsnot to praise or make light of Kirk’s assassination, instructing consulates to take “appropriate action” against any foreigners who do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Where real crises do not exist, he fabricates them – including imagined crime pandemics in Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago. Fake chaos fuels his power grab. Now he has been handed chaos on a silver platter. No wonder he couldn’t care less if the nation comes together.The shooting provides the perfect pretext for tightening his grip, silencing dissent, and concentrating power – so that his successors may inherit full state control, regardless of charisma, merit or mandate. After all, any autocratic system has to be built first; once entrenched, it becomes far easier to maintain.Liberal democracy and the rules-based global order are far from perfect, but they have delivered peace, progress and prosperity – the very opposite of authoritarianism. To suggest that the US, the architect of the postwar order, could soon slide into full-blown autocracy, its leaders thinking like Nazis in 1933, may seem far-fetched.But from another vantage point, it is not far-fetched at all. Totalitarianism was still within living memory when many of us, even at the heart of ​modern democraticEurope, were growing up. From Belgium to Bulgaria, most families have some history of the death, destruction, hatred and destitution that authoritarianism leaves behind.

At the end of her funeral service a blackbird (Turdus merula) flew inside the church. It fluttered and hopped about her coffin, which was laid on the floor in front of the altar on a beautiful Tongan tapa cloth. The blackbird lingered next to Mum for some time, then flew back out the open doors.I stayed at my sister Lisa’s home for a week after the funeral. The morning after the ceremony, a blackbird appeared in the back yard. I noticed it as I sat outside. It stayed around for a few days, sometimes perched in the sunshine on a brown wooden fence, often poking around for insects in the new spring grass. Those days were warm, still and quiet – far from how I felt. I found solace in the blackbird.Australia’s quietest cockatoo is running out of trees. We have betrayed its gentle curiosityRead moreSome Māori believe that, when they die, their spirit travels up New Zealand to the tip of the North Island – to Cape Reinga/Te Rerenga Wairua, “the leaping-off place of spirits”. From here, where the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific Ocean, spirits begin their journey to the afterlife in their ancestral home of Hawaiki. Those travelling souls are compared to the kuaka/bar-tailed godwit(Limosa lapponica), which fly non-stop from Alaska to New Zealand and Australia.View image in fullscreenThe common blackbird is a species of true thrush. It breeds in Europe, Asiatic Russia and North Africa and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand.Photograph: Dee Carpenter Photography/Getty ImagesFor Māori, the arrival of the godwits in spring and their departure at the end of summer were a source of mystery. Then unaware that the birds bred in the Alaska tundra, the intrigue prompted the sayings:Kua kite te kohanga kuaka?Who has seen the nest of the kuaka?Ko wai ka kite I te hua o te kuaka?Who has ever held the egg of the kuaka?After a few days the blackbird disappeared. Each morning I’d look for it, hopeful. But nothing. I told my sister about the bird, sharing what I’d seen, how I’d felt. It’s good to talk. Lisa had noticed our fleeting visitor too, and she had also linked its presence back to the church.Together we sometimes reminisce about that blackbird. To us it was Mum, staying on a little longer. We laugh too, relieved that Lisa’s black cat, an adept hunter who brought its trophies indoors, didn’t catch it.

The idea that Australia should exercise veto rights over Vanuatu’s relationship with third parties (which is code for China) did not strike its advocates as a bridge too far. Just a month ago, Australian ministers initialled the Nakamal agreement, apparently unaware of the opposition and resentment within both government and opposition ranks in Port Vila.This week, he could not land an even more ambitious defence treaty withPapua New Guineathat would have seen the virtual integration of the defence forces of PNG and Australia in mutual defence. Who the aggressor might be was not mentioned of course, though China loomed large in media reporting. Again, no one seems to have been aware of the opposition and resentment within the PNG parliament.Anthony Albanese fails to seal defence treaty between Australia and PNGRead moreThe foreign affairs minister’s explanation for the collapse of the Vanuatu deal was the“permanent contest”with China for influence in the Pacific. Penny Wong said Australia had lost the opportunity to be the only partner of choice in the Pacific, now working instead to be the partner of choice in our own interests. Whether it is in Australia’s interests to be in a permanent competition with China in the Pacific is arguable.Notwithstanding his earlier announcement that the PNG defence treaty would be signed, the prime minister’s explanation for the collapse of the PNG deal was essentially that democracies are not the same as authoritarian regimes because they go through processes which Australia respects. Essentially, it was a matter of insufficient time for due process.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThat is an extraordinary admission. If diplomacy is not an enterprise demanding intelligence and tact and a respect for process, what on earth is it?This double whammy in the Pacific is a failure of diplomacy. But the failure of diplomacy is symptomatic of a much deeper set of systemic failures: a failure of mindset; a failure of policy; and, critically, a failure to appreciate the cultural, political and social dynamics of the Pacific.Australia’s default foreign policy mindset is a function of two factors: dependence on America and fear ofChina.We see everything through the lens of our relationship with America. As the defence ministercontinues to pronounce, the US alliance is the “cornerstone” of both our defence and foreign policies. It is no accident that the prime minister was seeking to stitch up the two treaties in the Pacific before he meets Donald Trump, possibly on the margins of the UN general assembly later this month.Our ingrained fear of China dominates the way we think about both Asia and the Pacific. Our dependence on the US is a function of our fear of China. These related concerns thread their way through almost every foreign policy issue, whether it is our inability to criticise America’s bombing of nuclear facilitiesin Iranor Israel’s bombing of the people and the civilian infrastructure of the Gaza Strip.The policy failure is quite simply gobsmacking.Policy is pretty easy to understand. It consists of and elaborates the principles on which decisions are taken. But policy is hard to do, because it deals with the complex interrelationships between values, interests, needs, expectations and resources. So good policy ensures that the right people make the right decisions at the right time, generating effective and equitable outcomes.It would appear that the politicians in Port Vila and Port Moresby made the right decisions, because they acted in their own interests by refusing to give Australia veto powers over the conduct of their foreign and security policy. They preserved their sovereignty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are often seen in the Pacific, including by our friends in New Zealand, as arrogant, condescending and patronising, quick to lecture and slow to listen.This fundamental failure is the consequences of decades of less-than-benign neglect, where we have shown tough love to peoples we like to talk down to as “our Pacific family”. We are deaf to the entreaties of Pacific countries that we address the causes of global warming (mitigation), not just its consequences (adaptation), just as we drive hard bargains in affording them access to the Australian economy.If the Albanese government is capable of learning anything from its week-and-a-bit in the Pacific, it should be this: human security is the issue that really matters in the Pacific. Australia needs to understand that the Pacific nations might not want to be Australia’s partners of choice in the battle of the giants. They want wellbeing and happiness.Allan Behm is special adviser, international and security program, at the Australia Institute, CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionPapua New GuineaAsia PacificChinacommentShareReuse this content"

It comes off the back of the bureau’s first attempt to measure productivity in the non-market sector. Both raise questions of what we value and also whether our focus is where it should be.In 2020 the then shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers,announced an ALP government would develop a wellbeing framework that would seek to “measure what matters”. It was a worthy goal mocked by the then treasurer,Josh Frydenberg.AsPatrick Commins has explained, the wellbeing framework looks at a vast array of life – well beyond GDP. Unfortunately, the framework has not lived up to its promise. Rather than driving policy, it is now little more than a data dump. And unfortunately, much of it is out of date.For example, one measurement included is experience of discrimination. The most recent figures are from 2020, which the ABS noted are probably suspect because they were done during the period of Covid restrictions:If the graph does not display click hereUntil the government actually funds the ABS to regularly measure what matters, the wellbeing framework will be irrelevant to policy discussion.And measuring things matters because you can’t know what you don’t see (or count). But equally important is recognising that not everything can be measured as accurately as we might like (or suppose).Productivity, for example, has been the big topic of the past few months.It is essentially measured by GDP per hour worked. But we already know that GDP misses large swathes of the economy – it doesn’t measure housework, it doesn’t care about distribution. And yet we divide it by hours worked and, before you know it, we havefive reportsfrom the Productivity Commission, aproductivity roundtableand masses of writing on the issue (including by me), most of which ignores that our measurement of productivity is pretty ropey.Given the value of a thing produced is quantified by its price, this essentially means that if you to do one activity that provides a more expensive product in the same amount of time it would be more productive to do that expensive thing.If we all went off to work in the mines, Australia’s productivity would increase. Would that make us a better society? I doubt it, but it is essentially the (unstated) conclusion of theProductivity Commission’s reports.But while productivity is easy to measure when counting goods produced, once we get to services, things get very fudgy. Service quality is hard to measure and more services in the same time is not always good.This is important because Australia is much more of a service economy than in the past, so measuring productivity is harder than in the past:If the graph does not display click hereServices are also less productive because it takes more people to do a service than it does to make a good, so again if you want to raise productivity we could just stop people doing services and get them to start making things.Sounds great unless you need a firefighter or a nurse or a teacher.These jobs come from what is classed as the “non-market” sectors of education, health and social care and public administration and safety. And those sectors have also become more prominent – not just across all work, but even within services:If the graph does not display click hereThis is a problem for measuring productivity because, while measuring services is hard, measuring non-market services is even harder because often the services are not paid and more of them might actually be worse.The Bureau of Statistics has for the first time attempted to count non-market productivity in the most recent GDP figures.It also haspointed out the huge difficulties.For example, it explains that because heart surgery costs more than repairing broken bones “each open-heart surgical procedure carries more weight than each broken bone treated in the emergency room. The heart surgery costs more to perform, so it is assumed to be more valuable.”You can see the problem.If hospitals were doing more open-heart surgeries than fixing broken bones they might be more productive – but is that a good for society? Do we want policies that encourage more open-heart surgeries rather than other less productive surgeries?Similarly care work is counted as less productive than surgeries – but would it be good for society to encourage fewer age care workers?The issue is that non-market sector productivity is falling:If the graph does not display click hereThat is weighing down overall productivity.But the reality is much of the fall is just a hangover from the Covid period when there was an abnormal increase. Non-market sector productivity rarely grows much – except, as occurred in the 1990s, due to the huge IT improvements.If the graph does not display click hereI am glad the ABS has taken on this unenviable task, because it highlights just how much we should not get caught up on productivity figures.Do we really think education and health and social care are only as good as they were 20 years ago, or that productivity in those areas is 9% lower than it was in 2021?And is that even bad if, for example, it means more care workers per patient?That’s not to say we shouldn’t improve productivity in services and the non-market sector. But what are we improving? Is our measurement of it just a good guess and not really something that matters? And is non-market sector productivity “almost” everything?Measuring what matters is important but also is realising that not everything we measure matters as much as we might think.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsHealthAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

How can western governments still refuse to act?Steve CrawshawThe UN commission of inquiry’s report makes it almost impossible for Israel – and its allies – to maintain the narrative that criticism of it is part of an antisemitic plotWed 17 Sep 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 11.08 EDTShareThe conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry thatIsrael has committed genocidein the war in Gaza, and that its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli leaders are responsible for inciting that genocide, changes little in legal terms. The international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague has yet to issue its final ruling inthe genocide case that South Africabrought against Israel last year.Politically, however, thislatest report(officially a “conference room paper”, intended to aid discussion of the themes) may prove to be one of the final nails in the coffin of the shameless but still-continuing narrative from Netanyahu and his allies that any talk of Israeli crimes is part of an antisemitic plot – or, to use Netanyahu’s favourite phrase, “ablood libel”.The commission of inquiry’s findings now stand alongside those ofAmnesty International,Human Rights Watchand the respected Israeli groupsB’TselemandPhysicians for Human Rights–Israel, who have all published authoritative and detailed reports concluding that Israel is committing genocide in the two years since the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023. UN experts andgenocide scholarshave reached the same conclusion.Even when so many have already spoken, however, a UN commission of inquiry brings a particular stamp of authority. The chair of the commission on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel isNavi Pillay, a former president of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. When I first met her, she was a respected UN high commissioner for human rights – not exactly a “Hamas proxy”, to quote Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva when he accused the authors of the report of a “libellous rant”.Keir Starmer’s government has previously said it cannot talk of genocide until “a competent court” (in other words, the ICJ) has given its final judgment. The commission’s findings make clear that line is wholly unsustainable for the prime minister formerly known as a human rights lawyer. “Prevention of genocide” is – as Starmer well knows – a key element ofthe 1948 genocide convention; the president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars is one of many who have pointed out that states arealready failingin that regard.If Labour admitted there is a genocide in Gaza, it would have to admit its own hand in it | Owen JonesRead moreThe commission’s conclusions expose the moral failure of states that were rightly proud to create theinternational criminal court(ICC) in Rome in 1998 but now seek to undermine the rulings of that same court (the ICC investigates and prosecutes individuals, while the ICJ addresses the responsibilities of states, including on genocide). The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, hassaid it would be “absurd” to detain Netanyahu, despite the arrest warrant that judges unanimously approved for the Israeli leader for alleged crimes against humanity. France insisted itwould be inappropriate to arrest Netanyahuif he came to Paris (despite applauding the earlier arrest warrant for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin).The commission of inquiry’s conclusion that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu and his government are committing genocide means that governments’ continued refusal to cooperate with the ICC, and refusal to execute its arrest warrants for crimes against humanity, is illogical and dangerous. As part of the Donald Trump-Netanyahu axis of impunity and their shared determination to destroy the ICC, Trump has imposed sanctions on ICC prosecutors, judges and others – including, most recently, on Al-Haq and other respectedPalestinian human rights groupswhose only crime is to have documented the crimes committed by others.An experienced former British military prosecutor was eventually forced to resign from his post as principal trial lawyer at the ICC after death threats and more, saying this had been “the worst few months of my life”. Investigations by the Israeli-Palestinian+972 Magazine,theGuardianand others have revealed the extraordinary lengths that Netanyahu has been ready to go to, including alleged phone taps and attempted blackmail, in order to sabotage the court’s work.The crimes against humanity that Netanyahu stands accused of at the ICC should in any case not be seen as a lesser crime than genocide. Crimes against humanity – which includeapartheid, extermination and forcible transfer of population– differ from genocide not by being less serious but only because of the “special intent” that forms part of genocide.Britain, France, Canada and others are alldue to recognise Palestinian statehoodnext week, following 147 countries which have already done so. Together with the latest genocide findings, that will add to the pressure on Netanyahu, who admitshow isolated his countryhas now become.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There must be consequences for the crimes committed, too – no matter whether those accused of committing the crimes are considered friend or foe. Starmer and other European leaders have rightly been ready to face Trump down in the context of the US president’s dangerous love-in with Putin. But the destruction of the ICC would have incalculable consequences. Once crushed, the court could never be put back together again. Starmer needs to confront Trump directly on these themes this week; the trampling of justice can’t be left to one side, any more than Trump’s earlierhumiliation of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, could be ignored.To quote Tom Fletcher, the former UK ambassador to Beirut and now UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, events in Gaza are a “21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness”. Echoing the earlier words of the international court of justice, Fletcher called on governments to “prevent genocide”.

Her dedication paid off. By the time the march reached her on Saturday afternoon, she was sitting on a wall outside Downing Street, the little girls in camping chairs at her feet, engrossed in their iPads.She had unfurled two banners. One said “Keir Starmer is a wanker” and the other read: “We’re not far right, we are England’s mothers and we will not stay silent. Stop the rape of our children, mothers across Britain are taking a stand.”I asked her why she was there and she looked incredulous. Wasn’t it obvious? “Because Keir Starmer’s a wanker.” Why? “He’s taking our speech away.” Even though you’re allowed to sit outside his house and call him a wanker?“Well he is.”As for the other sign, she made it, she said, “because I’m not far right and I’m sick of being called it. I’m sick of coming to places like this and being called far right. I am here for the right reasons today, for the future of these children. People are coming in illegally and raping our kids and it’s got to stop.”I went toTommy Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rallyon Saturday to record an episode of the Guardian’s daily podcast,Today in Focus. Robinson called it “the biggest freedom of speech” rally in British history. Others, like Hope Not Hate, prefer todescribe it as“Britain’s largest ever far-right protest”. Unsurprisingly – with the exception of one jovial Welshman who said “well, my viewsarefar right” – no one I met thinks of themselves in that way. “We’re just right,”I heard, over and over. As in: correct.There is no doubt that many of the speakers at the rally were racist, with many delivering variations on the“great replacement” conspiracy theory. Robinson told the crowd: “It’s not just Britain that is being invaded, it’s not just Britain that is being raped. Every single western nation faces the same problem: an orchestrated, organised invasion and replacement of European citizens is happening.”But most of the110,000 marcherscouldn’t hear the speeches. Many couldn’t even fit on to Whitehall to see the big screens. I didn’t get the impression they were there for the speakers anyway: this was about being heard themselves.A few wore their racism with pride, like the man with the misspelled sign that read: “Why are white people dispised when our tax money pays for everything.” But mostly these were “ordinary people” with “ordinary jobs” who “care about our kids”, who said time and again that they’d “had enough”. Usually it was about immigration. But often it wasn’t just that. They’d had enough of a Britain they felt was no longer working.Instead of blamingyears of Tory austerity, or a capitalist system rigged against the little guy, for these people, “illegal immigrants” were to blame. And Starmer was the bogeyman. “Look what he’s done to the farmers, inheritance tax, you know, the NHS is down on its knees,” said a man from Norfolk. “We have potholes in the roads, we can’t get GP appointments, people are actually left in the hallways of some of the NHS hospitals and are not seen to for hours and they’re in critical condition. This country is becoming a joke.”For him it was personal: “I’m starting to lose my teeth, right, because I’m a type 1 diabetic. And it’s the struggle of me trying to get my teeth replaced because of my diabetes. They don’t help people like me. But they would help someone that steps foot on our land from a dinghy and gets everything.”No one used the words “asylum seeker” or “refugee”. It was “illegals” and “fighting age men”. All tarred with the actions of a tiny number of people, like the man in the Bell Hotel in Epping, who was found guilty of sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl and a woman.Everyone claimed that they didn’t have a problem withlegalimmigration: the millions of people who have come to the UK with visas, to study or work. They weren’t blamed for putting pressure on services. Just the people who arrived on small boats – who made up just 4% of arrivals in 2024.I left the rally when too many people on Whitehall were getting aggy and I realised the police had shut off all the side roads, making a quick escape impossible. Since leaving I’ve been grappling with how best to describe what I saw and heard. It was a far-right rally, yes, but many people attended unperturbed by the fact it had been billed as such by many media outlets,including the Guardian. They did not feel alienated by such an extreme, and previously fringe, label. In his speech, Robinson said something that I fear may be true. “They tried to silence us for 20 years with labels,” he said. “‘Racist’, ‘Islamophobe’, ‘far right’. They don’t work any more!”When the far right becomes the mainstream right, what language do we have to describe what is happening? How have conditions led to so many feeling unheard, frustrated and angry? Until the foundations of Britain are fixed – the NHS, schools, potholes, fuel prices – I can’t see this movement doing anything other than growing.Helen Pidd is a presenter of Today in Focus, the Guardian’s award-winning daily podcastThis article was amended on 17 September 2025 to reflect the offences of which the Epping hotel resident was convicted.Explore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionTommy RobinsonProtestLondonImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

He offered the BBC the rights to broadcast it live, but the corporation was nervous. Mandela had been in jail since 1962 and, to the extent that he was a well-known figure, he had beenbranded a “terrorist”. Hollingsworth met BBC executive Alan Yentob, who was wavering. “Alan,” Tony said, “you’ve got to bite the bullet.” Eventually Yentob agreed, replying: “I’ll give you five hours. If the bill improves, I’ll increase the time.”Conservative MPs were soon organising a parliamentary motion, deploring the BBC’s editorial decision. Opponents of Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) were right to be worried about the concert. The event was broadcast to a global audience of 600 million people, it made Mandela a household name around the world and, in all probability, hastened his release. Oliver Tambo, then president of the ANC, told Hollingsworth the concert was “the greatest single event we have undertaken in support of the struggle.”View image in fullscreenThe Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium in London, 11 June 1988.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyThe concert worked because, then as now, politics sits downstream of culture. The stories we tell ourselves and each other are how we develop and share our feelings about this world – and other possible worlds. This gives our storytellers – writers, musicians, artists, actors – incredible power to shape the space in which politicians are able to operate.Which brings us toGaza.More than any other conflict since the birth of the modern communications age, more so even than South Africa in the 1980s, the Israeli occupation of Palestinehas been conducted with words and images as well as with bullets and bombs. And for that reason, those artists who oppose the occupation and advocate for justice for Palestinians have been subjected to a cynical, pernicious censorship designed to severely narrow the scope of the stories they can tell.Examples abound. Last year there was aconcerted campaignby supporters of Israeli policy to have Jewish film-maker Jonathan Glazer cancelled. Actor Melissa Barrera wasdropped by a Hollywood production companyafter she posted on social media referring to “genocide” in Gaza. Multiple artists in Germany have had their exhibitions terminated for making entirely defensible critiques of the Israeli government. And the BBC recentlyrefused to showa remarkable documentary about Gaza’s health workers because its broadcast would have risked “theperceptionof partiality” (my italics). It was eventually shown to great acclaim on Channel 4.The BBC’s recent cowardice is the product of a wall of fear constructed by supporters of Israeli government policy, designed to punish those artists whose stories might mould a different culture, one with the power to radically change our politics. But that fear is abating.Take, for example, Together for Palestine, a concertto be held tonight at Wembley Arena– the huge indoor auditorium next to the stadium that hosted that Mandela birthday concert 37 years ago. I and others have been working for a year to bring the concert to life. Even finding a venue proved challenging: the mere mention of the word “Palestine” was a near-certain precursor to refusal. (I wonder what the reaction would have been had it been called Together for Ukraine?) But at some point in the past few months, something changed. Wembley signed a contract, YouTube finally consented to streaming the event, and – most importantly – artists agreed to appear.And so this evening, Wembley hosts the biggest cultural event in support of Palestinian rights since the destruction of Gaza began. Some 12,000 tickets sold out in two hours. Appearing on stage will be, among many others, Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Guy Pearce, musicians Bastille, James Blake, PinkPantheress and Damon Albarn – and Palestinian artists such as Saint Levant and Elyanna. The concert will be opened by Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories,recently sanctioned by the Trump administration.Five years ago, perhaps even as recently as this time last year, it would have been impossible to imagine dozens of notable global artists coming together to support Palestine. But the brutality of Israel’s assault on Gaza, itsdeliberate starvation of the population, and the unabashed public statements of Israeli ministers advocating ethnic cleansing have combined to create deep cracks in the wall of fear. I’m not sure the Israeli government, or indeed the wider Israeli populace, quite understands the extent to which the censorious policing of commentary around Palestine is breaking down. Indeed, the greater risk to some artists’ reputations may now come fromnotspeaking out on Palestine.One foundation of that wall of fear has been the association of the words “Palestine” and “terror” – the result of a deliberate, decades-long campaign to conflate the two. That same conflation was made in the 1980s with Nelson Mandela. Looking back now, it seems preposterous that debate around South African apartheid could have been so effectively policed by its proponents. But times change. What was once disputed can suddenly become suffused with moral clarity, with advocates for one side left stranded on the wrong side of history. In 2006 the then-Tory leader, David Cameron, said his fellow Conservatives were“wrong” in their approach to apartheid. He praised Mandela as “one of the greatest men alive.”Maybe one day future leaders of western political parties will issue a similar mea culpa for their complicity in the brutal violence currently being inflicted on Palestinian families. It will be too late to save manytens of thousandsof civilian victims of this war. But if there is a reckoning it might be, in part at least, because actors, artists, writers and musicians helped us to see Palestinians as human beings, as much deserving of respect and protection as their Israeli neighbours.As the Egyptian-Canadian writer Omar El Akkad says, one day everyone will have always been against this.Brian Eno is a musician, artist, composer and producerExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionBrian EnoPalestinian territoriesDamon AlbarnIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaNelson MandelacommentShareReuse this content"

It could and should be an art form for everyoneWed 17 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 05.05 EDTShareWhen I first suggested knocking on strangers’ doors and offering to write a poem for them, for nothing, on any subject of their choosing, the responses weren’t exactly enthusiastic. I’m from Heaton inNewcastleupon Tyne, where the project began. One day, I happened to mention it to a taxi driver as I travelled through Byker, near Newcastle city centre. “It would never work roundhere,” he said, pointing out of the window.The building he was pointing to was theByker Wall, an estate near where I live – I’ll admit it’s not the first place you’d visit on the hunt for a bard. When I told my friends and colleagues that I was planning to tryDoor-to-Door Poetryhere, they all made exactly the same sound – a Marge Simpson-esque expression of unease. I mentioned it to a trainee police officer who lived close to me. “Take some pepper spray and don’t carry any valuables,” she advised soberly. Having grown up on a council estate myself, I wasn’t as apprehensive as I might have been. But warnings like this still did a lot to rattle my nerves.When I arrived at the Byker Wall, the first person to answer was a man called Carl. He had bright blue eyes, a peaked baseball cap, and was wearing a Newcastle shirt. I performed an introductory poem for him while he stared back at me, completely expressionless. When I got to the end, I explained I could write him a poem about anything he wanted.“So what is important to you?” I asked. “Getting wrecked,” Carl replied. I could tell from the off that this was a “testing the boundaries” thing. I told Carl I would be more than happy to write a poem for him about getting wrecked. Whatever was important to him, really.Something in his face changed. “Will you write me one about how much I love my girlfriend?” he said. The conversation had gone from hardcore to sentimental in about three seconds.I wrote a poem for Carl about his and his partner’s first date. He told me he really enjoyed it. He was one of seven people who asked for a poem in the Byker Wall estate. And it was this hugely positive experience that set me off on a journey, one that would introduce me to a great many more residents in social housing and council estates across the land.In Boston, Lincolnshire, which has been dubbedEngland’s “most divided” town, I met five people on a street called Taverner Road. One of them was a woman named Pauline, who asked for a poem about“banger racing”, a sport that involves souping up secondhand cars and then crashing them into each other at great speed. I didn’t know anything about banger racing until that point, so the next day I went to watch some at Skegness Raceway before writing Pauline’s poem.On an estate in Moss Side, Manchester, I met a man who asked to be referred to as “the specialist”. I showed him my introductory poem and he shook my hand. “You’ve come to the right place,” he said. He told me what I was doing was freestyle, in the true sense of the word, before explaining that I resembled an 18th-century time traveller. I wrote him a poem about that.I visited estates across the country, and the response was always the same. Whether people were existing fans of poetry or not, so many of them stopped to listen, to chat about their lives and to gratefully receive the resulting poem.Towards the end of my adventures, in Jaywick, Essex – often described asthe “most deprived town” in England– I met Sarah, a woman with red hair and tattoos on her arms. She lamented the fact that the media only seemed to visit Jaywick to write a terrible story about it, and asked for a poem about its best side instead. This request led me to discover the beautiful beaches, as well as a fantastic fish and chip shop called Ozzy’s.Grief has always been my companion: poetry taught me how to live with it | Ali HammoudRead moreThe whole experience got me thinking about why we write poetry and who it is really for. In a world in which poetry is still seen by many as opaque and inaccessible, we discuss innovative ways to engage people with it. But it seems to me that another, more important issue is who we imagine will read the poem when it is finished. And how we want them to feel once they have.Trying my Door-to-DoorPoetryon a range of estates forced me to question some of my own preconceptions. It invited me to consider the fact that, in any given place, there is always a wide variety of people; that when we take the time to get to know someone, especially someone who lives their life differently to us, we are often embarking on a journey of self-discovery too. In a world that can feel increasingly divided and polarised, I am grateful to have had the chance to learn this – from house to house, poem to poem and door to door.On Visiting JaywickYes, Jaywick, I’ll confess my reservations.Your name I’d heard, your headlines I had read.I took the bus, explained my destination,The driver fixed me with a look of dread.But on that evening, walking on your beach,The sky was clear, the sun bobbed on the waves,The soft and golden sand was at my feet,Dog walkers smiled and went about their day.And honestly? It took me by surprise,Your natural beauty shook away my blues,I couldn’t help but pause and wonder whyThis scene had never featured on the news.For certain as each summer fades to brown,The tabloids yearly come here for a snapOf what they’ve dubbed a run-down, worthless town(Though who’s in charge of it, they never ask).They hunt for weeds and windows that need fixed,They hover round like poachers in the road,But do they stay for views as grand as thisBefore they pen their articles of woe?Because I know you have your problems, Jaywick.But people here are welcoming and kind.And Ozzy’s does the perfect fish and chips,Next to a pub that’s calledNever Say Die.But that won’t make the front page, nor the seaAs it glitters here above your coastal shelf,When papers only deal in misery,I’m pleased I found the truth out for myself.Rowan McCabe’s bookThe Door to Door Poet: My Adventures Across Englandwill be published on 18 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPoetryOpinionSocial housingNewcastleCreative writingCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Its conclusion is unsurprising, with few states in history having been so brazen about their intentions. To take just two examples: in May, theIsraeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”;a week later, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza, and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return”.At the beginning of this month, Labour’s deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary, David Lammy,wrote a letterto the chair of the international development committee, Sarah Champion, declaring that “the government has carefully considered the risk of genocide”, and has not concluded that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. How can two bodies come to such different endpoints? The British government has not come to a conclusion on genocide, because if it was to, it would have to face up to its complicity.Israel launches ground offensive deep inside Gaza CityRead moreAt the level of foreign and military policy, the British government works in alignment with the US, Israel’s strongest ally. The UK continues tosupply Israelwith crucial components for the F-35 jets incinerating Gaza and its people.Israeli planesinvolved in this bombing have been allowed to land in the UK. The UK government continuesto share intelligencewith Israel. Britain operatesrelentless surveillance flightsover Gaza. And rather than impose sweeping sanctions, British ministers facilitate trade withIsrael worth £6bna year.While Israeli president Isaac Herzog – whose genocidal utterances aboutcollective Palestinian guiltwere repeated by soldiers on the ground – is awarded thehonour of an official visit, hundreds of peaceful protesters holding placards opposing genocidehave been arrestedas though they are dangerous extremists.Every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public. After all,seven in 10 British peoplethink it’s likely Israel has committed war crimes,a majoritysupports an arms embargo,only a fifththink Israel’s attack on Gaza is justified,and over halfsupport Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sanctioning two of the most extreme Israeli ministers – the aforementioned Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – makes no impact on the state’s genocidal war machine, and recognising a Palestinian state amounts to nothing more than a welcome symbolic gesture.The lives of those living in Gaza are deemed less important than maintaining relations with Israel and, by proxy, the US. At the personal level, on Labour’s doorsteps, this approach plays out in the most callous of ways. Dalloul al-Neder is a Palestinian refugee from Gaza, who was a constituent of the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. He got to know her, meeting several times:she visited his takeaway shopin 2019 and posed for pictures, declaring “Palestine must be free”. She took him on a tour of parliament.View image in fullscreenDalloul al-Neder, who lives in Manchester, with an image of his late mother – he has lost several family members in Gaza bombings.Photograph: Sean Hansford/MEN MediaWithin weeks of the genocide beginning, in October 2023, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two young nieces were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Desperate to evacuate his wife and four-month-old daughter – who had been buried under rubble three times by Israeli attacks – he emailed Rayner twice to seek help evacuating his family. He says received no response.In January 2024, he attended a Labour fundraiser in Stockport addressed by Rayner and her colleague, Jonathan Reynolds, and got to his feet, clutching pictures of his dead mother, begging her to support a ceasefire, emotionally declaring “I lost my family in Gaza”. The whole tawdry episode is on camera: he was aggressively ejected from the meeting and on to the street. Rayner did nothing, except to say “thank you, you’ve made your point”. She then unfollowed him on social media. Days later, she wasinterviewed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby, who framed the incident as an example of the threats politicians face, linking it to the murder of the MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Since then, so many of Neder’s relatives have been slaughtered by the Israeli state that their names take up three pages of a notebook.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sun is shining, an ocean breeze rocks the tea trees and swarms of dragonflies dance outside my window. There is, however, a cloud over me as my mind keeps returning to the National Climate Risk Assessment (NCRA) released earlier in the week.I have been assessing climate risks and translating this into policy action for 35 years. Even for people like me, the National Climate Risk Assessment findings are confronting. They are also not new, nor alarmist.In 2022 and signed off by the then Coalition government, theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change statedthat Australia and New Zealand “faces an extremely challenging future” and “the projected warming under current global emissions reduction policies would leave many of the region’s human and natural systems at very high risk and beyond adaptation limits”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe report’s findings, however, are not the primary source of heaviness that weighs on me. Rather, it is my question: will our response match the scale of the risk we face?When Sussan Ley, who was the environment minister at the time, committed to developing this National Climate Risk Assessmentin 2021, it was initiated to “ensure there is a shared understanding among governments, businesses and communities of adaptation and resilience building priorities”. The intention was for this assessment to be updated regularly.The primary role of the National Climate Risk Assessment is not to make the case for emissions reductions but to inform Australia’s National Adaptation Plan. (There are a vast range of adaptation options ranging from information on how to cope with bushfires to hardening infrastructure to the managed retreat of whole communities from rising oceans.)Heatwaves caused more than 1,000 deaths in Australia over four-year period, study findsRead moreThat document, released alongside the National Climate Risk Assessment this week, has received next to no attention in the media over the last few days.The National Adaptation Plan sets out some real and tangible steps for national leadership on adaptation but, at this point,as Australia’s leading adaptation experts have highlighted, the actions don’t yet add up to the comprehensive plan the nation needs.For example, commonwealth support for ongoing climate disaster recovery efforts across Australia between 2019 and 2023 was $15.9bn. For comparison, budget commitments over the next five years towards Strengthening Medicare are $1.2bn, increased payments under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are $3.4bn and funding towards priority road and rail infrastructure projects are $2.9bn.The National Climate Risk Assessment estimates, conservatively, the commonwealth will increase 200-600% for disaster recovery with 2-3C of global warming.This issue points to a systemic challenge in Australia’s political system. Indeed, the National Climate Risk Assessment itself points toweaknessesin our institutions of government that contribute to the risks climate change poses to the people, the economy and the landscapes of Australia.How do we integrate adaptation across all ministerial portfolios, while climate impacts are already straining budgets and communities? How do we normalise and institutionalise conversations between governments on how to respond?On the positive, the plan highlights the synergies that can be created by integrating emissions reduction and adaptation.Climateworks Centreresearchshows, for example, that renovating existing housing stock to be more efficient can save households thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. Insurers are offeringlower premiumsto households that use simple tools to make their homes more fire or flood-proof.Labor reveals $1.1bn plan to replace petrol with fuels made from canola, sorghum and sugarRead moreImproving emissions and climate resilience outcomes at the same time makes sense.The Climate Change Authority, Australia’s independent expert adviser to the government and parliament,recommendedthat the Climate Change Act be updated to require regular national Climate Risk Assessments and Adaptation plans.Theyand theProductivity Commissionhave also recommended the authority be legislated and resourced to monitor progress on adaptation.Such changes have broad support from stakeholder groups ranging from those representingvulnerable people and communitiesto bodies representing the nation’slargest investors. It would also likely draw parliamentary support.Regular monitoring and updates to the National Climate Risk Assessment and the Adaptation Plan would give the community, business and investors confidence that the government will remain on task and be accountable for building a national response to the dangers we face.The National Adaptation Plan is a small but necessary first step in bringing climate adaptation into core decision-making. We are at the foothills of Everest. The plan takes a step towards resilience for community and economy but we have a long climb ahead of us and won’t get there without legislated resolve.Erwin Jackson is head of Australian programs at the Climateworks CentreExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

From her bed, flanked by pills and cigarettes, Ireland’s grande dame looks backWed 17 Sep 2025 11.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 12.47 EDTShareBrenda Fricker is sitting up in a bed plumped with pillows, wearing a sapphire blue blouse and a head of grey-golden ringlets. One bedside table has her medication, 25 pills a day. Another has a cup of water, an ashtray and her cigarettes. Above and on either side of her are shelves jammed with an eclectic hoard of books: Salman Rushdie, Edna O’Brien, Brian Aldiss, Alex Ferguson. Meanwhile, gazing out from framed black and white photographs on the walls, are writers, producers and actors from another era, plus a young, luminous Fricker herself.The current version of Fricker is 80 and not so well, happy to be interviewed but only from the bed of her Dublin home – not exactly a common setup with stars, but then she is no ordinary star. “I’m out of breath just talking,” she says. “I’ve never known tiredness ever in my life. Weary. Will I ever get up again?” She will, but the question is not entirely rhetorical. “I’m having a dreadful death,” she says. “I’m just dying, every day in pain.” This is said in a matter of fact tone, only to be undercut by a rueful prediction: “I’ll probably live to be 100.”When she was eight, the man who gave her elocution lessons made her expose herself as he masturbatedThe grande dame of Irish and British theatre, TV and cinema – Fricker was a staple ofCoronation StreetandCasualty,and won an Oscar forMy Left Footin 1990 – is an authority on survival. It is something of a miracle, in fact, that she made it into adulthood, let alone pensionable age. Fricker lit up the screen with warmth and light but her life was often cold and dark. At times she tried to end it, only to rediscover a hunger for love and joy and adventure. That spirit endures even though frailty has ambushed her and confined her to bed. She leans forward, blue eyes blazing. “Do everything while you’re young,” she says with fierce urgency. “Just do it.”Her younger self needed no urging. After stumbling into acting, she forged a remarkable career and collaborated with luminaries such as David Hare, Dirk Bogarde, Richard Harris andDaniel Day-Lewis, and in her Hollywood spell encountered Macaulay Culkin, Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. Her greatest affection is for London’s bohemian yesteryear. “It was a drinking culture,” she says. “Everybody was pissed most of the time. Happy days.”View image in fullscreen‘It was like I’d jumped in a pigsty. I met Donald Trump in an elevator after and he was very polite about it’ … Fricker as the ‘pigeon lady’ in Home Alone 2.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe reason for this interview, however, is Fricker’s new memoir,She Died Young: A Life in Fragments, which reveals a life scarred by abuse and sexual assault. Her parlous health means we rendezvous at her terrace home in the Liberties, an area of Dublin’s inner city. It is a bright and airy place, jumbled with books, plants, a dog and mementoes, including her Oscar, which props open a bathroom door. Carers visit daily. “They’re so good. Great, great women,” says Fricker.I sit down, a copy of her book peeking from my bag. “Did you read it?” she asks. I nod. “Oh God, this is terrifying,” she adds. “I don’t know how to do interviews about this.” The motivation for the memoir was not ego but money – to end a tangled saga of disputed debt – and it took four years of hard graft. “Every line I deleted and started again. It was murder for me. It was kind of ironic because I was talking about things I had paid a fortune to psychiatrists to make me forget. So it was very painful bringing them back. I thought they were a bit morbid. I think I’m a bit morbid. I’mIrish.”Harvey Weinstein put his arms around me and I thought I'd vomitFricker was born in 1945 and grew up in the south Dublin suburb of Dundrum. Her father, Desmond, a journalist with the Irish Times and RTÉ, was an aloof, detached figure with his nose forever in a book. Her mother Bina was a schoolteacher who would on occasion erupt and assault Brenda. “She’d beat the shit out of me.” Decades later, doctors detected a brain tumour that they said might have caused erratic behaviour.Despite love and solace from relatives in Kerry and her free spirited, sparky older sister Gránia, Fricker was an anxious child prone to bed-wetting. At the age of eight, she befriended a 30-year-old bachelor – the memoir calls him Séamus S – from a theatre group. When he offered private elocution lessons, her delighted parents delivered her each week to his home.View image in fullscreen‘I mean, we all have a method’ … Fricker with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesPerched on his sofa, she devoured cake while he taught her poems and read her books and answered her myriad questions. And then, over time, he had her hitch up her skirt and expose herself while he masturbated. The memoir, however, defends him. “So many of the happiest hours of my childhood were spent with him … our secret was the price I had to pay for the deep friendship that we shared.”I tell her that is shocking. She waseight. She nods. She accepts that she was groomed yet has no regrets. “It was a good deal for me because I was getting so much from him. I was a bright little kid, you know, curious about everything, and he never hurt me. He never touched me, he never frightened me.”Fricker does not imply any connection but from the age of 10 she became obsessed by blood and blades and began to cut and scar herself as a way to assert some control, to have another secret. When she was 14, a horrific bicycle accident – she hurtled face-first through a car windscreen – landed her in hospital for two agonising years. The driver was to blame but his political connections meant the incident was hushed up, she says.Fricker had excelled at Latin and algebra but the accident derailed schooling and she left without any qualifications, which bequeathed a lifelong inferiority complex. “A chip this size,” she says, arcing a hand over a shoulder. Decades of voracious reading have not filled the void. “It still wounds me. That’s how deep it goes.”Her memoir details a rape by an English actor named James Donnelly who, like Fricker, starred on Coronation StreetAged 17, she was raped at a party, an act of violence and cruelty that left her “broken”. Trapped in a cycle of depression, self-harm and suicide attempts, she was institutionalised multiple times. Yet a zest for life endured. She dabbled in journalism, au paired in Spain and got a role on the Dublin stage, which led to theatre and television work on both sides of the Irish Sea.And then violence again found her. The memoir graphically details a rape by an English actor named James Donnelly. Like Fricker, he starred on Coronation Street, but at a different time, and died in 1992. When I mention the name, she goes quiet and reaches for a cigarette. “He was a bastard, yeah.” She did not report the assault to police. “Girls get raped and they’re ashamed of themselves. You think it’s your fault. You really do.”Fricker welcomed the #MeToo movement as an overdue reckoning for abusers but has little confidence in much changing, saying: “It’ll go on for ever.”Which brings us toHarvey Weinsteinand My Left Foot. In 1989, she played the mother in this biopic of Christy Brown, a working-class Dubliner with cerebral palsy who became an acclaimed painter and writer. Weinstein championed the low-budget indie under his Miramax banner, leading to five Oscar nominations. Fricker lauds his promotional genius but still shudders at meeting him. “He put his arms around me and I thought I’d vomit. He just emanated something off. He was just disgusting, like a big, sweating pig.”View image in fullscreenOn the way up … in a scene from Casualty.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesDaniel Day-Lewis won best actor for playing Brown and Fricker won best supporting actress, a triumph that put Irish cinema on the map. For the girl from Dundrum, it was surreal – she rode in gigantic limousines and filled a suitcase with pilfered Beverly Hills hotel spoons as mementoes.Hollywood roles followed, including in the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.Macaulay Culkinwas a charming, beautiful kid, and spoiled rotten by those around him, she says. “Of course he ended up on drugs, what else would he do?” Playing a homeless pigeon-lover, Fricker ended each day “covered in pigeon shit”. Returning to her suite at New York’s Plaza hotel one evening, she met Donald Trump in the elevator. “It was like I’d jumped into a pigsty but he was very polite about it. He just said, ‘How’s it going?’”Her career thrived but loss and grief never released their hold. She had a miscarriage and, without her permission, doctors removed her womb, so she never had children. Marriage to the film director Barry Davies ended in divorce. Her adored sister Gránia died an alcoholic at the age of 68, which inspired the title of Fricker’s memoir. Through it all, Fricker continued working: The Field,Veronica Guerin, I Married an Axe Murderer, Cloudburst, more than 30 films. A forthcoming feature called The Swallow, by Tadhg O’Sullivan, may be her swansong.Falls, broken bones, swollen joints, aches and fatigue keep her in bed. Unable to sleep at night, she binge-watchesThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “It’s better than sex,” she says. “It’s better than getting drunk. I just love it.”Yet a passion for her craft endures, indomitable. She has not quite forgiven Day-Lewis for remaining in character – in a wheelchair, grunting – for the entire shoot of My Left Foot. A disruptive indulgence, she says. “I’m fond of him. A good man, great morals. But he’s a fucking method actor. I mean, we all have a method. I don’t mind another method actor but if they interfere with my little method, then fuck off, like, you know?” Fricker sighs and smiles. “I’ll be getting a phone call from Daniel. He phones me on occasion, tells me I’m being bold.”As I leave Fricker in her bed, a tousled queen in her Dublin kingdom looking back on eight extraordinary decades, it’s not a verdict I would quibble with.She Died Young: A Life in Fragments by Brenda Fricker is out tomorrow.In the UK andIreland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

I didn’t know what he was doing. Turned out he was writing a poem about me. I still have it’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 17 Sep 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 13.25 EDTShareIdrove a cab inNew Yorkfor three decades. Riding around, I would meet poets, drag queens and other people who were inspiring. It made me feel good. I started taking their portraits, sometimes with me in the picture. I had several cameras and would often have my strobe hooked on to my visor with a rubber band.This particular evening, in 1990, I had been informed by a friend that there was a book event going on so I went to take a look. It was jam-packed inside. I spotted Allen Ginsberg, so I went over and talked to him a little. He was pretty intense, kind of stressed, so I had to lay back a little but I asked him if he could write an introduction to my book In My Taxi. But he had too much going on.I went out, got in my cab and started driving off, but then I thought: “Hey, I think I’ll cruise back.” People were coming out of the building and I spotted Allen. I guess he recognised me. I was a pain in the ass to him, probably. Anyway he came over and got into my cab – a great, real, joyful moment.I photographed him alone too, but the idea was for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that pictureI stopped at the Bowery to let him out and he was looking at the meter where I have this tape coming out of it, for receipts. He said: “Hand me that tape.” So I tore it off and handed it to him. He’s looking down. I don’t know what he’s doing, but I’m not gonna rush him. A little more time with Allen. Turns out he was writing this poem about me, which I still have.I don’t call myself an artist, I leave that up to the audience. I went to college in southern California, and then Berkeley, for graduate work, and I was doing lithographs and photography. I got to New York in 1980. The rent was unaffordable but nothing was going to deter me from going to the city. I saw some crazy places – one guy was showering in the kitchen sink – but finally I found an ad in the New York Times for a place for $250 a month. I went to see it and was met by this real jovial, heavy-set man. The floor was dirt and it was 250 sq ft. Oh my God, I’d never seen anything like that in my life – but it was manifest destiny, because my dark room fitted into its east corner and right up to the window, so I had fresh air whenever I opened it.Another manifest destiny was that I had a neighbour who drove a cab. When he would hear me opening the door, he’d open his and we’d have a friendly conversation. One day, he says to me: “Do you want to go out with me tonight in the cab?” I said: “Oh my God, yeah, yeah.” So I went out and the rest is history, man. I applied for a hack license.My taxi portraits started with a Latino guy wearing a black kind of derby hat. He had a nice presence about him. I looked at him and said hey. I was nervous. This was my first time I’d taken my camera and equipment with me and he let me photograph him. That was the beginning and it just went crazy, man. I was constantly bombarded with opportunities. I would pick up a fare or maybe something was happening and I’d notice it and take a shot or two, then I’m gone. Or I would drop someone off and there would be something there, some sort of a billboard, a picture of a lady or whatever and the composition all came together. Sometimes, if my equipment wasn’t working properly, I would give the strobe to the passengers and say: “Hey, when you hear the click of my camera, hit the strobe.” So we’d have a dual thing going on.When I had Ginsberg in my cab, I photographed him alone too, but the idea was mainly for me to be there as well. I wanted to really romance that picture, put my feelings there. I called it Allen Ginsberg, offering me up a fortune cookie.Ryan Weideman’s work is atParis Photo, 13-16 November, with the Bruce Silverstein gallery.Ryan Weideman’s CVBorn:Oklahoma, 1941Trained:California College of Arts & CraftsInfluences:“William Klein and Ansel Adams.”High point:“Getting my first review – a really fantastic one – in the New York Times.”Low point:“I don’t know how to answer this.

PicturesMoviesReviewOne Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperAnderson updates Thomas Pynchon for the era of Ice roundups, pitting shaggy revolutionary Leonardo DiCaprio against cartoonish forces of reactionPeter BradshawWed 17 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 12.33 EDTShareOne of the great creative bromances has flowered again: Paul Thomas Anderson and Thomas Pynchon. Having adapted Pynchon’sInherent Vicefor the screen in 2015, Anderson has now taken a freer rein with his 1990 novel Vineland, creating a bizarre action thriller driven by pulpy comic-book energy and transformed political indignation, keeping his pedal at all times welded to the metal.It’s a riff on the now recognisable Anderson-Pynchonian idea of counterculture and counter-revolution, absorbing the paranoid style of American politics into a screwball farcical resistance, with a jolting, jangling, nerve-shredding score byJonny Greenwood. It’s partly a freaky-Freudian diagnosis of father-daughter dysfunction – juxtaposed with the separation of migrant children and parents at the US-Mexico border – and a very serious, relevant response to the US’s secretive ruling class and its insidiously normalised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) roundups: the toxic new Vichyite Trump enthusiasm.Pynchon imagined the subversiveness of the 60s having its contested sequel in the Reaganite 80s; Anderson brings the time gap between these eras into the present day, although there isn’t the a cultural distinction between what are evidently the last days of Obama and contemporary Trump pomp. Specific references such as Maga and BLM aren’t mentioned.Leonardo DiCaprio is Bob, a dishevelled revolutionary, who is to become even more dishevelled in the future when he will do a great deal of panicky running through the streets in his dressing gown, whining that he has nowhere to charge his phone. Bob is part of a heavily armed activist cell that attacks migrant holding prisons on the Mexican border; Bob’s (humble) job is to set off fireworks as a diversionary-slash-celebratory tactic, and he is less important than his comrades, such as badass Deandra (Regina Hall) and cerebral Howard (played in cameo by composer and Yale academic Paul Grimstad).Bob is passionately devoted to his partner and charismatic comrade, interestingly named Perfidia (Teyana Taylor). And Bob is not the only one. When the group attack the military compound, Perfidia captures and humiliates the aggressively reactionary Col Steven Lockjaw – played bySean Pennwith all manner of lizardly head-jerking, chin-jutting geezer mannerisms – who clearly derives sexual excitement from the whole business, and his creepy, cartoony unwholesomeness is another driving force. With the cold calculation of a born leader, Perfidia sees how she can toy with Lockjaw’s infatuation, using him to control and divert military opposition. Does she take it too far? Does the idea of taking things too far in fact have any meaning in this context? Perfidia deafeningly firing an assault rifle while in the ninth month of her pregnancy is one of the film’s most amazing images.It is poor, befuddled Bob’s destiny to bring up a daughter he thinks is his, as a single dad. Sixteen-year-old Willa (Chase Infiniti) is as smart and focused as her mom, instructed in martial arts by her sensei (Benicio del Toro), while Bob gets more messed up on drugs and booze all day, watchingPontecorvo’s The Battle of Algierson TV, grumpily refusing to remember her friends’ preferred pronouns. But the forces of darkness encircle them once more, and when his old revolutionary friends re-emerge to contact him, Bob realises his brain is too fried to remember the all-important code words on the phone. As for Willa, she is now stuck with troubled thoughts about her mother and a mortifying question concerning Bob and Lockjaw, like the heroine of Mamma Mia! The Movie.One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen – an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream?Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.One Battle After Another is out on 25 September in Australia, and on 26 September in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmPaul Thomas AndersonThomas PynchonLeonardo DiCaprioBenicio del ToroSean PennJonny GreenwoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

The actor said he had rewatched All the President’s Men in 2021 and was “taken aback at how appropriate it was, how timely it was, and how little has really changed. We don’t have Nixon any more, we have Trump.”Redford added: “We live in a country where we can’t call ourselves the United States of America. We just can’t. We’re the Divided States of America because of the political parties and they’re so robust in their anxieties.”Redford also commented directly on Trump, after Woodward suggested Trump was trying to destroy democracy. “[Trump] doesn’t understand [democracy]. So it’s easy for him to destroy it. It’s easy to destroy something you don’t understand. You can claim it doesn’t exist.”Explore more on these topicsRobert RedfordBob WoodwardDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Its effects are cumulative. The Histories charts the 69-year-old painter’s intellectual as well as practical development, his themes, his switches of media and of focus and attention. Everything is here for a reason.How engaging Marshall’s art is, from the first. He takes us from the bar to the bedroom, to the Middle Passage, from the studio to the academy, from the beauty parlour to the dancehall. He paints scenes of kidnappings and of enslavement in Africa and of a black cop sitting on the hood of his squad car – I love the jagged stylised flare of the streetlights in the background. Marshall knows that everything is contended and complex and that there are no innocent images. Pustules of paint, like litter between the blocks, decorate the spaces between the housing projects, like flowers blooming in a riot. On an idyllic day in the park, black folks picnic, practise a golf swing, play croquet, water-ski on the lake and listen to the Temptations, the lyrics floating up like ticker tape from radios on a sunny afternoon. It is an absurd, impossible image. The humour in Marshall’s art is not to be underestimated. In a series devoted to the Middle Passage a Baptist flounders. There are water slides and swimming pools, ocean liners and toy boats and a woman about to dive from a board. The water is filled with drowned maps of Africa and carefully rendered fish, and there’s an exhortation to plunge.View image in fullscreenDetails constantly arrest … Kerry James Marshall, Knowledge and Wonder, 1995.Photograph: Patrick L Pyszka/© Kerry James MarshallThe key early work here, and one that led to several variations, is Marshall’s 1980 egg tempera on paper A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self. The title alludes to James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and the slanting hat, tipped back on the subject’s head, may also echo Wyndham Lewis’s Tyro, from 1921. Gap-toothed and wide-eyed, a black face grins wildly. Dressed in black and wearing a black fedora, he looms from a black background. Only the white triangle of shirt at his collar, those eyes and that smile, punctuate the dark. This small work on paper is cartoonish, but also reserved and confrontational, bounded by a white mat in a black frame. He repainted it as an image-within-an-image, hung on a red wall above an old-fashioned upright vacuum cleaner, and called it Portrait of the Artist and a Vacuum. Where does the artist belong? Where’s their milieu, their audience, their culture? Studying at Otis in California, where painting seemed to be definitively over, there was little if any acknowledgment of the artist’s blackness, or of the importance of art to a wider, let alone a wider black, audience. But Marshall was showing that even an old-fashioned egg tempera portrait was as conceptual as anything else. It is an essay in blackness, and also alludes to Ralph Ellison’s 1947 novel Invisible Man. These paintings were both an end point and the beginning of a career in which he has become the pre-eminent painter of black American life.BlackPainting(2003) depicts a bedroom at night, the details only becoming apparent as your eyes adjust to the close-toned gloom. The painting is not black, but filled with tiny shifts in the darkness. Adjustments. There are bulks in there, shifts, bodies troubled in sleep. The viewer’s eye roams the gloom, an interloper, hovering by the pillow, noting the copy of Angela Davis’s If They Come in the Morning. What and who do the sleepers dread? It is a painting that waits and waits, a singularity amid an overwhelming multiplicity of signs, of innumerable crisp and telling details. Marshall’s art rewards attention, to its larger social and political themes, its momentous occasions and to its smaller stories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And don’t forget the shoes: so many closely observed sneakers, mules, sandals, slip-ons, pumps and high heels. Even at his loosest, Marshall insists on the particular. There’s no end to the invention or the details that constantly arrest you.There are near monochromes and sly plays on abstract expressionism, couplings in the park, an Afrofuturist family evening on an interstellar spaceship and a woman with amazing hair happily nursing a drink in a bar. A guy sweeps the stage in a cavernous hall, where a woman stands in effortless emulation of the sad-eyed girl at the counter inManet’s 1882 Bar at the Folies-Bergère. Marshall’s figure clutches her bag and waits, but for what or who we do not know. Like Manet’s barmaid, she’s a witness to her time.A naked guy, dressed only in a jock strap, poses as though for a life class, one arm raised in a Black power salute. On a worktable nearby rests a woman’s handbag and a small doll, apparently ankisi nkondifigure from the Kongo people of central Africa. Already there’s too much to resolve. And what of the knotted rope, rendered in glitter, dropping from above, or the big abstract canvases shunted to the edge of the painting, beyond the white and red and patterned drapes? And we haven’t yet mentioned the model’s blackness, his near impenetrable silhouette, the barely discernible lineaments of his body and face, his big hair, his unknowable expression. You could almost pick up the yellow glass on the table, the bag or the bunch of keys, but the model is somehow out of reach.View image in fullscreenUnknowable expression … Kerry James Marshall, The Academy, 2012.Photograph: courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York/© Kerry James Marshall.And so it goes, from painting to painting, from the studied portraits to the figures in motion, the naked guy lying on the bed, holding the red, black and green Pan-African flag over his genitals (my eyes snag on his patterned socks); the elderly ladies in their parlours, golden-winged like angels at an annunciation, with appliqué “we mourn our loss” tasselled hangings commemorating Martin Luther King, JFK and Bobby Kennedy. Little black kids and teenagers look at art in the museum, and two female black artists, their brushes hovering over palettes heavy with moiled and drooling piles of pigments, look as though they’re threatening to paint us.Many of the larger paintings are unstretched, fixed to the wall with grommets – like the paintings of Leon Golub, one of many ghosts at the feast of Marshall’s art, which is full of licks and nods to other artists. But it is the specifics that finally grab you. Seagulls catch the light on their wings, floating over the small boats drawn up on the shore, awaiting their human cargo destined for the Americas. Marshall’s paintings are filled with the imagined, the feared, the remembered, the repressed and the invented. They’re woven through with black history and culture, with aspiration and loss, a distant past that won’t go away and an entangled present. Everything is always impending. By turns ragged and precise, offhand and offbeat and concise, Marshall’s art is as necessary as it is unmissable.At the Royal Academy, London, 20 September to 18 January 2026Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

From Street Fighter’s “hadouken!” to Call of Duty’s “remember, no Russian” to BioShock’s “would you kindly?”, there are phrases so creepy, clever or cool they have slipped imperceptibly into the gaming lexicon, ensuring that whenever they’re memed on social media, almost everyone gets the reference.But there are also odd little phrases, sometimes from obscure games, that stick with us for seemingly no reason. I recall most of the vocal barks from the second world war strategy game Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, even though I haven’t played it for 20 years. Why is it that I’ll lose my headphones, wallet and phone on a daily basis, but I have absolute recall when it comes to the utterances of burly soldier Samuel Brooklyn? Why am I doomed to “Finally, some action”, “Consider it done, boss” and the immortal “okey dokey” echoing through my head? What is wrong with me?Fortunately, when Iposted about this on Bluesky, I discovered I was not alone. Hundreds of gamers got back to me about the random game dialogue lodged in their own heads. Some were lesser-known quotes from famous titles: comic book writer Kieron Gillen is haunted by the line “I’ve not seen such bravery” from Gauntlet, while video game academic Kat Brewster wrote that she thinks about the game’s “ah, sustenance!” line all the time. Matthew Castle, of the gaming podcastThe Back Page, simply cannot forget the way Beedlesays thank youin The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Game designer and artist Anna Hollinrake cannot escape the voice of the random Pokémon trainer who said: “Whether hot to trot or cool cat not, chill at my papa’s shop.” “It runs around in my head again and again,” she said. “Drives me mad.”Some games came up again and again. Worms, Grand Theft Auto, House of the Dead and Monkey Island seem to be filled with memorable lines, sometimes because they’re funny, but often because they’re simply ludicrous. One fan of Bungie’s shooter Marathon has been unable to forget the phrase “Frog blast the vent core!”, only later discoveringits strange origin. Many players had adopted these lines of dialogue into their every day lives – several respondents admitted to thinking “wizard needs food badly” whenever they open the fridge door.View image in fullscreenIn my head … Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.Photograph: Pyro StudiosSo why have so many obscure lines remained in our brains all these years? Partly it’s about sheer repetition: in a 20-hour action-adventure game filled with non-player characters, you’re going to hear the same “barks” (quick pieces of NPC dialogue that express surprise or provide contextual information) over and over again. This is why so many people recall everything the merchant says in Resident Evil 4 – by the end of the game, you’ve heard “What’re ya buyin’?” several hundred times. There is also an element of echolalia, the repetition of certain comforting words and sounds as an act of self-soothing.Gamesare built around rhythm and repetition, so it is perhaps natural for us to adopt elements of these patterns into our lives.Game dialogue can also become an in-joke with friends, enforcing bonds and shared interests and memories in the same way as quoting pieces of movie dialogue. Bluesky user Steve O’Gorman wrote this about F-Zero GX: “Samurai Goroh’s line delivery of ‘You stole the prize money from us last time’ while flailing his arms has randomly stuck with my friendship group for 20+ years.” With video games, our own subjective experiences in the worlds can often be as memorable and valuable as the intended narratives. Sometimes, the idea that we could be the only player to have encountered an obscure character, or heard a specific snatch of dialogue, creates a connection with the game that becomes personal.I don’t think I have a deep connection with tough Samuel Brooklyn, despite the number of times I sent him to his death while he yelled the immortal words: “No problem, man.” But clearly, I was going through something when I was playing that game, or I was just amused by the disparity between the seriousness of the fight against the Nazis and the daft, repetitive phrases that accompanied my every mouse click. We never really know what makes a moment of our life memorable, or why a line from an old episode of Gilmore Girls, Twin Peaks or Scarface sticks around in our subconscious. But it’s nice to know we’re not alone with our weird little aural collections.What to playView image in fullscreenScoundrel’s tale … Star Wars Outlaws.Photograph: UbisoftUnfairly maligned on its original release and now available in a lush Nintendo Switch 2 conversion,Star Wars Outlawsis one of my favourite ever Star Wars games. Choosing to eschew all the mysticism and vainglorious posturing of Jedi lore in favour of a scoundrel-turned-resistance hero story, it’s an exciting romp across familiar planets, against familiar Imperial bad guys.The design of the worlds and the various bases and spacecraft you explore is incredible, capturing the slightly battered futurism of those early Ralph McQuarrie concept sketches, and the dialogue is often genuinely funny. Lead character Kay Vess is a nobody in the Star Wars canon, but that’s the whole point, and the relationships she forges on her quest to pull off the ultimate heist against the Empire reflect the themes and ideals of the original movie. For such a big story, the Switch 2 screen makes a wonderful venue, allowing you to carry a whole galaxy with you wherever you go.Available on:PC, PS5, Switch 2, XboxEstimated playtime:25+ hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenBugged out … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryEurogamer haskicked off a series of featuresabout contentious topics in video game design, and the first looks at the subject ofboss runbacks– ie the length of space and gameplay between a checkpoint and a boss battle. Silksong has been challenging (frustrating?) gamers with its lengthy, often difficult runbacks, which can seem like a sadistic insult after you’ve failed a boss fight for the 56th time. But are they, in fact, a legitimate part of the rhythm of games? In my opinion, they are theworst, but don’t get me started.I didn’t think I’d ever link to the United Nations on this newsletter, but the organisation hasjust featured a pieceabout video games anddemocracyon its website to mark the International Day of Democracy (15 September).

Too successful to be persecuted by the politburo but largely forgotten when he died, his music is being revived by a new archival seriesMiloš HrochWed 17 Sep 2025 08.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 09.06 EDTShareZdeněk Liška became one of the eastern bloc’s pioneers of electroacoustic music by accident. After breaking through making music for ads and animations, the revolutionary film-makers of the 1960s Czechoslovak new wave asked him to soundtrack their movies, which he took as his greatest inspirations. With the help of radio engineering enthusiasts at Czechoslovakia’s film powerhouse, Barrandov Studios, he could imitate the whoosh of a spaceship or birds chirping. He composed underwater electroacoustic symphonies and music to be played on typewriters. Despite his innovations, he famously proclaimed: “I only write music under the pictures.”Liška was as productive as he was innovative: from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, he would score eight feature films a year, as well as numerous shorts and TV series. He could go camp or avant garde, channel Disney-like beauty and loved a waltz. His peers recall him composing on the night train or sketching the next cue while the orchestra was still recording the last one. Czechs from across the generations can whistle some of his melodies, such as the carnival-style theme from crime series The Sinful People of Prague.The longer he worked, the more he saw things in these films that their directors hadn’t even noticed. Liška scored 10 of surrealist directorJan Švankmajer’s short films. “He didn’t attempt to go with the mood of the film,” the director once said. “He was able to discover rhythms that even directors weren’t aware of.” Liška would compose with a stopwatch at the editing table, and often took on the additional role of film editor, suggesting cuts to fit his music. No other musical figure could match his influence on the Czech socialist film industry.Zdeněk Liška: Ikarie XB​-​1 – videoFinders Keepers label head Andy Votel first discovered Liška through the Czechoslovak new wave, and later rereleased his scores for Ikarie XB-1 and The Little Mermaid. He likens his impact to that ofEnnio Morricone. “He was solely committed to the film score medium and should be credited as someone who revolutionised how film music is made, despite his music being behind politically landlocked,” he says. He also sees parallels between Liška and electronic music pioneerDaphne Oram: “They were here to communicate with emotion and humour. The process was merely a vessel. But in Liška’s case, the history books, via the setbacks of socialist secrecy, are in need of a remix.”When Liška died of complications resulting from diabetes in 1983, aged just 61, his work had been almost forgotten. During his lifetime, only two records of his music – including his score for the 1965 Oscar-winning movie The Shop on the Main Street – were released. He wasn’t interested in live concert presentations, believing the sound shouldn’t be disconnected from the vision. He also produced communist propaganda, which complicated his legacy for Czechs.More than 40 years later, archivists and composers have been restoring his reputation. His music has been staged live on numerous occasions, including by the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Scholars study his electroacoustic inventions, his famous editing table is on display at the Czech Museum of Music and a 2017 Czech documentary, Music by Zdeněk Liška, told younger Czechs his story and underscored the reverence in which he is held. Last year, the Czech label Animal Music launched an archival vinyl series of Liška’s work, promising to open up his archive and release a new album every year. The first was dedicated to his collaborations with Švankmajer; the second, Music to Films by František Vláčil, arrives this month.View image in fullscreenA scene from Karel Kachyna’s 1975 adaptation of The Little Mermaid, scored by Liška.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPetr Ostrouchov is the label’s curator and composer. Compiling these releases has been a challenge that entails trying to get inside Liška’s head. “Thanks to the trust of the family, I was able to study his sheet music and understand his compositional logic a bit better,” he says. “Later, I was entrusted with access to his personal archive, and I retrieved digitised tapes from an old computer sitting in one recording studio’s cellar in Prague.” For each volume, Ostrouchov digs unnamed files from the hard drive and compares them with the film and sheet music. “A bit of detective work,” he says.Liška was born to a mining family in central Bohemia in 1922. His father led the miners’ brass band, giving Liška a close connection to music (and inspiring the countless brass motifs in his scores). After the second world war, he began his career at the Baťa shoe factory and its film studios in Zlín, far from his home town, where he composed music for commercials. (The studios were originally founded as the factory’s marketing department, but after the company was nationalised by communists and the city renamed to Gottwaldov, it continued separately as a counterpart to Barrandov.) Liška honed his craft on puppet stories by Hermína Týrlová, a Czech animation film pioneer, and befriended her then assistant, Karel Zeman, whose steampunk style can be seen in the craft of Terry Gilliam and Tim Burton.After the award-winning success of Zeman’s adaptation of Jules Verne’s Invention for Destruction, Liška became Czechoslovakia’s number one film composer, in demand by the likes of Věra Chytilová and Juraj Herz. The government also took notice. During the Normalisation after 1968, when four Warsaw Pact countries jointly invaded the country, Liška composed a symphony celebrating the Persian empire for Iran’s Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and scored the TV detective series 30 Cases of Major Zeman, a propagandist project overseen by the communist ministry of the interior. But he never joined the party or any artistic union. As a composer, he didn’t feel the same pressure as directors or writers.View image in fullscreenA scene from Ikarie XB-1, 1963.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“I think he was neutral to the regime,” says Liška’s oldest daughter, Hana. “He composed no matter the political system, and he was left to do his job, because his music was an important export and brought significant money back.” (The state agency Art Centrum arranged for him to work on multiple international expos, among other jobs for western countries. Liška also soundtracked expos in Montreal, Canada, and Osaka in Japan.) Prague Symphony Orchestra programme director and longstanding Liška scholar Martin Rudovský suggests that he was a “conformist”, albeit one who “doubted, in private, some of the propaganda films or TV series he scored. Certainly, he was not in opposition, for instance, as composers like Jan Novák.”Liška was making capitalist money in communist times, which attracted the attention of the politburo, but Liška was too successful to be persecuted. “Having a microwave or washing machine – let alone a swimming pool – was an unimaginable luxury for many at the time,” his daughter Barbora remembers. But not for Liška’s family. “We were used to these odd things.”At the end of Liška’s life, his daughters remember him spending “more time between hospitals and the recording studio than anywhere else”, until his death in July 1983. His legacy trickled through the iron curtain. Julian House – Ghost Box Records co-founder and then art student – had his first encounter with Liška when the Brothers Quay’s 1984 stop-motion short filmThe Cabinet of Jan Švankmajer, a surrealist tribute to the director that featured Liška’s music, was shown in the UK. “Liška’s compositions seem to have strange angles; they fit together in an odd way,” he says. House is also a graphic designer: “Something about them reminds me of collage, similarly to the film posters of the Czech new wave.”When the Berlin Wall came down, Oscar-winning film editor Joe Walker, a close collaborator of Denis Villeneuve, started noticing Liška’s name attached to many extraordinary films, he says. “It became, for me, a guarantee of quality. For a few years, when the editing work I hoped for was out of reach, I wrote music for documentaries, dramas and lots of children’s programmes. I tried to honour Liška every day by providing a diet of good music – serving up advanced harmony and jagged rhythms – even when the images were relatively banal.”Trailer for the documentary Music by Zdeněk Liška – videoVisionary composer, polymath and ‘true cosmopolitan’: Greece finally pays tribute to Iannis XenakisRead moreAnimal Music’s newest archival volume presents two lesser-known scores from Liška’s late career, collaborations with director František Vláčil. It’s personal for the curator, Ostrouchov: Vláčil’s 1967 existential medieval tale Markéta Lazarová introduced him to Liška in the early 1990s, when the movie won a critics’ poll for the greatest Czech movie of the century. Liška’s darkly ambient score pairs monumental choral music with tape manipulations and distant screams and whispers. (It’s so epic and timeless that the contemporary Czech post-hardcore band Lvmen have sampled bits of the score on every one of their albums since 1999, bringing Liška’s legacy into punk venues.) His score for Vláčil’s 1976 Smoke on the Potato Fields is the complete opposite, using melancholic string arrangements to tenderly guide the narrative about an émigré doctor who returns home in his twilight years.The archive still presents a gargantuan task for the future: Ostrouchov is imagining albums focusing on Liška’s music for documentaries or children’s programmes. His dream is to release Liška’s score to the questionable detective series 30 Cases of Major Zeman. “Liška scored a lot of schlock, but on the musical side, it was always ingenious,” he says. “He never phoned in.”Music to Films by František Vláčil (Archives Vol 2) is out now on Animal MusicExplore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicCzech RepublicSlovakiaElectronic musicClassical musicCommunismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You know, it’s not Bobby Gillespie or Gwen Stefani, it’s fuckingCilla Black. I’ve got no idea how she ended up there, but I’ve heard since that she was apparently a bit of a party animal.”It seems fair to say that a visit from Our Cilla was not what Melton expected when he started Nag Nag Nag in London in 2002. A former member of 80s goth band Specimen who DJed under the name Jonny Slut, he’d been inspired by a fresh wave of electronic music synchronously appearing in different locations around the world. Germany had feminist collective Chicks on Speed and DJ Hell with his groundbreaking label International DeeJay Gigolos. France produced Miss Kittin and The Hacker, Vitalic and Electrosexual. Britain spawned icy electro-pop quartet Ladytron and noisy, sex-obsessed trio Add N To (X). Canada spawned Tiga and Merrill Nisker, who abandoned the alt-rock sound of her debut album Fancypants Hoodlum and, with the aid of a Roland MC-505 “groovebox”, reinvented herself asPeaches. New York had performance art inspired duo Fischerspooner and a collection of artists centred around DJ and producer Larry Tee, who gave the sound a name: electroclash.The lyrics tended to be witty, occasionally foul-mouthed and very camp. The sound had house music, techno, 80s synth-pop and electro in its DNA, but boasted a rough-hewn, punky edge, the latter partly down to attitude and partly down to the era’s technological advances. “It isn’t like today, where you can take an idea to a playable version in five hours on a laptop,” says Larry Tee, “but you could record something releasable in your bedroom, you could get a Juno 106 [synthesizer] and alter the sounds and fry and burn them. I’m convinced the best electroclash tracks happened because people made mistakes, the levels were too loud or there was something wrong.”View image in fullscreenSweat and sparkle … Casey Spooner of Fischerspooner.Photograph: John Sciulli/Getty ImagesIt was audibly a reaction to something. In Britain, it felt a world apart from the increasingly slick dance scene of superclubs and superstar DJs. In New York, Larry Tee suggests it was a shift away from “trance and tribal house”. For Peaches, who had recorded her 2000 album The Teaches of Peaches in her bedroom, “lying in bed, smoking weed, masturbating and making beats”, it was music made by “marginalised, queer people … who were fed up with a system that was telling us ‘rock music has to be by four beautiful boys down the line from the Rolling Stones, electronic music has to be completely serious like you’re doing brain surgery while turning buttons’. Where was the punk? And for me, I can’t think of another time in music history where women were so at the forefront – Chicks on Speed, Miss Kittin, Tracy + the Plastics. It’s always like, ‘This dude did this’, you know?”Whatever it was an answer to – superclubs or rock’s traditional patriarchy – electroclash seemed to find an audience quickly. It wasn’t the only music Melton and his fellow DJs played at Nag Nag Nag – as underlined by a new 5CD box set, When the 2000s Clashed, they were equally wont to drop old punk singles, early industrial music or the Neptunes’ exploratory R&B – but electroclash was the club’s sonic backbone, and the night was an immediate success. Boosted by approving reviews first in the gay press, then the style magazines, its initial clientele – “a few old goths and some art students in their mum’s old curtains,” according to Melton – were soon joined by a succession of celebrities: Kate Moss, Alexander McQueen, Pet Shop Boys, Boy George, Björk. Perhaps inevitably, it attracted comparisons to celebrated New Romantic hangout the Blitz. “But there was no door policy, no guest list,” demurs Melton. “I didn’t want any of that exclusivity shit. It wasn’t posey at all, there was more a feeling of abandon. It was very hedonistic.”“It was the epitome of amazingness, this incredible melting pot of every kind of character,” says Concetta Kirschner, better known as rapper Princess Superstar, who turned up at Nag Nag Nag while promoting her 2002 UK hit Bad Babysitter. The club had an immediate impact on her sound. “It gave me a shot of freedom. I felt like there were a lot of tightly defined rules in hip-hop. But after Nag Nag Nag, I felt I could experiment, be whatever I wanted, rap over dance music or crazy new rhythms.”View image in fullscreenGreat one-liners … Peaches.Photograph: Jo Hale/Getty ImagesThe newly electroclash-adjacent Princess Superstar had a Top 3 hit with Perfect (Exceeder), a collaboration with Dutch producer Mason, but it was the exception that proved the rule. For all the excitement and press coverage it generated, electroclash noticeably failed to produce a major crossover star, although it wasn’t for want of trying in some quarters. The Ministry of Sound’s record label famously spent vast sums signing New York duo Fischerspooner, but their debut album #1 failed to catch light. “Electroclash didn’t work in hygienic conditions,” offers Mark Wood, a DJ and Nag regular behind the new box set. “It worked in clubs that were dark, hot, grubby, full of smoke, all sorts of things going on.”Peaches, meanwhile, went out on tour as a support to hard rock artists, including Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age: their audiences, she says, were “horrified”. “I think a lot of [electroclash artists] were offered these more traditional tours and thought ‘I can’t handle it’. On the Marilyn Manson tour I was spat on every night, but I rapidly developed some prank skills and some great one-liners.”But in Britain at least, electroclash entered the mainstream regardless, audibly impacting on the way existing pop stars sounded. Sugababes rebooted their career with Freak Like Me, a Richard X-produced reimagining of the old Adina Howard hit backed by the music from Tubeway Army’s Are Friends Electric? Another Richard X mashup, Being Nobody, which melded Rufus and Chaka Khan’s Ain’t Nobody with the Human League’s Being Boiled, was a Top 3 hit for Popstars runners-up Liberty X. You could hear echoes of electroclash in Goldfrapp’s platinum-selling 2003 album Black Cherry, Rachel Stevens’ 2004 hit Some Girls and Madonna’s 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor. Even Fischerspooner ended up on Top of the Pops, in the company of Kylie Minogue, performing their remix of Come Into My World.It was girls, gays and theys – and the music industry didn’t invest in those categoriesIn America, however, the movement provoked a backlash. “It was unfairly beaten up after three or four years,” says Larry Tee. “Electroclash was girls, gays and theys, the music industry didn’t really invest in those three categories, and I think they were as anxious to kill it as they were disco. I think the reason they wanted to burn electroclash so fast is that it didn’t really include that soccer bro culture, which EDM did.”Nag Nag Nag eventually closed its doors in 2008 – the club that hosted it, Ghetto, was demolished to make way for the Crossrail development. It seemed symbolic of the end of something bigger than electroclash. “It was Soho’s last stand as a grubby nightclub place – that’s all literally gone, everything moved east,” says Wood. “It was around the same time that smartphones arrived, which changed everything too. All that happened around the same time electroclash was being put to bed. Nothing lasts for ever if it’s worth having in pop music.”But recently, Jonny Melton noticed something odd. He was being sent new dance tracks that self-described as electroclash, while club nights, including London’s Shackled By Lust and Bloghouse, also use the term to describe what’s on offer. “That would never have happened before,” he laughs. “At the time electroclash was like goth – no one who was in a goth a band would ever admit to being a goth band.”View image in fullscreen‘At the time electroclash was like goth’ … Jonny Slut, centre, at Nag Nag Nag.Photograph: © Dale CornishMeanwhile, in 2023, Peaches embarked on a tour performing her debut album: it was both rapturously received and attracted an audience noticeably big on twentysomethings too young to remember its release. Princess Superstar, whose “career sort of died” in the 2010s, has watched with baffled delight as her electroclash-era hits unexpectedly enjoyed a new lease of life. First, Perfect (Exceeder) belatedly went gold in the US after it was used on the soundtrack of the 2023 movie Saltburn. Then, last year, her 2008 collaboration with Larry Tee, Licky, unexpectedly went viral on TikTok. “I think they thought it was by Britney Spears,” she says. “So I put a video up like, ‘Hey dudes’ and it all went crazy.”She’s currently making new music, some of it in collaboration with Frost Children, a US duo among a wave of younger artists who bear the influence of electroclash: you can hear its strains in Snow Strippers, Confidence Man and the Dare. Larry Tee, who’s currently planning an electroclash documentary, suggests there’s an influence in the music of both Lady Gaga and Charli xcx’s Brat.The music on When the 2000s Clashed still sounds remarkably fresh. Perhaps that fact that most of it remained underground, never dominating the singles chart or the radio playlists helped; so too does the fact that it’s informed by a lot of ideas that were subsequently mainstreamed: it was gender fluid before anyone talked about gender fluidity, sex-positive before anyone used that term either. “I think the younger generation get it,” nods Larry Tee, “because it was like the resistance: we’ve had enough of homophobia, enough of misogyny. For a moment, the door was open.”When the 2000s Clashed: Machine Music for a New Millenniumis out on 17 October on Demon/EdselExplore more on these topicsMusicDance musicElectronic musicIndiePeachesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I really do believe that,” Cumberbatch said, to which Poehler concurred, saying: “Of course. You don’t have to tell me, babe!”She continued: “Every single year at theOscars, everybody [in comedy] gets blanked and all the serious people get up and accept and accept. It’s some hot bullshit! Because comedy is not easy. And I got to tell you, both you and Olivia can do both.”Speaking later, Colman credited Paddy Considine, her co-star in Hot Fuzz, with giving her her first chance at drama, after casting her in career-changing abuse drama Tyrannosaur.The Roses was scripted by Tony Macnamara, who also wrote The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos’s quasi-comedy, for which Colman won the best actress Oscar. Cumberbatch has been nominated for two dramas – 2014’s The Imitation Game and 2021’s The Power of the Dog.The last comedy to win the best picture Oscar was Birdman in 2014, while recent winners Everything Everywhere All at Once (2023) and last year’s Anora included comedic elements.‘Love is great.

He also remarked that question-and-answer sessions with the documentary’s film-makers, cast and crew “went far beyond anything we’ve experienced at the festival … showing … that these conversations are necessary”.The 82-minute documentary was directed by New Orleans native Lindsay Quinn Pitre and produced by Michael Brandner Sr, who in 2018 discovered a pile of what were essentially love letters to his younger brother from a Roman Catholic priest now recognized by the New Orleans church as a credibly accused child molester.Brandner’s brother, Scot, who was a teenager when he received the letters in question from Brian Highfill, never told anyone about them and died by suicide at age 29 in the early 1990s.Michael presented the letters to New Orleans’ Catholic archbishop, Gregory Aymond. On a recorded phone call between the men, Aymond told Brandner that the letters were concerning but not “explicit enough” to warrant Highfill’s inclusion on a list released by the archdiocese that identified clergymen faced with substantial allegations of child molestation.Aymond ultimately added Highfill to that list in October 2020 after WWL and a reporter now at the Guardian questioned the archdiocese about at least three other people who had reported their own allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of the clergyman over the previous 18 years.God As My Witness recounts the Brandner family’s experience with Highfill, who died in 2018, as well as the stories of a number of people who endured being sexually abused as children by clergymen while being raised Catholic in New Orleans, building in part on reporting published by the Guardian alongside WWL. It also tells the stories of certain attorneys who have represented clergy abuse survivors against the New Orleans archdiocese after the church faced so many clerical molestation claims that it filed for federal bankruptcy protection in May 2020.The bankruptcy remained unresolved as of Wednesday, though more than 600 clergy abuse claimants who are involved in the case have started voting on whether to accepta settlement offerguaranteeing $230m in compensation in a process that runs through 29 October.Pitre, Brandner, their team and some of the subjects of God As My Witness accepted the Winter Park film festival’s best documentary award on 7 September. Brandner said it was uniquely emotional to see some of the survivors profiled in the film accept the award.“They converted from a victim to a survivor to a hero,” Brandner said. “It was truly beautiful and brought tears to my eyes.”God As My Witness had previously collected a best feature documentary nomination at June’s Raindance film festival in London, where it made its world premiere.It has also been screened at Portugal’s Cinema em Locais Inusitado e Temporarios film festival, where the Catholic bishop of the diocese of Setúbal, Cardinal Américo Aguiar, authorized for it to be shown in his private chapel. Among those in the audience was Grupo Vita, a Portuguese national support group for Catholic clergy abuse survivors.A statement from the Portugal festival director, Luìs Teixeira, said God As My Witness’s “local approach of a global topic succeeds in making it universal”.Among other showings on the festival circuit, Pitre said God As My Witness was tentatively scheduled to be screened at the2025 New Orleans film festival, which is set to be held from 23 to 27 October. She said she understood tickets to that festival were scheduled to begin going on sale in about the second week of October.Explore more on these topicsCatholicismReligionNew Orleans clergy abuseColoradoNew OrleansChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Release the penis-shaped balloons! Uncork the Château les Norks! But for pity’s sake conduct your celebrations quietly: Godolkin University’s clipboard-clutching new dean is in no mood for frivolity.“Let’s be real,” he drawls during his inaugural campus address. “The previous human administration was full of shit. We can’t trust humankind. And that is why, as your new dean, I will be preparing you for this brave new world,” he continues, as the assembled superheroes-in-training – or “supes”, as they’re called – variously gulp, whoop and clench their bum cheeks.So! New God U, new you. Specifically, new Emma (the wonderful Lizze Broadway), whose relief at her sudden release from the Elmira Adult Rehabilitation Center is tempered by the discovery that her lightly tyranny-padded seat of learning has gone full fascist.A brief recap, then, before we get our Speedos wet. The first series of this wildly irreverent spin-off of the sublime, R-rated superhero satire The Boys ended with Emma and fellow supes Marie, Andre and Jordan being stitched up by Homelander after their discovery of the clandestine, Vought-run medical/torture facility known as the Woods. (Homelander, for those not yet au fait with The Boys, is the psychopathic superhero figurehead of dastardly corporate cabal Vought International. Think, if you can stomach it, Trump in tights.) Got it? Good. And now? Marie (Jaz Sinclair) has escaped from Elmira and is on the run. After a valiant struggle with the powers that be, Andre (Chance Perdomo), alas, was not as fortunate. (FollowingPerdomo’s death in 2024, the decision was made not to recast the role.)Back at Godolkin, Emma and fellow releasee Jordan (London Thor/Derek Luh) are greeted by a grinning wall of suits and forced to read to the press a Vought-approved “victory” speech that turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, to be rubbish. Jordan, understandably, is suspicious. Not least of Dean Cipher (yes, Cipher), whose densely bearded presence Jordan is convinced they spotted “more than once” at Elmira. “He was a doctor or something,” the bi-gender shapeshifter tells a characteristically open-mouthed Emma. “And now he’s the dean? I mean, who the fuck is this guy?” Who indeed. Facts, discovers Emma, are thin on the ground. “I mean, the name ‘Cipher’ is a little on the nose, honestly …”View image in fullscreenExtravagant creepiness … Hamish Linklater as Dean Cipher.Photograph: Jasper Savage/PrimeCipher is played by Hamish Linklater, which is in itself a little on the nose, honestly. Is there anyone as adept at extravagant, nay, luxuriant creepiness as Hamish “Midnight Mass” Linklater? Let us discuss. Actually, let’s not. Let’s just accept that there isn’t. And then allow ourselves a gander at the actor’s spectacularly unnerving MO, albeit from a safe distance (the International Space Station, say; or crouched behind Emma during one of the bits where she suddenly goes big and all her clothes explode off). In addition to his stocks-in-trade (not blinking, being tall, speaking slowly in a sad voice before suddenly blurting out something unconscionable very quickly indeed), this particular Linklater performance comes with a range of Gen V-appropriate accessories. These include a set of ample action-eyebrows and a proclivity for calling those few, brave young supes who disagree with his belief in supe-supremacism “race traitors”. So, y’know, yikes.Unsurprisingly, campus unrest begins to mount. Humans are subjected to increasing harassment from the loutish, Cipher-emboldened frat-supes, while hopelessly naive activists scamper around daubing the word “Resist” over posters of Homelander’s spray-tanned fizzog.Elsewhere, as this second series unfurls its cape, it’s a joy and a relief to discover that it is business as usual. There are several outrageous, monocle-fogging set-pieces, including a gratuitous full-frontal male locker room scene complete with prosthetic thunder-dong. (What is it with Gen V and penises? Have 5,000 words on my desk by evensong.) There is an enormous amount of swearing and violence, much sweet-natured navigating of still-unformed teenage belief systems, several mildly confusing references to events in The Boys (the fifth and final season of which arrives next year) and many, many perfect jokes about the endless commodification of mental health and gender identity.But isn’t all this zippiness, this pinging between tones and genres a bit, well … throwaway? Ultimately, yes! But then, aren’t most things these days, when you think about it? Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm. It’s all part of its pinball patchwork of superhero tropes, romance, comic book baddies, thumpingly broad political satire and penises. Oh, so many penises. Enjoy!Gen V is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s crowd-pleasing TV that’s slick, easy on the eye and highly watchableRachel AroestiWed 17 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 03.02 EDTShareWill we ever grow bored of the savant sleuth? I suspect not – the satisfaction of witnessing a fantastically gifted person crack absurdly complex cases is one of fiction’s most reliable draws. As ever, our screens are swarming with them: in the past year alone we’ve been introduced to Ludwig, David Mitchell’s puzzle-setter turned incredibly astute (if reluctant) detective; been reunited with Natasha Lyonne’s human lie-detector Charlie Cale in Poker Face; and crossed paths once again with brainiac attorney Elsbeth, whose forays into policing are chronicled in the Good Wife spin-off of the same name.Also back for more mental gymnastics is Morgan Gillory, the protagonist of breezy procedural High Potential, which returns for a second season. With an IQ of 160 – giving her “high intellectual potential” (Mensa typically requires a score of about 130) – Morgan’s ability to unravel mind-bendingly complicated sequences of events is downright astonishing. Yet there’s something a little different about this particular clever-clogs crimestopper. Ever since an antisocial drug addict by the name of Sherlock Holmes set the genius detective tone, such characters have usually had a fewissues. Ludwig is reclusive, his talents tempered by intense awkwardness. Cale is a chaotic, commitment-phobic outsider partial to a drink or two, while Elsbeth is a no-filter weirdo who gives people the creeps.Morgan – played by Kaitlin Olson (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Hacks) – has no comparable weaknesses. When we first meet her she’s working as a cleaner in the offices of the LAPD. After accidentally knocking over a pile of investigation notes and spotting some serious errors, she leaves a clue behind to point the officers in the right direction. Soon, she’s recruited to work alongside the police, where she duly solves a series of extraordinarily labyrinthine crimes with practically no assistance. Morgan is not just inordinately smart, she’s also a fearless, charismatic, glamorous, gorgeous go-getter with flawless instincts and off-the-charts emotional intelligence. She may be a littlepushy at times, but now she’s in the business of saving lives and catching killers, a bit of urgency isn’t exactly inappropriate.If Morgan is practically perfect in every way, the same can’t be said for her life – initially, at least. A single mother of three, she struggles to make ends meet, and mostly uses her mind palace to get the most out of her coupon-assisted supermarket shop. Motherhood can, of course, stymie women’s professional lives, but Morgan’s willingness to put up with the demands and pay of a minimum-wage job doesn’t quite ring true. Similarly hard to buy is the show’s longest narrative thread: underpinning all her disparate cases is Morgan’s determination to track down the father of her eldest child, who disappeared without a trace 15 years ago. Despite her incredible powers of deduction, she hasn’t the foggiest idea where he is.View image in fullscreenUniformly nice and two-dimensional … the cast of High Potential.Photograph: Andrew Eccles/DisneyBut High Potential isn’t overly concerned with realism. Made by ABC in the US, this is slick, narcotic network TV. It’s crowd-pleasing and easy on the eye, the sort of thing you’d traditionally associate more with ITV than BBC Two. Morgan’s new colleagues are uniformly nice, two-dimensional guys: suave detective Karadec (Daniel Sunjata), investigators Daphne and Oz, plus Lt Selena Soto (Scrubs’ Judy Reyes), possibly the most reasonable and least fearsome police chief in cop drama history. No antiheroes, no edge: the vibe is cosy and heartwarming and rather basic.High Potential review – joyous, gorgeous, desperately needed trash TVRead moreObviously, the crimes aren’t cosy or heartwarming or basic. The season one finale saw Morgan taunted by a kidnapper who forced her to solve ludicrously difficult puzzles to save the lives of his victims. He returns in the opening double bill here, abducting a young mother on her way home from a night out – but his real target is clearly Morgan, whom he sees as a worthy opponent in his real-life game of chess. Watching her get tantalisingly close to outwitting this man is tense and thrilling, but something this out-there requires a watertight ending. The question is: is High Potential as clever as its protagonist?In a word, no. The show is very good at keeping the suspense going, but it can’t quite stick the landing, and the storyline concludes with a preposterous gotcha. Still, there’s always next time. (In fact, Morgan’s subsequent case – although equally bananas – is better thought through, ending with a neat and surprisingly moving climax.) The quality of the plotting may be a tad inconsistent, but like her many predecessors and peers, this virtuoso citizen detective can always be relied upon to save the day.High Potential is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Find out in this mind-expanding exploration of thought and consciousnessStuart JeffriesWed 17 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 17 Sep 2025 06.24 EDTShareThis book is a trip. Among other things, it copiously details all the drugs that the US-born professor of history and philosophy of science at the Université Paris Cité has ingested. They include psilocybin, LSD, cannabis; quetiapine and Xanax (for anxiety); venlafaxine, Prozac, Lexapro and tricyclics (antidepressants); caffeine (“I have drunk coffee every single day without fail since September 13, 1990”); and, at least for him, the always disappointing alcohol.The really trippy thing, though, is not so much Justin Smith-Ruiu’s descriptions of his drug experiences, but the fact that they’re written by a tough-minded analytic philosopher, one as familiar with AJ Ayer’s Foundations of Empirical Knowledge as Aldous Huxley’s mescaline-inspired The Doors of Perception. Moreover, they’re presented with the aim of melting the minds of his philosophical peers and the rest of us by suggesting that psychedelics dissolve our selves and make us part of cosmic consciousness, thereby rendering us free in the way the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza defined it (paraphrased by Smith-Ruiu as “an agreeable acquiescence in the way one’s own body is moving in the necessary order of things”).The melting metaphor is apt, since the primal scene of early modern western philosophy came when the 17th-century French thinker René Descartes melted a piece of wax. The lump may change its form, smell, length, breadth, and yet, Descartes supposed, we still claim to know that it is the same piece of wax. The knower can be wrong about all their perceptions involving this wax but not, Descartes argued,thatthey are thinking: this is the basis of his famous “I think therefore I am” – by means of which the French thinker made us the rational, science‑venerating beings we have been ever since.Smith-Ruiu, discombobulatingly, flips the script on the Cartesian thought experiment: what if, instead of melting the wax, Descartes had “melted his mind” with acid, or one of those hallucinogens starting to arrive in Europe across the Atlantic along with potatoes and tobacco, such as peyote or ayahuasca? What if he had not foregrounded rationality and instead extolled the imaginative powers that, Smith-Ruiu suggests, are unleashed by psychedelics? The west might have ended up seeing the world completely differently, and human beings as “infinite reservoirs of light and wisdom”.There’s more in Smith-Ruiu’s psychedelic experience, one might say, than is dreamt of in strait-laced colleagues’ philosophies. His thinking seems kin to such voguish, mind-blowing movements as Markus Gabriel’s new realism, and Timothy Morton’s implosive holism and object-oriented philosophy. Immanuel Kant claimed the transcendent was by definition behind an impenetrable veil, inferable perhaps but never knowable. We could never, in this world, see God. For Smith-Ruiu, psychedelics might help lift that veil. For that thought alone I’m amazed – and cheered – that he got tenure.It’s worth mentioning at this point that this is not one of those gonzo books typed while the author is out of their gourd. Smith-Ruiu is no Hunter S Thompson. It is called OnDrugsbut it was not written on drugs (apart, presumably, from some of the prescription meds he details above and the odd espresso hit). “I am as I write, sober, lucid, and entirely focused on the task at hand.”The book ends with a remarkable plot twist (philosophical spoiler alert!). In 2023, Smith-Ruiu attended Catholic mass for the first time in 40 years at the church next door to his Paris apartment. His claim here is that the psychedelic experience is analogous to that of ritual worship: ordinary time is interpreted as a distortion, and during mass one might perceive, as he did on mushrooms, something like eternity. Another parallel is that one submits one’s will in church as on a psychedelic trip. He writes: “Psychedelics, like religion, like poetry are among other things an abandonment of the will to go it alone.” Smith-Ruiu is self-aware enough to note how absurd this sounds: that psychedelics have become his gateway drug to the Catholic church.And you don’t even need to take magic mushrooms from some geezer in a Dutch head shop (as Smith-Ruiu did) to melt your mind. He cites the opening of Proust’s novel À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when little Marcel dreamily imagines that he has become some of the things he has been reading about before nodding off – a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V – as an example of everyday psychedelia.That isn’t the only non-pharmaceutical way to expand your consciousness – you could try reading this extraordinary book, whose riches I can only hint at in this review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

What Le Guin proposed is that human culture, novels included, didn’t begin with technologies of harm, such as flints and spears, but with items of collection and care, such as the wicker basket or, nowadays, the carrier bag. And so, if we make them that way, novels can be gatherings rather than battles.Tom Cox’s third novel fashions an escape from the dangerous outside world into something soft, comforting and unfashionable. It might once have been a Neanderthal’s armpit, but now it’s more likely to be a cosy cardigan. Or a deeply comforting story.This shambling but intricate yarn of friendship, loyalty, alienation and record collecting features a depressed nature writer called Billy Stackpole, who bears a parodic resemblance to such woodcut-on-the-cover authors asRobert Macfarlaneand Tom Cox. His debut was called Will the Stone Circle Be Unbroken: A Journey Around Britain Through Deep Time. Billy is sitting around his hand-forged firebowl when he utters the woeful/hopeful plea: “This sounds weird but I’ve never had a big sloppy cardigan and I wish I did … Just something you can throw on, at a time like this. Maybe in a nice earthy green, a bit mossy.”Within earshot is a magical sea creature capable of passing for a dog, but also of hoovering, gardening and reading Barbara Kingsolver novelsAs far as Billy knows, he’s speaking to a group of eight human beings. However, also listening in, incognito, is the novel’s cosiest and most unusual character. How you react now is probably a good indication of whether you’ll like Cox’s affable, quirk-heavy brand of literary knitwear. Because also within earshot of Billy is a long-nosed, sleek-haired magical sea creature with 24 fingers who is capable of passing for a large brown dog, but also of hoovering, gardening, reading Barbara Kingsolver novels, speaking six languages, giving wise life advice, and most excellent knitting. Meet Carl – who, because he’s nice, will secretly knit Billy a cardigan.Carl is one half of a charming odd couple along with Liverpudlian record dealer Eric. Eric and Carl live peripatetically, though they’ve ended up in rural Dorset; and everywhere they go, and whatever mild scrapes they get into, they meet furiously nice people. Everything Will Swallow You is the story of Eric’s life, without and then with his supernatural companion. But it’s also a materially hopeful “state of England” novel. Our social fabric may be fraying, but we’re still warm and woolly, most of the time.Eric’s vocation is nicely chosen. Over the years, his personal fortunes follow those of the long-playing record, and we see it become an index for values of decency and kindness. When vinyl is prized, not just priced, things look up in society. The cynical mid-1990s were a low point, but with gen Z’s fond infatuation with analogue, things have been getting better.One way of reading Cox’s work, from his Stackpolish nature writing in21st Century Yokelto his recent novels,Villagerand 1983, is as a counter to cartoonish Brexitshire views of the countryside. Look beyond the M25, and there’s folklore, nature, history, yes, but most important of all there are nice people; even if increasingly they spend most of their time looking at phone screens and getting angry with one another. His country, he insists, can still be a loving and lovable place.Like vinyl records, England may go through periods of neglect, but as a nation, as afolk-nature-history-haunted land, there’s still something warm and ultimately dependable about us. As Eric writes in his notebook, and his words equally apply to comfy-cardigan fiction such as Everything Will Swallow You: “Records never did a lot of what I thought they’d do for me. They didn’t make me cooler or more handsome or help me solve the secret of the universe. But they helped get me through some hard times and taught me that magic is real.”Everything Will Swallow You by Tom Cox is published by Swift (£16.99).

It is like an epic-length Mitchell and Webb sketch in fact, the kind of film you find yourself laughing along to, just a bit, in a spirit of throwing in the towel – a spirit of not quite being able to believe that two actors, mugging and gurning at each other, really are saying these same lines to one other, over and over again.The setting is Mull of Kintyre in 1981, and a pop star called Paul, with a strangely familiar but also entirely ersatz Liverpool accent, is welcoming a visitor, who arrives implausibly by rowing boat through the choppy grey sea. This is a blind Black pop legend called Stevie, who appears nonetheless to be able to see (and derisively imitate) Paul’s quirkiest mannerism whenever he gives it: a perky thumbs-up. (They are played, respectively, by Hosking’s regulars Sky Elobar and Gil Gex.)After a cup of tea, some whisky and a “doobie-woobie”, they have conversations that might be those of two space aliens from separate planets. They seem alternately wary, hostile, and yet finally willing to tolerate and even welcome each other’s existences. This is a relationship which survives going swimming together in the icy sea (are these penile prostheses, incidentally?), dressing up as sheep and saying “Baaaaa!”, and other peculiar adventures.Is this encounter really going to foment the personal and creative atmosphere in which two great talents are going to create one of the most pro-racial-harmony pop singles in history? Maybe. Never at any time do they get down to the business of talking about this song, or trying out some melodies or lyrics – legal and copyright restraints would otherwise certainly become an issue. But it is funny when Stevie repeatedly and angrily shouts the words “Scottish cottage” in his American accent. Silliness of this purity is rare.Ebony and Ivory is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsScotlandComedyPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rugby player Jason (Adam Lunnon-Collery) is chatting up aspiring indie film-maker Charlie (Liath Hannon); their conversation is laidback and intense, light-hearted and meaningful, like life. “I’m in character as an arrogant jock,” jokes Jason. We’ve just watched him taking stick in the locker room for having his ears pierced. Now you can practically see his heart thumping in his chest talking to Charlie, who is trans.The pair spend the night drifting through the city; they message a drug dealer (to score fireworks not drugs) and film each other with a Super 8 camera. Nobody hassles them. The movie is gentle and sweet until a sudden reveal – a twist that will require a stiff test of your ability to suspend disbelief, that almost verges on clumsy. But the charisma and lovely naturalism of performances from newcomers Lunnon-Collery and Hannon carries it off. Lunnon-Collery is particularly excellent as Jason, all warmth and charm on the surface.And fair play to the script by first-time feature director Donncha Gilmore, which gets more interesting as the film goes on, introducing ideas about regret and the unreliability of memory. Jason gets a jolt to his sense of identity: his certainty in himself as the good guy, a friend to the weak. He experiences a wave of shame over something from his past, events that he has reshaped in his memory to take the sting out. An impressive debut.Girls & Boys is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsTransgenderIrelandDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

And then there is silly, sadistic trash like this: a micro-budget ripoff of cannibal-killer franchise The Hills Have Eyes, its lousy sequels and suchlike. It even features an actor from the original 1977 Hills’ cast: Susan Lanier here plays Martha, a blowsy barmaid with a taste for human flesh. But Hills at least attempted to craft some sort of backstory for its mayhem; Martha and her skeezy friends’ tastes are just a given, as if encountering cannibals is just one of the hazards of the boating life, like sharks or equipment failure.The lambs to this slaughter are a quintet of mostly stupid young people in their 20s, who get together for partying purposes on the yacht of rich boy Chad (Zachary Roosa). Passengers include Chad’s permanently bikini-clad girlfriend Dana (Meghan Carrasquillo), stag buddy Franklin (Jamal R Averett), and lesbian couple Brandy (Amy Byrd) and Jess (Caitlin Rose). Yards of cocaine are snorted, gallons of booze consumed and makeouts embarked on as teasers for the film’s real idea of fun: putting the young’uns at the mercy of the tattooed boatyard body-eaters, who bring them ashore when the yacht runs out of gas at sea.In the end, this isn’t anywhere near as gory as the Hills films at their worst, but there’s something much more dispiriting about The Boatyard’s pointlessness, its lack of wit, empathy, or basic film-making skill. The acting achieves such a finely tuned pitch of atrociousness it’s impossible to endure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Katie Lias’s set design makes clear, these are precarious lives, regularly packed up and moved from one military base to the next. The promise of theMilitary Wives Choirs– originated up the road from York Theatre Royal at Catterick Garrison and the subject of aBBC documentaryand subsequent film from which this show takes inspiration – is that they offer connection in a rootless existence.View image in fullscreenLife-and-death stakes faced by their partners … Military Wives at York Theatre Royal.Photograph: Danny With A CameraWhile based on the true story and hitting some of the same plot beats asPeter Cattaneo’s 2019 film, Isitt’s version has its own cast of fictional characters. The show quickly introduces us to a disparate group of women who are brought together when upbeat outsider Olive arrives to form a singing group for the wives while their partners are on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Though it sacrifices the emotional heft of the movie’s central partnership, this take on the material adopts a fittingly ensemble approach, illustrating the power of community at the story’s heart.Isitt’s storytelling is propulsive and pacy, if somewhat reliant on contrivance and soapy tropes. Each of the women in the choir has her own emotionally loaded subplot – a baby on the way, a round of IVF, a struggling marriage – most of which are quickly and easily resolved (usually with a tear-jerking ballad thrown in). The more striking and moving moments arrive when frontline conflict explodes into the choir’s rehearsal room, theatrically juxtaposing the two worlds these women straddle and reminding us of the life-and-death stakes faced by their partners.The show is transparent in its pressing of emotional buttons, engineering moments of high drama that just as rapidly melt away again, while its comic rhythms start to become predictable. But what comes across most convincingly is the sheer joy found in singing together. Performing a score of familiar pop, rock and Motown hits, the excellent cast bring an infectious energy to this material, lifting the sometimes cliched script and connecting with a story that has deep local resonances.AtYork Theatre Royaluntil 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsMilitaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

So, for a long time, Whitemore and Jacobi’s portrayal of Turing formed his public image, which was inevitably tragic, given that he remained a convicted criminal for loving men and his theories had not yet been fully realised.View image in fullscreenJoe Usher, behind, and Mark Edel-Hunt in Breaking the Code.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBut Turing is now officially pardoned and features on aBritish banknotein a world that owes much to him for the evolutions in digital technology and now AI (in which Turing saw both the gains and dangers). So Jesse Jones’ smart revival offers a more redemptive portrait of a true genius who lived in an age that proved fatal to him.Starting in a Northampton theatre 23 miles from Bletchley Park, where Turing saved British shipping by cracking German naval codes, this touring production will end in Manchester, where he died. It adds a new epilogue by Neil Bartlett, set in the present day at Sherborne School, Turing’s alma mater. The punchy, touching speech follows Ian McEwan’s 2019 novelMachines Like Mein finding a way to give Turing some degree of posthumous triumph over his destruction.Most important to this Turing 2.0, though, is a superb performance by Mark Edel-Hunt. It is tempting to play Turing as if he always knew he was in a tragedy but, shown extracts out of context, an audience might think this were a comedy. Edel-Hunt also delivers long speeches of mathematical and computing exposition with immaculate clarity, exuberantly suggesting the humour and sensuality that Turing found in numbers and nature, his body and tongue tangibly loosening when his great brain engages.Acting of matching quality comes from Peter Hamilton Dyer as Dillwyn Knox, the cryptographer who recruited Turing to Bletchley; the men’s enthralling dialogues about reality and pretence are, as often in Whitemore’s writing, only fully understood in retrospect through later data. Carla Harrison-Hodge as Pat Green, a Bletchley colleague on whom Turing’s mother hopes he is sweet, radiates braininess and the pain caused to her by the play’s sub-theme of humans being harder to read than machines. Joe Usher, as two of Turing’s love interests, is especially impressive in a brilliant scene in Greece where a language barrier allows Turing to spill his secrets without truly doing so. Joseph Edwards does a nice double as a Sherborne student in the 1920s and 2020s.

Earlier this year, the caped bloodsucker presided over a “comedy of terrors” at the Menier Chocolate Factory. In a few months, Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo willplay every rolein a solo performance based on Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic. But first, writer Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, director Emma Baggott and a cast of six – often bathed in blood-red lighting – deliver a feminist retelling.Stoker’s book comprises sections from the characters’ journals and diaries, plus letters and newspaper reports, compiled by Mina Harker in a bid to fathom and defeat Dracula. This production uses a variety of audio effects to relay those and adds its own equivalent of footnotes, commentaries and what increasingly feel like mini-essays. Repeatedly telling rather than showing, they interrupt the flow of the familiar story, which now comes with more of a narrative from Mina, whose words were marginalised by Stoker.Mina directs or stage-manages a play within the play, the apparent conceit being that those who lived through the original events are now re-enacting them as cautionary tale and trauma therapy. There are some extra gremlins devilling their production, akin toInside No 9: Stage/Fright, while unreliable narrators and twists abound as the script asks who is demonised in our modern age of division.View image in fullscreenBathed in blood red lighting … Dracula.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt’s one of thoseincreasingly commonmeta productions where scenes are conjured out of thin air (much of the set is on wheels, a storage trunk becomes a coffin) only to be swiftly deconstructed and reframed. That stop-start approach not only demands prior knowledge of the novel but also drains the tension in an interval-free show that drags despite a 95-minute running time. The principal problem, though, is that it is only reasonably creepy and scarcely scarier thanKPop Demon Hunters. This is partly due to some jaunty comedy but also because atmosphere (design by Grace Smart, lighting by Joshie Harriette) often comes secondary to analysis and the fixation on how to tell the story becomes a distraction.Nevertheless, Umi Myers is commanding as Mina, although too often stuck in narrator mode, and Mei Mac is compelling as always, if underused, as her friend Lucy, whose character could be yet more expanded. It’s frustrating because there are potent issues raised about the limitations placed on women in the Victorian patriarchy, our own times and the novel itself. (On her first mention in the book, assistant schoolmistress Mina is squarely placed in the kitchen by her fiance, Jonathan, who reminds himself to get her the recipe for a dish he has enjoyed.) There is a particularly modern resonance when Mina challenges how airily men make decisions over women’s bodies, yet characters are too often flatly lampooned (the ensemble is completed by Jack Myers, Phoebe Naughton, Macy Seelochan and B Terry).As in the bloodless vampire psychodramaApex Predator, there are flashes of a far more gripping treatment of the core idea. These come, maddeningly, at the end of the evening. With illusions by John Bulleid and Gareth Kalyan, it’s a tricksy production but – despite all the talent involved – not much of a treat.AtLyric Hammersmith, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreBram StokerHorror booksMorgan Lloyd MalcolmLyric HammersmithFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a commercially strong bet – while most Broadway musicals are failing financially, six plays have already become profitable:Oh, Mary!(starring Cole Escola), All In: Comedy About Love (John Mulaney, Jimmy Fallon, et al),Romeo + Juliet(Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler),Othello(Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal),Glengarry Glen Ross(Bob Odenkirk, Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr) andGood Night, and Good Luck(George Clooney).It’s led to some grousing – about ticket prices, about a Hollywood invasion, about the spirit of Broadway. I’m generally agnostic on this – Broadway has always run on star wattage, and screen actors certainly provide some – but it does change how audiences interact with the material. People enter the theater with preconceived notions, certain expectations or, in the case of John Krasinski’s solo showAngry Alan,the specter of one very beloved sitcom character. Actors and directors can work with it, subvert it, challenge it, submit to it, but the celebrity factor won’t disappear. There’s no such thing as a blank canvas.Tell that to Marc (Bobby Cannavale), a middle-aged man deeply troubled by his friend’s purchase of an all-white painting in Art, the latest limited-run, starry revival to open on Broadway. Serge (Neil Patrick Harris) sees lines, shadows, depth within the 4ft x 5ft canvas. Marc stares very hard, tries different angles – Cannavale, a two-time Tony nominee, wrings laughs out of this silent effort – but sees nothing but offensive folly in his friend’s $300,000 purchase. Their mutual friend Yvan (James Corden), less professionally successful but more open-hearted, sees whatever is needed to keep his friends agreeable.Yasmina Reza’s French-language play, first staged in Paris in 1994, thenBroadwayin 1998, is a study of male friendship. Which means that these three longtime friends – 25 years of friendship, we’re told – spend an inordinate amount of time talking about a painting that, at least to a viewer at the Music Box Theatre, appears as a large white rectangle. (Harris’s plaintive Serge, speaking directly to the audience, insists: it is not white!) This would grate – it skirts the edge of wearisome – if not for three solid performances and the timeless insight of Reza’s script, translated here by Christopher Hampton, into men’s coded language of feeling.Indirectness, of course, knows no sex or gender. But part of the magic of Reza’s play, staged here by Scott Ellis (most recently the director of Doubt), is the seamless demonstration of the lengths men will go to avoid speaking emotions plainly, the delicacy with which she writes specifically, identifiably male versions of passive aggression and avoidance. In a tight and uninterrupted 90 minutes set in one apartment – Ellis keeps the setting somewhere in Paris, though David Rockwell’s set evokes antiseptic luxury Brooklyn high-rise – the three actors capably ride a friendship devolution through some moderately entertaining shouting matches and quieter, cutting confessions.Harris and Cannavale make light work of these two politely adversarial aesthetes – the former crisp and tightly wound, the latter swaggering and easily wounded, both a little detestable. But it’s Corden, returning to Broadway for the first time since winning a Tony in 2012 for One Man, Two Guvnors), who steals the show, in a bit of stage image rehab post-Carpool Karaoke and, for the chronically online, Balthazar ban. As both the heart and the court jester for the show, Corden is superb, a perfectly calibrated level of hysterical, sincere and crisp. One blistering monologue sees him ranting, in the voice of three separate characters, for several minutes straight without missing a beat; it was not celebrity compelling the extended applause when he finally collapsed, spent and spittle-covered, into a chair.You can only talk art for so long. All three characters eventually crack open, though not, perhaps, to the degree one would hope, as Serge and Marc still rely on abstractions of taste, influence, ideas. It’s when Yvan crumbles, tearfully admitting the significance of these friends in this life, that the production unlocks some prismatic, elusive sentiment, a color noticeably missing from the canvas. Or maybe that’s just my reading, colored by many a frustrating attempt to pull emotions out of a man. Ultimately with any play, just as painting, you supply your own background and see what you see.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayJames CordenNeil Patrick HarrisUS theaterTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

This series is characterised by a pervasive and polarising streak of distinctly adolescent humour. But in Borderlands 4, developer Gearbox has addressed that issue: it features plenty of returning characters in its storyline, but this time around they are more world-weary and less annoyingly manic. Borderlands has finally matured, to an extent. And not before time.Borderlands 4 still flings jokes at you thick and fast, and they are still hit-or-miss, but at least its general humour is a bit more sophisticated than before. It retains the distinctive cel-shaded graphical style and gun and ordnance-heavy gameplay that people have always loved. Indeed, it throws even more guns at you than any of its predecessors, and with a little work at filtering out the best ones, you will find plenty of absolute gems with which to take on hordes of straightforward enemies and more interesting bosses. A decent storyline emerges after the formulaic first few hours, eventually sending you off on some unexpected, fun and sometimes gratifyingly surreal tangents.The action takes place on Kairos, a planet new to the series, which feels more coherent than any of Borderlands’ previous settings. Kairos’s inhabitants are suffering under the totalitarian yoke of the tyrant Timekeeper, so you must rouse the downtrodden natives into joining your resistance movement, liberating tribes of folk by eliminating the Timekeeper’s oppressive lieutenants and removing surveillance-and-control implants from their necks. The deeper you get into the story, the more sidetracks and digressions you find, from dungeon-like vaults stashed with loot to environmental puzzles.You play as one of four vault-hunters – a Siren with summoning powers, an Exosoldier super-soldier, a hammer-wielding tank called a Forgeknight and a tech-wielding Gravitar. Each has battlefield skills that are crucial when you’re up against it, giving you the chance to spawn scythe-wielding phantom reapers, turrets, or defensive shields. The usual high-quality shooting is present and correct, but movement has been greatly improved: you get a grapple, a hover-bike and a huge jump-and-glide, all of which come in handy in the heat of frenetic battleandwhen you’re out exploring. They also translate well to the series’ famed co-op play, which supports up to four players.Borderlands 4 is a big game – the main storyline takes 20 to 30 hours to complete, and there’s plenty to do afterwards. It is not entirely frictionless: sometimes you need to traverse huge distances in its missions, and the directional indicator that helps you along the way is annoyingly erratic. And it has been buggy at launch: playing on PC, it has occasionally crashed on me, even after a huge patch, and early playershave reported problemswith stuttering and other performance issues. But Borderlands needed to grow up a bit, and that’s exactly what it has done, without losing its essential charm. Its top-quality shooter action might be comfortably familiar, but it’s also an awful lot less annoying than it used to be.Borderlands 4 is out now; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesAction gamesRole playing gamesShooting gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

This, however, does taste good,” says chef Carla Lamont as she snips off a piece of orpine, a native sedum, in her herb garden. It’s crisp and juicy like a granny smith but tastes more like cucumber. “It’s said to ward off strange people and lightning strikes; but I like strange people.”We’re on a three-hectare (seven-acre) coastal croft on the Hebridean island of Mull. Armed with scissors, Carla is giving me a kitchen garden tour and culinary masterclass – she was a quarter-finalist in Masterchef: The Professionals a few years back. Sweet cicely can be swapped for star anise, she tells me. Lemon verbena she uses in scallop ceviche.Mull mapShe points out a barberry bush whose small, sour berries, a Middle Eastern staple, she adds to jewelled rice, and a myrtle bush which, I learn, is different from the bog myrtle growing wild on the croft that, when the leaves are crushed, smells gloriously aromatic with hints of eucalyptus. Bog myrtle also protects your woollens from moths, wards off midges – and is a key ingredient in one of her cocktails.“I had never grown anything before I came here. I was in a kitchen in the city and herbs came dried in a tub. Now, if I haven’t heard of something, I give it a go or thrust it at Jonny and say ‘Greenhouse.’”Carla and Jonny, her husband, are part of a new wave of crofter chefs or field-to-fork farmers spreading across Scotland. Crofting is, essentially, small-scale subsistence farming, the crofter traditionally rearing a few animals and growing vegetables on the smallholding, and maintaining a job or two on the side.Now, just as the architect-designed, off-grid bothy is a world away from the bare-bones huts that once gave shepherds shelter, the croft has been reinvented. Our back-to-the-land yearnings, fuelled by programmes such as This Farming Life and Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild, have turned crofting into a modern rural fantasy.View image in fullscreenFishers haul creels off the Mull coast.Photograph: David Gowans/AlamyThe new generation of crofters still juggle jobs, but today, that usually involves tourism rather than working for the local laird. For Jonny and Carla, it’s a restaurant calledNinth Waveand a cute cabin, theSea Shanty(sleeps two from £800 a week).They met 30 years ago when Carla, from Canada, answered an ad for a chef on the neighbouring island of Iona. Jonny’s nickname, Carla smiles, is “the lobster man”. Every day, he hikes two miles cross-country to his small boat, the Sonsie, returning with the catch that Carla cooks in the restaurant. They also cure, smoke and brine seafood and meat on Bruach Mhor croft. When Jonny’s not fishing, he’s working the land.It’s not fine dining. It’s street food presented nicelyCarla LamontThey grow about 80% of the fruit and vegetables for the restaurant in their kitchen garden, everything from cardoons to wasabi, and forage for wild herbs on the croft. They’ve counted more than 150 seasonal greens, herbs and edible flowers growing wild here. Bumping up the dirt track for lunch, the hedgerow is billowing with fluffy meadowsweet. “I’ll be harvesting it later for panna cotta,” Carla tells me.“People don’t realise you can eat so many flowers.” The pots of blowsy blooms by the door, it turns out, are also on the menu. “Marigolds are edible and so are dahlias. You can eat the flowers and the tubers. The Mexicans used them as their main starch crop hundreds of years ago. They’re wonderful roasted; like a cross between a potato and a jerusalem artichoke.”View image in fullscreenA dish at Ninth Wave, MullThe restaurant was once the barn or bothy, with a dirt floor and tin roof, attached to their one-bedroom cottage. And while the produce for the menu might mainly be locally grown, reared or caught, the inspiration for Carla’s dishes comes from her travels. At the end of each season, the couple head off on food adventures, grazing their way through Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.For lunch I’m tucking into a Mexican-inspired dish: Jonny’s lobster teetering on garden-grown roasted corn salsa, a creamy Yucatan avocado and hoja santo soup, laced with lemon verbena and Vietnamese coriander. “It’s not fine dining,” she shrugs, “it’s street food presented nicely.”At the other end of the island, another restaurant on a croft is also making waves as much for its architectural wow factor as its pasture-to-plate menus. Jeanette Cutlack moved to Mull from Brighton in 2008 and ran a pop-up restaurant for 10 years in her home. Her dream, however, was to restore the abandoned croft and ruined barn down the lane.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Diners eat the simple, field-to-fork menus at long communal tables cut from a single Douglas fir. Starters such as crab arancini and lemon mayonnaise are served alongside spicy haggis, cornbread and salsa verde. Haggis is Jeanette’s speciality and she also runs haggis-making workshops.Now that the land has been cleared, the 20-hectare croft is starting to bear fruit. Jeanette has planted a nectarine tree and kiwi vine. In a polytunnel, she and her family grow salad and herbs while a small flock of Hebridean sheep grazes the hill that is part of the land.

Iain and Joyce Hetherington have converted their front room into a restaurant showcasing the local produce – from creel-caught shellfish landed at Croig on the island’s north coast, to organic vegetables grown by Carol Guidicelli on her croft at Langamull, near Croig, along with their in-house smoked venison. On the tiny community-owned island of Ulva, meanwhile, a short boat ride away, theBoathouse, recently revamped by Banjo Beale, winner of a TV interior design show, has become one of the hottest lunch spots, with diners crammed around picnic tables devouring plates of briny langoustine and crab claws on the water’s edge.View image in fullscreenSgriob ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheeseAnd then there is the well established but ever-evolving award-winningSgriob-ruadh farm, where they produce Isle of Mull cheese, just a few minutes’ drive from Tobermory’s pastel-painted waterfront. The Reade family arrived on the island with five cows in the 1980s and rebuilt a rundown dairy operation, starting cheese production a few years later. The farm’s Glass Barn cafe is a fabulous, foliage-festooned space where you can sample signature cheese and charcuterie platters or a bowl of homemade soup and a cheese scone before taking the far from run-of-the-mill tour.Our small tour group meets the US cheese-maker Troy by the pig pen. After hearing a potted family history, we move on to the milking parlour where he weaves in science and Willy Wonka-style invention. The milk, he explains, is pumped to the cheese-making shed next door via an underground tank. The warm milk, fresh from the cows’ udders, heats the water used by the cafe. Walking us through the cheese-making process, we head underground to the vast cheese cellar, meet newborn calves and piglets and learn about innovative sustainable farming initiatives.10 of the best Scottish island escapesRead moreThe leftover whey from the cheesemaking was once used to feed the pigs – until they found a better use for it. In the farmyard a smart new micro-distillery uses the whey to make gin and “whey-ski” – possibly a pun too far, a barrel-aged spirit. The tour ends with a tasting. The gin has a surprisingly distinctive creaminess, the whey-ski is pure fire water.“It’s not sweet like a bourbon,” Troy says as he pours another dram. “It’s more like an Irish whiskey.” I knock it back, thinking that’s the thing about Mull: for outside-the-box thinking and wild culinary innovation, it’s leading the way.Ninth Wave: four-course lunch £80(not open for dinner).Croft 3: two-course menu £42, three courses £50.The Boathouse:half lobster £25, langoustines £18 (a la carte).Ar Bòrd: three-course set menu £55pp.Isle of Mull Cheese tour: £20Explore more on these topicsFood and drinkScotland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here it makes an unexpected but inspired burrata topperTom HuntWed 17 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhile most Instagram food trends prioritise spectacle over substance, the viral frozen tomato idea that I’m employing today delivers genuine culinary value, and solves a common kitchen problem into the bargain. I’m a bit late to the party, admittedly, but it’s a versatile waste-saving technique.Its origin clearly derives from either Hawaiian shaved ice or granita, that classic Italian frozen dessert made by stirring and scraping or grating a sorbet-like base into shavings, and the approach essentially applies granita principles to fresh produce, while at the same time cutting out all of the hassle: simply pop any surplus or past-its-best fruit or vegetables in the freezer until they’re rock solid, then grate!Frozen fruit and vegetable “granita” with burrataThe freezer is one of the best tools we have for saving waste, so if in doubt, freeze! I especially love the simplicity of this incredibly versatile dish, which can help save on waste by making use of various odds and ends or of wonky fruit and veg at the back of the crisper drawer by simply freezing it for later, then upcycling it into a really special starter.Burrata is the perfect vehicle for the subtlety of this shaved ice. It’s made by stretching a ball of mozzarella into a delicate pouch, and filling it with stracciatella (essentially, strands of mozzarella mixed with cream), and so creating one of the most delicious cheeses known to humankind.One fruit or vegetable is plenty for this, and will stand-alone if you want to create a simple dish, but if you have other ingredients that will work well, by all means go for it. I wanted a Neapolitan-styletricoloregranita on my burrata, but ended with more of a Jamaican flag because I had only a green cucumber end, a red beef tomato and a yellow pepper spare. Other good seasonal combinations are beetroot, balsamic and dill, carrot; fennel, aleppo pepper and orange juice; and fig, balsamic and black pepper.This dish is hard to share so serve a whole burrata per person.Serves11 fruit or vegetable1 burrataSea saltOptional extras (all to taste)Oil: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil or cold-pressed rapeseed oilHerbs and spices: basil, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, sumac, aleppo pepperAcid: orange or lemon juice, plus the finely grated zest, if the fruit’s organic and unwaxed (especially good with carrot and fennel); or aged balsamic vinegar (thicker balsamic sits better on the granita, rather than melting it).Take your chosen fruit or vegetable and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight, until solid.When you’re ready to serve, place the burrata on a plate and grate your chosen frozen ingredient directly over the top. Season generously with sea salt, then drizzle with the oil of your choice. Add a sprinkle of herbs or spices and, if you like, a touch of acidity, then serve immediately because the frozen shavings meltveryquickly.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitVegetablesStarterCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the season shifts towards autumn, we crave deeper, more grounding flavours, andlu rou fanis just that: rich, savoury and nostalgic. The daikon tots, meanwhile, are a happy kitchen accident from even before we even had a restaurant – they’re crunchy on the outside, soft within and oddly satisfying. Both dishes reflect what we have always been about: balancing the familiar and the unexpected. Honest, humble and a little indulgent, and perfect for that in-between time as summer fades.Lu rou fan (Taiwanese braised pork, pictured top)This involves a two-stage cooking process. The pork is gently poached twice, to make it tender, and it’s then braised in flavoured water, so it soaks everything up and ends up really moist.Prep15 minCool4 hr+Cook3 hrServes4For the poached pork500g pork belly10mlmichiu(rice wine), or cooking sake2cm piece fresh ginger, bashed with the flat of a knife½ garlic clove, crushedFor the braise¼ tbsp rapeseedoil¼ shallot, diced1 tbsp light soy sauce1 dried red chilli1 star anise1½ tspShaoxing rice wine¾ tsp mirin1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed¼ red apple, peeled, cored and diced1cm piece fresh ginger, bashed with the flat of a knife¼ spring onion, cut in half lengthways¾ tsp rice vinegar1 small cinnamon stick¼ tsp dark soy sauceSteamed rice, to serveFirst, poach the pork. Put the pork belly in a deep pan filled with cold water, bring to a boil and cook for five minutes. Lift out the pork and discard the water.Put the pork skin side down in a clean pan, add enough cold water just to cover, then add the rice wine, ginger and garlic. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and poach for about 20 minutes, until the pork is firm, no longer pink and the skin looks translucent. Take off the heat and leave the pork to cool in its poaching liquid for at least four hours, and ideally overnight, covered and in the fridge.When you’re ready to braise, lift the pork out of the poaching liquor and cut it into cubes, skin and all. Strain the poaching liquor and reserve.Now to braise the pork. Put the oil in a casserole for which you have a lid (we use a traditional clay pot) on a medium heat. Add the diced shallot and cubed pork and fry gently, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until the shallot softens. Pour in 125ml of the reserved poaching liquid and all the remaining braise ingredients except the dark soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer,cover and braise for two hours, topping up with poaching liquid if needed.Lift off the lid, stir in the dark soy sauce, turn up the heat to medium and cook for another 20 minutes, until the sauce reduces and turns glossy and slightly sticky.Serve on steamed rice – the fatty nature of the sauce coats the grains perfectly. The trick is not to render the fat too much, so the pork melts in the mouth, but still holds its form.Daikon totsView image in fullscreenErchen Chang’s daikon tots.You’ll need to start on these a day ahead.Prep5 minFreezeOvernightCook40 minMakes10–12850g daikon(ie, 1 large one), peeled and coarsely grated90g plain flour, plus about 100g extra for coating1⅓ tsp salt2 eggs, beaten200g panko breadcrumbsAbout 500mlvegetable oil, for deep-fryingThe day before you want to eat, put the grated daikon in a large, dry frying pan on a medium heat and cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the moisture is gone. Add up to 100ml cold water, so you have a 1:3 liquid-to-daikon ratio, turn down the heat to low, then stir in the 90g flour and the salt until well combined.Line a small baking tin with clingfilm, then press in the daikon so it’s an even 2½cm deep. Put the tin in a steamer, and steam over a medium heat for 30 minutes (keep an eye on the water level in the base, so it doesn’t boil dry). Lift out the tin, leave to cool completely, then wrap up the tin tightly and freeze overnight.The next day, take the daikon tin out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes, just until it’s soft enough to cut. Unwrap the tin, lift out the block of daikon and cut it into 2½cm cubes – these are your tots.Set up a breading station with the remaining 100g flour, beaten eggs and panko in separate shallow dishes. Coat each tot first in flour, dip it in the egg (left hand), then into the panko (right hand; using alternate hands helps keep the crumbs from clumping).Heat the oil – enough to cover the tots – in a deep, heavy pan to 160C (or until a cube of ginger sizzles and browns in 20 seconds). Fry the tots in batches for two minutes each, turning them gently so they get an even colour all over, then lift out on to paper towels and leave to cool completely.Turn up the heat a little and bring the oil to 190C (or until a cube of ginger sizzles and browns in just 10 seconds). Fry the tots a second time, again in batches and this time for about a minute in total, just until golden and crisp – the double fry gives them a light, crunchy crust and a soft, gooey centre. Drain well and serve hot with your favourite dipping sauce; I like mine with hot sauce or chilli oil.Erchen Chang is chef/co-founder ofBao in LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodChinese food and drinkPorkMeatRiceMain courseSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
