By focusing on some common areas – like nutrition, exercise and meaningful connections – you can age well in every decade.Here’s what you need to know to extend the quality of life in these decades.Staying healthy in your 50sEntering midlife, a person’s health needs can begin to change.Sometimes these changes can be challenging, but there is “plasticity to ageing”, says Nathan LeBrasseur, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging, and you do have some control over the process.What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 50s?Wear and tear on the body’s cells and molecules increases the risk of ageing-related diseases, says LeBrasseur.Biological age is a measure of these cellular and molecular changes over time. It captures how old your body appears based onbiomarkers, liketelomere length, and how well your body is functioning.Biological age is a better measure ofhealthspan, or years of generally good health, than chronological age, or how many years you’ve been alive.Lifestyle factors, like if you smoke or drink, influence how you age – and focusing on your health now will help in the future.For some, the menopausal transition may begin between the ages of 45 and 55 and is linked to symptoms including hot flashes, mood changes and sleep disturbances. Women may also experience vaginal dryness or decreased sex drive, while men may begin to experience erectile dysfunction.What health tests should you get regularly in your 50s?To extend your healthy years, take preventive and proactive measures. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendsan annual skin cancer screeningfor anyone over 40, and talking to a healthcare provider about colorectal cancer screenings, yearly mammograms, and lung and prostate cancer screenings.In the UK, the NHS offers a free health check to people aged 40 to 70 without certainpre-existing conditions. It includes blood pressure and cholesterol tests, and checks your risk of health issues like diabetes and stroke. At 50, you’re also eligible for NHS breast, bowel and cervical cancerscreenings.What are the keys to longevity?Heart health is vital, as is being mindful of your nutrition and exercise. A diet rich in plants, whole grains, healthy fats and lean meats can improve your health. A diversity of physical activity – focusing on endurance, cardio, flexibility and balance – is crucial.It’s never too late to start, and what you do over many years will have a long-term impact, says LeBrasseur.How do I stay healthy in my 50s?Staying healthy in your 60sYour 60s are a period of change. For many, this decade is marked by shifting family dynamics with adult children or new health challenges.What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 60s?Getting older, and the physical changes that accompany it, vary person to person. “We’re all more vulnerable to things as we get older, but there’s a lot of heterogeneity of health status among older people,” says Jennifer Schrack, director of the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging andHealth.Older adults may walk more slowly because of pain or emerging balance problems, says Schrack, and osteoarthritis symptoms causing discomfort may emerge as well. As the body ages, the immune systemweakensand the risk factor for age-related diseases increases since the body takes longer to fight off infection.Memory tends to change, and forgetfulness is common as you age, explains Dr Angela Sanford, a care provider and associate professor of geriatric medicine at St Louis University. It’s common to see processing speed slow, and for multitasking to become a bigger challenge. If you worry about forgetfulness, a doctor can advise on cognitive screening tests.In your 60s, sleep may become more disrupted, with studies indicating that40 to 50%of those over 60 report difficulty sleeping.What health tests should you get regularly in your 60s?People in their 60s should be mindful to have regular bloodwork done, says Sanford. An annual eye exam, screening for colorectal cancer and diabetes, are also recommended.Women should have mammograms and test bone density, which declines during menopause.What are the keys to longevity?Genetics, lifestyle choices and environment are the factors that most affect your health, says Schrack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mobility and staying active contribute to quality of lifeas does maintaining positive relationships.How do I stay health in my 60s?Staying healthy in your 70sToday’s septuagenarians are different. “Many transitions that are happening now at 70 are the types of transitions people in previous generations might have experienced in their early 60s,” says Jeffrey Stokes, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston who studies ageing. People in this age group now have longer life expectancy, and are also becoming grandparents and retiring later than previous generations.What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 70s?Some medical conditions and functional problems, like decreased mobility and impaired balance, become more common as people age, according to Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.However, lifestyle factors play a role, and how much you feel these changes will be very individualized. And while there is no one “normal” way to age, it is common to experience health challenges like arthritis, hypertension or increased trouble sleeping.In comparison to earlier decades, your 70s can be quite stable – especially for women who have already experienced menopause.What health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?Many recommended screenings are framed as guidelines for those above 65 in the US and UK. This reflects a lack of research and that screenings become more complicated as we age, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. It can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stagecan vary.Some screenings to consider are for bone mineral density and functional limitations (to see, if for example, you are at risk for falling), according to Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.What are the keys to longevity?Movement is important, says Lachs, and any kind of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will help. Relationships, both casual and close, can improve a person’s health and sense of purpose, says Stokes.While many people in their 70s will have deep, meaningful relationships – like those with children and grandchildren – there’s often less emphasis on fostering new connections. Targeting this can help improve the loneliness and isolation faced by many in their oldest years, says Stokes.Adequate sleep – at least seven to nine hours each night – and a diet that contains less meat and more plants can contribute to overall longevity, too.How do I stay healthy in my 70s?Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe joys of ageingGrandparents and grandparentingNutrition and developmentHealth & wellbeingOlder peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The teenage me loved itWed 23 Jul 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.48 EDTShareIn the olden days, you could listen over and over again to your musical heroes doing their thing, yet go for years without hearing them speak. The songs themselves gave few clues to the real accents of the singers. Singing seemed to iron out regional vowel sounds so that, in song, everyone sounded the same – rather American. I was aware that Slade and (half of) Led Zeppelin were from the same neck of the woods as me, but I struggled to pick up any trace of Walsall in Noddy Holder’s singing voice or any hint of West Bromwich in Robert Plant’s. It was years before I heard either of them talking properly in their own proper Black Country accents. I loved it.I’m talking about the 1970s here, when there were fewer radio or television interviews, and very little in the way of what came to be known as reality shows. Even when the 70s turned into the 80s and I was old enough to go to concerts, the spoken words of British frontmen and women, when they found something to say between songs, sounded at best neutral and at worst mid-Atlantic. Over the years, with all the touring or living in the States, their original English accents could even desert them completely.I never saw Black Sabbath live, but I suspectOzzy Osbourne, even as he addressed the crowd through a mouthful of bat’s head in Iowa, sounded as Brummie as could be. From the beginning to the end, while speaking if not singing, he talked like a bloke from Birmingham should talk. You could take the man out of Aston, but this man’s accent never left the place. For me, this was always important, even though Ozzy’s accent made mine sound as posh as a minor royal’s.If you get chance, have a look at Rockfield: The Studio on the Farm, a film about the studio in Monmouthshire. Fifty years afterBlack Sabbathfirst went there, you’ll hear Ozzy talking about it in the same accent he’d have had back then. “We’d never been in a studio; we’d never been on a farm. So everything was new. You’d come and see a cow in a field, you know. We were from the streets of Aston – the only thing we ever saw was a police horse. It was brilliant.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneOpinionBlack SabbathBirminghamMetalPop and rockcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet his Hamlet revamp electrified Broadway and scooped up Tony nominations. As Fat Ham hits the UK, he talks violence, vengeance, strongmen and joyArifa AkbarWed 23 Jul 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.01 EDTShareWhen he was still in his 20s and studying for a master’s degree in acting, James Ijames was advised to take a swerve away from all things Shakespearean. His tutors thought his southern accent, the product of an upbringing in North Carolina, was not conducive to declaiming Elizabethan verse. Believing them, he did just one professional Shakespeare production in 10 full years of treading the boards.Now Ijames is righting that old wrong, although he does not see it quite that way. Fat Ham, his latest drama, is based onHamletand features a queer protagonist called Juicy, who is commanded by the ghost of his murdered father to avenge his death. Significantly, Juicy hails from a Black American family in North Carolina. “The thing I kept hearing over and over,” he says, “was that my regionalism – the slowness of my southern accent – would make it difficult for me to do Shakespeare. Ididavoid it for those reasons. That’s a little bit of what’s in this. I wanted to take this thing I was told I couldn’t access and see if I could make it work for me.”My family didn’t say: ‘You’re gay, get out, you’re the worst.’ They just said: ‘Don’t get in trouble’It worked all right. Fat Ham was feted on Broadway, winning a Pulitzer prize and amassing five Tony award nominations. Next month, the play is coming to theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin Stratford-Upon-Avon for its European premiere.Ijames, a playwright with more than 15 dramas under his belt, conceived the idea eight years ago, as he gravitated back to Shakespeare.An easy-going presence with a calm, donnish air, Ijames now makes a robust case for his right to Shakespeare. “I was raised in a Black Southern Baptist church that reads the St James Bible every Sunday,” he says, speaking via Zoom. “So I grew up reading Elizabethan English. Yet I was told the way I spoke would prevent me from being able to do that, when I had seen people speak this language with ease and eloquence my whole life. It just rocked my world, at a later age, to realise it belonged to me. So it was a real revelation working on this play.”View image in fullscreenNo soliloquies … the Broadway production.Photograph: Joan marcus/Joan MarcusIjames has not only embraced Shakespeare but played fast and loose with this most definitive of his tragedies. There are new names, rearranged storylines, with most of the big soliloquies written out. “I can’t compete with those,” he explains. “I can’t be in the room with ‘To be or not to be’. That existential crisis won’t look that way in my characters.”It’s a bold move, not least because of an unconventional programme in the Oregon Shakespeare festival not so long ago, with plays including references to slavery and non-binary actors cast in various roles. Nataki Garrett, the festival’s artistic director, received death threats. “I remember that happening,” says Ijames, “and thinking, ‘This is insane.’” Yet, he points out, Shakespeare hardly wrote from scratch: he took huge liberties with his source material, recycling older stories, borrowing from history. The “almost scriptural quality” some attach to his texts is not something Shakespeare would have endorsed, Ijames believes. “He was trying to evoke the audience’s imagination because he knew that’s where the play actually exists.”View image in fullscreen‘This play was a revelation’ …James Ijames.Photograph: Marc J FranklinActing, for Ijames, was a circuitous way into writing. In 2001, he says, “they weren’t really taking young people into playwriting programmes. So I went to grad school for acting. But I wrote the entirety of my career, in dressing rooms, wherever, until I’d built up enough work.”Learning about writing through acting sounds rather Shakespearean, I suggest. “Yes,” says Ijames. “I don’t pretend to be as earth-shattering a writer as he was, but his curiosities are very similar to mine.” Evidently so: Fat Ham is warmer and more comic than Hamlet – but at its core, it is a story about fathers, sons and the cycle of violence triggered by the drive for vengeance. Except that Fat Ham’s antihero struggles against the violent masculinity his father represents. “It’s perennial for me as a writer to ask, ‘What does masculinity mean?’ ‘What does the performance of masculinity do?’”One reason he is so defined by this theme, he explains, is because he shares a name with his father. “I’m a ‘junior’ – so there’s a kind of ownership, an expectation of legacy, that I’ve lived with my whole life. As an artist, I’m preoccupied with disrupting: this notion of how a man is supposed to act at any given moment.” He wants to explore what lies beneath the ideal of masculinity that young people are fed – an ideal that requires them to stifle many components of their emotional being. “It takes time,” says Ijames, “to bring that stuff back to life.”Alongside Juicy in Fat Ham, there is Larry (based on Laertes) who feels a closeted queer passion for Juicy. Shame and homophobia shape their trajectories. “Many times,” says Ijames, “homophobia is about not wanting to face parts of yourself. I’m not one of those folks who say you’re homophobic because you’re actually gay – but I do think you are homophobic because you think that if you get too close to a man’s body, thenyourbody might betray you.”I remember thinking that I should be elegant because one of my uncles was very elegantIjames grew up in a large family, in the small town of Bessemer City. His father worked in truck manufacturing (“He’s retired military – that type”) while his mother taught elementary school (“She wanted us to be surrounded by art”). What was it like growing up queer in this household, in this corner of the south? “I wasn’t in a family that was like, ‘Oh, you’re gay, get out of here, you’re the worst.’ They said, ‘Just don’t get in trouble.’” And the masculinity in his family contained a “softness”, something he puts down to it being mostly comprised of women. “They were such engines of the family that it changed us. I remember thinking I should be elegant because one of my uncles was very elegant.”What about the greater forces around him, such as the Baptist church? He tells an instructive story about a late family member called Thomas Calvin, who was a theologian. As Ijames’s uncle, he believed a Christian had a simple duty: to make the world a better place. “And that is my framework for Christianity.” Although Ijames has witnessed – and experienced – intense homophobia in churches, he still takes moral direction from the “social justice aspect of the teachings of Jesus”.Fat Ham review – Pulitzer-winning Hamlet revision hits BroadwayRead moreGiven the changes that have swept America under Donald Trump, it is hard to escape “strongman” notions of masculinity. Has it ever felt more toxic, more in crisis? “Well,” says Ijames, “that’s a thing a play can’t fix.” He adds, in his even way, that masculinity is hardly one single thing. “It’s a constellation of stuff. I don’t feel safer with these strongmen, so what is the strength we’re talking about? I don’t feel more protected. I don’t feel like we’re somehow more powerful. I just feel like anxious people – and I’m an anxious person – are being anxious with each other.”All those alternative versions of manhood are there in Fat Ham, rubbing alongside darker elements. But there is playfulness and exuberance, too. Its characters do not seem as villainous as Shakespeare’s and the ending might even be described as happy. Is Ijames deliberately creating a state that is good out of Shakespeare’s rotten one? “I was very much doing that. I was curious about what happens if we spend time figuring out what paradise looks like. What if everyone didn’t die at the end? What if everyone had a place to live, enough to eat. These are questions about civilisation.”There is violence in Fat Ham and it seems implicitly bound to race and US history, but Ijames does not get into cycles of inherited violence within some Black communities. Instead, he goes down another route. “I don’t write that because I don’t know how to be inside that. Joy is a thing I know in excess. It’s one of the tricks of being an actor: you understand what offers pleasure to the audience because you have to do it with your whole body. I think marginalised people in general, and Black Americans in particular, are miraculous. I think we should party once in a while.”Fat Ham is at theSwan theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon, from 15 August until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHamletBlack US cultureRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It turns out thatHouse of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewskiand a medium-sized Bluetooth speaker aren’t must-haves on a four-day wilderness hike. Who knew? An extra water bottle would have been a better use of that space, something I learned through a series of hardships.For guidance on this topic, I asked experienced campers – including parents with young kids, festival-goers, outdoor guides and lone wild campers – for their must-pack items. Whether you’re taking a £20 tent to a muddy field, glamping in a yurt or going fully off-grid, this list is sure to feature an item you’ll be thankful you threw in the bag.For a comprehensive list of essentials, you should always consider the particulars of your upcoming trip.

To get this mat ready, all you need to do is lay it out flat, unscrew the valve and … actually, that’s it. Come back later, tighten up the valve and go to sleep. In my experience, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to fully inflate, but if you’re in a rush, you can still inflate it manually.

The Telegraph gave it one star and described it as “a limp assembly of video, actors, a live band and indifferently recreated sets”. Time Out was muchmore positive, giving it three stars, but also alluding to “a noticeable amount of booing”.How do you explain the discrepancy?It appears to be a matter of expectations. When the show was announced last year, the creators, Layered Reality, suggested it would use AI and holographic projection to create a lifesize digital Elvis, leading to obvious comparisons with the hugely successful virtual reality extravaganzaAbba Voyage.But it’s nothing of the kind?“We ultimately took the creative decision not to mimic Elvis’s performances,” said a company spokesperson. “Instead, we use AI to upscale archive footage.”What does that mean?Reviews suggest they have dressed up some footage from Elvis’s 1968 comeback TV special and built a show around it (which includes visits to three separate themed bars selling expensive drinks).Sounds more like an escape room.Some visitors have drawn comparisons to thatWilly Wonka experience fiasco in Glasgow last year.Is it really that bad?They certainly have a problem on their hands. On Sunday, the show had to be stopped afteran audience member who allegedly kept shouting “This is bollocks!”was dragged from the venue by security.Do say:“We’re caught in a trap – we can’t walk out.”Don’t say:“Elvis has left the building.”Explore more on these topicsElvis PresleyPass notesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a big risk to takeOwen JonesDavid Lammy seemingly believes Israel and its supporters will always be able to act with impunity – but the status quo surely cannot holdWed 23 Jul 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 15.25 EDTShareAterrible tipping point in Gaza has been reached. The number of people admitted to hospital or dying from starvationhas surged. The journalists’ union forAgence France-Presse(AFP) has issued a statement warning that “without intervention, the last reporters in Gaza” will die of hunger.This is horribly shocking, but it is no surprise: after all, we are now more than 140 days into Israel’s total siege on Gaza. In May, Israel abolished the UN’s effective method of delivering aid in favour of a dystopian system in which Palestinians are forced to compete for a trickle of often unusable aid, and are shot at while doing so. About 1,000 civilians have been murdered while seeking food since the end of May. “There is no case since World War II of starvation that has been so minutely designed and controlled,”declares Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on hunger. Under the Geneva conventions, “starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited”.Against this backdrop, on Monday the former Tory cabinet minister Kit Malthouse stood up in parliament and asked the foreign secretary,David Lammy, if he did “not see the personal risk to him, given our international obligations, that he may end up at The Hague because of his inaction?” Lammy bent over the dispatch box and adopted a tone of solemn disappointment, as one might do when seeking to rise above an unprovoked insult. “I have to tell him that it demeans his argument when he personalises it in the way that he does,” he shot back.But Malthouse did not resort to abuse. Indeed, the presiding deputy speaker did not reprimand him for unparliamentary language. Lammy intentionally conflated scrutiny with personal attack to avoid answering the question. Alas, like our prime minister, he is a lawyer by trade, and he should know that thegenocide convention of 1948identifies five punishable acts: one of them is “complicity in genocide”. He should know that signatories to the convention have a legal obligation “to prevent and to punish” the crime of genocide. He should also know that his country signed the convention the day it was published, and incorporated it into law 55 years ago.Israel’s official position is that,when it is finished, no Palestinians will remain in Gaza. “We are destroying more and more homes, and Gazans have nowhere to return to,” Benjamin Netanyahu openly boasts. It is building what its former prime minister Ehud Olmertsays is a “concentration camp”as the first step before deporting Gaza’s survivors. Eyal Benvenisti – theIsraeli lawyerwho is part of the legal team defending it against accusations of genocide at the international court of justice – says this would be a “war crime” and “fits the definition of a ‘crime against humanity’”. He subsequentlysigned a letterdeclaring that this plan “under certain conditions, could amount to the crime of genocide”.Indeed, international law leaves no room for doubt. When the UK ratified thearms trade treaty in 2014, it accepted that it must not “authorise any transfer of conventional arms … if it has knowledge at the time of authorisation … [that] would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes”. It also accepted that this included “parts and components” essential to the functioning of “combat aircraft”. Lammy’s governmentsupplies Israel with components crucial for the functioning of F-35 jets, whose bombs indiscriminately destroy civilian infrastructure and shred the bodies of little children. Lammy also knows, of course, that Britain is a founding member of the international criminal court, which last yearissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and his former defence minister for war crimes and crimes against humanity.When successfully defending the sale of F-35 components in the high court, the government offered its assessment that it had not seen anyevidence of women and childrenbeing deliberately targeted in Gaza, and there was no serious risk of a genocide. This contradicts dozens of American doctors and nurses who served in Gaza, who last year testified they hadreceived the bodies of Palestinian childrenshot in the head or chest by Israeli snipers.Israeli soldiers have confessedthat they are deliberately targeting children. Nick Maynard – a British doctor working in Gaza’s Nasser hospital –says thathe is seeing clusters of young teenagers who have been shot in different body parts: on one day, it’s the abdomen, on another, the head or neck, on another, the testicles. “So there’s a very clear pattern and it’s almost as if a game is being played,” he says.The government’s official position of genocide denial contradicts the consensus of actual genocide scholars who dedicate their lives to the field. That includes Israeli academics such as Omer Bartov, a pre-eminent professor of Holocaust and genocide studies, who said that as a former IDF officer he agonised overreaching his conclusion: “But I have been teaching classes on genocide for a quarter of a century. I can recognise one when I see one.”Those who have facilitated or justified this abomination have no excuses, no place to hide. More than a year ago, South Africa’s legal teamcomposed a dossierdetailing statements of genocidal and criminal intent issued by Israeli leaders and officials: it was 121 – pages long, and is now completely out of date. There is more video footage of civilians being slaughtered and civilian infrastructure being destroyed than any other war crime as it was happening in history.Yet not only does Britain supply Israel with those crucial F-35 components, its government refuses to describe a single Israeli act as a “war crime”, because it knows that then imposes sweeping legal obligations. Britain continues itsannual tradewith Israel, which last year was worth £5.8bn. Days after its tokenistic gesture ofsuspending trade treaty talks, Britain’s embassy in Israelcelebrated the arrivalof the UK trade envoy. When Britain imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, it did so on the grounds of their “horrendous extremist language”, rather than actions, because the latter implicates the British government. They refuse to impose meaningful sanctions on Israel itself.Byproscribing Palestine Action, the government has assured that it is opponents of genocide who face being hauled before the dock in the here and now. Our foreign secretary no doubt believes that the impunity traditionally enjoyed by western leaders and Israel itself will protect him and his colleagues for ever. That assumes the winds will never change. There is no statute of limitation for complicity in genocide. Israel’s crime is not yet complete. Lammy must believe that his freedom is safe for ever: that there will be no knock on his door in five, 10, 20 years. That is quite the bet.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He spends much of the day crying from hunger, or gnawing at his own emaciated fingers.At seven months old, he weighs barely 4kg (9lbs) and this is the second time he has been admitted for treatment. His face is gaunt, his limbs little more than bones covered in baggy skin and his ribs protrude painfully from his chest.“My biggest fear now is losing my grandson to malnutrition,” said his grandmother Faiza Abdul Rahman, who herself is constantly dizzy from lack of food. The previous day the only thing she ate was a single piece of pitta bread, which cost 15 shekels (£3).“His siblings also suffer from severe hunger. On some days, they go to bed without a single bite to eat.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Aliwa is in hospital with severe malnutrition.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The GuardianMohammed was born healthy but his mother was too malnourished to produce breast milk, and the family has only been able to get two cans of baby formula since.The ward at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society hospital is crowded with other skeletal children, some doubled up on the 12 beds. There are only two functioning paediatric teams left in Gaza City, and up to 200 children turn up daily seeking treatment.Dr Musab Farwana spends his days trying, but often failing, to save them. Then he goes home to share meals that are too small with his own hungry sons and daughters.The whole family are losing weight fast, because his salary buys almost nothing, and he doesn’t want to risk the deadly race for supplies handed out by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation after another medic, Dr Ramzi Hajaj, was killed trying to get food at one site.More than 40 of the 111 recorded starvation deaths in Gaza occurred over a three-day period this weekGaza has never been hungrier, despite several warnings about impending famine over the course of nearly two years of war. Over just three days this week public health officials recorded 43 deaths from hunger; there had been 68 in total before that.Faiza Abdul Rahman, who has stayed in Gaza City throughout the war, said even the time of the most intense controls on food entering northern Gaza last year were not as bad. “We faced hunger before, but never like this,” she said. “This is the hardest phase we’ve ever endured.”Testimony from local people and doctors, and data from the Israeli government, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the UN and humanitarian organisations, shows food is running out.Empty shelves are reflected in soaring prices, with flour selling for more than 30 times the market rate at the start of the year.Graphic showing rising price of flourEven money or influential employers can no longer protect Palestinians. “Humanitarian organisations are witnessing their own colleagues and partners waste away before their eyes,” more than 100 aid groups working in Gaza, including MSF, Save the Children and Oxfam, warned in a joint statement this week.The journalists’ union at AFP said on Monday that for the first time in the news agency’s historyit risks losing a colleague to starvation. On Wednesday the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,said a “large proportion” of Gaza’s population was starving. “I don’t know what you would call it other than mass-starvation – and it’s man-made,” he said.For months Israel has choked off food shipments. The total amounts allowed in since the start of March are well below starvation rations for the 2.1 million population, and Palestinians are already weakened by the impact of prolonged food shortages and repeated displacement.“For nearly two years, children here have suffered from famine. Even if some days they felt full, it’s not just about being full, it’s about receiving the nutrients the body needs. And those are completely absent,” said Farwana, the paediatrician.Those years of malnourishment make them more vulnerable to other diseases, and their low immunity is compounded by the severe shortages of basic medical supplies, which Israel has also blocked from entry.“Often, I feel devastated because there’s something so simple the child needs to survive, and we just can’t provide it,” he said. Three severely malnourished patients died in intensive care this week, one of them a girl who would have probably survived if doctors had been able to give her intravenous potassium, normally a basic medication, and now impossible to get hold of in Gaza.“We tried to give her oral alternatives, but due to her malnutrition and resulting complications, she had poor absorption.”“These cases haunt me, they never leave my mind. This child could have gone back to her family and lived a normal life. But because one simple thing wasn’t available she didn’t survive.”Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza from 2 March. When the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, lifted it on 19 May he claimed the government was acting to prevent a “starvation crisis”, because some of the country’s staunchest allies told him they would not tolerate images of famine.In fact the Israeli government simply shifted course to draw out the starvation crisis, letting in only minimal quantities of aid so that Gaza’s descent towards famine progressed a bit more slowly.The Israeli government announced plans to channel all aid through a secretive US-backed organisation that runs four militarised distribution points.Hundreds of people have been killed trying to get food handed out at sites Palestinians describe as “death traps”, which have handed out supplies that meet only a fraction of Gaza’s needs.By 22 July, GHF had been operating for 58 days but the food it had brought in would only have sustained the population of Gaza for less than a fortnight, even if it was distributed equally.View image in fullscreenThe Khalidi family children: Sabah, 12, Saba, 11, Zeina, 10, Ammera, two, Mohammed, seven, and Yousef, 13.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The GuardianOn Tuesday Umm Youssef al-Khalidi was preparing to try her luck at a GHF distribution centre for the first time. She had avoided them for months because her youngest child is two and her oldest 13 and her husband is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair.“We have been silencing our hunger with water,” she said. “My fear for my family is greater than my fear for myself. I fear something bad will happen to me, and I’ll leave them without anyone to care for them.”But her family went without food for four days last week, and when they broke the fast, eight of them had to share a bag of rice and two potatoes given to them by a passing stranger.The children were excellent students before the war, who always won scholarships. Now they spend their days sitting on the edge of the street under a bombed mosque in al-Wehda neighbourhood in Gaza City, where the girls try to sell bracelets rather than just begging.There is little demand for cheap jewellery in Gaza today, and although sometimes a passerby takes pity on the gang of skinny kids with dirty faces and tattered clothes, soaring prices means it buys little food.View image in fullscreenThe Khalidi family sit in front of the rubble of a bombed mosque while in front of them is a table where children sell bracelets made of beads.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The Guardian“My children have become skeletal, skin and bone,” Khalidi said. “Even the slightest effort makes them dizzy. They sit down again, asking for food, and I have nothing to give. I can’t lie and say I’ll bring them something when I know I won’t be able to.”So she had decided that in the grim calculus of risks for her family, the hope of getting a little food finally outweighed the risk of losing the adult who held their lives together.Her husband’s phone had been stolen earlier in the war, so they would have no way to communicate over the long hours that she would spend trekking to the GHF site, then racing to try to get food, and walking back. The family would just have to wait and hope.“I have no one else to send,” she said. “It’s painful to watch them suffer, and their health gets worse every day they go without food.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelFamineHungernewsShareReuse this content"

The demonstrators gathered outside the presidential office, shouting anti-government slogans.They want him to scrap a controversial law that effectively places the agencies under government control. In a video address, Zelenskyy sought to deflect criticism by promising a new presidential bill.It would guarantee the independence of anti-corruption institutions and at the same time ensure there was “no Russian influence”, he said. “Of course, everyone has heard what people are saying these days – on social media, to each other, on the streets. It’s not falling on deaf ears,” he added.But the apparent concession left protesters unimpressed. They said Zelenskyy has not agreed to scrap the controversial aspects of Tuesday’s bill and pointed out that the Verkhovna Rada – Ukraine’s parliament, which approved the changes – has gone on holiday for the summer recess.Olha Ivanova, who has worked in the anti-corruption sector, said the government was calculating that the protests would fizzle out. She predicted they would continue. “Civil society is huge in Ukraine. From time to time we have to remind the people in power that we elect them,” she said.Ivanova held up a placard in English and Ukrainian that read: “Have you lost your mind?” She said she hoped Zelenskyy would reverse his decision, adding: “He’s not a dictator. Nobody would say this. He’s a president in a very difficult political context during a war.”Ukraine’s European backers including Germany, France and Sweden have echoed concerns about the new legislation, which the Ukrainian president approved on Tuesday night. They warned it couldhamper Kyiv’s attempt to join the EUand hinder the fight against corruption.The bill gives sweeping powers to the prosecutor general’s office. It can now decide which cases the two independent agencies – the national anti-corruption bureau and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office – are allowed to pursue.The two institutions have been key to fighting high-level corruption and protecting billions in international aid and investment. Critics say they have been stripped of their autonomy, making them indistinguishable from ordinary law enforcement bodies.Zelenskyy says the shake-up was needed to clean Ukraine’s “anti-corruption infrastructure” of alleged Russian connections. On Wednesday, he convened a meeting with the heads of law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies at his presidential office in Kyiv.Olena Kurnytska, a 21-year-old student at York University, took part in Wednesday’s protest for the first time. She waved a placard saying “I would like to see the future, not the flashbacks”. She said: “We feel like its our civic duty to be here. It’s an easy situation to exploit. A wartime government can twist democracy more easily.”Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, was one of several prominent European figures who voiced unhappiness at the legislative amendments.

As a candidate country, Ukraine is expected to uphold these standards fully. There cannot be a compromise.”In a pointed message to Kyiv, the EU’s defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, said trust during wartime was “easy to lose with one significant mistake by the leadership … Transparency and open European dialogue is the only way to repair [it].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crowd on Wednesday was larger than the night before. The street protests, which took place in several cities, were the first since Vladimir Putin’s 2022 full-scale invasion.Civil-society leaders have accused the presidential administration ofviolating an informal contract with society. They say the agreement with government – that it was inappropriate to criticise official abuses because of the war with Russia – is definitively over.0:50Protests in Ukraine as Zelenskyy approves law to weaken anti-corruption agencies - videoAbout 3,000 demonstrators gathereddirectly outside Zelenskyy’s administration complex on Wednesday evening, shouting slogans beneath his window. They included “shame”, “we are the power”, and “veto the law”.Posting earlier on Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians faced a “common enemy” in the shape of “Russian occupiers”. Of public criticism, he said: “We all hear what society says. We see what people expect from state institutions to ensure justice and the efficiency of each institution.”Yuriy Sak, a former adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry, said Ukrainians had a strong historical tradition of protesting against anything that resembled authoritarianism or dictatorship, in Soviet times and today.“It’s in our DNA. We have a very good sense for where the red line is, and for when people cross this line. If anyone tries to tighten their grip on power people pour into the streets,” he said, citing the uprisings in 2004 and 2014 against perceived government misrule.Sak likened the collective mood to the air raid alerts that sound most evenings, when Kyiv and other cities came under Russian missile attack. “Whenever we see authoritarianism on the move, a silent siren goes off in Ukrainian heads,” he suggested.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropeEuropean CommissionVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Anna Valero, another member of Reeves’s council of economic advisers, will also depart.‘He’s one of the best’: the economist shaping Rachel Reeves’s growth plansRead moreTreasury sources said that while Van Reenen’s position was in theory part-time, his position at the chancellor’s side through a tumultuous 12 months had meant working “seven days a week”.Reeves is under intense pressure to respond to a deteriorating economic outlook with a fresh round oftax risesin her autumn budget.The chancellor has had a bruising few months after being forced to reverse her decision to remove the winter fuel allowance from most pensioners and take much of the blame from Labour’s backbenchers for the botched £5bn in cuts to disability benefits.At a House of Lords committee on Tuesday, the chancellor placed Van Reenen’s key insight – the need for higher investment to boost the UK’s productivity – at the heart of her economic strategy.The chancellor toldpeers: “The key problem is productivity and investment is the answer. Investment in human capital, investment in physical capital and also investment in new technologies. That’s why the fiscal rules I set out do treat investment differently.”She declined to rule out taxing wealth more heavily, telling Lord Lamont, a former Conservative chancellor in the 1990s: “This is, with respect, what you would have done and did do in my position: you rightly said that tax is a matter for a budget and we’ll set out our policy then.”Treasury sources said Valero, also an LSE fellow, had always been expected to return to academia but would remain in touch with government, adding that Valero and Van Reenen had worked on key policy announcements, including the industrial strategy and the spending review, which had now been completed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many reported increased anxiety and isolation.John Hume, the chief executive of People’s Health Trust, said: “This report lays bare the immediate and longer-term health impacts of racist violence. Last year’s racist riots have left a deep scar, especially in communities already facing inequality, discrimination, and disinvestment.”The charity has urged the government to recognise and address the severe and lasting health impacts on those communities and to develop a specific strategy – with dedicated resources – to support those affected and help prevent future unrest.“We need to address the root causes of this violence which is both misinformation across the media and social media and the deepening dissatisfaction resulting from decades of austerity, poor housing and cost of living crises,” Hume said.“Now is the time for meaningful coordinated action from decision-makers at a national and local level.”Of the grassroots organisations surveyed, 62% said those they support were “likely” or “very likely” to experience racist hate crime or violence in the near future – with many describing the abuse as a daily occurrence.Incidents included an 18-year-old woman receiving racist abuse from adult men twice in one week.One community arts organisation in north-west England, which contributed to the report, said: “The incident and riots actually occurred in our participants’ streets, and they claim this will definitely be a traumatic childhood experience for them – especially since some of the participants were related to the girls involved in the Southport incident, or had relatives who were friends with the families, attended their schools, or lived in their neighbourhood.”“This has led to a physical withdrawal among the young people, with a reluctance to practise the independence they should now be displaying and celebrating. They stated that their main peer social interactions during this time occurred within our project, and they did not feel safe interacting outside of it.”Tamsin Hoare, the Kurt and Magda Stern Foundation chair, said: “These findings shed crucial light on the deep and lasting harms caused by last summer’s violence, and on the conditions that led to it.“We hope the recommendations, and clear and powerful calls to action, will inspire decisive change from leaders and institutions, so that all communities can feel a true sense of safety and belonging.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthImmigration and asylumSouthport attackShareReuse this content"

Spokesperson Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement: “The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.”New photos and videos highlight close ties between Epstein and TrumpRead moreTrumpfiled a $10bn defamation lawsuitagainst the Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, last week over an article about an alleged sexually suggestive letter bearing Trump’s name that was included in a 2003 album compiled for Epstein’s birthday. The president has denied writing the letter and has since sued the Journal.The White House subsequently banned one of the Journal’s reporters from Air Force One for an upcoming trip to Scotland.The justice department concluded earlier this month that there was not a basis to continue the Epstein investigation,triggering a fierce backlashamong Trump’s support base over what they have long seen as a cover-up of Epstein’s crimes and high-level connections.It has also fuelled speculation about Trump’s 15-year friendship with Epstein. In June Elon Musk, a billionaire friend-turned-foe of the president, tweeted that Trump is “in the Epstein files”.The Journal reported on Wednesday: “When justice department officials reviewed what attorney general Pam Bondi called a ‘truckload’ of documents related toJeffrey Epsteinearlier this year, they discovered that Donald Trump’s name appeared multiple times.”Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, said in a statement: “Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution, and we have filed a motion in court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts. As part of our routine briefing, we made the President aware of the findings.”This came shortly after a federal judge in south Florida denied a justice department request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein, the first ruling in a series of attempts by Trump’s administration to release more information on the case.The request stemmed from federal investigations into Epstein in 2005 and 2007, according to court documents. US district judge Robin Rosenberg found that the justice department’s request in Florida did not fall into any of the exceptions to rules requiring grand jury material be kept secret.The justice department has pending requests to unseal transcripts in a Manhattan federal court related to later indictments brought against Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell.In 2008 Epstein cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida that allowed him to escape more severe federal charges and instead plead guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution.The wealthy financier later was arrested in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges. His former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was charged with helping him abuse teenage girls.US judge rejects Trump administration’s bid to unseal Epstein grand jury transcriptsRead moreEpstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York City about a month after he was arrested. Investigators concluded he killed himself. Maxwell later was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.The justice department has asked lawyers for Maxwell if she would be willing to speak with prosecutors, and Blanche said on Tuesday he expected to meet with her in the coming days.Democrats and about a dozen Republicans in the House of Representatives are also pressing for answers. On Wednesday the powerful House oversight committee voted 8-2 to subpoena the justice department to release files related to Epstein, with three Republicans joining all Democrats. They also subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, on 11 August.The committee chair, James Comer, wrote in asubpoenacover letterto Maxwell: “While the Justice Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to your and Mr Epstein’s cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government’s enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of you and Mr Epstein.“In particular, the Committee seeks your testimony to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinPam BondinewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, she has doubled down on these claims and added more, including in an eight-part podcast series called Becoming Brigitte, the lawsuit alleges.The Macrons sought retractions from Owens, the suit says, for the “demonstrably false” claims she has made about them but she instead “mocked them and used them as additional fodder for her frenzied fan base”.“These outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions included that Mrs Macron was born a man, stole another person’s identity, and transitioned to become Brigitte; Mrs Macron and President Macron are blood relatives committing incest; President Macron was chosen to be the President ofFranceas part of the CIA-operated MKUltra program or a similar mind-control program; and Mrs Macron and President Macron are committing forgery, fraud, and abuses of power to conceal these secrets.“Because Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys’ repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,” the Macrons said in a statement. “Ms Owens’ campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety. We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.”The falsehoods have taken a toll on the Macrons, who are now subjected to “a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Beyond the reputational damage, they have spent “considerable sums of money to correct the public record”, including on legal counsel.“Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” the suit says.According to the Financial Times, the Macrons are willing to appear in court in Delaware for a trial. They are represented by Clare Locke, a heavyweight law firm that has won major defamation cases, including theDominion lawsuitagainst Fox News.The lawsuit came after the Macrons have sent three separate retraction demands to Owens that included evidence disproving her claims, which she has used to “further taunt the Macrons” and “invent even more damaging lies”, apress releasefrom Locke says.In a statement, a spokesperson for Owens said the commentator was “not shutting up”. Owens is expected to address the lawsuit on her show on Wednesday.“This is a foreign government attacking the first amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It’s America.”The shining: my trip to the G7 horror show with Emmanuel Macron | Emmanuel CarrèreRead moreIt is unusual for a sitting president to sue a journalist, though Donald Trump has filed multiple lawsuits, some of which have led to settlements, against US media outlets in recent months.Attacks on Brigitte Macron’s appearance and falsehoods about her gender havecirculatedfor years, though Owens amplified them considerably in the US. Other prominent women in politics, including Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris have faced these kinds of “secretly transgender” social media campaigns, the Wilson Center noted in a 2021 report on the “deeply misogynistic” trend. “These narratives tap into the trope of the duplicitous woman, implying that not only are transgender individuals inherently deceptive, but that this deception is responsible for the power and influence that these women hold,” the report said.The Macrons have previously filed legal claims against two women in France over their theory that Brigitte Macron is a biological male. They were initially found guilty of libel, though that was then overturned, which Brigitte Macron has now appealed.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFar right (US)Defamation lawMedia lawLaw (US)FranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And you may not need to walk as far as previously thought to reap those benefits.The NHS recommendsa brisk 10-minute walk every day. Many people aim to walk 10,000 steps, but struggle to achieve it. Now researchers have calculated that even 7,000 steps could be enough to protect health.Scientists examined data from more than 160,000 adults and found that walking 7,000 steps a day was associated with a reduced risk of a number of serious health conditions and death.Whereas previous studies have mainly examined the links between step count and heart health or overalldeath rates, this systematic review and meta analysis, published in the Lancet Public Health,sought to comprehensively examine how taking more steps per day could reduce the risk of a range of other health conditions as well.Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, the researchers found that achieving the 7,000 daily step target was linked to a 37% reduction in risk of dying from cancer, while the risk was 14% lower for type 2 diabetes, 38% for dementia, 22% depression and 28% for falls respectively. It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchFitnessWalkingHealth & wellbeingNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They were still out there more than two and a half hours after they had begun their shot at history, waving at their exultant families and reliving what had just passed. A first European Championship final awaits on Sunday, which may have felt inevitable for three weeks but feels no smaller a milestone for that. England present a familiar last hurdle and what a tie it should be between two sides that, in different ways, had to squeeze over the line.In the end it had to be Aitana Bonmatí. Extra time was drifting to a conclusion and, for the first time this summer, Spain were screaming for a spark from the world’s best player. They had plenty of chances to win inside 90 minutes but, against an outstanding Germany side, could so easily have been vanquished too. Had their keeper, Catalina Coll, not made a remarkable double save at the end of normal time they would finally have reckoned with mortality. Bonmatí, for one, did not fancy playing so loosely with the odds again.Germany offer steely resilience but Bonmatí’s moment of magic solves puzzle | Sophie DowneyRead moreA customary stroke of genius or the spoils of sloppy goalkeeping? The debate will rage about Bonmatí’s winner and a fair reading would err towards the former. Ann-Katrin Berger had been immaculate between the posts for Germany and did not look in immediate danger when Athenea del Castillo played Bonmatí, who had let the ball run through her legs and darted to meet it, through towards the right byline.Presumably Berger had set herself for a cross; she could not react in time to the thrashed first-time strike inside her near post that few players would have dared attempt in the circumstances. Nobody could doubt the scorer’s intention, either. Afterwards Bonmatí explained Spain had been perfectly aware that Berger was predisposed to leaving that area of her goal exposed.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí squeezes her shot past Ann-Katrin Berger at her near post.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/APThis was the same Bonmatí who, a month previously,had been hospitalised by viral meningitisin a turn of events that severely clouded Spain’s preparations. Back then it would have taken an admirable level of optimism to imagine her going the distance in a tense, rugged, enthralling last-four clash and ultimately waving the magic wand. England must find a way to cope with her and the rest of a team that, while short of its best here, remains a notch above any other contender at this competition.A rerun of the 2023 World Cup will hold few surprises. “I know what they can do,” said the midfielder Mariona Caldentey of England’s qualities as sheets of water continued to teem down. “It will be a hard game. They’re in the final even if they haven’t played the greatest football yet. It’s something we have never won and is something we are missing. We respect England, but we will go for it.”For long periods it appeared that, against the pre-match odds, Germany’s muscle memory could win out. They have ruled the continent eight times and it feels a trick of the light that their drought will now extend 16 years to Euro 2029. Even if it takes a colossal stretch to cast them as plucky underdogs they could make that case here, weakened by injuries and suspensions while on the back of aremarkable win over Francein which they had ground through 113 minutes with 10 players.This was a side that, similarly light on numbers for an hour,lost 4-1 to Swedenhere 11 days previously. It helped that they kept a full complement against Spain and the frustration for Christian Wück’s players will be that they played the occasion perfectly. The balance between defensive resolve and attacking thrust was cleverly poised; they knew Berger would be leaned on at intervals but it would have been no scandal had the dice rolled their way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She tested Coll in the second half and arrowed a free-kick just wide but it was a deflected shot from Elisa Senss that, with almost the final action before the additional period, almost broke through. A backpeddling Coll had to scramble the ball from under her bar and, when Carlotta Wamser followed up, reacted to block on the line. It was a defining moment to match Bonmatí’s later flourish.Earlier Berger,hero of that epicagainst France, could count a spectacular tip-over from Esther González among a number of interventions. She was beaten when Irene Paredes headed against her left post but, beyond a flurry before half-time, Spain were kept at arm’s length. They were rarely fluent, at least by their peerless standards, against opponents who had expected to run hard and did exactly that.Now their modern rivalry with England travels from Sydney to Basel with two years and, for those who took in both Euro 2025 semi-finals, several lifetimes in between. “We had the correct mindset at the right moments,” Bonmatí said.Nobody exemplifies it more.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Within hours, Seoul joined Washington and Tokyo in condemning the launch as a “serious threat” to regional peace and security.But justweeks earlier, when a North Korean KN-23 missile – designed to strike South Korean targets – hit a residential building in Kyiv, killing 12 civilians, Seoul said nothing.That silence fits a broader pattern. There was no response when Russiareportedly deployeda surface-to-air missile system to protect Pyongyang, nor when Ukrainian intelligence revealed that Russian instructors weretraining North Korean drone pilotson home soil, even as Kim Jong-un voiced “unconditional support” for Moscow’s war.Kim Jong-un pays rare public tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in UkraineRead moreRelations between the North and South, technically still at war, remain tense and the muted response has raised questions from analysts over whether Seoul fully grasps the consequences of what many see as North Korea’s most significant military transformation in decades – one shaped in real warfare, on the battlefields of Ukraine.“We definitely should be alarmed,” says Chun In-bum, a former South Korean special forces commander. “But it’s just the nature of people to avoid catastrophe or be indifferent to the terrors of reality.”Learning modern warfareAccording to Ukraine’s military intelligence agency,North Korea supplies 40% of all munitions used by Russiain its war against Kyiv. It has dramatically increased arms production at home, with Moscow paying Pyongyang directly.In autumn last year, Pyongyang dispatched an estimated 12,000 troops to fight in Russia’s Kursk region. That deployment has since expanded significantly. An additional 6,000 soldiers are now joined by 1,000 military engineers, hundreds of railway engineers, bridge-building specialists, logistics personnel, electricians, military police, and even interpreters, focused largely on rebuilding the battle-scarred Kursk region, according to Ukrainian officials.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: A firefighter extinguishes the remains of an unidentified missile, which Ukrainian authorities claim was made in North Korea.Above: Part of a missile.Photograph: ReutersThis military partnership with Moscow has been invaluable for Kim Jong-un’s regime, Maj Gen Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, the HUR, told the Guardian.“North Korea’s armed forces got new ammunition [from Russia]. Its soldiers gained experience of modern conflict. No other army in the region – Japan, South Korea and other countries – [has] participated in a modern war between two huge regular armies.”The ideological commitment of their forces became clear when Ukraine captured two woundedNorth Korean prisoners in January.“We were shocked by them. They were bio-robots. They tried to kill themselves by biting their own veins,” Skibitskyi says. When one was asked if he wanted to return home, he replied: “Yes, because I will be treated like a hero. I fought in a modern war.”North Korean troops are learning about combined arms warfare and the operation of strike and reconnaissance drones, electronic warfare systems, and other technologies previously unfamiliar to them.Moscow has transferred advanced weaponry and has helped upgrade the accuracy of North Korea’sKN-23 ballistic missiles, which have since targeted Ukrainian urban centres, including Kharkiv.In June, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, issued apointed warningidentifying South Korea directly: “This must be addressed now, not when thousands of upgraded Shahed drones and ballistic missiles begin to threaten Seoul and Tokyo.”However, a mix of strategic, economic and political factors are discouraging more visible action from South Korea, says Dr Yang Uk, a defence expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.Acknowledging North Korea’s military experience as a direct threat to Seoul would create pressure for a more robust domestic response, includingpotential weapons transfersto Ukraine that remaindeeply unpopular in South Korea.“Defence officials are particularly wary after December’s events,” Yang said, referring to thefailed declaration of martial lawby South Korean’s then president, Yoon Suk Yeol. “They’re really afraid of political attack and prefer to stay unseen by the public and press.”View image in fullscreenNorth Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong-un, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at a welcoming ceremony in Pyongyang on 19 June 2024.Photograph: Vladimir Smirnov/AFP/Getty ImagesYang warns that Russia is working to integrate North Korea into its long-term defence supply chain – a partnership that could reshape Asia’s military balance long after the war ends.Some analysts see Seoul’s silence as an extension of its longstanding “strategic ambiguity”: a reluctance to engage in foreign conflicts or unnecessarily alienate key powers, particularly those that might retain influence over Pyongyang.Economic factors weigh heavily too. Prewar, Russia was one of South Korea’stop trading partners. Amid Donald Trump’s tariff threats, the new Lee Jae Myung government’s focus on economic recovery and “pragmatic diplomacy” leaves little appetite for confrontation.Domestic politics also play a role. Lee’s Democratic partysupports engagementwith the North, reflecting how South Korea’s left-right dividecentres more on North Korea policythan on western progressive values. Voices on the left argue South Korea owes Ukraine nothing.Old norms and modern threatsSome of Seoul’s inertia may be bureaucratic. Chun points to procurement and planning processes that can take years, even as threats evolve within months.“We are dealing with a level 10 super Godzilla,” he said. “But the bureaucracy only sees a tiger.”North Koreans are already employing what they have learned in battle, he warns. “This should be a real wake-up call.”Skibitskyi echoes that concern, suggesting South Korea’s military doctrine is outdated and modelled on a pre-drone era.When asked by the Guardian whether it viewed North Korea’s deployments and combat experience in Ukraine as a security concern, South Korea’s defence ministry avoided addressing the implications directly.“The participation of North Korean military personnel in the war in Ukraine constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN charter and relevant UN security council resolutions,” a spokesperson said. “The Republic of Korea strongly condemns such inhumane and unlawful acts in concert with the international community.”Whether Seoul’s cautious approach reflects calculated long-term strategy or institutional paralysis remains unclear.But for Chun, the warning signs are impossible to ignore.“This is like a speeding train coming towards you,” he said. “You better move aside or start making preparations – while you still have time.”Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaRussiaUkraineSouth KoreaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

India’s average tariff rate is 13%, compared with the UK’s 1.5%.Labour ministers clinched the deal within 10 months of entering government, defying expectations – above all their own – about how quickly it could be done.The negotiations were led byJonathan Reynolds, the trade secretary, and his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal. Half a dozen UK officials and aides said the rapport between the pair and a focus on building trust and good relationships were critical to getting it over the line.That sometimes happened in creative ways. After Goyal told them he was a huge fan ofYes Minister, British negotiators brought him a handwritten note from Jonathan Lynn, one of the show’s co-creators.View image in fullscreenJonathan Reynolds first met Piyush Goyal on a visit to Delhi in February. Their rapport is said to have been critical to getting the deal over the line.Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters“Negotiating with India is not the same as negotiating, say, with Australia, or the USA, or Canada. It’s a relationship-based system, very much about who gets on with who and ensuring that you don’t insult anyone in any way,” said one senior UK official who has been closely involved in talks.“People want to get to know you, they want to look you in the eye and be convinced that you are someone they can do business with,” another senior UK official said. “And to some extent, the last year has been a bit of the two governments looking each other in the eye.”This meant a key task for British diplomats in India – including the high commissioner, Lindy Cameron, and the trade commissioner, Harjinder Kang – was to provide UK ministers and officials with something akin to relationship advice on dealing with their Indian counterparts.There were moments of comedy. At one point after a difficult set of negotiations, UK and Indian officials let off steam by doingyogain the corridor outside the room.On another occasion, the British negotiators led by Kate Thornley were at the airport in Delhi about to fly home when they received a call from the Indian side saying they were prepared to make key concessions on food and drink. A negotiator who had not yet gone through airport security turned on his heels to rush back to the negotiation room.“You have moments where it’s almost collapsing, and you have moments where you think you’ve got it over the line,” the first senior official said. “Until there’s ink on a piece of paper, it’s fluid.”Political signalling was crucial. Reynolds first met Goyal when Labour was in opposition, while he and David Lammy were visiting Delhi in February 2024. India and the UK were due to hold elections that year, with Modi widely expected to win a third term and Labour on course to end 14 years of Tory government.The trip was a particularly sensitive one for Labour, which was working to mend relations with India after a nadir in 2019 when Jeremy Corbyn was perceived to havesided with Pakistan over Kashmir.Lammy and Reynolds were having dinner with Indian investors and had not expected to meet Goyal, who like other ministers was occupied with the budget debate in parliament. But during dinner they got a message from Goyal inviting them to his home nearby for a nightcap.Over 11pm chai and kheer, Reynolds and Lammy made it clear that they would support the Conservative government if it finalised a trade deal with India – and would pick up the negotiations after the election if it didn’t.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Narendra Modi reiterated their ambition for a deal when they met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/ReutersA few months later, during the thick of the UK election campaign, Lammy addressed the India Global Forum and said a trade deal with the country was “a floor, not a ceiling, of our ambitions”. He travelled to Delhi in late July, having promised Modi’s government that he would visit in his first month as foreign secretary.“There was an element of, these guys actually mean what they say,” a senior UK official recalled. “In their manifesto, there’s only one country that gets a mention – that’s India. All these positive signals were received.”In November,Starmer and Modi meton the margins of the G20 summit in Brazil and reiterated their ambition for a deal. But, in the months that followed, there was a lull in negotiations which created some frustration on the Indian side, fuelling suspicions that it was not as much a priority for Labour as it had been for the Tories.In truth, Reynolds’s team considered a trade deal with India to be a medium-term goal, one that was unlikely to materialise until later in the parliament. And instead of getting back around the negotiating table straight away, ministers spent several months combing through what had been already agreed under the Conservatives. “We were going through it and bringing ministers of all departments up to speed,” said a senior UK official.In February, a year after first meeting Goyal, Reynolds travelled to Delhi toformally restart negotiations. Progress in those talks significantly exceeded officials’ expectations – and crucially the two sides agreed not to reopen the aspects of the deal negotiated under the Tories. “Things started to fall into place at such a pace,” a government source recalled. A few weeks later Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, who has also been closely involved in the talks, hosted the Indian finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, in 11 Downing Street.View image in fullscreenNirmala Sitharaman, India’s finance minister, met Rachel Reeves in London in April; they attended the UK-India economic and financial dialogue at the London Stock Exchange Group.Photograph: Justin Tallis/PASignificant headway in the negotiations had been made under Rishi Sunak, whose chief economic adviser, Douglas McNeill, would travel to India every other month for talks. Before the Indian and UK electionsstopped things in their tracks, Conservative officials had hoped a deal could be struck by the autumn of 2024.The Tories were hamstrung by two obstacles which disappeared when Labour came into power. The first was Sunak’s political weakness and sense he was on borrowed time. The second and most significant was Tory angst that the deal would trigger an influx of Indian migration. Suella Braverman, as the home secretary,nearly blew up the talksover the issue in 2022.Kemi Badenoch claimed this year that as Sunak’s trade secretary, she stopped a deal with India because of immigration concerns – a claim which some of her former cabinet colleagues have disputed. A Labour source said Goyal “found her disingenuous in that she would always try to present Indian asks around visas as much more than they are”.The final dealdoes not change immigration policy beyond facilitating visa routes in certain sectors and allowing up to 1,800 extra visas for Indian chefs, musicians and yogis a year.The agreement was finalised on 2 May by Goyal, Reynolds and their teams of negotiators over ice-cream on a sunny walk in Hyde Park. They celebrated with coffee by the lido and took pictures together in the park cafe. Civil servants worked intensively that bank holiday weekend before Starmer and Modi spoke on Tuesday to confirm the deal was done.UK hopes have since faded, however, about the chances of agreeing a separate bilateral investment treaty with India, coveted by the UK because of the benefits for the City of London. While negotiations over a treaty continue, multiple ministers and officials privately told the Guardian that they are unlikely to yield anything unless there is significant movement on the Indian side.Nonetheless, officials are bullish about what has been achieved. “People said it would never be done,” one said. “People said this is a country that doesn’t like to do deals, it’s a very protectionist society. They’re changing, they’re growing, they’re developing to become a much more modern economy. They need this is much as we do.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyIndiaJonathan ReynoldsEconomic policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Another questioned: “Is this it?” A third asked: “At what point does our basic humanity require us to take stronger action? Many of us think the red line was passed a long time ago.”Gaza: if the UK won’t act now, then when? – podcastRead moreThe fury across the Commons was evident. “Are words enough?” asked one veteran Tory. A second accused Lammy of “complicity by inaction” and warned it could land him at the international court of justice in The Hague. A Lib Dem highlighted that repeated UK expressions of regret had not prevented further carnage.A clearly despairing Lammy attempted to reassure the politicians the government was playing its part. “Me raising my voice will not bring this war to an end. I lament that and I regret that. But am I sure that the UK government are doing everything in our power? Yes, I am.”But as international condemnation ofIsraelover the horrors it is inflicting on starving Palestinian civilians grows, Keir Starmer’s government is struggling to convince the British public that it is doing enough.The outrage in the Commons is reflected across the country more widely, withthe public increasingly regardingIsrael’s response since the7 October attacksas disproportionate, as the atrocities continued.The government has been on the defensive, pointing out that it hasrestored funding to the UN agency Unrwa, provided millions inhumanitarian assistance,sanctioned far-right Israeli ministersandthose who committed settler violence, andbroken off trade negotiations with Israel.But it has struggled to explain its export licensing regime. Ministers say they havestopped the sale of arms, despite there still being more than 300 licences in operation. These include, they say, body armour sent to protect NGO workers, chemicals for Israeli universities and components for goods which are then transported to Nato allies.In particular, there is anger at the UK decision to allow theexport of F-35 fighter jet componentsto Israel, which ministers argue is unavoidable because they are part of a global programme over which the UK does not have unilateral control.It exposes serious weaknesses in the regime and some believe the government should go further – with a fuller export embargo and an end to all military cooperation with Israel. Lammy has only recently sought to explain that RAF flights that overflyGazado not share information to help Israel conduct the war. “We are not doing that. I would never do that,” he said this week.Starmer is also under pressureto immediately recognise a Palestinian state, both from hisown backbenches,within his cabinetandfrom the wider diplomatic community.Ministers say the UK will “play its part” in working towards formal recognition, with a UN conference led by the French and Saudis later this month a key moment. Privately, they warn the move would only be symbolic unless there is a ceasefire first. But for many, who think the UK should be matching France’s more hardline stance, that is not a good enough reason not to. “If not now, then when?” one cabinet minister said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are you not hearing that?” a Labour MP asked. “How could I not?” the foreign secretary responded.But while Lammy may have got the message, he appears restricted by both the caution of the UK prime minister and the realpolitik that there is only one foreign power that could single-handedly force an end to the conflict: the US.“I wish we could, but the truth is … we are unable to do that just as the United Kingdom,” he told MPs. “We have to work in partnership with our allies.” But for many, that will not be enough.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDavid LammyForeign policyIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

It was detained after the vessel had helped to rescue about 70 people in international waters, many of whom had been suffering from fuel burns, seasickness and dehydration.“This decision is politically motivated; those who rescue are punished,” said Karla Primc, the head of operations on the Aurora. “That is the reality in 2025.”A smaller vessel that was also involved in the rescue operation, the Dakini, was also detained. Sea-Watch linked the detentions to the decision to bring the 70 rescued people to the port of Lampedusa, rather than the much farther port of Pozzallo, where the Italian authorities had directed them.“Due to the difficult weather conditions, the Aurora developed a significant list and the rescued persons and crew were exposed to a high risk of hypothermia and going overboard,” it said. “Keeping the Italian authorities constantly informed, the ship’s crew headed for the closer port of Lampedusa. After about 10 hours, the Aurora entered Lampedusa with explicit consent ofItalyand brought all rescued persons safely ashore.”View image in fullscreen‘The Italian state is really trying to use all its means to keep us away,’ said one crew member of the Nadir.Photograph: Leon SalnerRights groups began sounding the alarm over an increase in vessel detentions in early June when the authorities detainedthe Nadir,a boat operated by the German association ResQship, for 20 days. It was the first time a sailboat had been detained since the Italian governmentimposed hardline ruleson civilian sea rescue activities in 2023, suggesting it was extending the rules beyond larger ships.Days later, a vessel operated by the Germany-based search and rescue organisation Sea-Eyewas also detained. The ships faced varying accusations of not complying with the authorities’ instructions around rescues at sea, which have included requirementspreventing shipsfrom responding to multiple distress calls and making them travel long distances to ports in central and northern Italy.“It’s clear now that the Italian state is really trying to use all its means to keep us away,” said Jelka Kretzschmar, a crew member of the Nadir. “The effects of this will obviously be that people disappear at sea, they drown, they suffer with no one watching and the scandal of how this is being systematically curated byEuropewill not be exposed. Instead people will be more extensively pushed back by European authorities and pulled back by Tunisian and Libyan authorities and put back in torture camps or abducted and dropped in the desert.”The Italian government did not respond to a request for comment.View image in fullscreenPeople rescued at sea are disembarked from the Nadir.Photograph: Leon SalnerSince the hardline rules on civilian sea rescues took effect in early 2023, large NGO ships have been detained 29 times, leaving them languishing in harbours for 700 days instead of saving lives,according to the affected organisations. Another 822 days were lost navigating to far-off ports.What appears to be different this time around is that smaller vessels such as the Dakini, which offers life vests and water but cannot bring people onboard due to its small size, are also being targeted, say campaigners. “Therefore the practice of detention hits a new era – including now also ships of the so-called minifleet that are only supporting rescue operations,” the ship’s crew said in a message to the Guardian.This year marks 10 years since NGO ships began operating in the Mediterranean. Over the years they’ve rescued more than 175,000 people, even as many have grappled with increased criminalisation and legal crackdowns. Earlier this month, 32 organisations issued a statement demanding that the Italian government end its “systematic obstruction” of NGO search and rescue efforts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For another 20 days, the vessel had been unable to leave the port of Lampedusa, even as mayday calls rang out over the radio.“It’s like there’s an invisible wall,” said James Watson, a British doctor who was on his fourth volunteer trip on the vessel when it was detained. “You can hear about these cases which are really distressing, you can hear it in the voices of the people who are reporting them. Everyone of those cases is really scary and represents people whose lives are at risk. And then you’re just sort of sat there, unable to do anything about it.”Figures from the International Organization for Migration suggest that this year more than 800 people have drowned in the Mediterranean, though the actual death toll is believed to be significantly higher.Ultimately Watson felt as though the Italian government’s actions were aimed at quelling the crucial roles that NGO rescue ships play in the Mediterranean. “These deliberate efforts to make the sea rescue harder, to take people who can be involved and help, out of that area not only increase the number of people dying but they kind of invisibilise it,” he said.“If nobody is in the area to find boats, to report on boats, then we don’t even know how many people are dying,” he said. “So it’s not just that people are going to die, which they definitely are, but nobody’s even going to hear about those people dying.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But the arrival of an active club, which has also shown itself in other nearby towns and cities like Toronto (the country’s largest metropolitan area), is a relatively new development.“Welcome to Hamilton, our city,” one Telegram post from the same Canadian active club wrote with its symbol posted on a sticker beside a sign for one of Ontario’s largest cities. “Folk-Family-Future!”Around the world, Canada isn’t the only country being introduced to these clubs, which are fitness and mixed martial arts groups operating out of local gyms and parks that espouse neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies. Already proliferating across the US in a number of states, active clubs openly take their historical cues from the Third Reich’s obsession with machismo and their modern inspiration from European soccer hooliganism.Recent research published by theGlobal Project Against Hate and Extremism(GPAHE) has shown that since 2023, these clubs are newly sprouting in Sweden, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, the UK, Finland and for the first time, in Latin America with two chapters in Chile and Colombia appearing.According to the GPAHE research, there are now chapters in 27 countries, with newyouth wings– akin to Hitler Youth-styled clubs – are surging stateside and abroad, “metastasizing” across western countries and recruiting young men into toxic, far-right ideologies encouraging race war.“The Active Club model was designed by Rob Rundo,” said Heidi Beirich, founder of GPAHE, referring to an infamous neo-Nazi and New Yorker whopleaded guilty in 2024to conspiracy to riot at 2017 political rallies in California.Around that time, Rundo was also the leader of theRise Above Movement, a neo-Nazi gang that had four of its members charged for their role in the2017 Unite the Right rallyin Charlottesville, Virginia, but later pivoted to spreading the idea of active clubs among followers as the new nerve centers for fascistic indoctrination and recruitment.“As far as we can tell, Rundo isn’t directly involved with chapters of the movement in a systematic way, but the chapters are inspired by him and the ideology he stands for,” said Beirich.Beirich explained that although Rundo isn’t likely to have a hand in these groups, it meshes with his original vision of active clubs being “autonomous and local”. But many of these chapters of active clubs in countries with large populations of white people – some of whom openly have gravitated towards racist, nativism in recent years – promote each other as a global struggle and are linked in a network of accounts on the Telegram app.One set of accounts, in particular, that have become the sort-of tastemakers among neo-Nazis online, have promoted several local active club chapters across the world and applauded those they think are creating the effective models to emulate.The same accounts admire the work of Thomas Sewell, a well-known andviolent Australian neo-Nazi, who has been promoting active club-styled groups in his country:“Their organization should be what every dissident group across European civilization seeks to emulate,” said one admiring post about Sewell and his crew.Beirich said Sewell, who previously admitted to have personally tried torecruit the Christchurch mass shooterto one of his past groups, is aligned with Rundo’s politics.“Sewell, just like Rundo, is a violent neo-Nazi recruiting new members to prepare for violence against both political enemies and the communities he targets, such as immigrants, Jews and the LGBTQ+ community,” she said, adding that he was “hosting MMA-style training and tournaments” to attract new followers.The Ultimate Fighting Championship and the combat sports that fall under its purview, have become alocus for the far right. Likewise, Sewell and Rundo have promoted learning these sports as a means of becoming street soldiers, akin to modern-day brownshirts, for their movement.Other organizations, which are more obviously political and engaging in public displays of activism, have seen this model of trained violence as a means of recruiting and solidifying their ranks. Patriot Front, an American proto-fascist hate group known for public marches andpropagandizing natural disasters, has outwardly linked itself to the active club movement.Its leader, Thomas Rousseau recently posted a group image with himself and others doing “grappling and striking” training at a martial arts gym in north Texas.Beirich described how members of Patriot Front “often work closely with Active Club chapters” including participating in their mixed-martials training. On Telegram, active club chapters regularly share Patriot Front propaganda.“Join Patriot Front if you are in America,” one active club adjacent account posted on Telegram, with nearly three thousand views.Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)CanadaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The band explain how a studio jape has united IrelandKillian Faith-KellyWed 23 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 12.52 EDTShare‘Welcome to the best thing we’ve ever written,” jokes Kingfishr lead singer Eddie Keogh, in a video recorded in a studio in October 2024, before he knew just how right he was. Keogh, flanked by bandmates Eoin “Fitz” Fitzgibbon on guitar and Eoghan “McGoo” McGrath on banjo, reads from his phone as he lends his chesty baritone to the just-written chorus of Killeagh: “They’d go rarin’ and tearin’ and fightin’ for love / For the land they call Killeagh, and the Lord up above / Kill-la la, la la la la la la la la la / For the green and the white I adore / For the parish to last ever more.”It has since spent 18 weeks in the Irish Top 10, gone four-times platinum, and become the first traditional, folk-leaning song to see this level of success since The Fields of Athenry was a hit for numerous artists in the early 80s. But the trio wrote Killeagh in 20 minutes: “It literally could not have been more of a slapped-together job,” says Keogh.Last summer, Fitz was back home in his east Cork village, having a drink with his friend and former hurling coach Phillip “Yank” O’Neill (so-named “because he tried to go to America once”, Fitz explains). All the other teams round here, said Yank, have a song to sing in the changing rooms when they win. We don’t. You’re in a band. Write a song for Killeagh.Fitz says playing hurling for Killeagh GAA club for 20 years was “the biggest thing in my life, the only thing really” before the band took off in Ireland: they broke through in 2022 with their poppy singles Eyes Don’t Lie and Flowers-Fire. His aunt Mary is the club’s secretary, his uncle Moss played for them, his grandfather Tom was their president and also a player. The junior team features Fitz’s brother Cathal, and is coached by their father Ger.Fitz said he would write a song if the juniors got to an east Cork final in 2024. In his head, “it was not going to happen. Killeagh haven’t been in the final since 2001, there’s no way they’ll get to a final this year. And lo and behold, October arrives and they get to the final, and Yank texts me almost immediately.”Kingfishr were recording their debut album at the time, which is now titled Halcyon and set for release in August. The band, who started making music together as a way to pass the time during lockdown-afflicted degrees at the University of Limerick, were in a decent place – they had supported Bruce Springsteen and Dermot Kennedy, and were booked to play a few 5,000-capacity venues in Ireland over the summer. But what was about to happen in that studio would lead, Keogh says, to “conversations about next year’s venues that are hard to make sense of in your brain”.While McGoo was laying down some moody banjo stuff for the album, Fitz and Keogh turned to their hurling song. “We just ran off for 15, 20 minutes,” Fitz says, “and I started rattling it out.” They wrote about local spots the River Dissour and Glenbower Wood. “Thinking nothing of it because it was all a bit of a joke. Then we showed it to McGoo, who said: ‘What if instead oflala la, it’sKill’la la?’ And sure, the three of us were screaming and shouting: this is the greatest thing ever!”The song is a heart-on-sleeve tribute to the sport of hurling and the focal point it provides for the people of Killeagh – and, by inference, communities like it all over Ireland. The first time it reached a crowd, it wasn’t sung by the band, but the Killeagh junior hurlers, who went on to win their final. A few days later, despite some reluctance from Fitz – who viewed the song as “a pisstake” and says it took him “a long time to come round to the idea that it was about more than just my hurling team and the river that flows through my village” – the band recorded it, and it was released in December as a B-side on their single Bet on Beauty.View image in fullscreen‘I thought: Oh Jesus Christ, this could be massive’ … Kingfishr.Photograph: PRNo dials were moved until St Patrick’s Day, when for some reason – perhaps its visceral Irishness, perhaps its mention of green and white – the song began to feature in a series of “get ready with me” videos posted on TikTok, primarily by teenage girls. “I remember saying to someone that we’d get a great weekend out of it, but once Paddy’s Day is over, it’s dust,” says Keogh. “And he said: ‘You haven’t thought about this – the hurling’s about to start,’ and the penny dropped. I thought: Oh Jesus Christ, this could be massive.”The song was written for the people of Killeagh, and has permanently connected the band to the town – their sponsorship of Killeagh’s new under-10s jerseys is testament to that. But it was adopted across the entire county of Cork as it became an anthem for an inter-county season in which the Cork team won the National Hurling League, the Munster Hurling Championship (their regional knock-out competition), and were – according to the bookmakers, their fans, and every expert going – supposed to win the biggest prize of them all, the All-Ireland.Alas, they capitulated in the second half of the final last Sunday and let a six-point lead become a 15-point loss to Tipperary. But on their way there, the song expanded its zone of endearment from Killeagh, to Cork, to everyone in Ireland who’d ever been involved with a GAA club, to seemingly just about everyone in Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Beyond the timing and TikTok virality, Killeagh has a certain musical familiarity: it employs phrasings typical of Irish traditional music, with a verse’s second line ending on a minor note before resolving itself on a major one, for example. There’s the enormously singable chorus – “any eejit can sing la la la la,” points out Joyce – and its evocation of an aspect of Irish life, the community-anchoring GAA club, that so many people either participate in or feel nostalgia for.‘Music is our way of coping with life’: the Mary Wallopers on bringing booze, sex and politics back to folkRead moreJoyce says that although she initially thought the song “a bit stereotypical”, she’s found herself singing it around the house and would “bet my bottom dollar that it’ll be sung at [folk] singing sessions around the country.” Ní Ghallóglaigh’s first words are “what agreatsong!”, and thinks Killeagh is “a modern addition to the Irish folk canon. 100%”. Joyce agrees.When I tell the band this, they’re gobsmacked. Keogh says he always thought of Ireland’s canon of folk ballads as a fixed entity, not something anyone could hope to add to. I ask him if adding to it is, more than streams or venue bookings or TikTok fame, the ultimate success for Kingfishr.“For me, personally,” he says, “success is being in the middle of a crowd of people and singing it with everyone, grabbing on to the lads next to you and looking at the people around you and thinking: you’llalwaysremember this. I think that’s what sportis, and what music is. People are absolutely crying out for that: being part of something bigger than yourself. Being part of a fucking team.”Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For me, it’s not about taking a knee and putting your fist up in the air. It’s about being committed to dismantling systemic racism.“In my opinion, things have got worse since George Floyd. Look at the race riots last year. And then I think of Diane Abbott being suspended for nothing else other than havingan opinionbased on her own lived experience of racism. Is that what we’re doing in 2025, really?“This country has benefited from diversity but still doesn’t embrace it. What does it mean to be a British citizen?

There were the Covid years when organizers cancelled the Nevada festival entirely, the sweltering record temperatures of 2022, and mud created by heavy rains in 2023 that trapped tens of thousands of attenders on the playa.Then last year, Burning Man ticketsfailed to sell outas they had every year since 2011. It was an indicator of a deep trouble for the week-long desert celebration in the form of a $20m revenue shortfall that meant “everything is now at risk”, Marian Goodell, the Burning Man Project CEO,wrote last fall.Burning Man has been trying to find its financial footing and figure out how to ensure the longevity of a festival that has become an institution, Goodell toldBloombergin an interview this week, a month ahead of this year’s festivities.The festival must succeed as a business, she told the outlet, while adding: “I am loath to look at Burning Man as a product, where the goal is to sell as much of the product as possible.”Burning Man, which started in 1986 on a San Francisco beach, is held each year in Nevada’s remote Black Rock desert, where as many as 73,000 people travel to partake in the revelry and performance art. But over the years it has increasingly become a playground for the wealthy and Silicon Valley elite, such as Elon Musk. Meanwhile, rising ticket prices have coincided with a decrease in attenders making less than $50,000, Bloomberg reported.Wealthy attenders, the outlet noted, have provided a “lifeline” to Burning Man over the years, with five people responsible for two-thirds of the $60m the festival has raised since 2014.Despite its explosive popularity over the years, in 2024 Burning Man fell short of its fundraising goals and saw a reduction in ticket sales. The organization does not have corporate sponsorships to support its operations, and the sale of tickets, which cost anywhere from $550 to $3,000, do not alone cover those expenses, Goodell said in her October note.“Ticket revenue alone does not fund all that Burning Man Project does to bring Burning Man to the world, including the production of Black Rock City, and in fact has not since 2014.”The organization has turned to Burners for support, writing that a monthly contribution of $20 “will help to keep Burning Man programs alive”. While it received millions of dollars in support, it stillfell shortof its fundraising goal last year. But this year’s tickets have so far sold well, according to Bloomberg, allowing organizers “to keep moving forward”.Last year’s decline in ticket sales prompted some outlets to ask whether the festival was past its prime, but Goodell argued in theReno Gazette Journalin June “the values that guide the Burning Man creative culture are more relevant today than ever.“It’s not a partisan project. It’s a cultural one. It’s creative. And creative culture, especially when rooted in shared values rather than political ideology, is what holds people together when everything else feels like it’s falling apart,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBurning Man festivalWest CoastFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Labour says: go right aheadGeorge MonbiotJacob Rees-Mogg’s Tory fantasy of a post-Brexit bonfire of regulations is coming true. Our bodies and ecosystems will pay the priceWed 23 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 09.20 EDTShareIt’s what the extreme right of the Tory party wanted from Brexit: to tear down crucial public protections, including those that defend us from the most brutal and dangerous forms of capital. The Conservatives lost office before they were able to do their worst. But never mind, because Labour has now picked up the baton.A month ago, so quietly that most of us missed it, thegovernment publisheda consultation on deregulating chemicals. While most consultations last for 12 weeks, this one runs for eight, half of which cover the holiday period – it closes on 18 August. The intention is set out at the beginning: to reduce “costs to business”. This, asrepeated statementsby Keir Starmermake clear, meanstearing upthe rules.If, the consultation proposes, a chemical has been approved by a “trusted foreign jurisdiction”, it should be approved for use in the UK. No list is given of what these trusted jurisdictions are. It will be up to ministers to decide: they can add such countries through statutory instruments, which means without full parliamentary scrutiny. In one paragraph the document provides what sounds like an assurance: these jurisdictions should have standards “similar to and at least as high as those in Great Britain”. Three paragraphs later, the assurance is whisked away: the government would be able “to use any evaluation available to it, which it considers reliable, from any foreign jurisdiction”.In this and other respects, the consultation document is opaque, contradictory, lacking clear safeguards and frankly chilling. Lobbyists will point out that a chemical product has been approved for sale in the US, or Thailand or Honduras, then ask the government to add that country as a trusted jurisdiction. If the government agrees, “domestic evaluation” would be “removed”, meaning that no UK investigation of the product’s health and environmental impacts will be required.In the US, to give one example, awide rangeofdangerous chemical productsareapproved for usesthat are banned here and in many other countries. The government has fired the gun on a race to the bottom.To make matters worse, once a country has been added to the list of trusted jurisdictions, all the biocidal products it authorises for use could, the consultation says, be “automatically approved” for use here. The proposed new rules, in other words, look like a realisation of thefantasy entertainedby the ultra-rightwing Tory MPJacob Rees-Mogg in 2016: “We could say, if it’s good enough in India, it’s good enough for here … We could take it a very long way.”There is in fact a means of reducing costs while maintaining high standards: simply mirror EU rules. Though far from perfect, they set the world’s highest standards for chemical regulation. Mirroring them as they evolve would avoid the pointless institutional replication andtotal regulatory meltdownour chemicals system has suffered since we left the EU. But we can’t have that, as it would mean backtracking on Brexit, which would be BETRAYAL. Adopting the weaker standards of other states at the behest of foreign corporations, by contrast, is the height of patriotism.The divergence from European standards is likely to meanbreaking the termsof the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement, as well as landing Northern Ireland in an even greater quandary, as itremains inboth the EU single market and the UK internal market. In many cases, deregulation delivers bureaucratic chaos.The consultation also suggests the removal of all expiry dates for the approval of active chemical substances. The default position would be that, as long as a foreign jurisdiction has approved a product, allowing it to be used in the UK, it stays on the books indefinitely. Those arguing that new evidence should lead to its deletion from the approved list would have a mountain to climb. Worse still, the consultation proposes removing any obligation on the Health and Safety Executive to maintain a publicly available database of the harmful properties of chemical substances on the UK market. No wonder they kept it quiet.Yes, these proposals might reduce costs for business. But the inevitable result is totransfer themto society. Already, we face a massive contamination crisis as a result of regulatory failure in this country, as compoundssuch as Pfas(“forever chemicals”),microplasticsandbiocidesspread into our lives. If the decontamination of land and water is possible, it will cost hundreds of times more than any profits made by industry as a result of lax rules. In reality, we willcarry these costsin our bodies and our ecosystems, indefinitely. The true price is incalculable.Many have paid with their lives, health, education or livelihoods for previous “bonfires of red tape”: through the Grenfell Tower disaster, filthy rivers,collapsing classrooms,consumer rip-offsand the 2008 financial crisis. But as long as these costs can be shifted off corporate and current government balance sheets, that is deemed a win for business and win for the Treasury.Earlier this month, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,told financiersin her Mansion House speech that regulation “acts as a boot on the neck of businesses”. In reality, business acts as a boot on the neck of democracy, a boot the government slathers with kisses.Before the general election last year,Reeves toldan assembly of corporate CEOs: “I hope when you read our manifesto, or see our priorities, that you see your fingerprints all over them.” The catastrophic planning reforms the government is nowforcing through parliamentwere hatched, she told them, at a “smoked salmon and scrambled eggs breakfast” with corporate lobbyists.This was just one instance of a massive pre-election grovelling offensive, involvinghundreds of meetingsbehind closed doors with corporations, which shaped Labour’s plans and explains so much of what has gone wrong since. The point and purpose of the Labour party was to resist economic warfare by the rich against the rest. Starmer and Reeves have turned their party into the opposite of what it once was.Capital demands three things at once: that the government strip away the rules defending the public interest from ruthless profit-making; that the government regulateitselfwith insanely restrictive pledges, such asReeves’s fiscal rules; and that the public is regulated with ever more draconian laws, such as thoserestricting protest. It gets what it asks for. Everything must give way to capital, but capital must give way to nothing.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests at the Guardian’s climate assembly, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

That abuse is what makes it necessary: that call was wrongWed 23 Jul 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 10.33 EDTShareLove or hate: that seems to be the lot of Black England footballers. Score and the nation adores you – you represent the best of British. Have a bad match, and the mob bigotry descends – go back to where you came from, you bloody immigrant.So it is that today England are celebrating supersub teenager Michelle Agyemang, whose last-minute equaliser – for the second match running – kept the national team in the Euros. Meanwhile, teammate Jess Carter was still reeling from the racial abuse she suffered at the hands of England fans after performances in earlier matches that were deemed below par.It’s a similar story for England’s men: “heroes” Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Ollie Watkins scored game-changing goals all the way to the Euros final last year. Three years earlier, when they missed crucial penalties, Saka and two of his teammates faced a tidal wave of race hate.The abuse this month, coming mainly from England fans, led to 27-year-oldJess Carter saying: “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race.”Her England colleagues, including her managerSarina Wiegman, have come out in support and condemned the “disgusting and disgraceful” racism – and last night, in protest, they decided not to take the knee before their semi-final against Italy. Instead, the players remained standing and the substitutes, just off pitch, lined up in support. But I’m left wondering, was that really the right thing to do?Taking the knee has, especially since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, become a signal known around the world highlighting the enduring evil of racism. No one ever claimed it would, on its own, end the bigotry and prejudice embedded in societies for decades. Yet it has given a brief occasional moment, seen by audiences around the world, to remind people that we’ve still got a long way to go.I can’t quite understand how it could possibly be a good thing, when there’s a clear sign that bigotry is still with us, to decide to abandon a protest against it. Worse, it seems that thePremier Leagueis now also considering ditching the gesture.In explaining the Lionesses’ decision, Wiegman – who coincidentally dropped Carter from the starting lineup last night – said taking the knee is not enough. “We’ve done that for a while. It seems that the impact is not good enough, as big as we think … we felt we had to do something else, something different.”Yet is there an equivalent gesture they could make that would be so resonant, so clear, so widely known, especially to an audience of millions beaming in from all over Europe? Last night’s standing protest was completely missable – it’s doubtful that anyone in the arena, let alone those watching on TV, noticed it.0:59Fans react to the moment England made it into Euro 2025 final – videoOf course, racism is not something youcan just “kick out”. Some commentators, including politicians, have claimed that the problem is “online abuse”, as if clamping down on social media will eradicate the problem; as if racism, prejudice and bigotry didn’t exist before social media. Anyone who stood on the football terraces in Britain anytime before the 1990s will know different.If you want to know why racism persists, a good place to look would be the national press, whose front pages provide an almost daily diet of intolerance – towards Muslims, migrants, and minorities in general. Or look to our politicians, who take their lead from those same newspapers for fear of a bad headline. And it’s not just Reform UK or the Tory party on the right. Why else would Keir Starmer – who, let’s remember,took the knee himselfin the early days of his Labour leadership – now talk about Britain being an “island of strangers” and oflegalmigration doing “incalculable damage” to Britain. (Several weeks later, long after the damage was done in making migrants and their children feel isolated and unwelcome, he said heregretted the comments.)The daily demonisation of people deemed outsiders leads to an atmosphere of suspicion, intolerance and prejudice. It denies people jobs and housing, makes them the target of heavy-handed policing, curtails theirfreedom of speech, unleashes hatred upon them on a regular basis – and a year ago led to them beingburned out of their homesbyrace-baiting mobsfor a crime they had nothing to do with. We’ve seen the seeds of this hatred again this week, outside anasylum hotelin Essex.Is now really the time to stop taking the knee?Lionesses stumble into final through blind luck but Agyemang offers glimpse of future | Jonathan LiewRead moreIronically, the England women’s team has its own history of racial imbalance: how was it, many asked – given the array of applicable talent – that the team that won the Euros in 2022, creating so much joy across the nation, hadno Black players? What a contrast with the men’s team, which has been fully multicultural for decades. Even last night, the Lionesses team was all-white through the second half – until Agyemang was brought on with five minutes left.Taking the knee has always been controversial: its originator,American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick, was in effect drummed out of the NFL for daring to challenge racism so publicly. In 2021, then home secretary Priti Patel criticised England players taking the knee as“gesture politics” and said fans have the right to boo them.I can appreciate why Carter and her teammates might feel frustrated by the lack of progress on race equality, and want something more to be done. But I’d look to those who’ve opposed this protest over the years, and how they’ve aligned themselves with prejudice and bigotry. Then I’d ask myself: “What would the racists want?” And do the opposite.Joseph Harker is the Guardian’s senior editor, diversity and developmentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is impossible to disagree. And Davis is right that this “major scandal” ought to prompt questions about how the traders’ cases were prosecuted by theSerious Fraud Officeand why it took so long for their convictions to be overturned.There has been a weirdness about these cases from day one. Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for conspiracy to defraud, the sort of sentence you might get for armed robbery. Hayes’s alleged crime was the rather more technical one of encouraging his employer to make a dishonest submission in answer to this question: “At what rate could the bank borrow funds by asking for and accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11am?”Welcome to the world ofLibor, or London inter-bank offered rate. The benchmark is now discontinued but it was used to reflect the rates at which banks could borrow from each other. A panel of 16 banks made submissions and an average was taken to set the benchmark daily. It exploded into public prominence during the financial crisis because the health of banks – as judged by their willingness to lend to each other – became a matter of huge public concern.As bankscoughed up huge sums in settlements with regulatorsfor Libor-rigging, as it became known, there was political appetite for prosecutions of individuals. Manipulating Libor came to be seen as the epitome of banks’ and bankers’ deviousness, even though, in truth, the benchmark had little to do with the source of the financial crisis – and even though individual traders tended to protest that their behaviour was well known to their bosses.But it must have seemed an easy thing to prosecute, not least because Hayes himself had admitted to the SFO over 80 hours of interviews that he had tried to influence Libor submitters to put forward numbers that would advantage his trading positions.The problem was the direction given to the jury in his trial. This is the critical passage in the supreme court ruling: “It was wrong for the judge to direct the jury that, if the submitter took any account of the commercial interests of the bank or a trader, the rate submitted was for that reason not a genuine or honest answer to the question posed by the [Libor] definitions as a matter of law.” Palombo’s trial was compromised similarly.The supreme court still said there was “ample evidence” that could have led the jury to a guilty verdict for Hayes. But – critically – the judge’s errors in direction “were sufficiently material to make the conviction unsafe”.The troubling aspect is that Hayes’s lawyers have been making the central point about misdirection for years. The court of appeal, however, dismissed appeals twice. The case made it to the supreme court only after US courts in 2022 decided two other Libor cases differently, saying there was “no prohibition” on taking commercial considerations into account when making submissions. Charges against Hayes were dropped in the US. As Davis said at the time, the UK became “an outlier”.Seven other Libor convictions in the UK now look likely to be challenged. If they, too, are overthrown little will be left of the SFO’s post-financial crisis pursuit of traders. Davis referred to what he called a “scapegoating exercise” that happened as a result of alleged collusion between the banks and government agencies, including the SFO and the Financial Conduct Authority. There has always been a whiff here of the authorities going after relatively lowly, if well-remunerated, traders such as Hayes and Palombo to satisfy a political wish for scalps.Hayes’s legal team called for a public inquiry and for the SFO, which has powers to act as both investigator and prosecutor, to be abolished. One suspects neither will happen, although the former would add greatly to public understanding of what happened during the financial crisis. But one hopes that this prod will be acted upon because it came from the supreme court itself: “The history of these two cases raises concerns about the effectiveness of the criminal appeal system in England and Wales in confronting legal error.” You bet it does.Explore more on these topicsBankingNils Pratley on financeFinancial sectorLiborUK supreme courtSerious Fraud OfficeCrimecommentShareReuse this content"

But she is of the exalted class who can buy themselves out of a bindWed 23 Jul 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 22.12 EDTShareYou may remember the first half of 2020, when, as light relief during the early stages of the pandemic, we could look towards the banks of celebrities trying to raise our spirits and come together in mutual hostility. Schools and industries had shut down, key workers were struggling, but the one certainty in life that remained undisrupted was that, as long as Gal Gadot and Natalie Portman kept sharing their inspo-content, we would never run short of a laugh. Covid ended and now we haveDonald Trump– and guess what, some of that dynamic is back.It’s different this time because the threat is different, but for anyone living in the US who has glanced, longingly, towards Europe or Canada and wondered about the possibility of moving, comments made byEllen DeGeneresthis week may strike a familiar note; specifically, the extraordinary tone deafness that only high net-worth individuals can hit when trying to share in a common experience. DeGeneres and her wife, the actor Portia de Rossi, moved to rural Oxfordshire last year and this week, DeGeneres was interviewed on stage in Cheltenham and gave us some insight into exactly what happened.“We got here [to England] the day before the election and we woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis,”said DeGeneres, to a crowd of 600or so at the Everyman theatre. “We were like, ‘We’re staying here, we’re not going back, we are not leaving.’ So yeah, we bought a house that we thought was going to be a part-time house then we decided we needed a different house and now we’re selling that house. If anybody wants a house. It’s a beautiful house. It’s a beautiful stone farmhouse.”A lot to unpack here, obviously, but let’s start with “we’re selling that house / if anybody wants a house / it’s a beautiful house”. As anyone who has moved countries knows, there are all sorts of problems to be solved in the first flush of arrival, chief among them panic-buying the first eight-figure house you stumble across and then wondering what to do with the horses. So it was that, while the property to which DeGeneres refers has a pool, a helipad and what E! Newsdescribed this weekas a “party barn” – which they may or may not believe to be common British usage – sadly itdoesn’thave a big enough stable. “Portia couldn’t live without her horses,” DeGeneres told the Wall Street Journal this week – there but for the grace of God, etc – anyway if anybody wants it, it’s on for £22.5m and the Daily Mail has all the details.There are, of course, real reasons for Americans in general and DeGeneres and her wife in particular to want to flee the US and at the existential level, fear of Trump can strike anyone. During the talk in Cheltenham, the former talkshow host spoke about the threat posed by the US president to LGBTQ+ communities, mentioning in particular the revived enthusiasm among certain Christian sects in the US for rowing back federal protection of same-sex marriage. If necessary, said DeGeneres, the pair would remarry in Britain.But it is also true that, like wealthy women seeking an abortionbefore 1973or in southern states today, there is almost no bind that money can’t buy you out of – in this case, moving countries without any of the customary friction. And so DeGeneres and her wife find themselves newly absorbed into the immigrant-expat continuum, occupied at one end by undocumented immigrants being seized and deported in the US by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and at the other, by those so wealthy they can go on holiday and seemingly decide, on a whim, to stay for ever. Each experience is attended by different rules, terminologies and demonisations, and is subject to sometimes fiercely defended distinctions from other, less favourable categories.For instance, I remember making the mistake, once, of asking an American friend about her grandparents’ emigration to the US from Europe, assuming rather romantically that they’d gone through Ellis Island. She looked appalled and informed me, crossly, that they’d come in on an ocean liner and docked directly in the city, the family piano safely crated in the hold. No one on that boat was inspected for head lice. “We werelegal.” Those belonging to communities targeted by Trump who also voted for Trump are less baffling when you consider these differences.None of which, of course, pertains to Ellen DeGeneres, who is worth the sort of money (an estimated $450m) that makes the visa problem faced by most Americans hoping to move away from Trump – or stay in the US in spite of Trump – disappear. Still, even among the elite, moving entails a steep learning curve. The new house DeGeneres and her wife have moved into isn’t far from the old one but is a much newer building, enabling the Mail to prod one local into calling it a “monstrosity”, and a possibly different local into saying “it looks like a prison”.DeGeneres, meanwhile, is still in the honeymoon period, and finding it all very beautiful. As she told the crowd at Cheltenham this week, she considers her new compatriots “polite,” the life here “simpler”, and has reached the conclusion that, “everything here is better”. Whether that’s the charms of the English countryside or the insulating effect of super-wealth we can’t know for sure. Either way, we look forward to watching the progress of the entertainer’s application to put up a large stable in an area of outstanding natural beauty make its way through the famously helpful and accommodating English planning authorities.

Which is just a few more gigs than the entertainer has kids: these days Cannon is most identifiable asthe father of 12 childrenby six women. “I really think I’m a king,” Cannon, who has said he has been diagnosed withnarcissistic personality disorder, mused in June during an appearance on the influencer Bobbi Althoff’s podcast. Kings, he explained, need a lot of children for their courts. In the same podcast, King Cannon struggled to recall the names of all 12 of his children. But that’s what the court nannies are for, eh?Cannon clearly enjoyed his chat with Althoff because he recently announced that he is starting his own podcast. It will be called Nick Cannon @ Night and he’s going to be giving relationship advice. “When it comes to his personal life, Nick has never shied away, unapologetically leaving the world curious about his views on dating, fatherhood and modern relationships.

But I like the idea of giving celebrities a platform to talk about things they are wildly unqualified to discuss. I would absolutely tune in to hear Lauren Sánchez, owner of a $170,000 handbag and enjoyer of a $50m wedding with husband Jeff Bezos, dole out budgeting advice.

But it fulfills a fantasy of accountability we rarely experience in our own livesWed 23 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt wasn’t just that a mangot caughtcheating on his wife. It was that he did it in public. With the whole stadium watching. With Chris Martin, unknowingly, teeing it up. With a camera zooming in at the exact wrong – or maybe karmically perfect – moment. The CEO. The HR director. The affair. The panic. The humiliation. All of it caught, dissected and shared a million times over.We didn’t watch that video because we loveColdplay(though, don’t we?). We didn’t watch just for the scandal. We watched because – despite our small steps toward enlightenment – we’re all starving for the satisfaction of seeing someone finally get what they deserve.That’s the part we need to talk about.According to a2023 studyin Computers in Human Behavior Reports, the satisfaction we feel during public shaming isn’t just about justice – it’s about pleasure. Their research found that people experience schadenfreude not only because they believe the person deserved it, but because it simplyfeels goodto watch someone face consequences. We’re not just looking for moral clarity. We’re chasing the emotional high that comes with it. We don’t just want closure, we want content. And cheating, exposed in public, has become the most satisfying genre of all.We as a culture areobsessedwith catching cheaters – not just for the drama, but for the justice. We want to see betrayal punished. We want the liar exposed, the philanderer humiliated, the partner who was faithful and trusting to be vindicated. And if we can’t get that in our own lives, we’ll take it from strangers.Justice is not the same as humiliation. Public shaming feels like accountability – but it rarely is accountabilityThis hunger has only grown over the years as the morally hollow have made careers out of turning scandal into spectacle and walking away untouched. But when the deception is undeniable, and the exposure unfiltered, it gives us something we rarely get: visible accountability.Within hours of that five-second clip surfacing, the internet did what it does best: turned a private moment into public symbolism. Their names were revealed along with their titles. Until the camera found them, they looked unbothered, cozy. Then her hand flew to cover her face. He ducked and waddled behind the seats. Then the entire internet gasped, and reached for their popcorn and pitchforks.You could feel the collective applause ripple through the comments section. We all know the feeling of being deceived. We know the sharp loneliness of loving someone who’s looking elsewhere, of having suspicions but not proof, accusations returned with a side of gaslighting. So when someone gets caught in 4K, we devour the moment. The visuals were almost too perfect: the Coldplay ballad, the cheering crowd turning confused, the abrupt shift from smug to stunned.Don’t we all wish we had that experience? A camera that didn’t look away. A crowd that said: “We see it, too.” Because in our own lives, we confront; they deflect. We cry; they move on. And there’s no applause, no witness. Just you and an unrelenting ache, their version of what happened and the truth.The CEO and the HR director are merely serving as stand-ins for the guy who ghosted you after two years, the woman who swore nothing was going on with her co-worker, the husband who moved on so fast you wondered if you hallucinated your entire marriage. Watching those two squirm on screen is a kind of spiritual revenge. We tell ourselves it’s about ethics, boundaries, accountability. But at the end of the day, don’t we just want someone to answer for the betrayal we never got closure for?Obsessed with the Coldplay kiss cam story? I was too, until I realised the sinister truth at the heart of it | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOf course, pain is not performance. And justice is not the same as humiliation. Public shaming feels like accountability – but it rarely is accountability. As Jon Ronson warns in his book So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed: “An instant digital mob justice can devastate without offering redemption.” Watching strangers get exposed might feel good temporarily. We nod at the cosmic slap, but it doesn’t fix the trust broken in a marriage or the respect damaged in a workplace. It doesn’t change who they were when no one was watching.There’s a flip side to witnessing this embarrassmentthat flickers just below the surface. We might laugh, but something in us recoils as we imagine the real cost to those involved: lost jobs, fractured marriages, psychological fallout for their children. A hyperlink trail that will follow them to the grave.As Evan Nierman, author of The Cancel Culture Curse and CEO of the crisis PR firm Red Banyan, puts it: “The internet has a way of locking people into their worst moment. When a misstep goes viral, the court of public opinion rarely allows space for explanation, nuance, or repair.”And once the pile-on begins, it escalates fast. “Digital shame operates at a scale and speed our psychology isn’t built for,” he warns. “What starts as a laugh can quickly spiral into character assassination, with consequences that long outlast a viral moment.”Yetthismoment – our collective gasp at betrayal made universal – revealed something crucial: we’re craving truth, acknowledgment. We’re craving slow, messy, quiet reckoning with accountability that extends beyond the tap-and-scroll. But in a world where real accountability is rare, a viral headline like thisfeelsclose enough – as though love, loyalty and truth might still mean something, even if only for a moment on the Jumbotron.Jessica Ciencin Henriquez is a writer in Ojai, California, and the author of the forthcoming essay collection, If You Loved Me, You Would Know.

But until concrete action is taken, western allies will remain complicit with these horrifying crimesWed 23 Jul 2025 13.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 16.05 EDTShareJuly has been one of the deadliest months of the war in Gaza, with Israelkilling one person every 12 minutes. The UN says more than 1,000 Palestinians have died trying to get food, mostly when they attempted tocollect aidfrom hubs.Behind these visible deaths lies the horror of systematic starvation: “minutely engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed”, in thewordsof Prof Alex de Waal, an expert on humanitarian crises. More than 100 aid groups warned that it is spreading fast. At least 10 people died of hunger and malnutrition on Tuesday alone, said Gaza’s health ministry.Parents watch their children wither. Adults collapse on the street.Never mind other essential needs – water, medical supplies, shelter. Even if food could be distributed fairly under the new system – and it cannot be – it is utterly insufficient. And even if more arrived, which might or might not happen ifa ceasefire were agreed, life is not sustainable when brief periods of partial respite alternate with months of deprivation.Starvation wreaks lifelong damage on physical and mental health, perhaps includingthat of future generations, anddestroys societiesas well as lives. People are forced to make impossible choices, such as deciding which of their children needs food most, and do desperate things, snatching food from others. These acts too leave lasting scars. While many aid groups have run out of everything, others say social breakdown has made distributing meagre supplies too dangerous for both staff and recipients. Israel blames looting by Hamas for the hunger. This, from a government whicharmed a criminal gang accused of seizing aid.To deliberately inflict starvation upon a society is to take it to pieces. The genocide convention prohibits “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”. Even if the trickle of aid keeps most Palestinians alive – just – the deprivationcan still destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a group.Condemnation is rightlygrowing. On Monday, the UK and 27 other countriesissued a tough statementattacking Israel for depriving Palestinians of “human dignity”. The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, called their assertion “disgusting”. But Israel’s other allies must keep working together. What matters is not what they say. It iswhat they do– including whether they impose sanctions and comprehensive arms embargos, and suspend preferential trade terms. Recognition of a Palestinian state is part of a necessary response, but not the only or most important issue.Britain was right to place sanctions on far-right ministers, reinstate funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and suspend many arms exports. But these measures came too late, and they are stillmuch too little. Kaja Kallas, the foreign policy chief of the EU – Israel’s biggest trading partner – has said that “all options [are] on the table”. But the blochas yet to agree on action.Faced with the systematic destruction of Palestinian life inGaza, other states must together produce a systematic, comprehensive and concrete response. If not now, when? What more would it take to convince them? This is first and foremost a catastrophe for Palestinians. But if states continue to allow international humanitarian law to be shredded, the repercussions will be felt by many more around the world in years to come. History will not ask whether these governments did anything to stop genocide by an ally, but whether they did all they could.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This implausible hostage to fortune was doubtless intended to convey Mrs Badenoch’s determination that, as she rebuilt the Tory brand after a catastrophic defeat, she would not be buffeted around by passing events.Modern British politics don’t work like that. A year ago, the Conservative share of the vote was 24%, a desperategeneral electionnadir. Now support for the partylanguishesat about 17%. In May’s local elections the Tories lost close to 700 councillors and control of16 councils, many of them to Reform UK, which leads in the polls and is viewed by Labour as its chief electoral threat. A recentsurveyfound that only 10% of the public think Mrs Badenoch looks like a prime minister in waiting. On Tuesday, as the House of Commons went into summer recess, she duly launched areshuffle.For the most part it was a modest affair involving middle-ranking shadow ministers and changes to backroom staff. Mrs Badenoch’s growing number of internal critics will have hoped for something more radical. But Sir James Cleverly’s appointment as shadow to the housing secretary,Angela Rayner, will have lifted the morale of Conservatives who fear their party has embarked on a doomed march to the Faragian right.During last autumn’s leadership contest – which he might well have won, had it not been for some ill-advisedtactical votingby supporters – Sir James positioned himself as a One Nation alternative to Mrs Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. On culture war issues such as Britain’s potential withdrawal from the European court of human rights and net zero, he islikelyto be a moderating force. As Nigel Farage actively seeks tostokea summer of discontent on Britain’s streets, a revival of centre-right influence within the Conservative party would be good news for the country as a whole.For the Tories it would also signal a more viable route to relevance than becoming aJenrick-inspiredtribute act to Reform. In a fragmented and polarised landscape, the Conservatives are haemorrhaging support both to the authoritarian right and the liberal centre. Mrs Badenoch has yet to find a way to successfully fight on two fronts, and has hitherto shown little interest in addressing the political wounds on her party’s left flank. Whether Sir James’s appointment is intended to redress that imbalance, or is simply an attempt to shore up party unity behind her, remains to be seen.In the meantime, Mrs Badenoch’s prospects continue to look bleak. A relatively cautious reshuffle – the promotion of the Johnson-era levelling up minister Neil O’Brien being the only other intriguing move – will not in itself solve the party’s underlying dilemmas over direction. It is also unlikely to spark a feelgood upturn in the polls.As speculation swirls around her leadership, Tory commentators have begun to talk ominously of November, the earliest point at which a challenge can be launched. It seems extremely unlikely that she could survive another disastrous round of local elections next year, when heavy losses are on the cards in Wales and Scotland. Having taken over intending to take her time, Mrs Badenoch’s annus horribilis means she now has little time left to make an impact.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One clever movement into space, one cutting through pass and one brilliant finish for Spain to finally undo a resilient German defence. WhenAitana Bonmatí angled home a shotfrom a tight angle deep into extra time, she not only sent her side through to a final of a women’s Euros for the first time but also proved so much about the strength, both physically and mentally, of this dominant Spanish team.It was perhaps inevitable that Bonmatí would be the one to find the answers to the puzzle Germany had placed in front of them for the best part of 112 minutes. For she has done the same so often for this Spanish side. One of the glittering jewels at the heart of their midfield, the 27-year-old more often than not is the one who can find that little bit of extra space to lose a defender with the deftest of touches.Spain to face England in Euro 2025 final after Bonmatí’s extra-time strike sinks GermanyRead morePerhaps the biggest lesson for La Roja on this cool summer night in Zurich was one of patience. Whatever their opponents threw at them, the end result for Montse Tomé’s side seemed inevitable. They bided their time and pounced at just the right moment. It was hard fought and not particularly pretty but this was their first victory against Germany and one that put them one step away from the only trophy yet to make it to their cabinet.Ann-Katrin BergerWhen looking at the numbers, they out-possessed, out-passed and out-created their opponents as they have done to so many others before them. And yet it did not seem like that on the night as Germany defended with a steely resilience that they have seemingly only newly discovered.Christian Wück’s team went about the task of defending with bravery, seemingly tireless despite having gone through a gruelling 120-minute quarter-final with Francejust days earlier, 107 of those with 10 players. It was an experience that turned out to be the perfect preparation against the world champions. An example of the power of the collective rather than the brilliance of the individual.There will be huge disappointment in defeat for Wück’s side but there will be a strong feeling that this group of players have discovered a toughness about themselves that they did not previously know they had. This performance, as with the one against France, was a stark contrast from that that had seen them gettorn apart by Swedenjust 10 days before. The two versions of this team could not be more Jekyll and Hyde. That is not to say that Wück’s side does not contain a plethora of characters. They are certainly not lacking in that department but alongside the quality of its individuals, this German side look to be slowly becoming a sum of its parts.View image in fullscreenAnn-Katrin Berger possesses an equal penchant for the spectacular as she does moments of eccentricity.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/APLeading from the back is the quietly brilliant Ann-Katrin Berger who possesses an equal penchant for the spectacular as she does the moments of madness. The former trait was on display once again tonight as she produced a world-class stop to deny Esther González a certain opener. Klara Bühl never stopped running, tearing through the Spanish defence with pace but just lacking the crucial end product that could have turned the game in their favour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that he could actually use those two, however, with captain Giulia Gwinn sitting in a knee brace and Sarai Linder next to her out after straining her ankle ligaments. With Sjoeke Nüsken and experienced Kathrin Hendrich suspended, an already light-looking side had to dig in deep against La Roja.This is perhaps why they eventually ran out of steam and failed to keep up with Spain in the final moments. There was just one run, one incisive pass, one clever movement too many for the tiring Germans to handle. It is safe to say, however, that both teams will have learned something significant about their characters over the course of two hours in Zurich. One always had to go home, one always had to progress but there are foundations to be taken for both as they continue their respective journeys.Explore more on these topicsGermany women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

There was nothing bright about the situation on this grey Mancunian afternoon except the 35-year-old’s immediate future. Eight years after his last opportunity, Test cricketer once more.Many players give umpires items of clothing to look after while they bowl; Dawson’s habit was to hand Ahsan Raza something to take care of while he didn’t. Those sunglasses were required only when he had the ball in his hands (and eventually, late into the last session, it became so dark he let Raza keep them). Batters seeking some kind of clue as to his thinking were certainly not going to learn anything from his eyes, not if he could help it.Rishabh Pant’s wounded foot trips up India’s solid start against England in fourth TestRead moreOn a day when one recent England spinner, Jack Leach, took the last five wickets of a six-fer in Somerset’s win against Durham, another, Tom Hartley, almost doubled his career-best first-class score with 130 for Lancashire against Gloucestershire, and a third, Rehan Ahmed, trumped them both by following a century with six wickets for Leicestershire at Derby, the current pick had to make do with more high-profile but less eye-catching results. There was very little turn as Dawson made his big return, but still he eked out one great moment.Before the game his new teammates had repeatedly mentioned being struck by one particular aspect of Dawson’s character. “He’s willing to always fight for the team, he’s very competitive,” Harry Brook said on Monday. “I know the cricketer he is, but I think what does go under the radar is his competitiveness,” Ben Stokes said on Tuesday. And it was there to be seen after the first ball of his second over found Yashasvi Jaiswal’s edge and Brook’s hands.Not in how he sprinted to his right, yelling and punching the air before exchanging high fives and 10s with his colleagues (he has a habit, after delivering the ball, of wheeling away with his arms outstretched, albeit briefly and quietly, even when nothing interesting has resulted at all). But in the swiftness with which he broke from the celebratory huddle, thoughts already on the next challenge. By the time anyone else realised that the man of the moment was no longer among them Dawson had paced out his mark and was preparing to bowl round the wicket for the first time, to the arriving right-hander Shubman Gill.View image in fullscreenDawson (arm aloft) runs off in celebration after dismissing Jaiswal.Photograph: Jon Super/APThere is a pleasing air of certainty about Dawson, a player experienced enough to know precisely what he is doing and where all of his teammates should be positioned to benefit from it. On this day it was a quality Gill could only admire enviously. Half an hour before play began the India captain was asked, after losing the toss for the fourth time this series, what he would have done had the coin fallen in his favour. He replied that it was just as well he lost, because: “I was actually confused”. And he probably said something very similar about his dismissal a few hours later, after he left a Ben Stokes delivery that, had his pad not got in the way, would have clattered into middle and off.Gill had spoken before this game of his belief that fortune has not favoured his side in this series. “Hopefully,” he sniffed, “in the next two matches the luck is going to be with us.” Maybe in the circumstances the result of the toss, unfortunate as it initially appeared, was the kind of break he was seeking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As captain Stokes has already been responsible for 40% of all instances of England winning the toss and choosing to field in Tests at Old Trafford, something he has done both times the coin has fallen in his favour here (and all other English captains in history three times out of 38). Just another way in which he cocks a snook at tradition, though India will not be reading too much into the oft-quoted statistic about bowling first here – that no side in Test history has ever chosen to do so and won – given it would almost certainly have fallen had rain not when Australia visited in 2023.But India’s luck, such as it was, was not to hold, on a day that saw freak damage both to one of Jaiswal’s bats and, much more meaningfully, to Rishabh Pant’s right foot. The main difference between the incidents was that with India’s vice-captain, unlike their opener, nobody could run out from the dressing room with four new ones to choose from, the similarity that both were caused by deliveries from Chris Woakes. The 36-year-old is not normally known as a destroyer either of men or ligneous hardware, but though he is one of the least heavy metal cricketers around this was one of the more appropriate days for a beloved son of Birmingham to rip a bat in two.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the captain, Leah Williamson, was trying to explain just how England manage to keep going behind but pulling out victories at the very end.“Whilst there are seconds on the clock, there are seconds that we’re just waiting,” she said. “It’s less ‘if’ and more ‘how’. I don’t know how to explain it, I don’t know how we do it.”Michelle Agyemang hits high notes with ease and takes spotlight in her stride | Tom GarryRead moreAnd frankly, this was the sort of victory that defied rational explanation. By the dying minutes of this game Beth Mead was playing in central midfield as part of a double pivot behind Ella Toone and the strike duo of Michelle Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones. Lauren Hemp, who started the last World Cup final as a second striker, was now left-back. And England were basically just pumping long balls into the area hoping something would happen. The formation: like, 2-6-2? 3-2-1-4?In a way, it scarcely mattered. This is after all tournament football, where the usual logic does not always apply, where the result is the result, however you get it. The new plan is no plan. Just go at it. “Everybody’s fighting and everybody wants to win and everybody feels like they can win,” Lucy Bronze said afterwards and frankly her stirring performances in this tournament suggest that ultimately it may be no more complicated than that.For Wiegman, however, all this represents a certain tectonic shift. When she arrived as England coach in 2021 she was presented not simply as a great leader but a sharp tactician, a coach raised in the Cruyff persuasion, who met the great man at the age of 13 on a television show, who had absorbed his principles of dynamic possession andwon Euro 2017 with the Netherlandsplaying the classic Dutch 4-3-3. Who above all had a philosophy, a defined style of playing.These days, that style is a little harder to discern. England have switched freely between a back four and a back three, often in the same tournament, sometimes even in the same half. Passing principles have been blooded, adopted and then junked in the face of trouble. So what exactly is the philosophy? Four years into the reign of the most successful coach in the history of English women’s football, what exactly is Wiegman-ball? And how is it possible that days before a European Championship final, we don’t even know the answer?Wiegman may be a coach of the Dutch school, but perhaps her formative experience as a footballer was playing at a Fifa invitational tournament in China in 1988. There she met the US national team coach Anson Dorrance, who was impressed with the young defensive midfielder and invited her to train at the University of North Carolina the following year.That year with the Tar Heels opened a world of possibility. “It was a soccer paradise,” she later said. She worked with Dorrance, played with all-time greats such as Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly, trained at world-class facilities, returned to the Netherlands with a creed that would shape her. Creating success in women’s football was not purely a theoretical exercise. It was about building a culture, being professional, showing ambition, exhibiting an elite mentality. Whatever it takes, you do it.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman’s England are known to change formation in the same half.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersPerhaps in retrospect this helps to explain why so many of Wiegman’s triumphs with England have felt vaguely American in character: that sense of manifest destiny, the superior physicality, a cold confidence in getting the job done, a belief above all that trophies are won through sheer force of will. It is by now no coincidence that England have compiled a litany of major tournament wins undeserved on the simple run of play.Spain in 2022.ColombiaandNigeriain 2023.Swedenand now Italy in 2025: victory as an extension of identity.And of course the fumble by Laura Giuliani for Agyemang’s opening goal and the crucial late miss by Emma Severini and the extra-time foul by the same player are not mistakes that happen in a vacuum, but mistakes induced by pressure. Perhaps Wiegman’s greatest achievement is to build a culture in which England’s players can navigate their own way through adversity, never get disheartened, never relinquish their desire to take the thing they do not deserve.This is what sees you through the tough moments, against more limited and tiring opponents. England’s ability to produce a swell of pressure in the closing minutes remains unparalleled. It may well be the closest thing England have to an actual ideology, the “proper England” of which so many in the camp have spoken. “You can never write the English off,” Kelly said afterwards. “I don’t think you’ll find a team in world football with more fight and more resilience,” Bronze said.The fact that this can be read as deeply disrespectful to the beaten Italians – what, did they simply not fight as hard? – is beside the point. Wiegman’s focus on culture – the underrated skill of binding 23 players for a month – is what gets England through the big moments. England do not lie down. England stay united right until the end. Then some things happen, and it’s best not trying to analyse those too much.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere are of course similarities here with the other great England coach of this era. Gareth Southgate was also a culture guy rather than a tactics guy, a healer rather than a technician, a man whose gift – and it really was a gift – was not to micro-manage or theorise but simply to create the right environment for gifted athletes to thrive for four weeks. To make the chore of international football feel fun. To find the right emotional blend. What is Southgate’s tactical identity? Beyond a weird predilection for playing right-footers at left-back, it’s hard to pin down.The caveat is that while this is a reliable way of progressing in tournaments, it is an extremely unreliable way of winning tournaments. Teams that are tactically inchoate but blessed with gifted individuals and an unshakeable mentality can win big pots in the absence of a genuinely great alternative. We think of the USA in 2019, Portugal in the men’s European Championship of 2016, arguably England in 2022. Meanwhile England’s habit of grimacing their way through knockout football almost won them the biggest prize of all in 2023, only for Spainto outclass them in the final.View image in fullscreenEngland were outclassed by Spain in the 2023 World Cup final.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAIt’s instructive revisiting the postmortem of that match, a spirited and honourable defeat, and yet one in which pretty much nobody in England gear was capable of explaining. But hang on. If victories are all about fight and resilience and spirit and never giving up, then do defeats mean you didn’t try hard enough? That you didn’t want it enough? That you gave up? Of course not.“If we put the ball in the back of the net, it’s game on,” said Millie Bright. Georgia Stanway thought England were “unlucky”. Wiegman, having watched Mary Earps save Jenni Hermoso’s penalty in the 70th minute, was convinced that the momentum of the game would inevitably lead to a goal. “Now we are going to get to 1-1,” she said afterwards. “But we didn’t.”Perhaps it was no surprise that, as England shuffle towards their next final, nobody really seems to be able to put their finger on why they lost the last. Doing so, of course, would involve acknowledging England’s technical inferiority, their inability to take and recycle the ball under pressure, the lack of sophisticated passers being produced by the English game, the basic absence of process. Better by far to file it away as a twist of fate, bad luck, a random bounce of the ball, just something that happens.And if true, then England – one of the best-resourced and most talented squads in world football – have a puncher’s chance of lifting the trophy on Sunday night. Perhaps ultimately this is all they want, all they ever required. The TV ratingswill be goodeither way. Perhaps Wiegman’s description of England’s Euro 2025 as a movie was more apposite than she realised. After all, when you’re watching a movie, you’re not really involved. You’re just sitting there, waiting for the plot to unfold in front of you.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arne Slot then outlined his plans for Ekitiké in a call at the end of last season.Newcastle made a move for Ekitiké last week after missing out on Liam Delap and João Pedro but their £70m bid was rejected by Eintracht and the player made it clear his preference was to join Liverpool. United also received the same information when they made a last-minute attempt to derail the deal. United’s director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, is believed to have contacted Eintracht’s sporting director Markus Krösche over a possible transfer but Ekitiké was already set on Anfield.Ekitiké scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in his one full season at Frankfurt, helping the club to qualify for the Champions League, and while he is primarily a No 9 Liverpool believe he can also operate as a second striker or out wide.He is potentially the third most expensive signing in Liverpool’s history behind Florian Wirtz and Darwin Núñez. Anfield officials are confident he can become one of the finest forwards in the game should his recent progress with Eintracht be maintained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think a lot riders would see us as arrogant because we want to control every ­single kilometre of this race. We don’t try to be arrogant, we just try to make our race as easy as possible. I think – this will sound super arrogant – but some guys can stay quiet.”Tour de France 2025: Jonathan Milan wins stage 17 sprint finish after big, late crash – liveRead moreOn a day when pro-Palestinian activists waved flags and unfurled banners in Dieulefit as the pelo­ton passed through, Pogacar was also questioned about his feelings on human rights in the UAE.“I ride for UAE Team Emirates and if you go there you’ll see how the sport is growing,” he said. “Kids love us, the locals love us when we ride with them. The sport is growing in the UAE, which I guess is why they have the team, to promote a healthy lifestyle.”In the roadside protest houses were draped with ­Palestinian flags with reports of ­protesters ­holding up “Starving is Killing” ­banners as the riders passed through. Dieulefit was honoured for sheltering Jewish people during the second world war.Last Wednesday a protester ran onto the finish line in Toulouse, wearing a T-shirt stating “Israel out of the Tour.” He was tackled by Tour staff and is scheduled to stand trial for endangering the riders.After that incident, the Israel-Premier Tech team said that it “respects everyone’s right to free speech which includes the right to protest.”If Pogacar remains in a league of his own, with Vingegaard clinging to his coat-tails, the battle for the final podium spot is likely to become intense in the next 48 hours, with Scotland’s Oscar Onley the meat in a Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe sandwich.View image in fullscreenSecurity members stop a man cycling towards the finish line at the end of stage 17 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersThe German team’s Tour debutant Florian Lipowitz is securely placed third overall, with Onley two minutes behind. But his teammate, Primoz Roglic, the most insouciant Grand Tour champion in the race, has now crept into the top five.Not everyone has been thrilled to see Roglic’s re-emergence over the past few stages. “Won’t be buying Red Bulls any more,” Onley said on Strava, after the Slovenian moved 38 seconds behind him, following the Mont Ventoux finish. “Not funding those attacks.”Meanwhile, volatile weather is predicted for the two remaining mountain stages, toThursday’s high altitude finish on the Col de la Loze, at 2,304 metres and Friday’s climb to the ski station at La Plagne, topping out at 2,o52 metres.As rain fell heavily on Valence and the Rhone valley, Francois Lemarchand, of race organisers ASO, said that change was in the air. “A few days of cooler weather are coming and we could see a swing of 20 degrees.

Little could the 19-year-old have known that, just over three months later, she would be the Lionesses’ saviour – twice – in the knockout stages of Euro 2025.A year ago, Agyemang scored a hat-trick for England at the Under-19 European Championship but few could have been bold enough to predict she would burst into the nation’s hearts on the grander stage so soon. Yet, that week in April, events were about to unfold that would transform not only her summer fortunes but England’s too.On the Saturday Agyemang scored in a strong performance to help the under-19s to defeat Austria 5-1 and the following day she was drafted into the senior squad for the first time to cover for the injured Alessia Russo. A few days later she made her senior England debut,coming on against Belgiumin the 80th minute and scoring 41 seconds later with only her second touch.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang has come a long way since her hat-trick for England’s Under-19s a year ago.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/The FA/Getty ImagesIn Switzerland this summer she has showed why she is so special. With the Lionesses struggling for form – and goals – in their defence of the European Championship they won in 2022 she has twice come on to save them from elimination. In thequarter-final against Sweden, England were 2-0 down when Agyemang replaced Georgia Stanway after 70 minutes, scoring the all-important equaliser before the Lionesses won on penalties. In the semi-final against Italy, she entered the fray as late as the 85th minute and equalised deep into added time.Chloe Kelly scored the winnerin extra time and England now have the chance to defend their crown on Sunday in Basel.Agyemang, who grew up in the Essex town of South Ockendon, with parents of Ghanaian descent, was not even born when England hosted Euro 2005 but she has long been tipped to reach the top and has been playing for Arsenal’s age-group teams since the age of six. Football isn’t the only thing in Agyemang’s life. She is studying business management at King’s College London, as part of its sport and wellness programme. She was “brought up on gospel music” and revealed after England’s win against Sweden thatshe has brought her piano over. “The kitman brought it over in a van. It’s calm and relaxing,” she said. “Lottie [Wubben-Moy, her Arsenal and England teammate] asked me to play for her – she came to my room and I played a few things for her, which was nice.”Michelle AgyemangIf ever the Football Association wanted an example of the benefits of integrating all of the youth international and senior sides together at St George’s Park, and of the advantages of the interconnected pathway and dialogue between senior and youth-pathway coaches, Agyemang grabbing her golden opportunity in that week in April with both hands was it.Yes, it is true that it cannot have been in Wiegman’s plans for Russo to pick up a knock during that April camp so that a teenager would need to be called upon for the trip to Belgium, and the Dutchwoman would be the first to admit that. The idea of Agyemang scoring crucial goals this summer to help propel England to their third consecutive major final was surely not one she imagined. It is also true, though, that England’s pathway coaches have admired Agyemang for years and she has long been tipped as a senior star.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang made a huge impact with her late equaliser against Italy in the semi-final.Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAIn the Women’s Super League, however, she was getting relatively few moments to shine during her season-long loan spell with Brighton, for whom she made 17 WSL appearances last term but just three starts, scoring three times in the 576 minutes she featured on the pitch.Asked about Agyemang’s talents, during England’s full-squad media day at St George’s Park in June, Williamson said: “I remember the first time she played because she came and flattened me in training. I was too slow on it and I think I gave her a bit of stick about it, but in my head I thought: ‘She’s got something about her’. [She is] someone who you can’t give a second to.“In training [in June], I was screaming for a pass and she put it top bins and I thought: ‘I ain’t going to say nothing’. So my first impression was, she let me know she was there, which I love. As a young player coming through, you can do all the fancy flicks and tricks you want, but somebody needs to know about you, and you need to tell people that you’re there, and that’s what she does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the difference is that Walcott – then aged 17 – was not given any match minutes in that tournament by Sven-Göran Eriksson whereas Wiegman has entrusted Agyemang to be a gamechanging substitute.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang scored three league goals on loan at Brighton last season.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/The FA/Getty ImagesWith three goals from her four senior appearances, her fearless and composed performances – she also hit the crossbar against Italy with an audacious effort – have been so strong that Wiegman was asked in her post-match press conference about whether Agyemang’s displays were forcing her to rethink whether she should play even more.The head coach replied: “She’s not forcing me. She is very grateful that she gets minutes. She’s ready for it. Her growth and development went so quickly. From not starting at Brighton, to getting lots more minutes, showing how good she is, and coming into our team, as things go it has been pretty smooth for her and I think she feels very good about that.”To describe her rise as rapid would be a vast understatement. Not even four years ago, Agyemang wasa ballgirl at Wembleyfor Wiegman’s first match at the national stadium. She will surely play a role, one way or another, in the Lionesses’ European final in Basel on Sunday, no longer watching on from the sidelines but now quickly becoming a household name.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Lionesses defender said if her decision to speak up stopped just one instance of abuse then it would have been worth it.Carter said on Sunday that she was stepping away from social media, because of what her teammateslabelled as “online poison”aimed at her throughout this tournament.

Trust me, no one is more disappointed in some of my performances than what I am, but the colour of my skin has got nothing to do with that.“It’s been pretty tough. I’m not saying it [speaking out] is going to make a big difference and make a change but hopefully [it is] just making people aware that it’s not OK. Racism is still going on and we’re just here to do our job to the best of our ability and hopefully bring success back to England.“I think the fans today were unbelievable and their support was incredible and I can’t thank them all enough for being on my side and on the team’s.”Speaking up in support of Carter the Labour MP for Warwick and Leamington, Matt Western, revealed on Tuesday that – within the space of three hours – 91 members of parliament had added their names to his call for the major social media companies to take serious action to combat what they called “the appalling racism and misogyny” directed at Carter, with Western adding: “They need to act.

I can’t believe we’ve got to the final. The last two games have been unreal.”It’s the morning after England’s second successive nerve-shredding last-minute comeback at the women’s European football championships, and in Style of Our Own, a pop-up shop on London’s Regent Street dedicated to women’s sport, there is a palpable buzz over the fact that on Sunday the team will be playing in yet another major championships final.Gigg herself plays semi-professionally for Hull City so she’s used to footballing highs and lows, but even so, she spent Tuesday evening’s semi-final “sitting on the edge of my seat, literally, like, wanting to cry” as the Lionesses overcame Italy with a stoppage-time equaliser from Michelle Agyemang followed by a Chloe Kelly penalty rebound.Though she is only 20, Gigg remembers the days before women’s football had the power to capture huge TV audiences. “I remember when I was maybe 12, I went to watch Man City women play, and there must have been 200-300 people there. Now you’re getting sold-out crowds and they’re playing in the men’s stadiums. It’s massive to see how it’s gone from not really a mainstream sport to being everywhere in the space of just a couple of years.“All of a sudden, people are realising that, wow, this is a big thing. People are tuning in. They’re watching, they’re getting involved. Even people who might not necessarily see themselves as women’s football fans are tuning in to watch them play, and they’re getting excited. And I think it’s brilliant.”It’s a sentiment echoed by Holly Agate who, on entering the shop with her friend Georgina Simpson, made a beeline for the squad strips, picking up one with Lucy Bronze’s name on the back. Agate has just finished her first year as a secondary school PE teacher in Aylesbury, where she has started a football club. “Some of the girls love it, some are a bit hesitant,” she says, but the Euros build-up caught their imagination before school broke up. “I have one girl in my year 9 class who now wants to go pro because of it. She is great at football as well – so I’m trying to get her scouted.”View image in fullscreenPE teacher Holly Agate and Georgina Simpson at the pop-up shop Style of Our Own.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianThe central London pop-up is the brainchild of Laura Youngson, the co-founder of the specialist women’s football boot brand Ida Sports, which says it exists “to prioritise high performance and comfortable footwear for athletes who have traditionally been an afterthought”. On sale are more than 30 other women-led brands, supplying women’s clothing and gear for football, rugby, cricket, golf and netball.“Part of the reason [behind it] was, what do you want your teenage self to have had?” Youngson says. “There’s not really a [retail] place where these sports can coalesce.” Backed by Mastercard, she pitched to Westminster council’s Meanwhile On scheme, aimed at revitalising its prestige high street by giving space to emerging brands; the lease (until October) was donated by the crown estate.Youngson was clear, however, that “it had to be this summer. It was the summer of women’s sport, the Euros, the rugby World Cup being hosted in England [in August]. It was one of those moments where it had to be now.”View image in fullscreenSimi Akintelure, 18, browses sports gear at the shop in central London.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianMaggie Cooper, browsing with her daughters Ellen, 21, and Iris, 18, has perceived a huge change in the visibility and resources dedicated to women’s sport. “I couldn’t get either of these two to be interested in playing football when they were younger. For me, one of the big things was at school, there was no girls’ football.”One issue, she says, is when schools measure success only by the record of their top teams, rather than by participation. “I think all girls should be doing lots of sport, they should be encouraged to do it,” otherwise “they are going to go off and find something else to do”.But the mood music is definitely changing, she believes. “I was at a party last weekend, and two separate women were both going to see the women’s cricket at Lord’s on the Saturday, but neither of them knew that the other was going. There just seems to be a lot more interest in women’s sport around.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he upheld the defendants’ complaints that there had been “serious and widespread failures to comply” with court orders in the ugby league case in particular.The defendants claimed there were “significant gaps” in the medical records in 90% of the claims issued in these cases. At the high court in London, Cook ruled that the claimants, who are being backed by a commercial litigation funder, are liable for the costs incurred in the bringing of these complaints.“These claims mean a lot to the claimants, and the difficulties here have been caused by Mr Boardman’s complete misunderstanding of his responsibilities,” Cook said. Boardman, Cook continued, seemed to be under the misapprehension that “he only had to disclose documents relied on” to the defendants, as opposed to providing them with all relevant material.This has contributed to a delay in the case, which still has yet to come to trial. “There has been no admission, and no apology,” Cook said, “and above and before everything else a complete failure on the part of Mr Boardman to recognise that all this was caused by his misreading.”Susan Rodway KC, of Rylands Garth, argued that the defendants had sent the claimants on “a four-month exercise in following leads down rabbit holes” in search of “some smoking gun” documents which do not exist, and that the firm lacked the resources to comply with the impossible task of providing full medical records for every one of the players involved.“There’s been enough delay,” Cook said. “These claimants need their cases resolving and the sooner the better.”It was revealed in the latest rugby case management hearing that of the 383 claimants who joined the action since the cut-off date this year, only 91 have received a medical diagnosis. Despite this, the legal teams on both sides will now select and agree on a group of lead claimants to go forward to trial, with further case management hearings scheduled for spring in 2026.“Almost five years after legal action began, the claimants lawyers have today conceded in court that many players in the case have not undergone thorough medical testing but instead what the judge called a “self-serving tick box exercise” in order to sign up to this claim,” a World Rugby spokesperson said.“They have no substantive medical diagnosis. The conduct of Rylands Garth meant the judge issued an order which could yet see many more players having their case struck out. There must now be serious doubts over whether players’ best interests are being served. This is a situation that surely benefits nobody.”“We will continue fighting for justice for our players and their families – who continue to suffer every day with the life-altering impacts of the negligence of rugby authorities,” said a Rylands Garth spokesperson in response. “Rugby authorities are fully aware that the testing has been extremely thorough, including brain imaging and neurological assessments. If they’re suggesting otherwise, they are again letting down players who have suffered playing the sport.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRugby leagueConcussion in sportRFLnewsShareReuse this content"

And what the club stands for really means a lot to me as well. It feels like home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here.”Rashford wasone of fiveUnited players made to train away from Amorim’s squad this summer. The England international, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has been training at a gym in Salford and at United’s Carrington base, although only after first-team players have left.The 27-year-old forward has three years remaining on a £325,000-a-week contract at Old Trafford. Barcelona said he would become the 10th man to play for them and United, after Mark Hughes, Laurent Blanc, Henrik Larsson, Jordi Cruyff, Gerard Piqué, Víctor Valdés, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexis Sánchez and Memphis Depay.“The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, the director of the football area and other board members,” Barcelona said in a statement.Rashford said: “I was clear on my preference from the beginning. It didn’t work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy. It’s a family club, something I’m used to from my past.”Rashford has spent 20 years at United, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, but has not featured since beingdropped by Amorim for the Manchester derbylast December. He said later that month that he was ready for a new challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alba had been scheduled to take part in Tuesday evening’s All-Star skills challenge, but was withdrawn. No explanation was given for Alba’s withdrawal, andMLShas not commented publicly on Messi and Alba’s absences.The most aggressive set-piece team in the world plays in MinnesotaRead moreThe MLS All-Star game has been around since the league’s inception in 1996, though it has taken multiple forms. It started as a standard East v West format used in other US leagues, but has also seen a single MLS All-Star squad play against well-known teams from around the world (Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus have all been past opponents). In five of the past six seasons, though, the game has pitted MLS’s squad against Liga MX’s.The event is considered to be a major one among MLS executives and some front offices, with it now being one of the only opportunities for representatives from every club to be in the same location since the SuperDraft ceased being held in-person and MLS Cup stopped being held at a neutral site. The league’s rules contain a provision meant to encourage player participation in the event, stating that, unless they are injured, players must participate in the All-Star game or sit out their club’s next match.This year’s game falls in the middle of a busy period for the league. Inter Miami have played five games already in July after exiting the Club World Cup in a round of 16 loss to PSG. Some of the league restarts play on Friday, less than two days after the All-Star game. The annual Leagues Cup competition pitting MLS teams v Liga MX starts the following week with games on Wednesday.For Miami, Messi and Alba’s absences will loom large – the club’s next match is against FC Cincinnati, who now lead the Eastern Conference and who beat Miami 3-0 the last time they played. Miami then play Atlas in the Leagues Cup on Wednesday.Messi and Alba’s situation is not unprecedented. Zlatan Ibrahimović was suspended one game in 2018 after skipping that year’s All-Star event, a decision he called “ridiculous” in subsequent comments to reporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 31-year-old Greece international had been living in Athens after signing recently for Panathinaikoswhen he diedon 9 October last year.Baldock spent most of his career playing as a defender for MK Dons andSheffield United, having been born in Buckinghamshire, and had played a club fixture just three days before the incident.An inquest into Baldock’s death at Milton Keynes coroner’s court on Wednesday confirmed his medical cause of death as drowning. His family had previously said in a statement that Baldock had “tragically drowned” while swimming in the pool at his home. An investigation by Greek police after the incident also found no evidence of criminal activity.Baldock was discovered in the swimming pool at his address, in the Glyfada district of Athens, on 9 October and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, the inquest heard. A postmortem examination found no drugs or alcohol in his system and that he had a very large heart “that would have meant that he was susceptible to heart arrhythmias”, where the heart beats too fast, too slowly or irregularly.Tom Osborne, the senior coroner for Milton Keynes, concluded Baldock’s death was an accident.Tributes were paid across the country in the days after Baldock’s death, including by his former clubs and at a Nations League match between England and Greece at Wembley where the stadium held a period of silence and both teams wore black armbands.In a statement released at the time, Baldock’s family said: “George you were the most special father, fiance, son, brother, uncle, friend, teammate and person. Your enthusiasm and infectious personality brought so much love to those that were fortunate enough to know you and those that adored you from the stands. We will forever cherish the special memories we have of you and you will continue to live on in your beautiful son.”Baldock was due to fly home the following day to celebrate his son’s first birthday, his family said.Explore more on these topicsFootballSheffield UnitedMK DonsnewsShareReuse this content"

It could take a year to implement.Sources say, however, that France was the only country that called for the immediate implementation of the instrument, arguing it had to demonstrate it was tough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To make countermeasures “clearer, simpler and stronger we will merge lists 1 and 2 into a single list”, he said.Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the EU had missed an opportunity by not warning that it would use the ACI after a trade ministers’ summit early last week, two days after Trump sent it a letter threatening 30% tariffs.“There is a sense that the bloc has fumbled its hand, despite holding decent cards,” he said. “The EU should have immediately retaliated against US tariffs. While the mantra ‘negotiate from a position of strength’ was oft-repeated in speeches, any associated actions never materialised.”The latest EU move comes before a summit with China on Thursday between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU council, António Costa, and China’s president, Xi Jinping.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These included vitamin D deficiency, blood sugar levels, thyroid function, prostate health, HIV, menopause and bowel cancer.The two linked studies, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), rated 60% of the tests as “high risk” over concerns about the testing equipment, sampling process, or instructions and interpretation of the results. Only eight stated who the tests were suitable for, while fewer than half provided any information about accuracy. And of these, much of the evidence to back these claims was not publicly available or was of low quality.With many tests recommending the user followed up with their GP or another healthcare professional regardless of the result, “this begs the question: ‘What’s the point of doing the test in the first place?’”, said Dr Clare Davenport, an associate clinical professor at the University of Birmingham and co-lead author of the studies.“The wide range of off-the-shelf tests now available to the public are not endorsed by theNHSand evidence for their benefit is lacking,” she added. “This is in contrast to well-established self-tests, such as pregnancy tests.“We are worried that consumers concerned about their health and tempted by the convenience of buying a test over the counter may be harmed if they use these tests in the wrong way.”The studies call for better regulation of DIY health tests to protect patients and prevent misuse. Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham and co-lead author of the studies said: “Self-tests have a clear potential to improve public health. However, for them to be beneficial and not harmful, they must be proven to be accurate, easy to use and supported by clear instructions. We hope the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] will update the regulatory process to ensure self-tests are effective and safe for everyone.”Joseph Burt, the head of diagnostics and general medical devices at the MHRA, said: “We take the safety of self-tests very seriously. We will review the evidence presented by the researchers and consider all allegations about device deficiencies.“We have strengthened post-market surveillance powers to monitor and act on concerns. These require manufacturers to actively monitor their products and report significant incidents to us, including for CE-marked self-tests.“We’re overhauling the medical device regulations to further strengthen standards for safety, usability and clinical performance – and we’re exploring new transparency measures such as requiring published summaries of clinical evidence. In the meantime, we strongly encourage anyone using a self-test to check for a CE [Conformité Européene] or UKCA [UK Conformity Assessed] mark, read the instructions carefully and seek medical advice if they’re unsure about their result.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “With the risk of false positives and negatives, and no offer of an interpretation of the results or aftercare, self-testing kits can mean patients experience a significant amount of stress and anxiety – prompting them to seek guidance from their GP to interpret any results.“This not only negatively impacts our patients, but it can also intensify the enormous pressures that GPs and their teams are currently under. Commercial self-testing kits should not default to NHS general practice as the provider for next steps and aftercare, unless the test was initiated in primary care or as part of a commissioned NHS service.”Explore more on these topicsHealthNHSHealth & wellbeingnewsShareReuse this content"

The advertising watchdog described the model’s collarbones as “very prominent”.It added that the model wore “large pointed shoes which emphasised the slenderness of her legs” and: “In part due to the camera angle which appeared tilted downwards, the model’s head appeared out of proportion with the rest of her body and further highlighted her small frame.”M&S argued in its submission to the ASA that its “inclusive women’s wear clothing” represented sizes eight to 24. However, it acknowledged that the models in the ads were size eight, and therefore at the lower end of its sizing range.The retailer said it “took concerns about the depiction of body image in their ads very seriously”, “all models were in good health”, and that it “complied with industry standards and best practices to avoid promoting unhealthy body images”.The ASA ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and M&S must ensure all its images “did not portray models as being unhealthily thin”.M&S confirmed that the images had been removed.The ASA said it also received complaints about three other adverts on the M&S app, website and in an email for the company, where two models wear a pink polka-dot dress.In its investigation, it said the model’s face “did not look gaunt”, adding that “while thin, her arms and the leg visible in the shot did not display any protruding bones”.“The model appeared in proportion and we considered that she was not presented as unhealthily thin overall,” the ruling concluded.The other images in the ad, which featured another model, also “showed the model in proportion. We also considered that the model did not appear unhealthily thin in those shots.”The ruling comes amid concerns that the fashion industry is reversing progress made in the body positivity movement in the 2010s due to a recent trend towards skinnier models.Earlier this year,the ASA banned a Next advertfor featuring what it deemed an “unhealthily thin” model in digitally altered clothing.In 2023, it banned Warehouse from using an image of a model in an oversized biker jacket, saying the model’s pronounced collar bone, hip bones and torso gave the appearance of her being “very thin”, which made the ad “irresponsible”.M&S has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerAdvertisingAdvertising Standards AuthorityRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is thought to be one of the first structures communally constructed by humans.Jeffery said: “The fact it has survived at all demonstrates how well constructed it was and how monumental in the landscape back in its time.”View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Dudderhouse Hill long cairn in the Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: The Historic England ArchiveThe long cairn, which was built by a Neolithic farming community who were the successors to hunter-gatherers and lived in caves and stone huts, may have had a number of purposes.One of those was funerary, as a “home for the dead”, although not for whole bodies. Evidence suggests the deceased were left to the birds and elements before body parts were ritualistically interred in the monument.Long cairns may also have been positioned, like Stonehenge, to help communities know when seasons started and ended.Heritage groups try to save decaying modernist studio in Scottish BordersRead moreAnother function of the long cairn was to say “this is our land”, said Jeffery. “Building a structure like that would have taken a lot of people a significant amount of time. They would have had to be fed by others, there would have been specialist stonemasons and engineers – a lot of effort would have been invested into those structures. They are a statement of ‘this is us’, ‘we are here’.”Research suggests the long cairn was used as an animal pen in the 16th century and in more recent years has been damaged by people removing and moving stones, sometimes innocently to create way markers for walkers.“The problem is this causes sustained and considerable damage over time,” said Jeffery. “People might only be taking one stone and don’t realise the harm they’re doing. If it was left unchecked, eventually the evidence for its existence would be lost completely.”Scheduled monument status means the long cairn will receive the highest level of protection available and means the national park authority can carry out a project to educate people about the site’s importance.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “Scheduling this remarkable neolithic long cairn ensures that this rare and fragile piece of our prehistoric heritage receives the protection it deserves.”Explore more on these topicsYorkshireNorth YorkshireNorth of EnglandHeritageWalkingNational parksEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Named Aeneas after the mythical Trojan hero, the program predicts where and when inscriptions were made and makes suggestions where words are missing.Historians who put the program through its paces said it transformed their work by helping them identify similar inscriptions to those they were studying, a crucial step for setting the texts in context, and proposing words to fill the inevitable gaps in worn and damaged artefacts.X-ray reveals ancient Greek author of charred first century BC Vesuvius scrollRead more“Aeneas helps historians interpret, attribute and restore fragmentary Latin texts,” said Dr Thea Sommerschield, a historian at the University of Nottingham who developed Aeneas with the tech firm. “That’s the grand challenge that we set out to tackle.”Inscriptions are among the most important records of life in the ancient world. The most elaborate can cover monument walls, but many more take the form of decrees from emperors, political graffiti, love poems, business records, epitaphs on tombs and writings on everyday life. Scholars estimate that about 1,500 new inscriptions are found every year.“What makes them unique is that they are written by the ancient people themselves across all social classes,” said Sommerschield. “It’s not just history written by the victors.”But there is a problem. The texts are often broken into pieces or so ravaged by time that parts are illegible. And many inscribed objects have been scattered over the years, making their origins uncertain.The Google team led by Yannis Assael worked with historians to create an AI tool that would aid the research process. The program is trained on an enormous database of nearly 200,000 known inscriptions, amounting to 16m characters.View image in fullscreenAeneas carrying Anchises out of burning Troy. The program is named after the mythical hero.Photograph: AlamyAeneas takes text, and in some cases images, from the inscription being studied and draws on its training to build a list of related inscriptions from 7th century BC to 8th century BC. Rather than merely searching for similar words, the AI identifies and links inscriptions through deeper historical connections.Having trained on the rich collection of inscriptions, the AI can assign study texts to one of 62 Roman provinces and estimate when it was written to within 13 years. It also provides potential words to fill in any gaps, though this has only been tested on known inscriptions where text is blocked out.In a test run, researchers set Aeneas loose on a vast inscription carved into monuments around the Roman empire. The self-congratulatoryRes Gestae Divi Augustidescribes the life achievements of the first Roman emperor, Augustus. Aeneas came up with two potential dates for the work, either the first decade BC or between 10 and 20AD. The hedging echoes the debate among scholars who argue over the same dates.In another test, Aeneas analysed inscriptions on a votive altar from Mogontiacum, now Mainz in Germany, and revealed through subtle linguistic similarities how it had been influenced by an older votive altar in the region. “Those were jaw-dropping moments for us,” said Sommerschield. Details arepublished in Natureand Aeneas is available toresearchers online.In a collaboration, 23 historians used Aeneas to analyse Latin inscriptions. The context provided by the tool was helpful in 90% of cases. “It promises to be transformative,” saidMary Beard, a professor of classics at the University of Cambridge.Jonathan Prag, a co-author and professor of ancient history at the University of Oxford, said Aeneas could be run on the existing corpus of inscriptions to see if the interpretations could be improved. He added that Aeneas would enable a wider range of people to work on the texts.“The only way you can do it without a tool like this is by building up an enormous personal knowledge or having access to an enormous library,” he said. “But you do need to be able to use it critically.”Explore more on these topicsScienceArtificial intelligence (AI)ArchaeologyMary BeardGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

The voices of those working in the energy sector day in, day out, who have vast experience of dealing with change, need to be front and centre of the process. If not, it’s doomed to fail.“At the moment, the transition feels like something being done to workers – that can’t continue. People need to see real jobs created where they live, and their local economy boosted, or we’re going to see more and more tempted by the siren calls of those who deny the reality of climate change.”The campaign will aim to put energy workers and jobs at the centre of the UK’s debate on decarbonisation. Unions say it is needed because they want more to be done to ensure good jobs are created in low carbon energy, and the government’s industrial strategy focuses on supporting workers and communities who will see a decline in jobs in industries that are being phased out.GMB and Prospect said new research commissioned from YouGov shows that 55% of the public want to see jobs and the economy prioritised, while 17% of those surveyed said they would put the need for speed first.Only three in 10 voters thought the energy transition would have a positive impact on job opportunities in the UK, and this fell to two in 10 when asked about jobs in their own local area. Fewer than one in 10 voters said the transition had led to more job opportunities in their area so far.The research found that overall the public feel more positively than negatively about the energy transition by 55% to 16% but that Reform voters have markedly more negative views at 48% and the party is seeking to capitalise on discontent in communities where the energy industry is declining.Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, said the biggest challenge with the energy transition “is no longer climate technology, it is climate jobs”.“We are going to need tens of thousands of workers to deliver this huge shift in the way we produce and use energy. Building on the clean energy industrial strategy, the opportunity is to deliver good, clean energy jobs for the people and places that most need them,” he said.“But this research shows that people aren’t yet seeing those jobs materialise, and if this continues then it will undermine support for the transition and drive people towards parties who oppose it and would put the future of the industry at risk.“The government have raised the ambition on energy policy, which is welcome, now they need to be bigger and bolder when it comes to energy jobs and put energy workers at the heart of this agenda.”The Climate Jobs UK campaign will be supported by theClimate Jobs National Resource Center, which worked with unions in the US to run campaigns on how to create good union jobs while tackling the climate crisis.A Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero spokesperson said: “The clean energy transition is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, with investment from this government helping to secure hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the UK in growing industries from carbon capture to nuclear.“We are working with trade unions to drive good jobs with high pay in the clean energy sector – including driving to ensure high levels of unionisation across the renewables industry.”Explore more on these topicsGreen economyLabourTrade unionsGreen jobsReform UKConservativesClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

To do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day,” the plan says. “Simply put, we need to ‘Build, Baby, Build!’”Trump is also expected to sign three AI-related executive orders on Wednesday during a keynote address at a summit in DC. The announcement will be co-hosted by bipartisan lawmakers with the Hill and Valley Forum and a business and technologypodcasthosted by four technology investors and businessmen, including Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks.The AI sector is already depleting land and water resources and taking a massive toll on the climate, with AI-powered large language models such as ChatGPT taking up to 10 times more energy than a regular Google search, according to anestimateby the Electric Power Research Institute. Last year, ChatGPT usedmore than half a million kilowatts of electricityevery day, equivalent to the daily power use of 180,000 US households.The training of a single AI model can lead to an emissions footprint that is almost five times larger than the lifetime carbon footprint of the average American car.Recent researchfrom Food and Water Watch also found that energy demand from AI servers and datacenters in the US is expected to increase up to threefold from 2023 to 2028, which could lead the US sector to, by 2028, annually consume enough water to fill more than 1m Olympic-size swimming pools and enough electricity to power more than 28m American households.“At its core, President Trump’s AI agenda is nothing more than a thinly veiled invitation for the fossil fuel and corporate water industries to ramp up their exploitation of our environment and natural resources – all at the expense of everyday people,” said Mitch Jones, a managing director Food and Water Watch, an environmental advocacy group.The new plan recommends that regulators review states’ AI laws to see whether they interfere with the agency’s authority. It also says federal agencies will “consider a state’s AI regulatory climate when making funding decisions” and “limit funding if the state’s AI regulatory regimes may hinder the effectiveness of that funding or award”.Republicans earlier this year attempted to enact a version of this by placing a moratorium on states’ ability to impose regulations on artificial intelligenceinto Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but the provision was stripped at the last minute.“Under this plan, tech giants get sweetheart deals while everyday Americans will see their electricity bills rise to subsidize discounted power for massive AI datacenters,” said JB Branch, a big-tech accountability advocate with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “States are held hostage: either stop protecting their residents from dangerous, untested AI products, or lose federal funding.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It says states are liable for all kinds of activities that harm the climate, but it takes explicit aim at fossil fuels.It says that a state’s failure to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions, including through the production and consumption of fossil fuels, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies, “may constitute an international wrongful act which is attributable to that state”.View image in fullscreenClimate activists demonstrated outside the international court of justice in The Hague before the court’s ruling.Photograph: Marta Florin/ReutersClimate campaigners and representatives of vulnerable countries were delighted with the outcome. Speaking outside the court, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, said it was a milestone moment for climate justice. “It has confirmed what vulnerable nations have been saying and have known for so long,” he said. “That states do have legal obligations to act on climate change.”He said the document would be a vital tool in upcoming climate negotiations and was likely to inspire new lawsuits. Advisory opinions are technically non-binding but are considered authoritative because they summarise existing law rather than create laws.Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate litigation and counsel for Solomon Islands in the case, said the ICJ laid out the possibility of big emitters being successfully sued.“These reparations involve restitution – such as rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and restoring ecosystems – and also monetary compensation,” he said.Coal, oil and gas are the main cause of anthropogenic climate breakdown, but there was no mention of fossil fuels in the main text of the Paris agreement in 2015. It wasnot until 2023that countries said they would “transition away” from them, and even that weaker pledge wasdowngraded by some governmentsto optional.View image in fullscreenRalph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change, said it was a milestone moment for climate justice.Photograph: Lina Selg/EPAThe court also said states were legally liable for the actions of the private sector and must regulate corporate activities that contributed to the climate crisis.The UNinstructed the ICJto produce this document in 2023 after years of campaigningby a group of Pacific island law studentsand diplomacy led by the Pacific island state of Vanuatu.Vishal Prasad, one of the law students that lobbied the government of Vanuatu to bring the case to the ICJ, said: “This advisory opinion is a tool for climate justice. And boy, has the ICJ given us a strong tool to carry on the fight for climate justice.”UN secretary-general António Guterres hailed the opinion and said it affirms that the Paris climate agreement goal needs to be the basis of all climate policies. “This is a victory for our planet, for climate justice, and for the power of young people to make a difference,” he said. “The world must respond.”It was the largest case the court has ever heard. During atwo-week hearingin The Hague in December, representatives of vulnerable states told a panel of 15 judges that a handful of countriesshould be held legally responsiblefor the ongoing impacts of the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The court resoundingly rejected that argument, saying a range of other treaties applied, including theUN convention on the law of the sea, theVienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer, theMontreal protocol, theconvention on biological diversityand theUN convention to combat desertification.Customary international law also applied, it said, including principles of sustainable development, common but differentiated responsibilities, equity, intergenerational equity and the precautionary principle. States also had a duty to work together to protect the climate, the court said, because uncoordinated action “may not lead to a meaningful result”.View image in fullscreenYūji Iwasawa, right, the ICJ president, said climate breakdown had ‘severe and far-reaching’ consequences.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APThe court said a clean, healthy and sustainable environment was a precondition for exercising many human rights, such as the right to life, the right to health and the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to water, food and housing.The ICJ took aim at countries that are not part of climate change treaties, saying they still had to show that their climate policies and practices were consistent with other parts of international law. Donald Trump signed an order earlier this year towithdraw the USfrom the Paris agreement for the second time, andother rightwing leadershave threatened to do so as well.“As always, President Trump and the entire administration is committed to putting America first and prioritising the interests of everyday Americans,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Reuters in response to the opinion.The fact that the climate crisis was a global problem did not absolve individual states of responsibility, the court said, and those that have been harmed could theoretically bring climate-related legal claims against those that caused it. It may be more difficult to make a causal link than in the case of local pollution, but the court said it was not impossible and would be strengthened by existing science.Courts could order reparations, the ICJ said, including the restoration of infrastructure and ecosystems. In cases where the damage is irreparable, compensation may be due.The ICJ is the third of four top courts to publish such a document on the climate crisis. The inter-American court of human rights (IACHR) concluded earlier this month that there wasa human right to a healthy climate, and the IACHR and the international tribunal for the law of the sea saidstates had a legal responsibilityto control greenhouse gases. The African court on human and people’s rights has only just begun the process.Of all these, the ICJ has the widest jurisdiction and the role of harmonising and integrating international law. Vanuatu now intends to take the document to the UN general assembly to seek a resolution affirming its findings.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisInternational court of justiceUnited NationsVanuatuPacific islandsAsia PacificSouth PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Loss of the ecosystems could lead to reductions in carbon drawdown, crop productivity and ecosystem resilience to climate extremes.Mycorrhizal fungi have “remained in the dark, despite the extraordinary ways they sustain life on land”, said Dr Toby Kiers, the executive director of Spun.“They cycle nutrients, store carbon, support plant health, and make soil. When we disrupt these critical ecosystem engineers, forest regeneration slows, crops fail and biodiversity above ground begins to unravel … 450m years ago, there were no plants on Earth and it was because of these mycorrhizal fungal networks that plants colonised the planet and began supporting human life.“If we have healthy fungal networks, then we will have greater agricultural productivity, bigger and beautiful flowers, and can protect plants against pathogens.”Mycorrhizal fungi are found on the roots of plants and help regulate Earth’s climate and ecosystems. Its underground networks provide plants with essential nutrients, while drawing more than 13bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year into soils – equivalent to roughly one-third of global emissions from fossil fuels.Spun launched the initiative in 2021 alongside organisations including GlobalFungi,FungiFoundation, the Global Soil Mycobiome consortium and researchers from around the world to map out the under-researched networks of mycorrhizal fungal.Using machine-learning techniques on a dataset containing more than 2.8bn fungal samples from 130 countries, scientists were able to predict mycorrhizal diversity at a 1km2scale across the planet.They discovered that only 9.5% of these fungal biodiversity hotspots fell within existing protected areas, revealing huge conservation gaps. The coast of Ghana was found to be a global hotspot for fungi, but with the country’s coastline eroding at a rate of 2 metres a year, scientists fear this crucial biodiversity will be washed into the sea.This research marks the first large-scale scientific application of the global mapping initiative, which “are more than scientific tools – they can help guide the future of conservation”, said the study’s lead author, Dr Michael Van Nuland. “Given the impact of these fungal symbioses on the health and functioning of Earth’s ecosystems, continuing to ignore them could be a hugely missed opportunity.”Nuland said the fungi respond negatively to human stressors, and without addressing the possible loss of these vital fungus, we could lose our ability to develop novel natural climate solutions.Land use is a significant cause of mycorrhizal fungal degradation, and it is “frustrating that no action has been taken to prioritise conservation of it”, said Kiers. “The fungi are needed for agricultural productivity and human health.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The expansion of its fungal maps would guide decision-makers to start leveraging mycorrhizal systems.The preservation and protection of mycorrhizal fungi could help to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges – biodiversity decline, climate change, and declining food productivity, said Dr Rebecca Shaw, the chief scientist at the World Wide Fund for Nature, who added that it had a direct benefit to people.Explore more on these topicsFungiBiodiversityConservationBiologyWildlifeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

An air ambulance took the injured man to the Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast and an ambulance took the other casualty to South West Acute hospital in Enniskillen, where the child was pronounced dead.Politicians expressed shock and sadness.“My thoughts are with the victims and their families at this tragic time,” said Pat Cullen, the Sinn Féin MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. “I would urge people to not speculate on the details of this tragic and shocking incident.”Deborah Erskine, a Democratic Unionist party assembly member, said the community was stunned. “The area of Maguiresbridge where this has happened is a rural, quiet area and everyone is deeply affected by what has happened,” she said. “My deepest condolences are with the families of those who have been killed as a result of this incident. Their lives have been turned upside down this morning.”The former DUP leader Arlene Foster, who grew up near the area, said: “I am so very sorry for the family involved and praying for all impacted by this horrific act.”Hilary Benn, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said the news was tragic and deeply distressing.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, our priority is unity and action.“Teachers have endured years of underinvestment, overwork, and undervaluing of our profession. We urgently need government to invest in education – that means fair pay, manageable workloads, and safe, respectful working environments for staff and students.“I will work tirelessly with our executive and activists across all nations to secure the conditions and respect teachers deserve. This is a critical moment for education, and NASUWT will lead the way in fighting for our members’ rights.”Wayne Broom, the NASUWT national president, said: “This election engaged our members up and down the country, and the result reflects their confidence in his leadership.“Matt will play a vital role in the next chapter of the union’s work on behalf of teachers across the UK. The national executive and I look forward to working closely with him as we continue our mission to put teachers first.“We also want to thank Neil Butler for standing in this election and for his ongoing service to NASUWT – his dedication exemplifies the strength of this union’s democracy.”Wrack was named as the executive’s preferred candidate for general secretary in March. Under NASUWT rules he would have automatically filled the position if no other candidate received enough nominations from local branches.Butler’s initial attempt to collect nominations was ruled out on the grounds that, as an employee, he was not a member of the union. He launched legal proceedings and the NASUWT backed down shortly before a hearing at the high court. Wrack was named acting general secretary and nominations were reopened.Only 4.7% of the NASUWT’s 178,306 eligible members took part in the ballot. Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, was elected in 2023 on a 9% turnout.Explore more on these topicsEducationTeachingTrade unionsWalesFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

Local people have been involved in the protests – which broke out after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault – but far-right activists have played a key role in promoting them online and have been present.Essex police have issued a dispersal order in Epping that is in place from 2pm on Thursday until 8am on Friday, covering an area including the town centre, transport hubs and networks such as the underground station.The order gives officers the power to tell anyone suspected of committing or planning antisocial behaviour to leave the area or face arrest.The latest clashes took place on Sunday when riot police were once again pelted with projectiles before the area was cleared using a dispersal order.Harrington used a press conference on Wednesday to push back at allegations that counter-demonstrators were being deliberately transported to be close to the protests outside the hotel last Thursday.Farage had earlier called on Harrington to resign and posted footage online that the Reform UK leader claimed was proof the force had “transported leftwing protesters to the Bell hotel in Epping”.Essex police issued a statement on Wednesday saying officers organised a foot cordon around protesters on their way to exercise their right to protest. Later, some people who were deemed to be at risk when they were surrounded by groups of men who had attacked police were taken away in police vans, but the force said officers “categorically did not drive any counter-protesters to the site on any occasion”.Harrington used the press conference to address online misinformation about the hotel and the policing operation, urging people to “consider the consequences in the real world of your actions”.The source of the claims that police were bussing counter protesters to Epping appeared to come from social media users who repurposed footage of people taken away on Thursday after violence erupted.When Reform UK was asked about this, Farage told the Guardian: “Hard-left groups Stand Up To Racism and Antifa were given the red carpet treatment by Essex police, with the force literally escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest. They have been caught red-handed helping to light the fuse that led to violence.”Harrington also said the force would act on any evidence provided to it, after it emerged a number of activists from the far-right Homeland party were behind a Facebook group that had been organising protests outside the Bell hotel. “I have got no information available to me to say that any particular group or person is behind organising this. Clearly where they are we will examine that and identify that and see what offences they commit, whether they should have notified us about a march or procession.”Harrington said the force would also be looking to see whether anyone had been acting to incite violence.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He allegedly intended to make £235,622 from one insurer and £231,031 from another.He was also charged with encouraging or assisting in the commission of grievous bodily harm.It is alleged that between August 2018 and December 2020 he bought videos from a website called The Eunuch Maker showing the removal of limbs and “encouraged Marius Gustavson to remove body parts of third parties”.Hopper, who appeared from custody, did not enter pleas to the three charges during a 40-minute hearing at Cornwall magistrates court in Bodmin.A bail application was made, but he was remanded to appear before a judge at Truro crown court on 26 August.The police said Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust, where Hopper has been employed, had worked closely with officers throughout the investigation.A spokesperson for the trust said: “The charges do not relate to Mr Hopper’s professional conduct and there has been no evidence to suggest any risk to patients. Mr Hopper worked at the Royal Cornwall hospitals from 2013 until he was suspended from duty in March 2023, following his initial arrest.”Former patients with any questions or concerns about their treatment can contact the Royal Cornwall hospitals’ patient experience team on 01872 25 2793, or emailrcht.patientexperience@nhs.net.In a BBC interview in 2023, Hopper spoke of the amputations. He said: “I do quite a lot of amputations and the one thing that kept going around in my mind was power tools. The thought of power tools being used on me was icky. It was really weird.”He said he recovered quickly. He was told it would take him about three months to be able to walk. “I did it in three hours,” he said. “I hate to say it but I’m more active since I lost my legs than I was before.” He was shortlisted in the European Space Agency’s search for an astronaut with a disability.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He stood next to his lawyer and admitted guilt to four counts to judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in federal court in Los Angeles.Plasencia, 43, was to have gone on trial in August until the doctor agreed last month to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles.He spoke only to answer the judge’s questions. When asked if his lawyers had considered all the possibilities of pleas and sentencing in the case, Plasencia replied: “They’ve considered everything.”He had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.Prosecutors outlined the charges in court before the plea, and said, as Plasencia’s lawyers have emphasized, that he did not sell Perry the dose that killed the actor.They described, and Plasencia admitted, that Perry froze up and his blood pressure spiked when the doctor gave him one injection, but Plasencia still left more ketamine for Perry’s assistant to inject.In court, Perry was referred to only as “victim MP”.The charges can carry a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and there is no guarantee Plasencia will get less, but he is likely to. He has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August, and will be allowed to remain free until his 3 December sentencing.Plasencia left the courthouse with his lawyers without speaking to reporters gathered outside.The only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the US attorney’s office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the “Ketamine Queen” and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.According to prosecutors and co-defendants who reached their own deals, Plasencia illegally supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine starting about a month before his death on 28 October 2023.According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a “moron” who could be exploited for money.Perry’s personal assistant, his friend, and another doctor all agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation as the government sought to make their case against larger targets, Plasencia and Sangha. None have been sentenced yet.Perry was found dead by the assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anaesthetic, was the primary cause of death.The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry, 54, began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry’s death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.He admitted to enlisting another doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.“I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez’s plea agreement.After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry’s “go-to”, prosecutors said.Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time onFriends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryFriendsnewsShareReuse this content"

The electric vehicle maker once led the market for gas-free cars, but recently has faced falling stock, steep competition and a CEO who has been described as erratic and a chaos maker. Now, for its second-quarter earnings, Tesla is reporting a decline in both revenue and profit.The electric vehicle maker said it saw a 12% drop in revenue from the same time last year, coming in at $22.5bn, which was below Wall Street’s expectations of$22.7bn. Tesla noted its operating income also decreased to $0.9bn, a 42% decrease since last year. This marks asecond straight quarterly declinefor the company.During a call with analysts on Wednesday, CEOElon Muskstruck a more positive note saying it had been a “very exciting quarter” and that “Tesla has a shot of being the most valuable company in the world”.He touted thelaunch of the company’s driverless carsin Austin, Texas, and the opening of a hamburger joint in Los Angeles called Tesla diner, which he said “has been a huge hit”. Musk also said the company’s humanoid “Optimus” robot has been freely walking around the company’s Palo Alto lab all on its own.Tesla’s shares dropped around 5% in after hours trading. Throughout 2025, the company’sstock has vacillated, starting the year at a near all-time high of $428 per share in January and then plummeting by nearly half to $222 per share in March. Tesla’s overall stock has dropped nearly 13% this year.In its financial summary on Wednesday, Tesla said the subpar financials are due to a decline in vehicle deliveries, lower regulatory credit revenue and reduced average selling price of its cars.Earlier this month, Teslareleased dataon its vehicle deliveries and showed a 14% decrease over last year. Industry data shows that in California alone, the company’s car registrations havefallen for seven straight quarters, with a 21.1% drop in the second quarter. In Europe, Tesla’s new car salesfell by 27.9% in Mayfrom a year earlier. That was in sharp contrast with other electric vehicle makers, which have seen ajump in salesover the past year.The volatility at Tesla has been partially attributed to Musk’s role in Donald Trump’sadministrationas thede facto headof the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). At Doge, Musk led the charge to downsize the federal government, getting rid of various agencies and instituting layoffs in nearly all departments. This sparkedmass countrywide protests against Teslaand demands to boycott the company.By early June, as Musk was scheduled to leave his role as a special government employee, the relationship between the CEO and president had frayed, leading to aspectacular blow-up between the two men. They hurled insults at each other over social media and, once again, Tesla’s stock plunged.“The Tesla brand is under attack and provides a prime example of negative brand equity rub – the perception ofElon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst for Forrester. “This poses a significant threat to Tesla’s growth, as large parts of the prospect pool are poisoned by what they perceive as a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.”After the Musk and Trump feud, Musk said he was going to focus on running his companies and began hyping the rollout of Tesla’s first driverlessrobotaxiin Austin. The launch featured about 10 cars designated to certain areas of the city and had “safety drivers” in the front passenger seat. Although Musk said the launch was a success, several peopleposted videos on social mediashowing the robotaxis driving down the wrong lane, speeding and unable to make left turns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk added that Tesla is being “extremely paranoid” about safety.As for politics, the CEO has said he is not yetdone with Washington and is nowstarting a new US political partycalled the America party.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTeslaElon MuskQuarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rodriguez’s girlfriend then allegedly used the pills to end two pregnancies.Coeytaux not only broke a series of Texas anti-abortion laws, the lawsuit alleges, but also a 19th-century federal anti-vice law known as theComstock Act. That act bans the mailing of abortion-related materials, but has been unenforced for decades, its scope narrowed by laws and court rulings – includingRoe v Wade, which has since been overturned – that came into effect in the 20th century.“Assisting a self-managed abortion inTexasis an act of murder,” the lawsuit alleges. Although Rodriguez’s girlfriend, the lawsuit continued, “cannot be charged with murder for her role in killing her unborn child, immunity does not shield Coeytaux from liability for aiding or abetting or directly participating in the murder”.New York county clerk rejects Texas’s effort to fine doctor in abortion pill caseRead moreRodriguez is seeking damages against Coeytaux as well as an injunction that would forbid Coeytaux from mailing abortion pills across state lines. Rodriguez wants that injunction, he said in his lawsuit, “on behalf of a class of all current and future fathers of unborn children in the United States”.Rodriguez also claims the injunction is necessarybecause his girlfriend is allegedly pregnant again, and he fears her husband – from whom she is separated – may urge her to have another abortion. His girlfriend’s previous abortions were also at her estranged husband’s convincing, according to Rodriguez’s lawsuit.This lawsuit marks the latest attempt by anti-abortion activists to target the mailing of abortion pills, which have becomea major avenue of abortion accessin the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe, and to revive enforcement of the Comstock Act. In December, Texas sued Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor, over allegations that she violated Texas law by mailing abortion pills to a Texas woman. In January, a Louisiana grand jury criminally indicted Carpenter over accusations that she mailed a pill to that state, too.Anti-abortion activists’ have beenurging men who are angryabout their female partners’ abortions to come forward and launch litigation.However, because the Carpenterlawsuit was ultimately filed by the office of Ken Paxton, the Texas Republican attorney general, experts believe it may be fatally hobbled by a quirk of US constitutional law. Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis, law school professor who studies the legal history of reproduction, has toldthe Guardianthat while the US constitution forces states to recognize fines levied in lawsuits between people, it does not necessarily do the same for fines that result from lawsuits that have been brought by states.Planned Parenthood offices begin rejecting Medicaid after Trump signs bill to defund healthcare organizationRead moreBecause Rodriguez is suing as an individual, his lawsuit may sidestep that hurdle.Coeytaux declined to comment on the litigation.According to his LinkedIn profile, Coeytaux is based inCalifornia, where abortion remains legal, and which has a “shield law” in place to protect abortion providers who mail abortion pills across state lines. They have never been put to the test in court.Rodriguez is being represented in his lawsuit by Jonathan Mitchell, an attorney who masterminded a six-week abortion ban that went into effect in Texas in 2021. Although Roe was still the law of the land when the ban took effect, it withstood legal scrutiny because of its unique design: rather than being enforced by the state, it deputized people to sue one another over suspected illegal abortions.Explore more on these topicsAbortionTexasHealthReproductive rightsUS healthcareCaliforniaRoe v WadenewsShareReuse this content"

Search delivered double-digit revenue growth, and our new features, like AI Overviews and AI Mode, are performing well. We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions offerings. And Cloud had strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability.”Google’s AI chatbot, Gemini, now has more than 450 million monthly active users and AI Overviews, the AI-generated summaries that pop up automatically at the top of Google search results, has over 2 billion monthly active users across 200 countries and 40 languages, Pichai said on the investor call.To keep pace with the expansion and demand for its Cloud products and services, Google said it plans to increase its investment in capital expenditures from $75bn to $85bn. Pichai said there was a “tight supply environment” for datacenter and cloud computing infrastructure and that “there’s obviously a time delay” with this additional investment, which will play out in the next few years.“We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai said on the call. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers.”Market reaction to the increased spending appeared mixed, said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“While the increased spending underscores Alphabet’s commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in emerging technologies, it also raises concerns about potential impacts on near-term profitability,” Cohen said in a statement. “AI investments are fueling the company’s strong CapEx commitments, though the market is questioning the pace of monetization.”Some analysts say this is par for the course for companies looking to effectively compete in the AI and cloud computing space.“It seems this is a necessary investment as the only factor limiting Google’s growth is the constraints on computing that AI and cloud solutions need to run on,” said Brian Mulberry, senior portfolio manager atZacks Investment Management.Pichai spoke at length about many of the company’s recent AI developments, though the company still trails behind major players like OpenAI.

It speaks to speed. And it underscores how Alphabet’s in-house AI stack is quietly turning into a competitive asset, winning business from names like Apple and Anthropic.”While analysts still expect the company to report positive results for the second quarter of the year, some are concerned about its recent series of antitrust losses. A judge in April found that the firm acted illegally to build a monopoly of some of its advertising technology. That follows an August ruling that found Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior to protect its search monopoly.The firm said it saw a 12% increase in revenue across Google Services, which includes its core search engine, assuaging analyst concerns about recent reports and remarks that indicated Google searches have declined for the first time in 22 years. During Google’s recent antitrust trial, for instance, the Apple senior vice-president of services,Eddy Cue, saidGoogle searches in Safari had fallen for the first time in 22 years. He attributed that to the rise in the use of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Microsoft Copilot for searches.Google develops AI tool that fills missing words in Roman inscriptionsRead more“Search remains the dominant cash engine – and a tension point,” Acheychek said. “While OpenAI’sChatGPTis arguably a threat to Google’s search business, it’s also a customer.

But when I arrived, the markings had vanished. Faced with this absence, I found myself seeking a new story, something unplanned.Mustapha was my guide that day. At first, he took me along the typical tourist trails, which didn’t speak to my photographic interests. Then he suggested we explore the sand dunes. Initially, I wasn’t particularly interested in these either, but then we came across this old well. I set up my camera, a 1972 Hasselblad 500, and my tripod. As I started to photograph the well, Mustapha stepped forward, instinctively leaning in to look inside. I hadn’t imagined him in the picture but he didn’t pay attention to me. That spontaneous gesture – part ritual, part desperation – transformed the scene completely. It felt sacred, as though he were praying for the return of something essential: water.This unplanned moment encapsulates the core of my wider project, Before It’s Gone: the fragility of ecosystems, the human struggle for survival, the quiet persistence of memory in the face of environmental loss. I began the project in 2018, driven by my growing awareness of how dramatically oasis environments were changing in Morocco. I started noticing patterns: rising temperatures, shrinking water sources, abandoned palm groves and increasing rural exodus. What was once a source of life and resilience for entire communities was slowly being erased. I felt an urgent need to document this transformation – not just ecologically but socially and culturally.People are being forced to leave the only homes they’ve ever known, not because of war but because water is disappearingOver the years, the project has taken me to dozens of oases and expanded to include Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Mauritania. It has unfolded through travel, extended conversations and long-term engagement with the people who live in these spaces. What drives me is the conviction that these are not just local stories – they are global warnings. The climate crisis is often framed in abstract or future terms. Through this work, I want to make it visible, human and grounded in the present.Including the human figure was essential. Oases are not just geographic features: they are homes, livelihoods and cultural reservoirs shaped over centuries. In this photograph, Mustapha embodies that deep connection. His gesture of looking into the well is both literal and symbolic – it speaks to dependence, resilience and vulnerability, but also to hope and remembrance. This reflects my work, which explores the complex relationship between people and their environments. Whether I’m documenting oases’ decline, Moroccan youth, or the sociology of work and migration, I’m interested in how individuals navigate change.Water scarcity is no longer just an environmental issue. It’s a humanitarian crisis, especially in regions such as the Sahara, where life has always depended on fragile water sources. I hope images like this can serve as visual testimonies – simple, powerful reminders of what is at stake.Photography has taught me to slow down and pay attention to people, landscapes and silence. This shot is a portrait of loss but also of quiet resistance. Communities are being forced to leave the only homes they’ve ever known, not because of war but because the water is disappearing. I hope the image evokes empathy and awareness. I want viewers to connect emotionally – to see the climate emergency not as a distant headline, but to recognise the urgent need to protect natural resources and the cultures and communities that depend on them.This was a fleeting moment, entirely unplanned, yet it now speaks to so much. Seeing it enlarged today as a poster in underground stations across London, advertising theWellcome Trust exhibition Thirst, is humbling.

She talks about the deaths of her mum, dad and brother – and why she’s given up dating menWed 23 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 06.26 EDTShareIt’s early evening in a photography studio in west London, and the American comedianLeslie Jonesis capering about, dressed in a full-length gold lamé ballgown and smoking. “Make me look skinny,” she says to the photographer’s departing back.“I’m 6ft tall – I can’t cut my feet off,” she says, later. “I can’t stop being a scary motherfucker. This is who I am – let me work with who I am.” Yet, she is the opposite of scary. Statuesque, no question, but whatever she’s doing, whether peering into a bag of fish and chips as if it’s alive, or telling her assistant to read The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho’s trust-the-universe novel, for the 100th time, there is always somebody laughing. She brings an air of deliberate chaos, which you just have to surrender to, wherever the conversation leads, until you find yourself nodding along with the most crackpot conclusion. (The birthrate is low because men spend too much time in hot tubs, and their sperm has become lazy and complacent? “It’s funny, but it’s true. Go look that shit up – I’m not saying something that’s not factual. I hope.”)She knows this about herself: “I’m the type of person who, if I’m happy, everybody in the room is going to be happy, and if I’m sad, it’s going to be very quiet and tense. I’m a temperature guider in the room.” I didn’t see her sad, so I only know that the first bit is true; not every comedian even wants to spread joy, but Jones wants to, and does so raucously, effortlessly.View image in fullscreen‘When I had my mind on it I was so good’ … Jones during her basketball-playing daysSo it’s a surprise that the first thoughts out of her mouth are serious ones. “We’re repeating the worst part of history right now,” she says, “but maybe it’s for the lesson that we didn’t learn the last time.” We’re talking about Donald Trump, of course, who that day had been blocked by a court in his attempt to end birthright citizenship, and imposed blanket tariffs on Canada and even more swingeing ones on Brazil. It sounds, though, as if she’s saying this is part of God’s plan. “I definitely believe in something other than ourselves,” she says. “I believe in a higher power. We’re in his image. So when you see someone, you’re looking at God.”It’s hard (but maybe just for an atheist like me) to square this trenchant, evangelical certainty with her politics, and those, generally, ofSaturday Night Live, the flagship US sketch show that doesn’t just take casual aim at religiosity, but makes the most complicated, long-form scriptural points about race, politics, capitalism and Trumpism. Respect for faith at absolutely no time gets in the way of a joke. The problem, Jones says, is not God, but the rightwing capture of Christianity. “He made all these animals, he made all these plants – you think he didn’t make gay men? A transgender man or woman?” Yes, of course. “How can you look at a platypus and not see a woman who is not as beautiful? Does that makes sense?” Not really, no. But even the intonation on “platypus” is mysteriously hilarious.Her grandmother was funny, her dad was funny, her brother was “kind of goofy funny”; if any of them had become comedians, she would have been out of a job, she says. “My mom wasn’t funny, but she was a very joyful woman.” Yet her childhood and indeed life have not been easy, as she detailed in her memoir, Leslie F*cking Jones, two years ago, which she prefaced: “Now I’m gonna be honest: some of the details might be vague because a bitch is 55 and she’s smoked a ton of weed. A lot of it is hazy, but I will give you the best recollection of it that I can.”Her dad was an army veteran who became an electrical engineer. He was also an alcoholic, who moved the family from Memphis to LA when he got a job at Stevie Wonder’s radio station, but then lost that job. Meanwhile, her mother had a stroke when Jones was very young, and both parents died within six months of each other, her dad in 2000, her mum in 2001, when Jones was in her early 30s. Jones missed both funerals because she was working to pay for them. Her brother died in 2009, when he was only 38, having beenfound unconscious in a park in Santa Barbara.Jones describes her young life as a series of glorious flameouts. Having a natural height advantage, she wanted to be a basketball player. “When I had my mind on it”, she says, “I was so good, but most of the time, I was inconsistent. But I could coach my ass off.” She got a basketball scholarship to Chapman University in California, then switched to Colorado State University, changed her major several times, started off doing computer science, dropped it, spent a term and some determination on being “not just law enforcement, a serial-killer finder”, but couldn’t shoot a gun. “I thought: ‘I can be Columbo. You don’t see him shooting a gun.’ And everybody was like: ‘Columbo totally had a gun. He was a cop.’ Then I was going to be a lawyer, because I love to talk. I wasnotgoing to be a lawyer when they handed me all those books and wanted me to read them.” She eventually settled on communications.View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t cognisant of how my behaviour was affecting others’ … Cameron Diaz, Jones and Jay Pharoah on SNL.Photograph: Dana Edelson/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesShe was, however, a natural comic, winning “funniest person on campus” in 1987. After that, “there was never a point of giving up, because comedy was my thing. When it didn’t pay the bills, I’d have to get a job and still be a comic. Because I’m a comic.”After the bereavements of the 00s, though, it was a different kind of comedy. Particularly after her brother died, “I was evil. Not evil, just angry. Performing, and angry. My routine was raw, it started getting to where I thought: ‘I don’t give a fuck whether you all laugh.’ I was destroying it. That’s when I started wearing a mohawk. People thought I did it for fashion – no, I just didn’t want to comb my hair. I was bare minimum getting out of bed.” She was taking drugs, she says, and she doesn’t mean weed, “I meandrugsdrugs. Speed.”Of all the rotten substances, I say, why speed? “Because I was having sex with a guy. I mean, listen, if we’re going to be honest, let’s be honest. He was hot, first of all. He was really good in bed. And he would do speed, so I did it because he would do it. I did not know how it was affecting me.”I come out of this unclear on a lot of the causal links, but with a pretty clear read on the mix of nihilism and life force that messed her up but propelled her along at the same time. “I was like: ‘Hey, everybody’s gone; if it’s time for me to die, then I’ll die.’ Then I saw this couple, who you could tell were on drugs, and I thought: ‘That’s going to be you if you don’t stop this foolishness.’ I busted up laughing. That was hilarious.”In 2013, Saturday Night Live held an unusual mid-season casting call to add at least one African American female comic to the cast, in response to the criticism bytwo cast members that the show was too white.Jones was hired as a writer, rather than a featured player, later appearing on screen the following May. At 47, she was the oldest new hire the show had ever made, but none of this was an easy fit. She was not political, she says. “I was just a regular person that thought the government did its thing, I ain’t got time to worry about what they doing, I’m going to work every day. If you guys raise the gas price, it doesn’t matter, because I’m still going to put $20 in my car. I had not a clue. And you know, I am the average American. We just think, ‘The government’s going to take care of that shit,’ and when people complain about the government, you think: ‘Oh, that’s just because you’re trying to get one over on the government.’ I might have been kind of a Trumper and didn’t know it.”View image in fullscreen‘Comedy was my thing’ ...on tour in 2023.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesFor a long time, she relentlessly harassed her main mark on the show, co-star Colin Jost, who she adored, wrestled and kind of manhandled in a way that really foregrounded her attachment to comedy so physical it’s almost mime-adjacent. “People don’t understand in that first year, maybe the first two seasons, I was really in love with Colin. I didn’t know how it was going to happen, whether we would just work late together and make out in his office and drink whiskey. I had all the visions. He was so cute, and funny, and he was justso white. Such a white nerd frat boy, that I was like: ‘I want him.’ Every time I would see him in the corridor, I’d shout: ‘I love you, Colin, you beautiful white stud!’” Nothing came of the crush, except that it became a recurring joke on the show. Jost got together with Scarlett Johansson in 2017, and they married in 2020.Last year, Jones told Drew Barrymore on her chatshow that she’d sworn off men for good, having grown “tired of raising boys”, and she picks up this theme with gusto. “People talk about society going through a ‘lonely man’ phase. It comes back to you all won’t do the work to become the person that you really can be. You’re waiting for me to solve your problems. You’re waiting for me to give you permission. Grow up – I’m not Build-A-Bear. Fuck that shit. Every time I get on the dating apps, I’ll be like: ‘I want to call the FBI. All of the serial killers are here.’”If she struggled to settle in at SNL, it wasn’t just because she wasn’t “woke” enough. She was also still grieving, and “I was not acting out, but I wasn’t well. I wasn’t cognisant of how my behaviour was affecting others. I remember Lorne [Michaels, producer and creator of SNL] texting me; I had said, ‘I’m so sorry how I’m acting,’ and he said, ‘I talk to my wife about a lot of things, and she says: ‘I am so glad you are talking about these things, but can you not talk about them to me? Can you find somebody else?’ That’s when SNL found me a therapist.”View image in fullscreen‘People were like, “Ignore it”, and I absolutely was not going to ignore it’ … Jones in Ghostbusters.Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/2016 CTMG, IncShe speaks more highly of therapy than anyone I’ve ever heard, but really for what it did for her comedy: “To be a good comic, you have to go deep into yourself, and have empathy and love yourself. It takes years to get fucked up; it’s gonna take years to clean up. So, you know when you go to a psychic?”Not really, but go on …“And you’re, like, ‘Bitch, you’re not going to tell me shit,’ and then by the 40th minute, she has broken you down? That was therapy. It made me a better person, made me a better friend, for sure, made me a better comic.”Three years into her SNL work, she got the role of Patty Tolan in what turned out to be an ill-fated reboot of Ghostbusters, which spawned a depressing wave of racist and misogynistic abuse on what was then Twitter. “The platform is the first thing I went after, because I was like: ‘Hey, I’m in your club; you’re supposed to have security. People are shooting at me. I shouldn’t have death threats on here.’ People were like, ‘Ignore it’, and I absolutely was not going to ignore it. I am so tired of this attitude, I am so tired of being the bigger person. No, meet these motherfuckers where they at and fight back. I am not a victim – you’re an asshole. It’s wild to me that we can build these glorious things, we can build an iPhone, and we still can’t beat racism.”She left SNL in 2019, and has since hosted the reboot of Supermarket Sweep, as well as an MTV awards ceremony, guest-hosted The Daily Show, voiced animated projects for film and TV and written her memoir. For her next move, she says, “I want to do a serious acting role, maybe play some kind of detective. I could find the serial killer or I couldbethe serial killer.”She dissolves into laughter, as it is not lost on her how often she talks about serial killers. In a way, there’s nothing more serious than her mission as a comic to get funnier the worse things get. “That’s my job, to bring some joy – you can’t cry all day. That’s what they want, they want you sad. They want you to see no light.”Leslie Jones ison tourin the US from 19 September to 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsLeslie JonesComedySaturday Night LiveTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

TikTok. My immediate reaction was a derogatory “oh no”. Aster has specialized ingut-twisting, unworldly horror, the kind of brain-searing, highly symbolic shocks that linger for weeks; I watched large stretches of his first two features, the demonic family parableHereditaryand Swedish solstice nightmareMidsommar– through my fingers. But in Eddington, he took on not one but two insidious bogeymen haunting our psyches: phones in movies and Covid.Nearly every character in Aster’s black satire of Covid-era upheaval possesses a device essential to modern life but often incompatible with cinematic storytelling. People trawl Instagram for updates on their crush, sell crafts on Etsy, watch videos on the Bill Gates microchip conspiracy, receive updates via Pop Crave. Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), the walking ego bruise of a protagonist in Aster’s vision of a small western town, announces his snap campaign for mayor against nemesis Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) on Facebook Live. In one of many blows to his tenuous dignity, he discovers message boards of pedophilia panic frequented by his wife, Louise (Emma Stone); he’s awakened from a depressed, drug-tinged sleep binge by frantic iMessages from his two hapless deputies.Eddington review - Ari Aster’s tedious Covid western masks drama and mutes his starsRead moreSuch verisimilitude to how most of the movie-going public live our lives – online, on screens, absorbing toxic dosages of information in our own private bubbles – usually spells disaster for a Hollywood project. Decades into the internet era, most movies and TV showsstill cannot get the internet right. Second screens are inherently un-cinematic, and the tighter the internet’s hyper-loops of viral attention coil, the harder it is to capture in cinematic projects that usually spans years from conception to audience. Something almost always feels off – the interface distracting, the tone askew, the liminality and speed incongruous with the story. I can probably count on two hands the films that have captured digital life in a way did not feel inaccurate, didactic or self-important, let alone seamlessly woven it into story –Eighth Grade,Sweat,Tár,Dìdi,Past Lives. I remember them because it’s still so rare; it is difficult to incorporate the mundane minutiae of screen life, tie oneself to time-stamped events, or tap into the propulsion of social media and succeed. It is just as tricky to burrow into an identifiable cultural moment without coming off as horrifically smug – both the climate emergency satireDon’t Look Upand billionaire-skeweringMountainheadwere so politically self-satisfied as to be nearly unbearable.Much has and will be said about Eddington’s portent precarious ambiguity, its mid-act tonal shift and descent into violence, about Aster’s divisive transformation from horror wunderkind to high-minded auteur. (I personally found the shift dubious and the second, should-be thrilling half a tedious slog, though in the hands of cinematographer Darius Khondji, everything looks fantastic.) But on this front – the task of handling real events on a real timeline with a real sense of the vanishing boundary between online and off – Eddington is a success. Aster’s film touches so many of the third rails of modern cinema – the internet, screenshots, Zoom, celebrities, political figures, bitcoin, 9/11 – and yet somehow survives.It does so by grounding this admittedly bloated satire of political and social turmoil in a hyper-specific moment in late May 2020. Whereas the winners in the digital culture film canon usually succeed by using the phone screen as a window into one character’s psyche – think the surveilling Instagram Live that opens Tár, or the Instagram scroll montage in Eighth Grade – Eddington aims for a specific cultural moment; phone lock screens keep time during a week deep in US lockdown, as frustration, anger, fear and outrage fester into outright chaos. My particular brand of brain worms means that I remember, in crystal-clear chronological order, the concerned Atlantic articles, to NBA cancellation, to Tom Hanks coronavirus diagnosis death spiral, to New York completely shutting down on 11 March, as well as the beginning of the Black Lives Matter protests after the murder of George Floyd on 25 May. What I chose not to remember, at least until watching a scene in which the sheriff refuses to wear a mask in a grocery store, prompting a showdown with frazzled employees, was the lost etiquette of 2020 – standing 6ft apart, silently judging those who wore their masks on their chins and those who policed, constantly assessing others’ propensity for a fight. Traversing fault lines everywhere.Tech-bro satire Mountainhead is an insufferable disappointmentRead moreEddington’s characters implode and tangle and lose their minds against this chillingly familiar backdrop – half-masked high-schoolers gathering in clumps outside, mask mandates handed down from the governor, virtual town halls. Some tumble downinternet rabbit holesinto delusion. (A too-broad, conspiratorial wellness guru, played by a too-intenseAustin Butler, makes an unfortunate IRL appearance in Eddington.) Others follow Instagram to the growing ranks of BLM protests across the nation. Neighbors doubt neighbors, and even the mention of Black lives exposes barely hidden racial tensions. Everywhere, at least for the film’s superior first half, there’s a feeling of trepidation – a familiar disorientation from the rapid blurring of right and wrong, a deluge of high-octane headlines and a potent confusion of sympathies that cannot be resolved.Aster is not always fair in his rendering, sometimes stacking its deck in favor of the needling center that is Sheriff Joe. But the internet is going to flatten everyone into statements and identities, and Eddington takes swipes in all directions. Tár is nimbler at skewering so-called “social justice warriors”, though at least Aster captures how some white leftist activists are primarily driven by ego, how much of the body politic is straight-up id. About a quarter of the way through the movie, Joe confronts an onslaught of national anger with his own projection; he dismisses concern from deputy Guy (a savvily cast Luke Grimes from Yellowstone) about the Black Lives Matter protesters (or “looters”) seen on TV with a blanket “that’s not a here problem”.Except, of course, it is. Five years on, we have only just reached some critical distance from the rupture that, judging by the lack of retrospectives this March, no one wants to remember. In Eddington, that upside-down, unreal reality begins to come into focus. There is no such thing as a “here problem”. Everything is an everywhere problem. At any point, the worst parts of the internet – which is to say, the worst parts of people – can descend on your town at terrifying speed. To see that environment rendered believably on screen is, ironically, the most thrilling part of it all.Eddington is out now in US cinemas and in the UK on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsAri AsterJoaquin PhoenixPedro PascalEmma StoneAustin ButlerComedy filmsWesternscommentShareReuse this content"

It was adapted byPeter Shafferfrom his stage-play about the two real-life composers, one a genius, one a nonentity (itself a theme-variation from Pushkin’s 1830 drama Mozart and Salieri), and directed by the great Czech film-maker Miloš Forman – his English-language masterpiece, or maybe his masterpiece full stop. Abraham was in his mid-40s when he played this Oscar-winning role; when I first saw it, I thought he would surely dominate the movies for decades to come, no doubt in classical adaptations in which he would be a superlative Iago or Faustus. For some reason, he never again got a starring role to match this, but he did have a terrific scene-stealer in season two of TV’s The White Lotus, in which he did not seem one day older than in this film.Abraham’s Antonio Salieri is the court composer of middling saccharine tunes in 18th-century Vienna whose leisured classes gobble his facile work like the chocolate treats he serves to people he wants to seduce. His career and terrible fate are recounted to a solemn priest by the aged Salieri in flashback; he was initially complacently content to regard his success as a reward from God for his bland religious conformity. But – in the film at least – Salieri is an envious, malicious mediocrity and hypocritical time-server, corrosively obsessed by the obvious superiority of the gloriously gifted but ill-mannered newcomerWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played here with many a nitrogen giggle by Tom Hulce. Mozart’s work instantly outpaces his and his genius causes Salieri to petulantly turn against God.Elizabeth Berridge seductively plays Mozart’s kittenishly devoted wife Constanze, or Stanzi; Roy Dotrice is Mozart’s sternly disapproving father; Jeffrey Jones plays the genial, tolerant Emperor Joseph II with elegant aplomb; and Mozart’s tearful maid Lori is played by the teenage Cynthia Nixon, later to find fame as Miranda in Sex and the City. Simon Callow played Mozart on stage for the play’s London premiere opposite Paul Scofield, and was perhaps chagrined to get only a small role here.The word “mesmeric” is overused, largely by virtue of being a notorious critics’ euphemism for arthouse films they secretly find dull – but Amadeus really is mesmeric (as well as deliciously exciting) and watching it again I went into exactly the trance I experienced the first time. Abraham’s Salieri, for all his loathing and rage, is Mozart’s sincerest admirer, electrified and dismayed by the brilliance which has effaced his own forgettable efforts. His face is a picture of elaborate courtesy and evil cunning as he pretends to be Mozart’s friend at court. With pure satanic connoisseurship, Salieri sees how it is not merely Mozart’s naivete but his genius which will be his downfall, how his superbly original work will gradually be rejected by simpering high society, how the resulting poverty and depression will erode his health.And so Salieri conceives his own diabolic masterpiece, greater and more audacious than any of his banal musical work: to exploit Mozart’s shock and guilt at the death of his father (which Salieri has divined from the plot of Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni) by arriving at his door like his father’s ghost in a sinister ball-mask, to commission a “requiem” for ready cash which Mozart can hardly refuse. This work will keep alive the psychic wound of despairing guilt which will drive Mozart to his death, music which Salieri plans to pass off as his own at Mozart’s own funeral; an exquisite flourish of dishonest piety.There are so many superb set-pieces in Amadeus that picking out any individually is almost impossible, but for me the best is Mozart’s first maladroit and nervous arrival in the emperor’s presence. They are surrounded by variously disapproving or admiring courtiers, all intensely aware of the political significance of a new German-speaking genius at the Habsburg court dominated by Italianate culture. Drama school students should study Abraham’s lizardly contempt which pours out of every frame. Salieri has composed a plonkingly uninspired “march of welcome” keyboard piece to be played when Mozart enters and the Emperor, a keen amateur musician, impulsively asks to play it himself as their young guest capers in. What was Salieri’s motive for this? Perhaps he wished to overawe Mozart with this extravagant gesture – or to establish his own primacy as composer at this vital moment. Or perhaps he wished, with machiavellian spite, to tempt Mozart into some brattish display of ingratitude with which he would disgrace himself.But he could hardly have expected the authentic un-political genius of Mozart’s response: having first insultingly demonstrated that he already knew this fatuous jingle by heart after a single hearing by playing it himself – he then improvises around it, conjuring what is to be a famous aria from The Marriage of Figaro, whose instant catchiness causes the courtiers to gather round. (The film uses Harrison Birtwistle’s original clever reworking of a genuine Salieri composition for this ingenious coup.) Poor Salieri’s face is a mask of rage and pain. His humiliation is almost complete.The finishing touch comes when at a masked ball (whose disguises are to inspire his hideous revenge) Mozart calls out for suggestions as to who he should pastiche at the keyboard and the incognito Salieri shouts out his own name – and Mozart grinningly thumps out a grotesque parody. Again: what is Salieri’s motive? Pure masochism, maybe. A need to find out the truth, to find out what Mozart really thinks of him and what everyone really thinks – what God thinks, perhaps. To confront the truth about his own lack of talent. There is a kind of integrity in it.Salieri’s final grim procession down the chaotic hallway of the psychiatric hospital, proclaiming his status as the patron saint of mediocrity is a chilling bravura moment. A treat for the big screen.Amadeus is in UK cinemas from 25 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsPeriod and historical filmsWolfgang Amadeus MozartMiloš FormanTheatrePeter ShafferreviewsShareReuse this content"

A genuine skin-crawling unease seeps out of the screen for every second of its running time, helped by a brooding, moaning electronic score by Steve Matthew Carter. This ineffably creepy, often unbearably tense and disquieting film has a little of early Christopher Nolan (the Nolan of Following and Memento), with hints of Lynch and Cronenberg in its hallucinatory episodes.Sloan’s co-writer and partner Ariella Mastroianni (reportedly a very distant relative of Marcello) stars as Frankie, a woman living on the edge of poverty, suffering from the neurogenerative disorders ataxia and dyschronometria. This means that she is disoriented and cannot accurately judge the passing of time, a condition she attempts to manage by listening to 30-minute tapes on an old-fashioned Sony Walkman, and by gazing in at the windows of total strangers. Her pinched, sharp, intelligent and discontented face dominates the screen; she radiates suppressed anguish and rage at everything that has happened and will happen to her, and at the idea that her condition means she will have to resign herself to an assisted living facility. The scene in which a harassed doctor puts this to her is itself a masterly set piece of grimness.Her husband apparently took his own life some time ago, an ambiguous event which recurs to her in vivid nightmares – was she somehow responsible? – which means Frankie is now legally obliged to let her young daughter be looked after by her glowering mother-in-law. At a therapy group for those who have lost loved ones to suicide, Frankie meets a mysteriously intense young woman (Renee Gagner) whom she remembers seeing in a window, and who puts to her a strange proposition; she says she is being abused and bullied by her aggressive cop brother (Jack Alberts) and needs to get away from their shared apartment, but he is keeping her car keys. If Frankie will break into the apartment and get them, and drive her car to the remote Jersey wetlands, she can have $3,000.But can Frankie do this without zoning out, or suffering one of her “flashforward” episodes where hours can suddenly go past in an instant? Gazer’s atmosphere of looming disaster and dreamlike oppression crowds in on you as the movie progresses; an intriguing, genuinely scary picture.Gazer is in UK cinemas from 25 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersScience fiction and fantasy filmsNew JerseyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Released in 1998, it totally reshaped Madonna’s career, embracing trip-hop, electronica and Britpop and essentially proving to an unfriendly public that she was one of pop’s great auteurs. It spawned one of her biggest singles – the haunting power ballad Frozen – and its title track is still a staple of radio and DJ playlists. In the past few years, many of contemporary and underground pop’s most significant names – including Caroline Polachek, Addison Rae, a.s.o., Shygirl and FKA twigs – have referenced Ray of Light, whether directly or indirectly. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make a case for the best or most significant Madonna album – she has at least five strong contenders – but if there’s a consensus pick, it’s Ray of Light.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Veronica ElectronicaWhich is why the announcement of Veronica Electronica, a full-length Ray of Light remix album, was met with such hysteria from fans earlier this year.Madonnahas spoken at length over the years about both Veronica the character – in true Madonna fashion, Veronica stems from a vaguely contradictory concept in which she is both a girl dancing at a club and, somehow, “medieval” – and the album, which she intended to release after Ray of Light but ended up shelving. For diehards, the promised record is something of a holy grail – never mind that this long-awaited release only contains two truly new songs, one of which, an old demo titled Gone Gone Gone, has been floating around on the internet for years.Even so, it’s hard to deny the simple pleasures that can be derived from hearing some all-time great Madonna remixes cut down to radio length and sequenced like the original Ray of Light. Drowned World/Substitute for Love sounds great taken out of its original glacial trip-hop context and turned into a DayGlo acid rager by BT and Sasha; the emotional ambiguities of the original song are replaced with warm positivity, and you can easily imagine the song soundtracking the final minutes of a raging house party as the sun begins to rise. Other tracks, such as Peter and Victor’s remix of Skin – the other new song here – take an opposite tack; they heighten Skin’s innate moodiness with a steely, exploratory techno beat punctuated by big, sharp breaks, turning the original track into something tweaky and unsettled.The trailer for Veronica Electronica – videoMadonna trying standup is no joke: she’s a natural comedian and genuine kook | Shaad D’SouzaRead moreAs is often the case with remix records, there are moments on Veronica Electronica that feel perfunctory – namely, the Club 69 remix of Nothing Really Matters. Perhaps any remix of the original song will always be held to a higher standard, given its status as one of the only out-and-out club tracks on Ray of Light, but unlike many of the remixes on the album, it feels as if there’s no relationship between the source material and the rework here, aside from Madonna’s vocal, which is looped to the point of irritation. It’s frustrating when people claim to “hate remixes”, as if you can put a blanket statement on an entire artform, but this kind of remix may make you sympathise with the sentiment.Fabien’s Good God mix of The Power of Good-Bye, on the other hand, represents all the potential of a curio project like this: a bizarrely minimal drum’n’bass rework of one of Madonna’s best ballads, it finds enormous power in the conflict between Fabien’s increasingly frenetic drums and Madonna’s serene, sorrowful vocal. It’s a surprisingly appropriate lead-in to Gone Gone Gone, a song so brilliantly weird that you really can understand why it was left off the original album. It is, essentially, a wistful breakup ballad set to a squelchy electro beat – a surreal tonal clash that hardly gels with Ray of Light’s placid waters, but which gives a surprising amount of insight into Madonna’s creative state at the time: here is one of the biggest stars in the world, in her creative prime, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. For that peek behind the curtain alone, Veronica Electronica is worth the price of admission.Explore more on these topicsMadonnaPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

In those days, his desolate wail had reach and range, and a deep melancholy. That tone was perfect for the subject of this bleak and blasted reflection on cocaine (Vol 4 was dedicated to “the great COKE-Cola company of Los Angeles”). Osbourne sounds like a man who has been wiped clean, both terrified of and in thrall to the drug: “The sun no longer sets me free / I feel the snowflakes freezing me.” At a time when cocaine was still considered a party drug, the fervour in Osbourne’s voice as he celebrates enslavement to it is deeply unsettling – it’s every bit as amoral and devout in its drug worship as Lou Reed’s Heroin.Black Sabbath – Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973)It’s pointless trying to extricate the sound of Osbourne himself from Sabbath as a band: at their peak, they were a single being with four heads, but a single musical will – they were perhaps the first truly monolithic-sounding band. So, inevitably, the better the band sound, the better Ozzy sounds. And, dear God, did the four of them ever combine better than on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, especially in the “dreams turn to nightmares” section, where Osbourne is singing at the absolute top of his range, while Tony Iommi goes to the very bottom of his to play a riff that even 52 years later sounds as though it has been dredged from some primordial sludge, rather than played on a guitar. And on the acoustic passages, Ozzy makes the perfect transition from rage to gentleness. Blinding stuff all round.Black Sabbath – Hole in the Sky (1975)Black Sabbath: Hole in the Sky – videoSabotage was probably the best Sabbath album, both profoundly heavy and strange and experimental. Hole in the Sky, though, was Sabbath at their most traditional and basic: a huge rolling boogie, powered by Bill Ward’s swinging drums, and topped by Iommi’s brutal riff. Near the top of his register, Osbourne – as on Snowblind – sounds possessed by an ecstatic emptiness, like a cult leader. Or, more accurately, a cult follower: he sounds delighted as he sings: “I’m looking through a hole in the sky / I’m seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie.” The contrast between Osbourne’s shriek and Iommi’s roil was a key component of the Sabbath sound – when Iommi was not soloing, his voice was often the only treble in the mix. Though you’re never going to Osbourne looking for vocal pyrotechnics, he had a vital role in the musicality of Black Sabbath. Listen to any doom band with a growling vocalist to hear the difference his voice makes.Black Sabbath – Symptom of the Universe (1975)One of the greatest of all heavy metal tracks – you can hear lightbulbs going off in the minds of a generation young musicians as it plays – has a reputation that rests largely on its riff, and its heaviness, but Osbourne brings it to life. Here, he is vicious, bordering on unhinged, his cries of “yeah” stretching out and getting ragged as his voice fades. Symptom of the Universe depends on its power for Osbourne’s commitment, because Geezer Butler’s lyric is – to be honest – a bit of a dog’s dinner. Osbourne makes it sound credible through sheer force of will. And in the outro – all acoustic guitars and shakers, and Latin rhythms – the desperation turns to grit, and Ozzy is suddenly a kind of soul singer. Told you this was a strange record.Black Sabbath – The Writ (1975)When it opens with that bubbling bassline, you might think you’re listening to an unheard Cure song. Then the guitars and vocals come in. But where The Writ goes is entirely unexpected. Over the course of nine minutes it manages to encompass not just proto-goth, but Zep-esque storming, with bluesy flourishes from Iommi: anthemic arena rock, grinding and faintly psychedelic passages that preface a large amount of US noise rock a decade later and harpsichord ballad sections. And wherever you throw him, Ozzy sounds completely at home. Sometimes his voice was a monotone, but that meant small gradations and changes in tone really registered. The measure of how central he was to the Sabbath sound was that the band had to overhaul it to incorporate his successor,Ronnie James Dio.Ozzy Osbourne – Crazy Train (1981)Banished from Sabbath, seemingly out of control and hardly likely to top anyone’s list of reliable people to ask for a household favour, Ozzy needed to begin his solo career with a bang, and find a way to be something other than Sabbath Part 2, but not as good. He found it in a young, blond California guitarist named Randy Rhoads, who had been playing around Los Angeles with Quiet Riot. Rhoads, who died in 1982, helped reinvent Ozzy – something his employer has always acknowledged. His tone was bright and shiny, a polar opposite to Iommi, and he played with flash and flair – this was the sound of rock guitar to come, and a clean break for Osbourne. For their first single together, Rhoads brought a killer riff, and Bob Daisley gave Ozzy a perfectly self-aware lyric to acknowledge his public perception: “I’m going off the rails on a crazy train.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

You don’t release a single about Britain’smost famous satanistif you want to let people know you’ve changed from your old, evil ways. The version on the album was clunky, which was perhaps why a live cut was selected for the single. Ozzy is fine, but no one is really pretending the hero of this recording is anyone other than Rhoads. After Don Airey’s portentous keyboard intro, it is Rhoads who provides the crashing riff – just evil enough, but no Sabbath parody – and he who provides the two guitar solos that helped cement his international reputation. Rhoads shredded, but played with melody – he didn’t just cram notes in, but made them do things other hard rock guitarists were not contemplating.Ozzy Osbourne – Diary of a Madman (1981)Arguably the standout moment of Rhoads’ career, it’s also a song that illustrates that long before experimental metal was a thing, the genre was far from being unimaginative. Diary of a Madman – and yes, the title is once again on the nose – was an extraordinary song of shifting moods, and Osbourne singing a lyric that is not in the least cartoonish but a darkly empathetic account of mental illness, of someone utterly trapped in their own despair. A technically better singer might have been tempted to overemote, but Ozzy keeps the mood, allowing the music – by the end there’s an operatic choir – to provide the drama, while he offers the feeling.Ozzy Osbourne, the people’s Prince of Darkness, took heavy metal into the lightRead moreOzzy Osbourne – Mr Tinkertrain (1991)Ozzy achieved huge commercial success through the 80s without touching the heights of the two albums with Rhoads. There were high points, but there was a fair amount of hair-metal awfulness, too. Ozzy himself long described 1986’s The Ultimate Sin as the worst record of his career, no matter it going double-platinum in the US. No More Tears, though, was the toughest and best album in a decade, guitarist Zakk Wylde and producers Duane Baron and John Purdell giving him a completely sympathetic backing. The album opener reconfigured Osbourne in villainy and horror, but of a much darker and less fantastical hue than in the devilish days: Mr Tinkertrain is written from the perspective of a predatory paedophile, a creepy lyric with a perfectly judged backing, that manages not to overstep the mark from horror into prurience.Ozzy Osbourne – No More Tears (1991)The seven-minute title track of No More Tears was commercial metal par excellence: epic and grand and stirring without becoming overbearing. And, because it was Ozzy, this one was sung from the perspective of a serial killer. This was another case of a band performance bringing out the best in Ozzy: he sounded stronger than he had in years, actually weird and dangerous rather than acting out a pantomime of weirdness and danger. His singing behind the beat in the pre-chorus, dragging out the syllables, is genuinely creepy. Even in the year of Nirvana’s Nevermind, an on-form Ozzy was still a metallic force to be reckoned with: No More Tears ended up going quadruple-platinum, his second most successful after his first solo record. It deserved its success; it was also his best record since that debut.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalBlack SabbathPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He called this figure Zebra, on account of its propensity for camouflage – hence the title ofMark Simpson’s new electric guitar concerto forSean Shibe, Zebra (or, 2-3-74: The Divine Invasion of Philip K Dick), the centrepiece of this polychromatic Prom from the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and conductorAnja Bihlmaier.It’s a conventional concerto in some ways: in three movements, fast, slow, fast. But, although the guitar carries the melodic line most of the time, it doesn’t hog the limelight: no Brian May on the palace roof posturing here. Instead, chameleon-like, it slips in and out of camouflage, blending with the orchestra then standing apart, and creating new sonorities. Guitar and muted trumpets wah-wah together; high pinprick notes merge into high violin glitter; in moments of stillness, the orchestra, augmented by synth and organ, traces an aura around the guitar that sounds like the result of a reverb pedal until this halo asserts an eerie presence of its own.Everything tumbles towards a big extravagant ending, with an AI voice quoting Dick’s words joining the melee. This voice didn’t come across everywhere in the hall but was crystal-clear listening back on BBC Sounds; generally, in fact, the precise balance of the broadcast demystifies some of the sonic intrigue the piece created in the hall.Shibe’s exuberant virtuosity is a constant, though, as is the vibrancy of Simpson’s music. Shibe’s encore was a heat-hazy version of Messiaen’s choral piece O Magnum Mysterium: perhaps more of his music should be co-opted for electric guitar.Zebra came in between Strauss’s Death and Transfiguration, initially understated but reaching a glowing apotheosis, and a fellow pharmaceutically inspired work, Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique. The orchestra responded ever more colourfully to Bihlmaier’s storytelling conducting, with jumpscares in the March and, in the finale, grotesque-sounding woodwinds leading a tightly rhythmic witches’ dance as sinister bells tolled from the gallery.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Set in an isolated Dartmoor village, it was commended by Margaret Atwood as “a Scarlet Letter for our times” and won the Betty Trask prize. His follow-up, Groundwater, opens in similar style, with its protagonists fleeing a city in favour of rural seclusion, but this time his story is rooted in a more prosaic and recognisable present.An unexpected inheritance has spurred John and Liz to trade in their rented flat in London for a remote house by a lake. After years of trying unsuccessfully for a baby, their relationship strained, both hope that the change will shift something inside them. Meanwhile, though most of their furniture is yet to arrive, they must prepare the house for Liz’s sister Monica and her family, who have invited themselves to stay.From the opening pages McMullan stokes an unambiguous sense of foreboding. It is August and the weather is stifling. Walking by the lake John encounters a baby deer, struggling to stand on an injured leg. The next day after breakfast, Monica’s children find the fawn dead on the doorstep. A stranger claiming to be a local warden materialises on their land and invites himself to stay. No one thinks to check his claims. When three students from a local campsite also contrive to inveigle themselves into the group, something terrible, it seems, must happen.Ominousness is piled upon unease and yet McMullan meets his own challenge only with the humdrumReading Groundwater, I was repeatedly reminded of Chekhov’s famous exhortation that one must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it. The warden, Jim Sweet, tells John and Liz about the caves deep below the surface of the lake, miles and miles of unmapped tunnels snaking through the limestone. Liz is haunted by the memory of a dog she watched dying in the hallway outside their London flat. She stares at the walls of trees around the lake and thinks of the California wildfires on the news: “All that burning, a thousand things dying.”Ominousness is piled upon unease and yet McMullan meets his own challenge only with the humdrum. Terrors are proved baseless. Confrontations blaze briefly and fizzle out. Unable to bring themselves to say what they are really thinking, the adults conduct long and often mundane conversations about inconsequentialities, while the twin interior monologue that shifts often confusingly between John and Liz adds little insight or forward propulsion to the narrative. Insufficiently differentiated, their voices blur: though we spend much of the novel inside their heads, their true selves remain opaque, unformed, out of reach not only of themselves but of the reader.Liz, a writer, is working on a scheme to monitor the black rhinos in a national park in Kenya, but “she hadn’t been to the national park herself … everyone was remote”. The same sense of remoteness, of a reality half-understood but never experienced, pervades these pages. Meanwhile a second intercut narrative, in which dream-like versions of John and Liz draw items including a crystal decanter, a crutch and a child’s hobby horse from the waters of the lake, adds a baffling dollop of mysticism to proceedings.As I read on, my thoughts kept returning to another novel set by a lake, Sarah Moss’sSummerwater, and not only because of the powerful echo in the title. Like Groundwater, Summerwater, told over a single rain-lashed day in a lochside holiday park in Scotland, is preoccupied with the quotidian, exploring through its 12 narrators the fissures and fractures that open in relationships, the certainties brandished like weapons against fear and vulnerability, the joys, yes, but also the small, terrible failures of courage and understanding.Why, then, does Moss’s novel triumphantly succeed and McMullan’s never take flight? It helps that Summerwater’s simmering tension finally explodes into catastrophe, while Groundwater swerves perplexingly away from climax and sputters out. But it is Moss’s astonishing acuity, her uncanny ability to see inside the human heart, that lends her work such power. It is much, much harder than she makes it look to draw readers deeply into the small dramas of small lives, harder still to find the universal in the particular, to draw fresh and meaningful patterns between people and landscape, between age-old cycles of existence and the insistent demands of the here and now. Moss manages it with flourishes of sly humour that both leavens and intensifies the horror to come.McMullan’s novel would definitely have profited from a few more laughs. Instead, in striving for an elusive profundity, he reminds us how strikingly difficult it is to spin gold from straw, and how very rare and precious are those Rumpelstiltskin writers who show us how it’s done.Groundwater by Thomas McMullan is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

It acquired the name thanks to the pioneering efforts of three Dutch scientists – Marie Beatrice Schol-Schwarz, Christine Buisman and Johanna Westerdijk – who identified the beetle-transported fungus that causes it in the 1920s.Nor is the so-called “English elm” (Ulmus minor) really English, inasmuch as it is thought to have been transferred here from Italy, so Reform UK party enthusiasts should probably agitate to repatriate all such specimens. More confidently thought native to these isles is the wych elm (from the Old English for “supple”) or Scots elm, which has long been thought to have healing and protective qualities.Our scholarly guide to this noble plant, Mandy Haggith, delves enthusiastically into such lore. The 17th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper said that elm was connected to the planet Saturn and that its leaves could fix broken bones. Modern “healers” promise that drinking a decoction of elm bark can purge phlegm and stop diarrhoea. Haggith cites a present-day “Massachusetts-based herbalist and druid” who claims that slippery elm milk is good for insomnia.It would be unkind to call this sort of thing merely barking. The author insists that “a western scientific worldview” (in other words, a scientific worldview, shared by scientists in China and India) “is absolutely not the only way forests can be thought about”, which is fair enough. But the fake cures of the “wellness” industry are not without their own ecological downsides: as Haggith writes later, fashionable pseudo-remedies gone viral on TikTok or whatever can inspire the stripping of bark from healthy trees at injurious scale.Happily, elmwood was not only the preserve of quacks; it was also a sought-after material in shipbuilding (most of the hull of the fast clipper Cutty Sark was made of rock elm), and long before that for making spears and bows: an iron age Celtic tribe was known as “the ones who vanquish by the elm” (Lemovices). Medieval London, Bristol and other cities had running water delivered by mains pipes of elm. And elm is also the source of a famous insult: when the great Samuel Johnson claimed that there was no Gaelic literature, a poet responded with the Gaelic for “your head is made entirely of elm, especially your tongue and your gums”.Luckily, although Dutch elm disease has killed hundreds of millions of trees since the early 20th century, the species is not lost, or even on the brink of extinction. Brighton, Haggith sees, is managing the blight well through city-wide surveillance and timely surgery. And the fossil record suggests that elms have previously suffered waves of pandemic disease before bouncing back. There will be time for more poetic mentions of elms of the kind the author rather exhaustively collects towards the end. (“Robert Frost was a big fan of elm trees …”)But the greater part of this book’s devotion, and its delight, is reserved for living specimens in their habitats. Two rows of elms, Haggith notes, can form a “corridor for wildlife, dog walkers and feral children”, or “a church-like nave, an arch-shaped cloister that draws the eye” towards a monastery in Beauly. A cheerfully self-described “tree-hugger”, she is inspired to her best writing by close observation of the trees themselves. On an elm growing horizontally out of the rock near a Scottish loch: “I stand beneath it, neck craned in awe, looking up into the lush green profusion of its living community. It is winter, so all this greenery isn’t the tree’s own leaves, but photosynthesising life using it as a climbing frame”.

Could video games be the ultimate relationship tool?Keith StuartWed 23 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 10.03 EDTShareLast week, Radio 4’sWoman’s Hourtalked about the role of women in the video games industry. It featured interviews with gaming insiders, from esports presenterFrankie Wardto members of the inclusive online communityBlack Girl Gamers. It was wonderful to hear so many disparate, expert views on games culture being given so much time on the show.One of my favourite moments was when presenter Nuala McGovern read out some listener responses to the question: why do you play video games? “I don’t think there’s enough recognition of gaming as an activity for couples,” one replied. “My husband and I bonded over our shared love of gaming. Our honeymoon was playing Borderlands 2 while we saved for a flat deposit, and now, with a young child, we explore stories, we visit new worlds, we solve mysteries … There is an underappreciated romance to gaming – we communicate, encourage, collaborate and celebrate together. It’s a joy.”I found this very moving because I know many friends who met their partners through playing games, and who see the act of gaming together as a much more textured and immersive experience than wallowing in front of a TV series. I’ve lost count of the number of couples who’ve told me they especially enjoyed playing survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill together – even though they are strictly single-player experiences. Sharing scary games is a way of lessening the terror while exploring an abandoned orphanage or science lab. It introduces an element of physicality – as does taking it in turns to use the joypad, swapping it from hand to hand, like an intimate gift.View image in fullscreenAn elaborate dating site … Final Fantasy XIV.Playing a video game with someone you’re falling in love with, meanwhile, gives you a new perspective on who they are and what they can do. It’s helpful to know your partner is brilliant at solving spatial puzzles, or that they’re determined and resourceful when faced with tricky tasks. If nothing else, it’s a hint at exactly how it’s going to go when you end up assembling an Ikea bookshelf together. Recently, I wrote aboutthe use of video games in child therapy, and one of the counsellors I spoke to, Ellie Finch, is looking at doing couples therapy in Minecraft because it’s often a space where all the people in the relationship feel comfortable. I suspect that challenging clients to build a simple house together will tell her more about their interpersonal dynamic than two hours of talking.There is a lot of romance in experiencing new places together, getting lost and combining skills to help each other out of calamities. There is sweetness in a shared Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing escapade; there is intellectual challenge in quiet evenings with Blue Prince or Split Fiction. For too long, gaming was seen as the preserve of lonely young men, a hobby too guarded and insular for lovers; now everyone can play and the digital world is opening up. Lots of people are now effectively using online games such as Final Fantasy XIV and GTA Online as highly elaborate dating sites, sometimesmeeting and forming relationships in real life. Games remove many barriers – the expense of going out, the vulnerability of meeting strangers – they are test spaces for the romance-curious.I hope that as this generation of gamers age, they will keep playing together. I hope they show their grandchildren the levels they designed in Super Mario Maker, or the beautiful apartment they constructed in The Sims – the digital photo albums of entire lifetimes together.Gameshave so much to tell us about each other, if we are open to play and being playful.What to playView image in fullscreenTiny fun … Neogeo Super Pocket.Photograph: Blaze EntertainmentLast year I reviewed the Super Pocket from Blaze Entertainment, a funky little handheld capable of playing a range of cartridge-based retro games. Now there’s a newSuper Pocket Neogeo edition, inspired by the cult 1990 console by the Japanese manufacturer SNK, in the familiar black and gold colouring. It comes loaded with 14 Neogeo titles and it’s a really intriguing selection, from bona fide classics such as side-scroller Metal Slug X and formative fighting game Fatal Fury. There are lesser known gems, too, including luscious beat-’em-ups Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy and Mutation Nation. The Super Pocket will also run all the other carts designed for Blaze’s Evercade consoles, opening a whole galaxy of well-emulated retro delicacies.Available on:Super Pocket consoleEstimated playtime:countless nostalgic hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenNothing new under the sun … Shadow of the Colossus.Photograph: Sony Computer EntertainmentVGC hasa translation of a recent Japanese interviewwith Ico and Shadow of the Colossus designer Fumito Ueda, who claimed that “the age ofgame mechanicsis over”. His assertion was that developers were no longer inventing new mechanics and were focusing on existing design techniques as well as the look and feel of games. It’s a provocative assertion, perhaps gaming’s equivalent of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man – but I hope he’s wrong.Valve has been removingadult gamesfrom Steam, reportedly as a result ofpressure from credit card companies. An Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout has claimed responsibility – the organisation recently published an open letter to payment processors such as PayPal and Mastercard claiming that games available on the digital store featured child abuse and incest. Vice has gatheredreactions from Steam customers.Somehow, I’m not surprised by the discovery thatNintendo employeesrarely leave the company. Games site GoNintendo hasshared some employment data from the companyshowing that staff in Japan stay with the company for 14.4 years on average, with people at offices elsewhere staying between eight and a half and 10 years. It’s nice to know that, amid the crisis in the industry, with thousands of staff being laid off, at least one major company apparently knows how to nurture its workforce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rosamund Pike’s stage CV already has plenty of highs, fromHitchcock BlondetoHedda Gabler, but her performance in Miller’s follow-up play has been keenly anticipated, given that it reunites some of the team that made Prima Facie a smash hit.This is an almost deliberate counterpoint to Prima Facie, in which a defence lawyer, expert at playing the system to demolish rape charges against her clients, is undone by her own experience of sexual assault. Miller wanted to highlight how poorly the law serves victims, and Inter Alia presents the same issue from the flipside with a female judge, determined to make the system more just, whose world is upended by an accusation close to home.Jessica Parks (Pike) is the kind of multi-skilled woman you just know the legal system needs more of. She brings humanity and compassion to her courtroom, employing her soft skills to protect vulnerable witnesses while cutting down cocky male counsel with a tone that can “cut through tendons and bone”. But she’s not just a crown court judge, she’s also an expert juggler, in the way that high-achieving women so often need to be. Her career exists “inter alia” – as Miller puts it, in the cracks of everyone else’s lives.View image in fullscreenHumanity and compassion … Jasper Talbot, Jamie Glover and Rosamund Pike in Inter Alia, designed by Miriam Buether.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAll the hallmarks ofJustin Martin’s pulsating direction are here, from the onstage guitar and drums ratcheting up the tension to Pike’s physical, occasionally anarchic performance. She is in constant motion, wearing many different outfits – karaoke queen, sexy wife, Marigold-clad dishwasher and laundrywoman – and Miriam Buether’s set combines with Natasha Chivers’ lighting to capture the dissolution of boundaries between the courtroom and home.“You live like you work, everything done at speed,” a friend tells Jessica: it may sound like a badge of honour, but it’s also an indictment of the society that requires it of her. The term “emotional labour” is never used but is certainly present: while Jessica prepares a dinner party for 16, her husband Michael’s only responsibility is the cheese. He has it delivered.This is not a solo show: Jamie Glover provides the marital tension as Michael, who has been beaten by his wife to both KC and the bench. Harry, their 18-year-old son, mooches about almost silently, alternating, in Jasper Talbot’s portrayal, between sensitive, sulky and comically drunk. But what begin as peripheral figures – to be organised, loved and cared for – are given vital voices of their own as the narrative progresses.View image in fullscreenSensitive and sulky … Jasper Talbot with Rosamund Pike in Inter Alia.Photograph: Manuel HarlanJessica remains the moral and emotional centre: her tragedy unfolds like that of an Ibsen protagonist failed by those around them. As a mother she has done the best she can, both to shield her child from bullies and to raise him true to her feminist beliefs (there’s a very funny scene where they have the porn talk). But she can’t protect him from social media, or peer pressure or, in the end, himself.As a lawyer turned playwright, Miller’s work has an ingrained advocacy – for years, she has used it to argue for social and legal justice. And one of the rare objections to Prima Facie’s script – the way its didactic dialogue impinged on the drama – could be upheld here. Determined to give every issue and angle a fair hearing, Inter Alia sheds its nimbleness and wit as it grapples with the serious stuff in its later stages, meaning the pace slows even as the confrontations become more heightened.As the set darkens and Jessica becomes literally lost in the woods, there’s a sense that we’re all groping, a little blindly, towards an ending, even Pike. But the production remains a searing commentary on the justice system and a purposefully uncomfortable insight into contemporary parenting. Prima Facie remains as relevant as it was three years ago – a UK tour, with a returning Comer, has beenannounced for 2026– and this is an ideal companion piece.At theLyttelton theatre, National Theatre, London, until 13 September.In cinemasfrom 4 September.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreRosamund PikeMiriam BuetherreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yaël Farber’s production animates the psychological terror that King Leontes (Bertie Carvel) wreaks on his pregnant wife Hermione (Madeline Appiah), out of his unfounded suspicion that she has been unfaithful with his old friend, Polixenes (John Light). Carvel makes a convincingly deluded barefoot king, regarding himself as the vulnerable cuckold. His suspicion turns to solid belief to unleash punishment on Hermione.In its first three sombre acts, the drama plays out as a thriller, with expressionist movement and lighting. A gigantic orb of a full moon hangs over the stage (Soutra Gilmour’s design is spare and striking as a whole), turning cool white or roiling red to reflect the action.View image in fullscreenPsychological horror … Madeline Appiah as Hermione in The Winter’s Tale.Photograph: Marc BrennerFarber recently staged two Shakespeare tragedies at the Almeida: aMacbethfour years ago which was full of slow and meditative dread, andan arresting King Learlast year. This feels like a third tragedy in some ways, lugubrious in mood and with a monochrome aesthetic in the first, darker half.But there is a fuzziness to the storytelling. This modern-dress production is all smoke and shadows, unmoored from a specific time or place, so it is harder to contextualise its themes. More specifically, some scenes are vague, such as Antigonus’s pursuit by a bear which is dealt with symbolically – a static figure takes off the mask to reveal herself as Hermione. It is beautiful but unclear.Tim Lutkin’s lighting design turns warm in the second half, with lovely live music (lone musicians waver around the set). The usually awkward change of mood, from dark to light, works smoothly here: the play glides into a second half with Autolycus (Trevor Fox) its light-fingered highlight.But Farber seems at pains to add her own mythical layers: the figure of Time (also Fox) speak a choral ode from Brecht’s The Antigone of Sophocles instead of the Oracle of Apollo, and this is opaque in its meaning. The feast in Bohemia is inspired by the ancient Greek ritual of the Eleusinian Mysteries, so the programme explains, adding that, for Farber, Hermione and Perdita “wear the mask of Demeter and Persephone”. An interesting idea on the page, it is gnomic on stage.View image in fullscreenConvincingly deluded … Bertie Carvel, right, as Leontes with Richard Sutton as Jailer.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere is more clarity around female strength and resistance, to counter Leontes’ tyranny. Aïcha Kossoko, playing noblewoman Paulina, is a powerful presence while Appiah, as Hermione, exudes pained dignity and courage alongside her bewilderment. When she testifies in court, she is a bereft mother with lactating patches on her dress after her newborn baby has been taken from her. It is an abject scene.The production never stops looking beautiful, and bustles with a wealth of original concepts, but sometimes resembles a puzzling procession. It remains an unsolved problem play, the first half – shaped so artfully as a tragedy of explosive and irrational male rage – still not quite wedded to its second.At theRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 30 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyThe Winter's TaleYaël FarberSoutra GilmourBertie CarvelWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

Donizetti’s bel canto bloodbath has lost none of its power to intrigue as well as entertain in the 190 years since its Naples premiere. In Cecilia Stinton’s thoughtful new staging the heroine is a charmer, a little wacky perhaps, prone to the odd hallucination maybe, but in different circumstances you imagine she’d be fun to be around. It’s also clear from the sexual violence played out behind the backs of her testosterone-fuelled lover and brother as they sing a rollicking duet on the forestage that when this Lucia kills it will be in self-defence.Opera Holland Park is ideally placed to host a traditional production. Neil Irish’s sets, subtly lit by Tim van ’t Hof, seem to grow out of the Jacobean walls of Holland House. The action is partly set inside a crumbling mansion, here pointedly in need of repair. The rest occurs in and around the lichen-encrusted cemetery where the soil is still fresh on the grave of Lucia’s mother. With the orchestra located in the middle of the action, Stinton uses a potentially tricksy space well, though the busy chorus of parlour maids, gardeners and wedding guests could be more imaginatively blocked at times, and the 19th-century Scottish dad dancing was perhaps a step too far.Michael Papadopoulos’ way with Donizetti’s tuneful score is another asset. There’s real care and attention in the way he shapes phrases and encourages the City of London Sinfonia to breathe in time with the singers. The 35 players produce a satisfyingly weighty sound, especially in the lively party scenes and the turbulence of the Act III storm. The OHP chorus is similarly rock-solid.View image in fullscreenHeft and ping … Morgan Pearse as Lord Enrico Ashton.Photograph: Ali WrightLeading a fine cast is Jennifer France, a bright, flexible soprano whose unforced warmth wins the audience’s sympathy from the outset. Playful, even cheeky at first, her descent into the grave – quite literally – where she plasters her blood-stained wedding dress with earth, is both consistent and credible. Her hushed singing is a delight, her coloratura secure. Only the high F feels a stretch, and then only just.Her Edgardo is Portuguese tenorJosé de Eça. His is a thoroughly Italianate sound, rich and ringing, though a couple of softer high notes fell slightly flat. The final death scene is, for once, convincing. Australian baritone Morgan Pearse sings Lucia’s hard-hearted brother Enrico with impressive heft and plenty of ping to the voice.Among the supporting roles, Blaise Malaba is a genially resonant Raimondo and Joseph Buckmaster a sprightly toned Arturo. A shout out too for stylish mezzo Charlotte Badham who made an indelible mark as Lucia’s companion Alisa. Their touching, delicately sculpted relationship was one of the production’s unexpected pleasures.Until 1 August.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Producers spoke to contestants to ascertain whether they wanted the programme to be shown.The show will be broadcast as normal onBBCOne and BBC iPlayer from 6 August. However, the editing of the programme will be looked at again to examine the prominence of the pair.“MasterChef is an amazing competition which is life-changing for the amateur chefs taking part,” a BBC spokesperson said. “The focus of it has always been their skill and their journey.“This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.“However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series.”BBC executives have been agonising over what to do with the series for weeks. Filming was all but complete when allegations over Wallace’s behaviour emerged at the end of last year. Torode appears throughout and Wallace appears in all episodes apart from the final.Earlier this month, Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report, commissioned by MasterChef’s producer, Banijay, substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact.Wallace has said he was “deeply sorry for any distress caused” and he had “never set out to harm or humiliate”, but has said the report had cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.Torode was also dropped after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over theuse of racist language, which he believes never happened.No decision has been made on the celebrity and Christmas editions of the show, which have already been filmed and feature Torode. The BBC said it would announce a decision on those later this year.“Most importantly MasterChef is a brilliant, much-loved programme which is bigger than any one individual,” the BBC said. “There are many talented, dedicated and hard-working people who make the show what it is. It will continue to flourish on the BBC and we look forward to it returning stronger than ever in the future.”MasterChef is hugely important for the BBC, featuring in its listings for the majority of the year. It has also invested in the show recently, with its move to state-of-the-art studios in Birmingham. The show is also a major cash cow for Banijay, with scores of versions of the show running around the world.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefBBCTelevisionFood TVGregg WallacenewsShareReuse this content"

I called on an old trick – the mixtape. Having been a music nerd all my life, I decided I could use some help from Miles Davis, Cinematic Orchestra, Stereolab and more to woo her. Making the perfect mixtape is an art form. You have to start strong, but you don’t want to cram all the best bits into the first 10 minutes. I needed to show myself as a man of the world – some more obscure choices, a bit of jazz. I sequenced them so they all flowed together nicely, and all this was done in an era where I had to rip the tracks from CDs. And in a final touch, I had to put in a track from a band that were playing very shortly – in this case, The Go! Team! – so I could invite her to the gig.View image in fullscreenJohn Regan’s mix tape.Photograph: Guardian CommunityAfter spending days shuffling the order, I called the mix “M” after her first name. I’m glad to say it worked. We went to the Go! Team gig the following week, and there followed an M2, M3, M4 and many many more. The CD still exists, and amazingly, still plays.

But in my grandmother’s home there was an old tape player with a built-in radio and one day, I discovered a blank cassette. I began recording the Top 40 chart shows, carefully pressing stop every time the presenter spoke or an ad played. Suddenly, I had access to music on repeat, something I’d never had before – and it transformed my world. I remember my tape included Coolio – Gangsta’s Paradise (I was so struck by the storytelling in a rap tune); Stereophonics – Local Boy in the Photograph (being from Cardiff, discovering a band from Wales made it feel closer to home); and Beastie Boys – Intergalactic (I remember rewinding this endlessly, trying to memorise every line).Years later, I entered the music industry professionally. That early habit of curating, editing, and deeply listening became the foundation of my career. What started as a quiet act of rebellion turned into a lifelong vocation and a powerful reminder that music always finds a way to reach you, even when it’s not allowed.SofiaIlyas, London‘My sister never kept anything, except this tape’View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLisa Bonomini’s mix tape track list.In 1995 I lived on the Isle of Mull. One evening, feeling lonely, I compiled a compilation tape on my portable CD player – a TDK D90– for my sister’s 30th birthday. We were always making them with our friends in those days, and many are now sadly lost in the mists of time. The excitement of finding a new band and recording them for your mates to enjoy was a uniquely youthful phenomenon.This tape consisted of a mix of indie classics and was labeled Side A: “Do you remember kipper ties?” and Side B “Did you wear one?” as a sarcastic ode to my very old 30-year-old sister (I was a mere 24). The cut and paste cover features the boys from The Sweeney and George and Mildred. My sister never kept anything, she was a minimalist and constantly threw away unwanted stuff and clutter. She died in 2020, and it broke my heart to find that of all things, she had kept this silly tape made for her by her little sis. I will keep it for ever.Lisa Bonomini, Ludlow, Shropshire‘The musical education will stay with me’I was privileged in the early 90s to stumble across a now legendary Edinburgh club called Pure. The then DJ Twitch, now JD Twitch, Keith McIvor, of Optimo fame, was one of the DJs. He lived in Glasgow like me and I was soon giving him regular lifts to and from the club. He made me a mix tape for the car called the “Maggie mix”.Now long lost, it soundtracked those journeys. It was a wonderful time and life changing for me and a lot of other people hearing the latest dance music in a small and very close knit community of regulars. Sadly, as many people will know,Keith was recently diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. Many have expressed how much his music has meant to their lives, I was one of the very lucky ones to hear him early in his career, and the musical education I received at Pure will stay with me for ever.Maggie, Glasgow‘My favourite mix ever’View image in fullscreenCarla Dempsey’s mix tape.Photograph: Guardian CommunityAbout a month after meeting Joe and being absolutely smitten, my birthday arrived. Joe made me a mixtape. I had heard his legendary mixtapes before, with snippets of songs or spoken word in between whole songs that seemed to move seamlessly as if they had been written to be played together. But my birthday mixtape, “Lots of Racket- Obscure, Obnoxious, Scratchy Toons”, sealed the deal for me – not only were our musical tastes compatible, but he had been listening to me! Some really important songs I had mentioned (The Flying Lizards) were there, along with what would become fast favourites from lots of genres and eras.It was, and is, my favourite mix ever. Whenever I hear a song from that mix out in the wild, I immediately start the next song or snippet in my head when it ends. And Joe? He lasted too. We’ve been together since that early June of 1992, have three children, and probably a hundred more fantastic mixtapes.Carla Dempsey, Peterborough, Canada‘It was named after the longsuffering nextdoor neighbour’View image in fullscreenFrancois Pittion in 1988.Photograph: Guardian CommunityMy grandmother fell ill and moved in with my parents, so I as a fresher at University College Dublin moved into her house, whereupon we had a party that lasted three years. The main soundtrack to that was a mixtape I made named “sober Dan”, after the longsuffering nextdoor neighbour. The tape was cobbled together from various radio programmes, mainly a pirate indie station in Dublin, Dave Fanning on 2FM and of course Peel. The tracks were quite varied, including: Livin’ On – 13th Floor Elevators; Take the Skinheads Bowling – Camper van Beethoven; Orange and Red – Guernica; Emotional Slaughter – Black Uhuru; TV Party – Black Flag; Hey! Little Child – Stars Of Heaven; Try a Little Sunshine – The Factory.I have spent the last 40 years tracking these down on vinyl. My latest find was the hard to get cover of Hey! Little Child (this version was from a live LP recorded in the wonderful Underground, played by the brilliant Stars of Heaven). I’m just left with Try a Little Sunshine by The Factory, which is extremely rare and expensive. As for what our neighbour Dan thought of our student antics? At my grandmother’s funeral, my mother asked him if we were a right nuisance, to which he replied, “lovely neighbours, they always mowed my lawn”. Thank you Dan, and my mixtape will always be in memory of you.Francois Pittion, Dublin Ireland‘Pure 90s gold’View image in fullscreenSarah’s 90s mix tape.Photograph: Guardian CommunityMix tapes were a whole love language, between crushes and friends. Playlists can’t really compare to having something tangible and hand-decorated that had to be painstakingly made. I still have many of mine, and a matching trove of old Walkmans that rode the Greyhound and Amtrak with me up and down the state and are ready to serve me again if ever called upon.For this mix tape, I have to give credit where credit is due. It was made by a high school boyfriend. As you can see (above), it’s stacked full of pure 90s gold. With this one tape he set me up very well for my college years and a lifetime of listening.Sarah, CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsMusicTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the play has found fresh relevance todayFraser GraceWed 23 Jul 2025 05.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareIam standing outside the hallowed walls of the Market theatre, Newtown, Johannesburg. This is the place where Athol Fugard – surely the greatest of South African playwrights and one of my all-time theatre heroes – staged plays including Hello and Goodbye and The Island. The latter was co-written with fellow theatre greats, actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona. Now it’s the turn of a little-known English writerand his playBreakfast With Mugabe. This is, as they say, one of the days of my life.In 2001 my script felt like urgent work. Elections loomed in Zimbabwe, andRobert Mugabewas reportedly unleashing terrible violence in his bid to cling to power. To many in the UK “President Bob” had long been a monster. But what, I wondered, created the monster?The play finds Mugabe holed-up in State House, pursued by the bitter spirit of a long-dead comrade. Denied help by traditional healers, the former liberation leader reluctantly turns to a white psychiatrist. Cue the unravelling of history.View image in fullscreenColonial culpability … the Market theatre in Johannesburg.Photograph: Fraser GraceInterest in Breakfast With Mugabe was immediate, and persistent. The late (and much missed) Antony Sher directed a Royal Shakespeare Company production that travelled from Stratford in 2005 via Soho theatre to the West End in 2006. An audio version flourished on BBC Radio 3 and the World Service; a second UK production followed, while in the US a production by Two Planks & A Passion (directed by David Shookhoff) clocked up 100 performances on New York’s 42nd Street. Another production was staged in Berkeley.Since then, Mugabe has died and Zimbabwe bumps along in comparative peace. So a new production – especially inSouth Africa– came as a surprise.According to Greg Homann, the idea blossomed slowly. In 2022, Greg – whose theatre work spans the US, UK and SouthAfrica– was associate artist at the Midlands Arts Centre in Birmingham. Then his “dream job” became a reality. Returning to South Africa as artistic director of the Market theatre, one of the first artists he encountered was a young director fast building a reputation as an innovative theatre-maker. Calvin Ratladi had, sometime in 2016, chanced on a copy of Breakfast With Mugabe. The play stuck with him; would the Market produce it?Sadly, that plan stalled. Then, earlier this year, Ratladi was named Standard Bank’s young artist of the year for theatre. This award is quite a gong (its first winner was Richard E Grant). It brings with it support for a creative project – and an opportunity was glimpsed. If Ratladi still held a torch for his Mugabe project, the Market theatre would host. Remarkably, he was as keen as ever. A theatre polymath and renowned disability activist, for him this four-handed, pressure-cooker play of psychology and spirituality presented exciting new challenges.If this partly answers the “why here, why now?” question, why do Ratladi and Homann think the play resonates in the new South Africa?For Homann, the play typifies the Market’s longstanding commitment to “an entwining of politics and theatre” – a tradition vital to the theatre’s co-founders Barney Simon and Mannie Manim, and to one of the many playwrights they championed,Athol Fugard, who sadly died in March. Recent shows at the Market have examined the life and legacy of other significant South African figures, among them Winnie Mandela and Robert Sobukwe. As Ratladi points out, Breakfast With Mugabe extends this tradition; a play about a hero of the liberation movement – this time from outside South Africa, and one whose legacy is hotly contested.View image in fullscreenPressure-cooker play … (from left) Farai Chigudu. Craig Jackson, Gontse Ntshegang and Themba Ndaba in Breakfast With Mugabe at the Market theatre.Photograph: Ngoma KaMphahleleThis is especially true among Zimbabweans, an estimated one to three million of whom now live in South Africa. Hearings into theGukurahundiin Matabeleland in the mid 1980s have only just begun in earnest. In that massacre, Mugabe ordered his army’s North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade to suppress his party’s opponents. An estimated 20,000 Zimbabweans were murdered.At the production’s first night in Johannesburg, it was clear the play retains its bite. Themba Ndaba and Craig Jackson lock the president and his shrink in a terrible struggle for supremacy; Gontse Ntshegang shines as the manipulative Grace Mugabe, drawing howls of laughter for her indiscretions as “the First Shopper”, while Zimbabwean-born Farai Chigudu exudes menace – and barely controlled violence – as the bodyguard/secret policeman, Gabriel.With the first three performances sold out, audiences (as audiences will in South Africa) whooped, gasped and sighed at every zinger or put-down – verbal or physical – delivered by the cast.I’ve been lucky. The play has almost always been well received by audiences as well as critics. In the US however, what I believed was a play about colonial culpability was celebrated as an essay on interracial conflict, pure and simple. Do Americans struggle to see their country implicated as a colonial power?In South Africa by contrast, it’s the impact of colonial oppression that deafens. Post-liberation rewards – the justice so long awaited by black South Africans – never materialised for many. How the country’s current government can ever deliver redress is a hot-button political issue for President Cyril Ramaphosa – and one critical to the future of South Africa’s 63 million inhabitants.And what does Ratladi’s unexpected, bracing new production offer the playwright? A lesson. Whatever we maythinkwe’ve written, a play can – simply by shifting its context in time and space – make us think and feel something new. It is after allplay– a living, unfolding, mutable thing. Like all true play, its punches do not always land where expected.Breakfast with Mugabeis at the Market theatre, Johannesburg, until 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRobert MugabeAthol FugardSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it time to rethink how we say goodbye our loved ones?Tim BurrowsWed 23 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 17.43 EDTShareWhen my father-in-law, Cliff, died in March 2021 after being diagnosed with an aggressive and late-caught cancer, he didn’t leave any funeral plans. Nor was there money squirrelled away to pay for them, even if he had. He was an ardent atheist, so a church service was out of the question, and pandemic restrictions had been limiting guest numbers, so my wife, Hayley, and her siblings decided to opt out of having a traditional funeral. Instead, they chose “direct cremation”, a service that minimises formalities – and, crucially, the cost. There is no funeral service; the coffin is simply brought into the crematorium before it is cremated, after which the ashes are returned to the family.During an online consultation with “death specialists” Farewill, Hayley was quoted £1,062 for a direct cremation, more than £3,000 cheaper than the currentaverage cost of a basic funeral. The only catch was that no one would attend the cremation, aside from those paid to carry it out. It seemed a cruel choice to some, who could not get their heads around the idea that there would not be a funeral to attend. But Hayley explained why it seemed like the perfect option: they could obtain her father’s ashes without fuss and hold their own, intimate ceremony on the banks of the River Wye, where Cliff had loved to fish.Although Cliff died in a hospital in Powys, Wales, he was cremated 140 miles away at a crematorium near Exeter. His ashes then travelled 220 miles east, with no limousine cortege in sight, to our home in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The delivery man arrived holding a gift bag containing Hayley’s dad in one hand and a small bunch of flowers in the other.Farewill’s co-founder Dan Garrett is something of a disruptor within the death industry. Death first inspired him when he was growing up in Golders Green in north London, where his family home backed on to the local crematorium.“The walk with my family was always to the crematorium,” he says. “It was absolutely beautiful; I reckon it left some kind of resonance in my head.” He graduated from the Royal College of Art in 2015 looking for a gap in the startup market, and launched Farewill the same year. He felt that the funeral industry, with its monopolising practices based around local, family-run funeral directors, was ripe for revolution. Farewill branched out from its initial offer of online will-writing services (usually carried out by solicitors) after it noticed a pattern emerging among its customers.“We were speaking to 20,000 people a year,” he says. “And we had a box [on the online form] that said: ‘What do you want to do with your funeral?’” And probably 80% of what people were writing was: ‘I just want no fuss, don’t wear black, nothing traditional, just something that represents me.’” Garrett realised this was “a great business opportunity”.Farewill began doing direct cremations in December 2019, a few months before Covid hit the UK. The popularity of its services did not peter out with the pandemic, and now20% of bodies are disposed of by direct cremation.Farewill rivals Pure Cremationrecently predictedthat 50% of the UK population will choose direct cremation within 20 years. Business has been bolstered by a generation of tech-savvy consumers navigating a cost of living crisis and a stagnant economy. It is not exclusive to the UK: the US is experiencing a similar shift in the funeral industry, as detailed bythe New York Times.View image in fullscreenHayley (centre) with her sister Jo and uncle Barry, pictured at Cliff’s ceremony on the River Wye.Photograph: Courtesy of Tim BurrowsAccording to the Cremation Society, up to 80% of people are cremated in the UK, which is above the average globally – although this is still behind Japan, where almost everyone is cremated – but it hasn’t always been the case. As Jessica Mitford (who, like David Bowie, opted for direct cremation) wrote in The American Way of Death, there were just three cremations in the UK in 1885 – the first year of its legalisation, after a hard-fought period of campaigning. Today, the vast majority of the UK would rather be incinerated, perhaps for reasons similar to those articulated by George Bernard Shaw in the 1940s: “Earth burial, a horrible practice, will some day be prohibited by law, not only because it is hideously unaesthetic, but because the dead would crowd the living off the Earth if it could be carried out to its end of preserving our bodies for their resurrection on an imaginary day of judgment.”Despite its growing popularity, fightback is brewing against direct cremation, nicknamed “burn and return” by those who oppose it. “Direct cremation interrupts both this sacred understanding of the dead body and the sense that it has deep and powerful spiritual value,” wrote Anne Richards, public policy adviser to the Church of England,in June. “Whether offered overtly or not, such a no-fuss service undermines the sense that a dead body is worthy of respect, care, dignity and love. Why spend money on something worthless?”Writing in the Spectator, Ysenda Maxtone Graham, in a piece that described the process as “a lonely end for one’s mother or father, or indeed oneself – and actually quite expensive for what happens, which is basically waste disposal”, said: “You can see how – as with assisted dying – the elderly could be pressurised into going for this option by the death-averse, non-religious and hard-up young.”But looked at another way, direct cremation has demystified an industry that has long been accused of overcharging grieving families. The “cost of dying” in the UK, including professional fees for administering the estate, a simple funeral service, and all optional extras like the party or wake, has this year hit a record high of £9,797, according toSun Life’s annual study, while 6% of funerals are now crowdfunded.View image in fullscreenCliff, Tim Burrows’ father-in-law, pictured with Tim’s daughter Greta in April 2019.Photograph: Courtesy of Tim BurrowsIn February 2025, Farewill was sold to Dignity, one of the largest funeral companies in the UK, which operates 45 crematoria. In the office of Dignity’s Bentley crematorium, just outside Brentwood, Essex, manager Ian Best says he still calls direct cremations “unattended cremations” out of habit. It is a hangover from the days when the only cremations without family or friends were “pauper’s funerals”, paid for by the council if there were no relatives to cover the cost (thanks to the cost of living crisis, the number of such funerals, now known as public health funerals, hasrisen by 47% in England in the last seven years). Before the pandemic, Best says, unattended cremations only happened at Bentley every three or four months. Now, they count for roughly a third of all cremations that take place there.“It’s definitely changed the industry massively, and I think we’re learning as we go,” says Best. “It’s uncharted territory for us.” The biggest change, he says, “is just the fact that people aren’t here. I’m so used to being here, looking out of the window, seeing the car park full up, and hearing people – to then think, oh, there’s no one outside, but I’m still attending a funeral.”But in many other ways, you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between a direct cremation and a service attended by mourners. “I always emphasise the fact that we do it exactly the same here, regardless of whether it’s attended or unattended,” says Best. “You’ll still always come through the front [of the chapel], we’ll always have music on, we’ll always bow, we’ll always have the curtains, there’ll always be that element of respect.” Imagining it reminds me of another echo of the pandemic – catching highlights of Liverpool’s winning Premier League campaign when there were no crowds; all that ceremony, but with no one to share it with.I first arrived at Bentley shortly after a direct cremation and family members were standing outside chatting, having said their final goodbyes. I ask Ian if he minds people attending direct cremations in this manner, when they are advertised as “unattended” (and this is reflected in the price). Quite the contrary, he says: when he noticed them congregating, he turned the speakers on outside and played music as they watched the funeral directors take in the coffin. “Theoretically, an unattended funeral should just be the funeral director bringing the loved one in the coffin: there’s no family,” he says, but he is open to families watching, and sometimes invites people in to sit at the back, to help them grieve for their loved one. “I’m not going to turn people away. It doesn’t cost me anything.”Some funeral directors suggest that the way direct cremations are sold is too pushy. Pure Cremation is one of the country’s biggest direct cremation providers, with an enormous crematorium in Andover, Hampshire, and a multimillion-poundTV advertising spend, with commercials shown primarily during daytime hours to catch the retired demographic most likely to buy funeral plans. Their adverts are all over social media, too. I sawone advert promising a free afternoon tea, up to the value of £50, when buying a direct cremation through the company (“Offer ends 31 August”).The rise of direct cremation, as well as the backlash, goes some way to addressing a fundamental question about death: what, or who, are funerals for?“Funerals have always been for the living,” says Martin Stibbards, whose family funeral directors in Essex offer everything from a full horse-drawn funeral cortege that harks back to their Victorian roots to their own direct cremation service. “You don’t know you’re at your funeral, but your relatives do.” Stibbards says that the genius of the new direct cremation companies is that they have flipped the decision from the family to the living, directingtheir advertising towards those making their own funeral plans. “Grief is difficult. You might think it’s all very good when you’re sitting in your living room and you’re not dying and thinking: ‘Yeah, I’ll just sign up, this is going to be great for my family.’ But when the reality happens and you’re whisked off somewhere without anybody knowing where you are … grief can be very complex.”At Bentley, Best ushers me behind a curtain to see the cremation chamber. Coffins from unattended and attended services wait to be cremated.It feels inadequate, somehow – but not because of the cremation process itself. Rather any attempt to mark the end of a life feels unsatisfactory. And nothing – direct cremation, a princely burial after a multi-vehicle cortege, or lighting up the sky with fireworks like Hunter S Thompson – can change that.Explore more on these topicsBereavementDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When we played a kids’ game, the dark clouds parted and my life took a radical turnLaura JonesWed 23 Jul 2025 01.55 EDTShareIwas halfway through a yoga session when it happened. I was sitting opposite a stranger and we were about to do a clapping exercise together, like a child’s game of pat-a-cake. I didn’t feel awkward, or silly; I went for it and gave it everything. It was as if the clouds parted and the sunlight shone through. I felt a huge sense of relief, as if I had just found something I had been looking for.I was in my late 20s, and I’d had chronic depression since my teens. It would come in waves, and I could see another wave heading towards me. After a photography degree, and a couple of years working at a picture library, I had been desperate to break into the media and, in 2003, I was really excited about getting a job on a magazine picture desk. It felt like an achievement and a lucky break in a competitive industry, but I soon discovered its office was not a great place to be.My boss was difficult to work with, and it wasn’t a warm, welcoming environment. She would put me down and make me feel worthless. My self-esteem, which was not great to start with, was soon in tatters. Outside work, I was partying hard and taking too many drugs. My boss and I had several confrontations and, after one particularly bad interaction, I couldn’t face going in the next day.My friend, who knew I had been depressed, told me his girlfriend was teaching a yoga class that evening, and suggested I go. I hadn’t done yoga since university, and she taught kundalini yoga – a style that focuses more on energy than physicality. I didn’t know then that yoga could be such a cathartic process.View image in fullscreen‘Yoga changed my life’ … Laura Jones in Goa.Photograph: Alexandra DaoI threw myself into it. Across from a partner, looking into their eyes, the childlike practice of our hands clapping together, and the concentration required to keep the rhythm, suddenly cleared the mental fogginess that had dogged me for years, and I experienced a crystal-like clarity. It was as if somebody had turned on the lights. I felt as if I’d been in the dark, in anguish and negativity. Now, I could see myself more clearly, and I got a sense of the jolly person inside.Depressionfelt as if it didn’t belong to me, as if it was a great big, stinky old overcoat that I could take off.Not long after that first kundaliniyoga class, my job contract ended and I got out of that office. I had just enough experience to go freelance, and I ended up making twice as much money, so I could pay for regular yoga classes. I had felt broken but every time I did yoga, it felt as though I was piecing myself back together a little bit.Practising yoga taught me to trust in life – to believe that I could release my grip and situations would work out without me having to try to control them. Without so much fear running the show, I had a greater sense of ease. Of course life was, and is, stressful, but I had a much more positive outlook.I began to make better decisions and it became a positive feedback loop – as I looked after myself better, I got more energy. I joined a gym and when I started getting physically stronger, I became far more mentally resilient. It didn’t happen overnight but I had put the brakes on my downward spiral and started to reverse out of it. It had such a huge impact on my life that I decided to train to be akundalini yoga teacher.For the next few years, I was still working as a picture editor, but it wasn’t what I wanted. Working on newspaper picture desks, I would sit in front of banks of images that were considered too distressing to print, and feel helpless and full of rage at the injustice in the world.I wanted to contribute something to make the world a better place, and in a small way, I hoped that by teaching other people kundalini yoga, it would help them. I hoped that this would ripple out – that the more that people were able to find their own inner peace, the more they would in turn be able to help their friends, family and community.Kundalini yoga changed my life, and I have seen it give people more purpose and enjoyment in their lives, too. It taught me that happiness really does come from within, and now I help people switch on their own inner light.As told to Emine SanerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One fabulous way to cook up a glut isscarpaccia, an Italian classic that’s similar tofarinataand a distant cousin of pizza. Thinly sliced courgettes are degorged by tossing them in sea salt to extract their juices, then, true to Italian thrift, the flavourful liquid is used to make a batter that’s then reunited with the courgettes before baking into a thin, crisp slice.ScarpacciaZucchini or courgettes are a type of summer squash that grows so prolifically that even the most amateur horticulturist, such as myself, is often inundated with a cash crop of long green gourds. The leaves, stems and flowers are all edible (the greenery can be used like any other leafy green – it’s wonderful simply sauteed with garlic, lemon and nutmeg).Those who don’t have the luxury of growing their own still benefit from the seasonal abundance, however, because the price of courgettes drops to much more affordable levels, even at the most affluent of farmers’ markets. When I was growing up in Dorset, I remember seeing baskets of the things on garden walls, just left out in return for a donation of a few pennies.500g courgettes, topped and washed500g new potatoes,washedSea salt1 white or red onion, peeled and thinly sliced3 sprigs fresh rosemary, or thyme or oregano, leaves picked150g wholemeal flour– wheat, spelt or plain white50g polenta, or semolina or breadcrumbs, plus extra to finishOlive oilFinely slice 100g each of the courgettes and potatoes and set aside. Grate the rest into a colander set over a bowl, add two teaspoons of sea salt and toss to coat. Place a plate and a weight directly on top of the courgettes and potatoes, and leave to degorge for an hour. Working with a handful at a time, squeeze the courgette and potato mix over the bowl, to collect their juices, then measure out 120ml of the liquid (if need be, top up with water).In a bowl, mix the grated courgettes and potatoes with the sliced onion, herb leaves, flour and polenta, then stir in the 120ml reserved juice and mix to the consistency of thick cake batter; add more liquid or flour as required.Line a large baking tray with unbleached baking paper and brush with olive oil. Spread the batter over the paper so it’s about 5mm thick, then arrange the sliced vegetables on top in neat alternating rows. Drizzle with more olive oil, sprinkle with a little polenta and a pinch of sea salt, then bake in a 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 oven for 45-55 minutes, until golden, crisp and charred in places.This article was edited on 23 July 2025, to clarify that the grated courgettes and potatoes should be mixed with the onion, herbs, flour and polenta.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite their unruliness as a crop, they are mild-mannered in flavour, a culinary chameleon that partners with a wide range of tastes. From the umami punch of parmesan to the fragrant cut-through of citrus, and from the warmth of cinnamon to the char of the barbecue, these green gourds can be used in myriad ways, shining in sweet and savoury contexts alike.Courgette butter, parmesan and lime puff tart (pictured top)There is nothing easier or more gratifying in summer than a tart topped with the season’s bounty. Serve with a rocket salad for a light lunch, or alongside your protein of choice. The courgette “butter” is endlessly adaptable: turn it into a pasta sauce with a spoonful or two of creme fraiche, or use it to fill quesadillas.Prep30 minCook25 minServes6-8For the courgette ‘butter’3 tbsp olive oil3 medium-large courgettes(about 670g)3 small garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced½ tsp fine sea saltFinely grated zest and juice of ½ limeFor the tart320g sheetready-rolled puff pastry3-4 tbsp ricotta, or creme fraiche or cream cheese10g parmesan, finely gratedEgg wash, or milk, to glazePut the olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Meanwhile, top and tail the courgettes, then slice into very fine 1mm-2mm-thick rounds (if you have one, use a mandoline).Tip the sliced courgettes, garlic and salt into the pan, stir to coat everything in the hot oil, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes, until the courgettes start to break down. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook for another 15 minutes, until the courgettes are soft and jammy and a bit like butter; if you like, leave the courgettes to cool and store in the fridge for up to three days.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Unravel the pastry sheet and its paper on to a large baking tray, trimming off any excess paper, if need be, then use a small knife to score a light 1cm border all around the edge of the pastry. Spoon dollops of the ricotta into the centre of the pastry, then spread it all over the base up to the border.Squeeze the lime juice on to the cooked courgettes, then spread them evenly over the the ricotta and top with an even scattering of the parmesan and the grated lime zest. Brush the border with egg wash (or milk), then bake for 25-30 minutes, until the edges are puffed up and deeply golden. Serve immediately.Courgette and brown sugar loafView image in fullscreenThis is a brilliant way to use up a glut of courgettes, turning them into a soft, cinnamon-spiced cake with deep caramel notes from the muscovado sugar and a hit of aniseed fragrance from the fennel seeds. Perfect for an afternoon tea break.Prep20 minCook50 minServes8For the cake210g plain flour1 tsp ground cinnamon¾ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda½ tsp fine sea salt250g grated courgettes(2 small-medium courgettes)100gdark muscovado sugar2 medium eggs200g granulated sugar50g creme fraiche, plus extra to serve1 tsp vanillabean pasteFinely grated zest of 1 lemonJuice of ½ lemon120ml olive oil1 tbsp demerara sugar1 tsp fennel seeds, roughly crushedHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line a 2lb loaf tin with greaseproof paper.In a medium-large bowl, thoroughly whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, bicarb and salt, then add the grated courgette and toss until evenly coated.In a large jug, whisk themuscovado sugar and eggsfor about a minute, until there are no significant lumps and the mix is a little frothy. Whisk in the granulated sugar, creme fraiche, vanilla, lemon zest and juice, then stream in the olive oil, whisking all the time.Pour the wet mix into the courgette bowl, whisk just until combined, then scrape into the lined loaf tin. Mix the demerara sugar and crushed fennel seeds, then sprinkle evenly all over the top. Bake for 45 minutes, until golden on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove and leave the loaf to cool in its tin for five to 10 minutes, then carefully unmould and transfer to a rack to cool completely. The cake is delicious as is, but slices can also be served with a spoonful of creme fraiche and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil (or maple syrup, if you have more of a sweet tooth).Alexina Anatole is the author of theSmall Wins Substackand Sweet: The Secret to the Best Desserts, published by Square Peg at £27.

They are easy to misplace, however. If yours is lost, damaged or stolen, here are some tips to get you back on track.What to do if your Oyster or Zip card is lost, stolen or damagedCheck whether your card is registered to a Transport for London (TfL) account. If you lose an unregistered card, you can’t get a refund or replacement, and will lose any pay-as-you-go credit.For a registered card, sign in to yourTfL accountand report it missing, stolen or faulty. You can also report a lost, stolen or damaged Oyster photocard, including the five to 10, 11-15 or 16+ zip cards, 18+ student, apprentice, 60+ and veterans Oyster photocard, by logging in toyour web account. This will cancel the cards.Order a replacement card online or buy one at an Oyster Ticket Stop, which you can find in many newsagents or corner shops around London. It costs £7 for a new Oystercard and £11 to replace a photocard, plus postage. Your pay-as-you-go balance will transfer to your new card as long as you’re registered, as will a travelcard or bus and tram pass if you have at least five days travel remaining. If the card is for someone under 18, a parent or guardian must apply on their behalf.What to do once youhave got a new Oyster cardWhen you get a new or replacement Oyster card, there are some steps you can take to help if it goes missing.Create an account if you haven’t already and connect it to your Oyster card. You’ll already have an account if you buy a Zip card, 18+ student, apprentice, 60+ or veterans Oyster photocards.Transfer your account to your new card by confirming a security question and answer on your TfL account, or providing details of a journey you made with the Oyster card in the last eight weeks. You can do this by selecting “add new Oyster card” and entering the card number, or under the “transfer my products to another Oyster card” on your TfL account after you’ve reported it missing. If the card is for someone under 18, a parent or guardian will have to do this for them.If you get discounted travel, such as with a railcard, you will need to have the discount added to your replacement card. You can do this by asking a member of staff at a station to connect them, so will need your railcard handy.Keep your Oyster card in a secure place, ideally not with other cards, so if you lose one, you don’t lose them all.Explore more on these topicsLost or stolenexplainersShareReuse this content"

According to figures from the comparison website Confused.com, the average cost for four days in a short-stay car park in England will come in at £110, whereas in Scotland it is £58 and in Wales £88. The car retailer Motorpoint surveyed 25 UK airports for a week’s stay at the beginning of August and found London City the most expensive (£149.50 being the best price) and Teesside the cheapest (£50).It is best to book as far in advance as possible as prices go up the closer you get to departure and the most expensive option is to simply turn up and park.Ben Custard of Motorpoint advises booking once you have paid for your holiday. “Space is limited and prices tend to increase as your holiday approaches. You might be able to park for under £10 a day – even in peak season, at some airports,” he says. “They tend to charge considerably more without a reservation, meaning you could find yourself paying double the price advertised online.”Big airports have multiple car parks –Heathrowhas 11 official ones – and prices can differ between each, often depending on how close they are to the terminal, or whether staff park your car for you.For example, at Stansted for a week in August, it currently costs £138 to drop the car with the “meet and greet” at the terminal, while at the short-stay, a five-minute walk away, it costs £113. Parking in the long-stay section comes in at £98.Booking through comparison sites can often save you money andMoneySavingExpert offers discount codes.For that same week at Stansted, booking through the Holiday Extras site costs £111 for “meet and greet”, £96 at the short-stay and £83 at the long-stay. It is worth looking at other comparison sites such as FHR, SkyParkSecure and Airport Parking and Hotels to see what the best price is.Know the detailsTravel plans can change, so it is worth understanding whether you will be able to cancel your booking. Some providers allow this right up to the time when you are due to arrive.Official parking at Heathrow lets you cancel two hours before without being charged, while Stansted has a 72-hour deadline when you book directly. Comparison sites can include free cancellation with bookings, or you may have to pay extra on top of a booking to get it.Some airports have a grace period if your flight is late back and you pick up your car a few hours later than expectedSome airports have a grace period if your flight is delayed arriving back and you pick up your car a few hours later than expected. But it is vital to check as, even within individual airports, different rules can apply to different car parks.If you are going to park at the long- or medium-stay car parks, factor in the time that it will take to get to the terminal. While buses may be advertised as every 10 or 15 minutes, other people may be lining up when you get to the stop, so you may miss out on the first one.At London Gatwick, the long-stay car park is 10 minutes from the terminal and buses arrive every 10 minutes. At Stansted, they are every 15 minutes.Go off-siteOff-site parking is where you can leave your vehicle at a car park outside the airport complex. These are typically run by third-party companies and operate in a similar way, with passengers ferried to the terminal by frequent buses.They are often cheaper than official airport car parks and a survey by the consumer group Which? last year showed many drivers thought they provided a better service. The best-rated were Sentinel at Leeds Bradford airport and APH at Gatwick and Manchester.It is important to do some research before signing up to a third party company, however.Which? found that some private “meet and greet” providers– which collect the car from the terminal and then park it themselves off-site – were responsible for petty theft and speeding in the vehicles.Alternatively, you can avoid car parks altogether and put your vehicle in a private space in front of someone’s home, or on their land.A number of websites, such as Justpark and Parklet, advertise available spots around airports. In the case of Stansted, car parking for a week in August currently costs between £49 and £97 in the immediate vicinity of the airport on Justpark. But you will have to consider whether you need to get a taxi from the spot you park in. Security will typically not be as good as in a fenced-off car park.View image in fullscreenHeathrow is served by the Elizabeth and Piccadilly lines.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAConsider alternativesDo you need to park at all? Trains, and even taxis, can often work out cheaper than parking the car for your week or two in the sun – although it is worth doing the sums to make sure.Heathrow is on the Piccadilly and Elizabeth lines while Luton airport is on Thameslink and East Midlands Railway services. Gatwick is connected via Southern, Thameslink and Great Western Railway. TransPennine Express and Northern Rail run trains to and from Manchester airport to Manchester Piccadilly station.There are also a number of direct services to airports, and prices vary depending on when you book and what type of ticket you need. Stansted Express goes from London Liverpool Street (£29 return in advance); Heathrow Express goes to London Paddington (£37 return in advance) and Gatwick Express to Victoria (£42.70).If you are travelling as a family with children, the cost of a car park may be a similar, or a less expensive option, once you take into account the cost of getting to the station where the airport train goes from.Local private taxi companies often offer fixed prices to airports. Coaches, meanwhile, may be one of the cheapest options but can also take longer than getting a train.Beware drop-off feesPossibly the cheapest way to get to and from the airport is to rely on the goodwill of others. But getting a lift is not always free because of the high cost of drop-off fees introduced at many airports.View image in fullscreenIf you are getting a lift to an airport, remember to check whether there are drop-off feesPhotograph: Geography Photos/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesAt Southend airport, it costs £7 for just five minutes to pick up and drop off. Go over that time and it will cost £15 (for up to 30 minutes). Research by Select Car Leasing shows that Leeds Bradford International, Gatwick and Bristol airports charge £7 for a drop-off of up to 10 minutes.However, London City, Exeter International, Inverness, Birmingham International and Newquay Cornwall allow free drop-offs.View image in fullscreenIt is best to book as far in advance as possible to park at an airport because prices go up the closer you get to departure.Photograph: Britpix/AlamyExplore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksHeathrowMotoringHeathrow airportGatwick airportStansted airportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a physical sunscreen, using zinc (my own preference over titanium), that goes on almost clear and has a matt, but not chalky, finish. It will appease young people who have been (wrongly) convinced that mineral SPF is somehow superior to synthetics. It now comes in an additionaltinted version(£19) that can easily substitute for light, school-friendly makeup.The unaffordability of sunscreens is a hot topic in beauty. There’s no doubt that prohibitive VAT-liable SPF prices will negatively impact health for people on lower incomes. I admire the dermatologist-founded brand Altruist enormously for its mission to democratise UV protection. ItsOily Skin Cream SPF50(£9.50) is terrific for teen skin. It combines mineral and synthetic ingredients, and has a dry-to-the-touch finish that sits nicely under makeup.

We are not a matriarchy,” says Mare Mätas as she meets me off the ferry. I’ve stepped on to the wild and windswept Kihnu island, which floats in the Gulf of Riga off Estonia’s western coast like a castaway from another time. Just four miles (7km) long and two miles wide, this Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernity, a place where motorbikes share the road with horse-drawn carts, and women in bright striped skirts still sing ancient sea songs. But Kihnu is no museum – it’s a living, breathing culture all of its own, proudly cared for by its 700 or so residents.MapMare, a traditional culture specialist and local guide, promptly ushers me into the open back of her truck and takes me on a whistlestop tour of the island, giving me a history quiz as we stop at the museum, the lighthouse, the cemetery and the school.The men of Kihnu would once have spent many months away at sea, sailing or hunting seals. Out of necessity, the women of the island became the heads of the family as well as the keepers of the island’s cultural heritage. This led to Kihnu being nicknamed “the island of women”, and the BBC even proclaimed it “Europe’s last surviving matriarchy”. But Mare is very clear: “If you must use a word, you could say that our culture is matrifocal. But I prefer to say that on Kihnu we are simply equal.Womenhave status in the community, and older women have a higher status – they are seen as wise elders. Women work as the guardians of our culture, and we look after the circle of life on the island – we have the children, we tend the land, we care for the dead.”This Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernityThe women of Kihnu have been lighthouse keepers, tractor drivers and even stand-in priests. Today, they play ancient melodies on violin and accordion, teach their daughters traditional dances and sing Kihnu’s eerily beautiful runic songs, believed to be of pre-Christian origin. Most eyecatchingly, they wear traditional dress – bright red woollen skirts, embroidered blouses and patterned headscarves. These aren’t just garments donned for weddings or festivals – this is the only place in Estonia where folk dress is still donned daily.View image in fullscreenWhen the men were at sea, the women became the lighthouse keepers.Photograph: Matjaz Corel/AlamyMare is wearing a red stripedkörtskirt and woollen jacket. Her daughters, in their teens and 20s, pair their traditional skirts with slogan T-shirts. The skirts are woven every winter and each tells the story of the wearer. Young women usually wear red – they are supposedly in the “fairytale” era of their lives. If a woman is in mourning, she will don a black skirt. Over the months, her skirts will include more red and purple stripes until she’s dressed in joyful red again. A married woman wears an apron over her skirt, and new fashions and patterns still influence designs today. “When paisley was brought to the island from India, we began using it for our headscarves,” explains Mare. “And in the 1960s, when miniskirts were the rage, we wore mini körts!”I spot women of all ages dressed in bright flashes of red as I cycle about the island’s dirt roads on a sit-up-and-beg-bike. Kihnu is a patchwork of wildflower meadows and pine groves, edged by rocky coastline and dotted with wooden homes painted in primary yellows and reds. Outside one homestead I meet Jaak Visnap. An artist from Tallinn, he has run naive art camps here every summer for 20 years. Historically, many of the island’s sailors were also naive painters (artists who typically have no formal training and exhibit a simplicity in their work), and when I meet Jaak, he and a group of painting students from Kihnu and the mainland are busy working on richly coloured paintings for an exhibition in the island’s museum.View image in fullscreenLocal guide Mare Mätas in traditional dress.Photograph: Sian LewisEstonians often label themselves as cold and standoffish, but the painters welcome me warmly and offer me wine. The sun comes out and transforms the island – moody grey skies swept away by golden light – so I join them for a swim in the warm, shallow sea. As we bob on our backs in the evening glow, Viola from Tallinn tells me a joke: “It’s raining, and a foreigner asks an Estonian man: ‘Don’t you have summer in this country?’ ‘Of course,’ he replies. ‘But sadly I was at work that day.’”Before I leave the painters, I ask Jaak how the island has changed since his first summer here. “This used to be the fishing island,” he says. “Now, it’s the tourist island.” But visitors don’t seem to have transformed Kihnu just yet. Locals may drive modern cars and trucks, but I also pass Soviet-era motorbikes with side cars. There are a few shops and cafes, but they sell smoked dried fish and seal meat as well as coffee and cakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But tourism also allows the next generation to remain on the island, rather than leave for the mainland in search of work. And for now, most visitors seem to embrace slow travel, staying with local people in guest houses and B&Bs, and visiting to join midsummer dances and violin festivals, to learn to paint or knit, or just to find pastoral peace.Baltic beauty: exploring Estonia’s northern coastRead moreThe “island of women” is a misnomer. Instead, Kihnu feels like an old-fashioned yet balanced place that moves to the beat of its own drum (or perhaps, the hum of its own accordion). In winter, cloaked in snow, it must be a tough place to live. But in summer, this slow-paced island is a joy to explore. As I leave, the rain that makes it so lush and green returns. The ferry has barely left the harbour before Kihnu is swallowed in the grey sea, a place of legend once again.Kihnu is reached by aone-hour ferry crossing(foot passengers €4 one way, cars €16 one way) fromMunalaidharbour, which isan hour’sbus journeyfrom the coastal town ofPärnu.

The result is a transformation into one of the thinnest and lightest devices available and radically changes how it handles, for the better.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 8.9mm thick when shut – well within the realms of a standard smartphone if you ignore the camera bump on the back. It easily fits in a pocket but opens up to turn into a folding tablet just 4.2mm thick.But at £1,799 (€2,099/$2,000/A$2,899) you pay an awful lot for such a fancy device. It is an expensive, cutting-edge gadget that can, in theory, replace your phone, tablet and PC in one pocketable device.View image in fullscreenThe super-thin frame leaves an enormous camera bump protruding about 5.5mm from the back.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe seventh-generation foldable solves most of the niggles of Samsung’s previous foldables. It weighs only 215g, which is 24g less than last year’s model and about the same as large slab phones, and is shaped just like a regular handset when closed.It fits better in your pocket. Typing messages, answering calls, getting directions and taking photos feel and work like a regular phone. Even the 6.5in screen on the front is top-notch – bright, colourful, crisp and 120Hz smooth – and the improved fingerprint scanner in the power button is accurate and rapid.Open it like a book and the Fold 7 is only a hair thicker than the USB-C port. It is impressively thin yet feels solid. It is difficult to see how a device can be made any thinner without ditching the charging port. The flexible 8in OLED screen is smooth, crisp, super bright and almost square, ready for running two apps side by side.The outside screen and back are protected by the latest technology in hardened glass, but the inside screen is still covered by a necessarily softer layer than a standard phone that picks up fingerprints easily and is relatively shiny. The crease down the middle of the screen where it folds is very nearly gone, only visible in glare.View image in fullscreenFlex mode allows you to watch films with the Fold 7 half-folded like a mini laptop.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsMain screen:8in QXGA+ 120Hz (368ppi) Amoled flexible displayCover screen:6.5in FHD+ 120Hz (422ppi) AmoledProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:One UI 8 based onAndroid16Camera:200+12+10MP rear with 3x telephoto; 10MP+10MP selfie camerasConnectivity:5G, dual sim, e-sim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, GNSSWater resistance:IP48 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes)Dimensions folded:158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mmDimensions unfolded:158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mmWeight:215gPower for multitaskingView image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 fully charges in 82 minutes, hitting 60% in less than half an hour using a 25W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold 7 does not skimp on processing power with the same flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM as theS25 UltraandS25 Edge. That means it flies along in everyday tasks and high-end games and is considerably more powerful than its closest rivals, such as theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold.The battery lasts just shy of two days using the two screens for about four hours each and spending several hours on 5G, which is about the same as its predecessors and similar to normal slab phones. It will last longer when just using the outside screen for phone usage, but most people are likely to need to charge it every other day.One UI 8 for Android 16View image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 can run two apps full size side-by-side, or up to eight in a combination of split-screen and floating windows.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold 7 is one of the first Samsungs to run One UI 8 (Android 16) out of the box. It has not changed that much since last year’s software, which is a good thing all round as One UI 7 was great. It includes all the features from Samsung’s S25 line, including thegreat Now barat the bottom of the lock screen that shows live sports scores, music, timers and other regular tasks.Samsung does a better job than rivals at making the most of the multiple modes and multitasking possibilities opened up by the folding tablet form. You can have up to eight apps open on the internal screen at any one time, and have different home screen layouts for each screen. You can force apps into almost any size or shape, use apps in a partly folded mode, move them between the front and internal screens, and many other small features.The Fold 7 also has all the AI tools from the S25 series, including Google Gemini, Circle to Search, writing and drawing tools, transcription and audio editing tools, and so on. Some are good, others can be safely ignored just like most buzzy AI features. Samsung will provide Android and security updates until 31 July 2032.CameraView image in fullscreenShooting photos is easiest with the Fold 7 closed, but you can shoot with it open or half-folded for hands-free photos.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe large camera lump on the back holds the 200-megapixel main, 12MP ultra wide and 10MP 3x telephoto cameras. The Fold 7 also has two 10MP selfie cameras, one in each screen.The main 200MP camera is the best of the bunch, matching that from theS25 Edge. It is a top-drawer camera capable of capturing great images across a range of lighting conditions, and is a significant upgrade on previous generation Folds.The 12MP ultra wide camera is solid and capable of taking some very good closeup, macro photos, which is always fun. The 3x telephoto camera is equally good, producing great portraits, but it gets a bit soft and grainy indoors and can’t match the 5x zooms on top slab phones. The selfie cameras are a similar story, with great detail in good light that quickly becomes a bit grainy indoors. You can shoot selfies with the main camera using the outside screen as a viewfinder when the phone is open, which produces much better results.The camera app has plenty of modes, is straightforward to use and shoots equally solid video. Overall, the Fold 7 has a great camera system that is not a significant downgrade on flagship slab phones, which is thoroughly impressive.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 looks like a regular slab phone from the front or the back.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery has an expected lifespan of at least 2,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Inside screenrepairs cost about £500. Samsung offers aself-repair programme, as well as Care+accidental damage insurancethat reduces the cost of repairs to £139.The Fold 7 is made from recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements and steel, accounting for 13.7% of the weight. Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices, and breaks down thephone’s environmental impact in its report.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs from£1,799(€2,099/$1,999.99/A$2,899).For comparison, the Galaxy Z Flip costs£1,049, theGalaxy S25 Edgecosts£1,099, theS25 Ultracosts£1,249, and theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Foldcosts£1,399.VerdictThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is an incredible, extremely expensive piece of technology that feels like a giant leap over previous models, removing many of the niggles and compromises that had become synonymous with foldables.By being so much thinner, lighter and normal-sized when shut, it feels just like a regular handset. Open it up and the internal screen is the best on a foldable yet. The crease is virtually gone, it is bright, crisp and makes the most of multitasking.The camera sticks miles out the back but generally doesn’t get in the way except to make the phone wobble on a table – a compromise worth making for a top-quality camera system. You even get the same chip, solid battery life and great software as Samsung’s top regular phones.That leaves the relative fragility of the folding form, lacking proper dust resistance and having a softer internal screen, and the eye-watering price, as the biggest compromises. If you are not sold on the idea of having a phone that is also a tablet in your pocket, I don’t think this will convince you.But the Fold 7 is the best folding phone available and the major upgrade Samsung needed after a few rather repetitive years.Pros:a phone and tablet in one, super thin and light, just like a regular phone when closed, great software with powerful multitasking abilities, fantastic tablet screen, top performance, solid battery life, water resistance, long software support.Cons:extremely expensive, no dust resistance, more fragile than a regular device and costly to repair, limited zoom camera compared with the very best normal phones.View image in fullscreenYou can easily forget the Fold 7 opens, as it feels and works like a regular smartphone using the outside display.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungSmartphonesMobile phonesTablet computersAndroidreviewsShareReuse this content"

But that is what happened to Prof Bethanie Carney Almroth during talks about a global treaty to slash plastic pollution in Ottawa, Canada. The employees of a large US chemicals company “formed a ring” around her, she says.At another event in Ottawa, Carney Almroth was “harassed and intimidated” by a plastic packaging representative, who barged into the room and shouted that she was fearmongering and pushing misinformation. That meeting was an official event organised by the UN. “So I filed the harassment reports with the UN,” said Carney Almroth. “The guy had to apologise, and then he left the meeting. He was at the next meeting.”View image in fullscreenBethanie Carney Almroth says she has been harassed and intimidated lots of times at the talks to form a plastics treaty.Photograph: Angeles Estrada/IISD/ENB“That was one example when I filed an official report,” said Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicologist from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. “But I’ve been harassed and intimidated lots of other times, in lots of other contexts, at off-site meetings, at side events, also at scientific conferences, via email and so on.”She has also had to take measures to avoid surveillance at the meetings. “I have a privacy screen protector on my phone, because they will walk behind us and try to film what’s on our screens and see what notes we’re taking, or who we’re chatting with. I would never open my computer in the middle of a room without knowing who is behind me. It’s a high-vigilance, high-stress environment.”These are examples of what numerous sources say is a “total infiltration” of theplastics treatynegotiations by vested industrial interests and corporate lobbyists. The core concern of six insiders who spoke to the Guardian was that the polluters are exerting too much power, not just within the negotiations but also within the UN Environment Programme (Unep), which oversees the negotiations. One source said they were “horrified” by the industry’s influence on policy and the sidelining of real solutions to plastic pollution, calling it “corporate capture”.‘Distorting knowledge’The plastics treaty negotiations resume in August in Geneva, Switzerland, having failed to reach agreement at the fifth round of talks in December. At stake is whether the torrent of toxic plastic pollution pouring into the environment can be stemmed. Doing so is not only vital to protect people and the planet but also to curb the climate crisis and the massive global losses of wildlife.But a flood of industry lobbyists and organisations have joined the talks, far outnumbering national delegations and scientists. They assist a group of petrostates, led by Saudi Arabia, in blocking the progress that many nations want, and are part of a wider “petrochemical bloc” that a recent study says “is driving up plastics production, externalising the costs of pollution, distorting scientific knowledge, and lobbying to derail negotiations”.View image in fullscreenAn oil refinery in Saudi Arabia. The country is leading a group of petrostates in blocking progress on the plastics treaty.Photograph: AlamyThe scale of the plastic problem is staggering. About 450m tonnes of new plastic is produced every year and production is set to triple by 2060 under current growth rates, damagingevery aspect of a safe environment.Almost all plastic is made from fossil oil and gas, and emissions from its production drive the climate crisis. Plastic and the toxic chemicals it contains also damage soils, ecosystems and human health, having pervaded the entire world from thetop of Mount Everestto thedeepest part of the ocean, fromhuman brainstohuman breast milk.The plastics treaty is being negotiated between the world’s nations, under the auspices of Unep. The negotiationsbegan in 2022, and the talks in Geneva next month will be its sixth major meeting. But since the beginning, the talks have been dogged by a fundamental disagreement.More than100 nations,backed by more than 1,100 scientists, say acap on the soaring production of plastic is essentialto reduce all the harms they cause. Petrostates and plastic manufacturers reject this and say the focus should be on better managing and recycling of waste. Global climate action to cut carbon emissions is also putting fossil fuel states under pressure to increase other uses for their oil and gas.“The amount of plastic that we’re already producing today is entirely unmanageable,” said David Azoulay, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (Ciel), who has attended the negotiations. “There’s no way, technically or policy wise, that we can manage it. But the companies’ objective is to produce more and miraculously somehow reduce the overall impact.” The expensive recycling technologies proposed by producers are “magical thinking”, he said. Only9% of plastic is recycled, according to a 2022 OECD report.Azoulay said fossil fuel states and industry do have to be part of the negotiations, but that the process fails to take account of their vested interests. “The fact that there is a major group of business and industry is not problematic, as they are stakeholders. But the fact they’re given, at a minimum, equal standing and equal access to the processes as those of victims of the problem that they’re creating, that is a problem.”View image in fullscreenDavid Azoulay, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said it was problematic that businesses and industry are given equal standing at the talks as those of the victims of the problem they are creating.Photograph: Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENBHe added: “There is a problematic underlying approach in how Unep operates, which is to consider that the people who created the problems, benefited from the problem, have lied about the problem and their responsibility about it for years and decades, are trustworthy partners to solve those problems.”‘Not an intelligent conversation’While the negotiating countries will decide the outcome of the treaty talks, Unep is the host and its executive director, Inger Andersen, has a critical and influential guiding role. She has not been spared from criticism.Andersen was accused of an “inappropriate absence of ambition” by more than 100 environmental organisationsin April 2023. They also expressed concern about a “lack of transparency regarding who is advising [her] work and the [treaty] secretariat”, which is the group of Unep officials who manage the talks.She was criticised in particular for astatement perceived to undermine the importance of a capon plastic production, made in September 2024: “We have to have a more refined conversation than just cap [or] no cap, because it’s not an intelligent conversation.” A reduction in production should focus on raw polymer for single use, short-lived products, not “car parts and plane wings”, she said. Critics said her statement contradicted scientific evidence that the environmentalimpact of plastics begins with extraction and production, not just their use.View image in fullscreenInger Andersen, Unep’s executive director, has been accused of a ‘lack of ambition’ by environmental organisations.Photograph: Kiara Worth/IISD/ENBThe environmental organisationscomplained to Andersen’s boss, the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, in October 2024, saying they had “deep concerns” that her public statements would “narrow the scope” of the treaty and that she had exceeded her role as convener of the negotiations. They did not receive a reply.It was also alleged at the most recent negotiating round, in Busan, South Korea, in December, that Andersen had put pressure on high-ambition countries to give way on their demands for a strong treaty with a cap on plastic production. Andersen responded at the time, saying: “I will meet with everyone at every stage of the way and I will obviously meet the member states and hear them out, from [across] the entire spectrum of the 193 [countries].”Plastics ‘ringleader’In her convening role, Andersen can do only so much to encourage nations to reach a deal. All the countries have to reach a consensus, but one nation in particular stands out as a block to an effective plastics treaty: Saudi Arabia, the world’ssecond biggest oil producer. Via its oil company Saudi Aramco, it owns Sabic, one of the world’s biggest producers of plastic.The country has played an increasing role in the plastics treaty negotiations and was described by Politico as the“ringleader” of a small group of oil-rich countries, including Russia and Iran, that blocked proposals for production caps in December.It has also developed a close relationship with Unep in recent years. Andersen made an official visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2024, met Saudi ministers at the UN summit on desertification which was hosted in Riyadh in December 2024 and sought a further ministerial meeting at Davos in 2025 to discuss “strengthening of cooperation”. She wasin Riyadh againon 29 June, signing a cooperation agreement on emissions reductions.The country paid Unep $1m to hostWorld Environment Day in 2024, a similar sum paid by previous host nations, and gave the UN agency donations of more than $20m between 2020 and 2024. Some of that was contributions to Unep’s environment fund and covered arrears dating back to 2021. Manycountries give moneyto Unep, which relies on these voluntary contributions for 95% of its income.Most of the rest was instalments from a$25m dealstruck in 2019 for Unep to provide expertise in strengthening Saudi Arabia’s environmental protections. After the deal, the head of Unep’s Saudi Arabia office wrote a report which the Guardian has been told expressed concerns about the governance of the money. Unep refused to share the report with the Guardian, saying it was a standard handover report by an official leaving his post and was confidential.In response to the criticisms of Andersen and the plastic treaty talks, a Unep spokesperson told the Guardian: “Unep’s sole focus is on supporting all countries to deliver an impactful treaty that will finally end plastic pollution. Unep continues to facilitate the participation of all relevant stakeholders in the process so we can end plastic pollution for everyone, everywhere.”Inside the plastics treaty negotiations, an official from Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy was elected in November 2024 to the10-person bureau of national representativesthat run the treaty talks.Azoulay saidSaudi Arabiaand its allies were undermining the plastics treaty talks. “We’re seeing complete bad faith negotiation.The obstruction [by Saudi Arabia] takes many forms, using their 35 years of experience in derailing climate negotiations, using every procedural tool to prevent progress, and using their vast financial resources to strong-arm and try to influence other countries,” he said. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.‘Overwhelming’ lobbyingWhile the petrostate delegations are power players in the meeting rooms and corridors of the treaty negotiations, one group outnumbers every nation: plastic industry lobbyists. At the December talks in Busan there were arecord 220 corporate lobbyists in attendance.That was far more than even the host nation’s delegation of 140 and was three times the number of independent scientists. Dow and ExxonMobil sent nine lobbyists between them, according to ananalysis by the environmental law group Ciel. Some lobbyists were included in country delegations, rather than with observer organisations, giving them access to sensitive member-state-only sessions, Ciel said.“The overwhelming presence of industry lobbyists skews the treaty’s direction,” a document being circulated among concerned treaty observers and sent to the Guardian says. “This imbalance sidelines scientific evidence in favour of corporate agendas, undermining the treaty’s potential effectiveness.”This warning is not new. Anotherletter from environmental organisationsto Andersen in April 2024 said the lack of a conflict of interest policy enabled industry access to decision-makers. “The participation of businesses from the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors poses a severe threat to the objectives of the treaty,” the letter said.A Unep spokesperson said it was for the negotiating countries themselves to establish a conflict of interest policy, but they had chosen not to do so. In reference to the harassment of Prof Carney Almroth in Ottawa, the spokesperson said aUN code of conductto prevent such behaviour strictly applied to all plastics treaty meetings.Another lever of influence being pulled by corporate interests is via the system through which Unep gives full access to the negotiations tocivil society sectorsincluding women, farmers, Indigenous peoples, children and scientists.The membership of one group has soared recently: business and industry. More than 30 plastic and chemical industry lobby organisations have joined the negotiations since the start of 2023, almost doubling the total number.These include the US Plastics Industry Association, Plastics Europe and national plastic industry groups from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia and Korea. Thegroup is co-chairedby a Saudi official.The problem, say critics, is that industry players have deep pockets and clear financial interests. “Lobbying should be called lobbying. It shouldn’t be called ‘society observers’,” said one source close to the negotiations.View image in fullscreenAn oil refinery owned by ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the US, the second largest in the country.Photograph: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Getty ImagesAreport by InfluenceMapin November 2024 found that plastic and fossil fuel industry groups, including ExxonMobil, Sabic, PlasticsEurope and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, “strongly advocated to weaken the ambition of the plastics treaty”.In contrast, the report said: “The consumer goods and retail sectors have strongly supported an ambitious, science-aligned treaty, but [the plastic and fossil fuel sector] at present seems to have the upper hand.”Hotel and flight costs make the treaty negotiations expensive to attend, which is why rich industrial interests can flood the talks with lobbyists while smaller countries, scientists and NGOs struggle to find the funds, said Carney Almroth.“​​The lobbyists have much more power and much more access,” she said. “They have the economic power to get into rooms I can’t get into. They can speak directly to ministers in ways that I cannot.”Carney Almroth says she is fortunate to be in position to speak out, with a permanent post at a supportive university in Sweden, a safe country whereintimidatory lawsuitsthat havetargetedsome scientists are difficult for companies to pursue. Many other plastics researchers are afraid to let their voices be heard, she said, fearing legal challenges, loss of funding or career damage. “It’s the tobacco playbook: challenge the science, challenge the messenger, try to silence people, try to undermine people’s credibility.”One business group is particularly influential: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, whose members include significant plastic, chemical and fossil fuel companies such as Sabic, BASF, BP, Chevron, DuPont, Dow, LyondellBasell and Shell. WBCSD has provided successive co-chairs to the business and industry group.In a statement, the WBCSD said it followed UN rules of procedure, saying: “We support the global ambition to reduce plastic production and use [and] we believe stakeholder participation – including businesses, civil society, academia, and others – is critical to achieving a durable and effective agreement.“Representing companies across industries and throughout the plastics value chain – from raw material producers through to consumer brands and waste management – we engaged as an organization well positioned to share a wealth of private sector knowledge, and expertise and support the process into practical action.”Misunderstandings and misinformationScientific experts, also keen to share their wealth of knowledge, say they have struggled to keep up with correcting wrong or misleading statements made by industry groups during the talks.There is no official scientific advisory panel for the treaty. Instead, the self-organisedScientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty(Scept) has attempted to fill the gap. It has 450 members, none funded by industry, and advises the smaller nations plagued by plastic who cannot afford to send scores of delegates to the negotiations.However, in February 2025,Scept wrote to the bureaurunning the talks and Unep’s Andersen to complain about a lack of access to meetings during the December negotiating round.“Consequently, our ability to follow the negotiations was severely limited,” the scientists said. “We were unable to identify the knowledge gaps, misunderstandings or misinformation that require clarification, often spread by actors with conflicts of interest.”Scientists also said theircriticisms of a significant 2023 Unep reporton “how the world can end plastic pollution” were ignored. The scientists said the report failed to reflect the whole range of health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution and was over-optimistic about technical solutions to deal with waste plastic.Scept experts had been invited to participate before the report’s publication and provided more than 300 comments. Unep said a “technical issue” meant an email containing Scept’s comments was not received in time for publication. It said it had taken feedback from other experts and deniedthe reportunderplayed the impacts of plastic.‘Threatening our children’s future’Some countries are gearing up for a fight at the next round of negotiations in Geneva in August. Ninety-five nations issued a “wakeup callfor an ambitious plastics treaty” on 10 June at the UN Ocean Conference.“Mountains of plastic [are] suffocating our ecosystem, poisoning food chains and threatening our children’s future,” said France’s environment minister. “This is a pivotal moment. We will not give up.”View image in fullscreenA rubbish dump filled with plastics in Rodriguez, Rizal province, in the Philippines.Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/ReutersBut Carney Almroth is uncertain about success. “Who knows? We’re planning and strategising for our scientists now and how we’re going to communicate our messages. But I think we can expect chaos and fireworks.”She recalled another incident of harassment at one of the plastics negotiations. A man from the plastics industry, who was not on the guest list, started harassing and shouting at students who were checking people in. “He was leaning over them, angry – it was bad, bad behaviour.”“Everyone I’ve ever been yelled at by is a white man from the global north – every single time. It’s a power dynamic,” she said. “But I don’t cower. I don’t shrink away. And I don’t raise my voice. I respond with references and facts and numbers. I’m also quite tall and when I go to the meetings, I wear heels and I’m taller than most of them. It’s petty, but it’s a game.“I like to think that we are impacting in a positive way, to bring more evidence-based decision making in ways that can help us find solutions that are truly more protective of people and the environment.”You can contact Damian Carrington viaemail, Signal (dpcarrington.35) orsecurely via this guide.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionUnited NationsLobbyingSaudi ArabiaClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Should not the cabinet be reminded that in October 2014 parliament overwhelminglypassed a motioncalling on the government to recognise the state of Palestine?The vote – 274 in favour, 12 against – reflected strong parliamentary support across party lines. While the motion was non‑binding, it sent a clear political message that the majority of elected representatives supported Palestinian statehood. Ever since then, every prime minister has refused to implement that decision of parliament, generally saying that the time was not yet right.Surely now is the time for the prime minister to finally act.Anthony MiltonEmeritus professor, University of Aberdeen; senior member, Robinson College, CambridgeI think the Guardian should emblazon the last paragraph of Nick Maynard’s article across the cover of tomorrow’s Guardian so that everyone who enters a newsagent will be drawn to read it (I’m witnessing the deliberate starvation of Gaza’s children – why is the world letting it happen?, 22 July).What more needs to happen beyond deliberate killing, enforced malnutrition and starving children forKeir Starmerto take immediate action?

Plus more letters on Labour’s plan to lower the voting age to 16Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.48 EDTShareDuring the last general election, my grandson’s secondary school held a mock election in which the oldest students voted (Voting age to be lowered to 16 across UK by next general election, 17 July). The majority voted for Nigel Farage, not because of his policies, but because the students thought he was “hilarious”. To this result, my 16-year-old grandson said: “And that’s why they don’t give 16-year-olds the vote.”Unless secondary schools and sixth forms start teaching politics and political systems in school and encourage the notion of informed debate, young voters will get their information from social media (and not from the Guardian app).Having a well-informed tranche of young voters would be wonderful. Imagine an interested and probing group of voters who could challenge policy and refuse to put up with obfuscation.However, unless we enable young teenagers to find the facts among the overwhelming amount of disinformation on social media, this move could end up being Keir Starmer’s Brexit.Janet PerkinsHorsham, West SussexReducing the voting age to 16 is long overdue. For far too long, old people have had the arrogance to believe that they know best. They almost never change their voting habits. They read the same newspaper as they have always done, for confirmation bias, making them liable to information distortion. And for many, dare I say, their cognitive degeneration can put them out of touch with reality. I may have become a grumpy old man (now in my eighth decade), but I still recognise that young people are more refreshing philosophers.Dr John FletcherDundeeRowena Mason draws attention to the disappointing turnout by 16- and 17-year-olds in the 2021 Senedd elections (Lowering the voting age: a boost for UK democracy or a shot in the dark?, 17 July). I was a member of the committee that recommended the lower voting age in Wales. But we also stressed that better civic education is needed if 16- and 17-year-olds are to become politically engaged. That did not happen. The UK government needs to learn that lesson.Paul SilkCrickhowell, PowysI have no problem with votes at 16, provided that schools allow bona fide political parties access to their students. When I taught in a West German grammar school in the mid-1970s, the main political parties often used to man a stall in the playground, offering literature and other information to potential student voters.I struggle to find such freedom in our schools, where politics, if discussed at all, tends to be theoretical rather than practical and certainly never party-based. Had we on these islands lived under a dictatorship, we might be less afraid of grasping the nettle, as countries like Germany have.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, LincolnshireSo, the voting age is to be lowered to 16 by the next election. Is this to get their disgust and distrust of politicians in early? It might be better for the government to spend time looking at why voter turnout is so low, rather than make it worse by increasing the size of the electorate. The cabinet could do what it promised (change, not more austerity) and all politicians could represent the people’s wishes.Martin SmithGuildford, SurreyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Who you know probably matters more than what you know, 15 July). It’s not much to do with artificial intelligence, and studying chemistry is not the solution.Anecdotally, of the 13 engineering science graduates from Keble College, Oxford, in 1982, only three found work in the UK – in Daddy’s firm. The rest of us went overseas. My nephew recently graduated in chemical engineering from Durham and could get nothing better than a lab assistant job in the UK. So he’s joining a Norwegian oil firm in Stavanger, upstream research for the trading desk.My eldest daughter, a paramedic graduate, seems destined for emergency response in the Australian mining industry. My youngest has dreams of studying medicine. But Daddy has just explained to her that it means working overseas on graduation, attempting to default on the £100,000 debt she’ll accumulate and never coming back. The reason this country is a declining parody of a developed nation is that kids are best served graduating from the Airport Bookstore School of Management and honing their bullshitting skills.Managers with a visceral understanding of the business and the conviction to recruit, train and retain the right talent are rare.

It is Africa’s last absolute monarchy and has beenruled by King Mswati IIIsince 1986.The government estimated the five men would be held for about 12 months, a spokesperson, Thabile Mdluli, said, adding: “It could be slightly less or slightly more.”She said Eswatini was ready to receive more deportees, depending on the availability of facilities and negotiations with the US, which has also deportedeight people to South Sudanafter holding them for weeks in a shipping container in Djibouti, and more than 200Venezuelans to El Salvador.Officials have said the men, who wereput in solitary confinement, were safely imprisoned in Eswatini. However, they have refused to disclose the terms of the deal, other than to say the US was footing the costs of keeping the men locked up and that they would work with international organisations to deport them to their home countries.View image in fullscreenA guard tower at the Matsapha correctional complex, where the men are reportedly being held.Photograph: APMany civil society organisations and politicians were not convinced. “This action, carried out without public consultation, adequate preparation, or community engagement, raises urgent questions about legality, transparency, and the safety of both the deported individuals and the people ofEswatini, especially women and girls,” said a coalition of seven women’s groups.The organisations delivered a petition to the US embassy on Monday calling for the US to take back the deportees, for the deportees’ human rights to be respected, and for Eswatini not to become a “dumping ground for unresolved problems from elsewhere”.The groups’ leaders held a protest outside the US embassy on Friday, where they sang, danced and held up signs with messages including: “Whose taxpayers?”, “Eswatini is not a prison for US rejects” and “Take the five criminals back to the US!!”Eswatini’s largest opposition party, the People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo), said in a statement: “Pudemo vehemently condemns the treacherous and reckless decision by King Mswati III’s regime to allow the United States of America to dump its most dangerous criminals on Swazi soil.“This is not diplomacy but human trafficking disguised as a deportation deal. It is an insult to all Emaswati who value peace, security, and the sanctity of our homeland.”The coordinating assembly of NGOs, an umbrella group, said the situation was “deeply alarming” and condemned the “stigmatising and dehumanising language used by US officials”. It called for the Eswatini-US agreement to be made public and to be suspended pending “genuine public consultation and transparent national dialogue”.View image in fullscreenKing Mswati III, who attended the coronation of Britain’s King Charles in 2023, has ruled Eswatini since 1986.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersTricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, said in aposton X on 16 July that the men, who she said had been convicted of crimes including child rape, murder and burglary, were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back”.She added: “These depraved monsters have been terrorising American communities but … they are off of American soil.”Eswatini’s prime minister, Russell Dlamini,told local mediaon Friday that the government was confident it would safely manage the prisoners. “Eswatini is currently holding inmates who have committed more dangerous crimes than those attributed to the five deportees,” he said.A prison service spokesperson, Baphelele Kunene, said the country’s citizens should not be afraid. “We can confirm that the five inmates in question have been admitted to one of our high-security centres where they are responding very well to the new environment,” he said. “Even though they come from the US, there is no preferential treatment for them as they are guided by the same prison regulations, eat the same food as others and are also expected to exhibit the same and equal amount of respect for prison protocols.”The US state department’s most recent human rights report on Eswatini, in 2023, said there were “credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; [and] political prisoners or detainees”.Political parties are banned from taking part in elections, which the system’s advocates argue makes MPs more representative of their constituents. In September, Pudemo’s leader, Mlungisi Makhanya, wasallegedly poisonedin South Africa. The party said it was an assassination attempt, which Eswatini’s government has denied.The Department of Homeland Security has been contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

His legal team has requested a 30-day delay in implementing the decision, opting to keep him in criminal detention while they consider next steps.Meanwhile, in a separate courtroom in Maryland, US district judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing a civil case Ábrego filed, issued a 72-hour freeze on any further attempts by theTrump administrationto deport him. Xinis ruled that Ábrego must be returned to Maryland on an order of supervision.“The Court shares Plaintiffs’ ongoing concern that, absent meaningful safeguards, Defendants may once again remove Ábrego from the United States without having restored him to the status quo ante and without due process,” Xinis wrote inthe ruling. “Thus, additional relief is necessary.”Trump administration officials have previously stated that if Ábrego is released from criminal custody, he would be immediately transferred to immigration detention and face a second deportation, this time not to El Salvador.Immigration proceedings would begin right away and could lead to Ábrego’s removal from the US before his criminal trial, despite the administration’s earlier pledge that he would be prosecuted in an American court.The 30-year old was wrongfully deported by federal immigration officials in March. According to the Trump administration, Ábrego was affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim that Ábrego and his family vehemently deny.Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, the Trump administration faced widespread pressure to return him back to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return.In June, the Trump administration returned Ábrego fromEl Salvador, only to then hit him with a slew of human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”.Prior to his deportation, Ábrego had lived in Maryland for over a decade, working in construction, and was married to an American wife.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationKilmar Ábrego GarcíaEl SalvadorAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland.”Ortiz had been tried, convicted and sentenced last year in Venezuela of the murders. The White House did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment by time of publication.Caracas releases 10 Americans as Venezuelans freed from El Salvador jailRead moreA state department spokesperson did not discuss specifics of Ortiz’s case when asked by the Guardian.“The United States had the opportunity to secure the release of all Americans detained in Venezuela, many of whom reported being subjected to torture and other harsh conditions,” the state department spokesperson said. “For privacy reasons, I won’t get into the details of any specific case.”Ortiz can be seen in twoseparateimages, shared by a state department social media account. Inone image, Ortiz is smiling and looking at the camera while sitting on a plane.“The US had a due diligence obligation and now that this person has been released, the investigation has to continue in accordance with the law, and keeping in mind there are victims in fear of his release,” said Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela program director at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), in a statement to the Guardian.Last week, the US state department, coordinating with the Salvadorian and Venezuelan governments, participated in a large-scale prisoner swap between the three countries. A total of 252 Venezuelans, previously detained in the US and expelled to a notorious Salvadorian prison under the Alien Enemies Act, were returned to Venezuela. In exchange, the US received 10 American nationals who were detained in Venezuela. Among them was Ortiz.The Venezuelan NGO, Foro Penal, which tracks the movement of political prisoners in the country, released a notice on Monday, mere days after the prisoner swap, confirming the release of the 10 American prisoners. But, in their statement, they clarified that only nine of the US nationals released were “political prisoners”.“One of the 10 Americans/residents, who were formerly detained, was not classified as a political prisoner, which is why we only documented nine formerly detained,” the organization wrote, alluding to Ortiz’s case.Ortiz carried out a violent murder in Madrid, Spain, in 2016 which made international headlines. According to press reports, in a fit of jealousy, Ortiz drove from Germany to Spain to track down his ex-wife’s new partner, Víctor Joel Salas, an attorney based in Madrid. Ortiz had previously threatened Salas, a Spanish newspaperreported.Ortiz entered Salas’s office and instead found two women, employees of the law firm. He stabbed the two women and waited for Salas to enter the office. When a taxi driver and client of the law firm entered, Ortiz stabbed the man, set fire to the law firm’s offices and fled. Salas arrived shortly thereafter and discovered the three bodies,El País reported.The ex-marine and Iraq war veteran quickly leftSpainand arrived in Germany shortly after the murders. Spanish officials, who investigated the case, began an international manhunt to track him down, but due to bureaucratic holdups, German police were unable to arrest him. Ortiz fled to Colombia and crossed the border into Venezuela, where he was later caught by officials in 2018.Despite Spanish authorities’ requests for Ortiz’s extradition, Venezuela refused, deciding to try him for the murders there because he had been a Venezuelan citizen. In January 2024, he was sentenced by a Venezuelan court to 30 years in prison for the triple murder.This Friday, Ortiz was released to the US and arrived in Texas on a flight, welcomed with open arms by Trump administration officials.Salas, who was almost killed by Ortiz, told the Spanish TV programVamos a Veron Tuesday that he and the victims’ families had been shocked by news of Ortiz’s release.“We all feel like we’ve been deceived, betrayed and let down,” he said. “We feel deceived because Dahud Hanid Ortiz was never a political prisoner; he was a murderer who was convicted and sentenced by the Venezuelan authorities. The case record makes it quite clear that he’s a criminal.”Salas also questioned how José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero – the former Spanish prime minister and a mediator between Venezuela and the US – could have acted as he did knowing “who it was that he was freeing”. He called on Zapatero and others who had been “kind enough to free someone who murdered three people” to take all necessary action to “undo this injustice”.The lawyer said he and the victims’ families were afraid Ortiz could decide to return to Spain.“The fear’s always there,” he told the TV programme. “The surprising thing in all this is that it was the German authorities who contacted me to say they were activating red alerts so that he’s not allowed back into the Schengen area.”Salas renewed his criticism of the Spanish government in an interview withTeleMadrid, saying the authorities had neither informed him of the murderer’s release, nor offered him protection. “The message they’re sending out is that anyone can come to Spain, kill three people – and get away with it,” he said.The lawyer added that “the governments of Donald Trump and Maduro have just handed a killer his freedom – someone who’s a real danger to society – without anyone bothering to provide a real explanation”.In March of this year, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, declaring that the Tren de Aragua gang was invading the US at the behest of the Venezuelan government. Hundreds of Venezuelan men, accused of being gang members, were quickly expelled toEl Salvadorand detained in the notorious Cecot prison.The accusations that the men were all gang members was based on flimsy evidence by homeland security officials. After the quick and quiet expulsion to El Salvador, news organizations began revealing the identities of some of the men, including a gay Venezuelan makeup artist who was seeking asylum in the US.“In the four months that the men were imprisoned in CECOT, the Trump administration repeatedly insisted that they were not under US custody,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy analyst with the American Immigration Council, in ablogpost. “Rather, they claimed that El Salvador maintained sole custody over the men and the United States had no control over their fate.”Reichlin-Melnick points out that the prisoner swap undermines the US’s past statements, especially with the state department taking credit over the exchange, saying the deal happened “thanks to President Trump’s leadership”.The American nationals detained in Venezuela made a quick stop in El Salvador before being flown into Texas. The 252 Venezuelan men detained by the US and El Salvador were flown to Venezuela.“All three countries involved violated the right to due process of people detained in their territories,” Dib from WOLA said. “Hostage diplomacy undermines global security and violates international law.”The American nationals released include Wilbert Joseph Castañeda, Jorge Marcelo Vargas, Lucas Hunter, Jonathan Pagan Gonzalez, Ronald Oribio Quintana, Erick Oribio Quintana, Fabian Buglione Reyes, Renzo Huamanchumo Castillo, Juan Jose Faria Bricen and Ortiz, per CNN.Venezuela to investigate alleged torture of its citizens in El Salvador jailRead moreAlthough the nature of their arrests in Venezuela is not entirely known, one particular case stands out. Castañeda wasdetained by Venezuelan authoritiesin August 2024, along with two other Americans, two Spaniards and a Czech citizen. Although the US government and his family have repeatedly claimed Castañeda was in Venezuela for a personal trip, the Venezuelan government accused the group of men of participating in a CIA-led plot to overthrow the government and assassinate the president, Nicolás Maduro.Records accessedby Military.com confirmed Castañeda was a Navy Seal at the time of his arrest.Earlier this month it was reported that the prisoner swap deal had been under way for some time, but that miscommunication between Trump administration officials botched it, the New York Timesreported.The US government has engaged in a number of prisoner swaps with Venezuela in recent years. Under the Biden administration in 2022, the US swapped seven Americans in exchange for two of Maduro’s nephews. In 2023, the Venezuelan government released 10 American nationals and a US-wanted fugitive, for the exchange of Alex Saab, a close Maduro ally and formerUS government informant. And earlier this year, Venezuela freedsix Americansafter a Trump administration envoy met with Maduro.Officials accused Ortiz of unsuccessfully attempting to pay Venezuelan authorities so that he could be included in the 2023 prisoner swap related to Saab, according toreportingfrom a Venezuelan newspaper.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasUS politicsSpainEl SalvadorMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

But the arrival of an active club, which has also shown itself in other nearby towns and cities like Toronto (the country’s largest metropolitan area), is a relatively new development.“Welcome to Hamilton, our city,” one Telegram post from the same Canadian active club wrote with its symbol posted on a sticker beside a sign for one of Ontario’s largest cities. “Folk-Family-Future!”Around the world, Canada isn’t the only country being introduced to these clubs, which are fitness and mixed martial arts groups operating out of local gyms and parks that espouse neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies. Already proliferating across the US in a number of states, active clubs openly take their historical cues from the Third Reich’s obsession with machismo and their modern inspiration from European soccer hooliganism.Recent research published by theGlobal Project Against Hate and Extremism(GPAHE) has shown that since 2023, these clubs are newly sprouting in Sweden, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, the UK, Finland and for the first time, in Latin America with two chapters in Chile and Colombia appearing.According to the GPAHE research, there are now chapters in 27 countries, with newyouth wings– akin to Hitler Youth-styled clubs – are surging stateside and abroad, “metastasizing” across western countries and recruiting young men into toxic, far-right ideologies encouraging race war.“The Active Club model was designed by Rob Rundo,” said Heidi Beirich, founder of GPAHE, referring to an infamous neo-Nazi and New Yorker whopleaded guilty in 2024to conspiracy to riot at 2017 political rallies in California.Around that time, Rundo was also the leader of theRise Above Movement, a neo-Nazi gang that had four of its members charged for their role in the2017 Unite the Right rallyin Charlottesville, Virginia, but later pivoted to spreading the idea of active clubs among followers as the new nerve centers for fascistic indoctrination and recruitment.“As far as we can tell, Rundo isn’t directly involved with chapters of the movement in a systematic way, but the chapters are inspired by him and the ideology he stands for,” said Beirich.Beirich explained that although Rundo isn’t likely to have a hand in these groups, it meshes with his original vision of active clubs being “autonomous and local”. But many of these chapters of active clubs in countries with large populations of white people – some of whom openly have gravitated towards racist, nativism in recent years – promote each other as a global struggle and are linked in a network of accounts on the Telegram app.One set of accounts, in particular, that have become the sort-of tastemakers among neo-Nazis online, have promoted several local active club chapters across the world and applauded those they think are creating the effective models to emulate.The same accounts admire the work of Thomas Sewell, a well-known andviolent Australian neo-Nazi, who has been promoting active club-styled groups in his country:“Their organization should be what every dissident group across European civilization seeks to emulate,” said one admiring post about Sewell and his crew.Beirich said Sewell, who previously admitted to have personally tried torecruit the Christchurch mass shooterto one of his past groups, is aligned with Rundo’s politics.“Sewell, just like Rundo, is a violent neo-Nazi recruiting new members to prepare for violence against both political enemies and the communities he targets, such as immigrants, Jews and the LGBTQ+ community,” she said, adding that he was “hosting MMA-style training and tournaments” to attract new followers.The Ultimate Fighting Championship and the combat sports that fall under its purview, have become alocus for the far right. Likewise, Sewell and Rundo have promoted learning these sports as a means of becoming street soldiers, akin to modern-day brownshirts, for their movement.Other organizations, which are more obviously political and engaging in public displays of activism, have seen this model of trained violence as a means of recruiting and solidifying their ranks. Patriot Front, an American proto-fascist hate group known for public marches andpropagandizing natural disasters, has outwardly linked itself to the active club movement.Its leader, Thomas Rousseau recently posted a group image with himself and others doing “grappling and striking” training at a martial arts gym in north Texas.Beirich described how members of Patriot Front “often work closely with Active Club chapters” including participating in their mixed-martials training. On Telegram, active club chapters regularly share Patriot Front propaganda.“Join Patriot Front if you are in America,” one active club adjacent account posted on Telegram, with nearly three thousand views.Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)CanadaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The government spends a little over 2% of GDP on defence currently, with forecasts to lift that to 2.3% by 2033. To prioritise Aukus, significant cuts have reportedly been made to defence programs, training budgets and to senior defence ranks.Australia has already paid $1.6bn to the US as part of the Aukus agreement. However, the future of the massive nuclear submarine deal remains uncertain as the Pentagon undertakes a review to ensure it does not weaken US naval capacity or diminish America’s force posture to contain China.Morrison, whose leadership between 2018 and 2022 endured a low in relations with Beijing, told the committee it was vital for western nations to resist Chinese attempts to interfere in politics and curb free speech.Citing polling of Australians by the Lowy Institute, the former prime minister told US lawmakers that “for the first time in quite a number of years there is a greater value on the economic partnership with China than concerns about the security threat”.“That is an objective of the CCP [Chinese communist party], that western democracies go to sleep on the threat,” Morrison said.“You need to build the internal resilience, and that means an appreciation of the potential threat. And that is somewhat in jeopardy in Australia.”Morrison said the liberal world order faced a “rising threat from authoritarian states who, not content with absolute control over their own populations to preserve their regimes, also seek hegemonic control over their own regions and to recast the world order to accommodate their illiberal objectives”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if we think that is going to produce change in the mindset of Beijing then we’re frankly kidding ourselves.”Appearing alongside Morrison before the committee hearing wasRahm Emanuel, formerly president Barack Obama’s chief of staff, mayor of Chicago and US ambassador to Japan. Emanuel is widely considered to be a leading Democratic contender contemplating a run for the White House in 2028.He argued the US – in a significant shift from the Trump administration’s “America First” doctrine – should lead a strong “anti-coercion coalition” along with allies like Australia to counter Beijing’s growing influence.He cited China’s trade sanctions on beef, wine and barley, imposed after Australia led calls for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, as examples of economic coercion, China’s most “pernicious and persistent tool”.“Australia is the best kind of blueprint of what you want to replicate worldwide. They did it on their own,” Emanuel said. “And China realised they couldn’t isolate Australia.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsScott MorrisonAustralian politicsUS politicsChinaAustralian foreign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It says states are liable for all kinds of activities that harm the climate, but it takes explicit aim at fossil fuels.It says that a state’s failure to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions, including through the production and consumption of fossil fuels, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies, “may constitute an international wrongful act which is attributable to that state”.View image in fullscreenClimate activists demonstrated outside the international court of justice in The Hague before the court’s ruling.Photograph: Marta Florin/ReutersClimate campaigners and representatives of vulnerable countries were delighted with the outcome. Speaking outside the court, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, said it was a milestone moment for climate justice. “It has confirmed what vulnerable nations have been saying and have known for so long,” he said. “That states do have legal obligations to act on climate change.”He said the document would be a vital tool in upcoming climate negotiations and was likely to inspire new lawsuits. Advisory opinions are technically non-binding but are considered authoritative because they summarise existing law rather than create laws.Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate litigation and counsel for Solomon Islands in the case, said the ICJ laid out the possibility of big emitters being successfully sued.“These reparations involve restitution – such as rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and restoring ecosystems – and also monetary compensation,” he said.Coal, oil and gas are the main cause of anthropogenic climate breakdown, but there was no mention of fossil fuels in the main text of the Paris agreement in 2015. It wasnot until 2023that countries said they would “transition away” from them, and even that weaker pledge wasdowngraded by some governmentsto optional.View image in fullscreenRalph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change, said it was a milestone moment for climate justice.Photograph: Lina Selg/EPAThe court also said states were legally liable for the actions of the private sector and must regulate corporate activities that contributed to the climate crisis.The UNinstructed the ICJto produce this document in 2023 after years of campaigningby a group of Pacific island law studentsand diplomacy led by the Pacific island state of Vanuatu.Vishal Prasad, one of the law students that lobbied the government of Vanuatu to bring the case to the ICJ, said: “This advisory opinion is a tool for climate justice. And boy, has the ICJ given us a strong tool to carry on the fight for climate justice.”UN secretary-general António Guterres hailed the opinion and said it affirms that the Paris climate agreement goal needs to be the basis of all climate policies. “This is a victory for our planet, for climate justice, and for the power of young people to make a difference,” he said. “The world must respond.”It was the largest case the court has ever heard. During atwo-week hearingin The Hague in December, representatives of vulnerable states told a panel of 15 judges that a handful of countriesshould be held legally responsiblefor the ongoing impacts of the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The court resoundingly rejected that argument, saying a range of other treaties applied, including theUN convention on the law of the sea, theVienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer, theMontreal protocol, theconvention on biological diversityand theUN convention to combat desertification.Customary international law also applied, it said, including principles of sustainable development, common but differentiated responsibilities, equity, intergenerational equity and the precautionary principle. States also had a duty to work together to protect the climate, the court said, because uncoordinated action “may not lead to a meaningful result”.View image in fullscreenYūji Iwasawa, right, the ICJ president, said climate breakdown had ‘severe and far-reaching’ consequences.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APThe court said a clean, healthy and sustainable environment was a precondition for exercising many human rights, such as the right to life, the right to health and the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to water, food and housing.The ICJ took aim at countries that are not part of climate change treaties, saying they still had to show that their climate policies and practices were consistent with other parts of international law. Donald Trump signed an order earlier this year towithdraw the USfrom the Paris agreement for the second time, andother rightwing leadershave threatened to do so as well.“As always, President Trump and the entire administration is committed to putting America first and prioritising the interests of everyday Americans,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Reuters in response to the opinion.The fact that the climate crisis was a global problem did not absolve individual states of responsibility, the court said, and those that have been harmed could theoretically bring climate-related legal claims against those that caused it. It may be more difficult to make a causal link than in the case of local pollution, but the court said it was not impossible and would be strengthened by existing science.Courts could order reparations, the ICJ said, including the restoration of infrastructure and ecosystems. In cases where the damage is irreparable, compensation may be due.The ICJ is the third of four top courts to publish such a document on the climate crisis. The inter-American court of human rights (IACHR) concluded earlier this month that there wasa human right to a healthy climate, and the IACHR and the international tribunal for the law of the sea saidstates had a legal responsibilityto control greenhouse gases. The African court on human and people’s rights has only just begun the process.Of all these, the ICJ has the widest jurisdiction and the role of harmonising and integrating international law. Vanuatu now intends to take the document to the UN general assembly to seek a resolution affirming its findings.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisInternational court of justiceUnited NationsVanuatuPacific islandsAsia PacificSouth PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

His position is widely regarded as untenable in light of the two consecutive electoral defeats.After the deal was disclosed by Trump, Japan’s Mainichi newspaper reported that Ishiba would announce his resignation as prime minister by the end of next month.According to media reports, Ishiba told his close associates that he would explain how he would take responsibility for the election loss once a solution was reached on trade negotiations. The Guardian was unable to confirm these reports.A senior member of the Ishiba administration told the public broadcaster NHK that Trump’s post on social media regarding the trade deal was “accurate” and something that “Japan welcomes”.US tariffs of 50% on imports of Japanese steel and aluminium are not part of the deal and the agreement does not include any reference to defence spending, Japan’s top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said.Trade between US and JapanJapan’s auto industry – which accounts for 8% of jobs in the country – was reeling from a 25% levy on imports to the US. The announcement on Tuesday made no mention of easing tariffs on cars – which account for more than a quarter of all Japanese exports to the US – but Ishiba later confirmed that the rate would be lowered to 15%.“We are the first [country] in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,” he told reporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US markets posted further gains with the Dow Jones rising by over 1% and the S&P closing up 0.78% at a record high.Markets were boosted by reports that the EU and US were closing in on a deal similar to the one the US struck withJapan, a 15% tariff on European imports.The EU isweighing €100bn(£87bn, $118bn) worth of tariffs on US imports if Trump does not agree a trade deal by the end of next week.Shares in Japanese carmakers rallied sharply. Shares in Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, surged by more than 14% and there were gains for Honda, Mazda and Subaru. London-based companies with the highest exposures to US tariffs – includingGSK, AstraZenecaandDiageo– were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100.A line graph showing movement in the FTSE 100 since January 2025Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “News of a trade agreement between the US and Japan is fostering optimism among investors that further deals might be reached before punishing tariffs come into force.”Under thedeal announced by the US president late on Tuesday, Japanese imports to the US will incur a 15% tariff, compared with the 25% level Trump had threatened to impose from 1 August. The levy, paid by US importers, remains above the 10% “baseline” global tariff that had been imposed by Washington while the two countries negotiated.The Japanese car industry, which accounts for 8% of jobs in the country, had been reeling from the threat of a 25% tariff on shipments to the US market. Vehicles and automotive parts account for more than a quarter of all Japanese exports to the US.Trump claimed that the deal would open the Japanese market to US products including cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products, many of which had proved to be a sticking point in negotiations.The deal with Japan followed anagreement with the UK in May, as the first major country to reach a deal with the White House, which included limiting an increase in US tariffs on most British goods to 10%.Financial markets were thrown into a tailspin on 2 April by Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement, when he unveiled blanket levies of 10% and higher individual ratesof up to 50%on dozens of markets, including those of economic allies and rivals alike.Trump paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days to allow for negotiations with trading partners after a dramatic sell-off in the US bond market. The markets staged a recovery, as investors bet that Washington would ultimately back down from the toughest measures.Trade between US and JapanInvestors latched on the president’s reluctance to see through extreme threats by betting that “Trump always chickens out”, or Taco for short, in a Wall Street maxim influencing trading decisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because even a higher tariff is preferable to continued uncertainty,” said George Lagarias, chief economist at the financial services company Forvis Mazars.“But this is hardly a catalyst for long-term optimism.

Its government spokesperson referred Reuters to the foreign ministry. Thailand’s foreign ministry said it had yet to be informed of the decision to recall the Thai envoy and the plan to expel Cambodia’s ambassador.The government has also ordered the closure of all border checkpoints under the jurisdiction of Thailand’s Second Army, the Pheu Thai party said.“Tourists are strictly prohibited from entering these border areas,” it said.In the landmine incident on Wednesday, the soldier sustained injuries and lost his right leg, the party said.Earlier, Thailand accused Cambodia of placing landmines on the Thai side of the disputed border area after three soldiers were injured, but Phnom Penh denied the claim and said the soldiers had veered off agreed routes and triggered a mine left behind from decades of war.Thai authorities said the soldiers were injured, with one losing a foot, by a landmine while on a patrol on 16 July on the Thai side of the disputed border area between Ubon Ratchathani and Cambodia’s Preah Vihear province.Cambodia’s foreign ministry denied that new mines had been planted, and said in a statement on Monday night that the Thai soldiers deviated from agreed patrol routes into Cambodian territory and into areas that contain unexploded landmines.The country is littered with landmines laid during decades of war.Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Albanese government was first elected in May 2022.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe report also found the number of FOI documents granted in full had fallen by more than half in just over a decade – from 59% in 2011-12 to 25% in 2023-24.It found the rate of outright refusals nearly doubled, from 12% to 23% during the same period.Further, when an FOI decision is challenged and reviewed by the information commissioner, the wait time has increased from six months in 2016-17 to 15.5 months in 2023-24.The centre’s director, Geoffrey Watson, called on the Albanese government to “reverse this worrying trend to restore the public’s right to know.”“The alarming deterioration in transparency is deeply troubling.” Watson said. “With the Albanese government’s supermajority, the risk of entrenched secrecy becomes greater, undermining democratic accountability.”Top public servant urges ‘more doing, less reviewing’ after 70 inquiries in Labor’s first term, FoI papers revealRead moreThe centre also found the Albanese government had a worse compliance rate with Senate orders for the production of documents than its Coalition predecessor.“The Morrison government’s compliance rate with orders to produce documents in the 46th parliament was 48.7% compared to the Albanese government’s rate of 32.8% in the 47th parliament,” the report said.“This represents the second-worst performance of any parliament since 1993”.The centre also said public interest immunity claims over documents have been steadily increasing. These claims are used by the government to withhold documents by arguing their release would not be in the public interest.In the last parliament, one claim was made every week.Prof Gabrielle Appleby, a board member of the Centre for Public Integrity, said “ministers are hiding information from the Senate and the Australian people”.“There appears to be no other good explanation for such a significant deterioration in the rate of compliance. This is corrosive of democratic accountability,” Appleby said.The centre said that without an independent legal umpire, as exists in New South Wales, it was impossible to state how many of these public interest immunity claims were “bogus and evasive or legitimate and necessary”.Earlier this year, the federal government refused to release a 32-page document outlining its draft response to a parliamentary inquiry that called for sweeping changes to gambling regulation.This week, the ACT independent senator David Pocock pushed for the documents to be published as part of a senate order for the production of documents.The Liberals and the Greens have given their support to the order, giving Labor until the end of the month to comply or explain why they will continue to keep the documents secret.Scott Morrison tells US Australia risks going to sleep on China threat after diplomatic ‘charm and flattery’Read moreIn May, the information commission revealed the federal government was refusing freedom of information requests at a rate not seen for a decade.At the time, the Transparency International Australia chief executive, Clancy Moore, said the FoI system was essential to ensuring accountability and integrity, but refusal rates suggested “important information about the functioning of government is being kept from everyday Australians”.The Centre for Public Intergity report did note some improvements to the FoI system, including faster processing times and a reduction in the backlog of decisions awaiting review.In 2023, the Australian Financial Review reported the prime minister’s office had initally refused to release his ministerial diary under freedom of information laws as it would“unreasonably divert”staff resources and unreasonably interfere with his job. The decison was subsequently reversed.Explore more on these topicsFreedom of informationAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

About 150,000 were considered active. Pointsbet alleges that more than 50% of Betr’s net win in January came from a tiny percentage of that customer base.Betr and Pointsbet were both contacted for comment.Australia’s had two more years of gambling ad harm since the Murphy report. It’s time for Labor to show some courage | Zoe DanielRead moreBoth companies declined to clarify whether the January 2025 figures cited by Pointsbet were representatives of Betr’s longer term financial and operational position. Pointsbet declined to state whether the January figures were an outlier.In its note to the ASX, Pointsbet told shareholders there were “meaningful risks associated with a VIP-heavy customer base” including greater “compliance and regulatory risks”.In May, Pointsbet was fined $500,800 by the Australian media regulator and subjected to enforceable undertakings after breaching spam and self-exclusion laws.The Australian Communications and Media Authority accused Pointsbet of sending 508 marketing messages to people who had self-excluded themselves from gambling.Two years ago, a landmark report by an inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy said gambling companies maintained “VIP programs to incentivise people they regard as high-value customers.”Financial Counselling Australia, which represents people who have been harmed by the gambling industry, told the inquiry that high-value customers are often individually managed by bookmaker staff and encouraged to keep gambling. The group did not name Betr in its submission.The Murphy inquiry also recommended the federal government ban all gambling advertising after a three-year transition period. So far, the federal government is yet to formally respond to that recommendation.The Albanese’s government’s plan to restrict gambling advertising was delayed until after the election in the face of strong opposition from sporting codes and broadcasters.5:54Does community sport and free-to-air TV in Australia need gambling ads to survive? – videoOn Wednesday, the communications minister, Annika Wells, told parliament the government had resumed consultation with broadcasters, major sporting groups and some harm reduction advocates.“I know the minister for social services [Tanya Plibersek] and myself have been working together on this and we are committed to continuing the work of the previous ministers from the first term,” Wells told question time.So far, sources familiar with the consultation say it has focused on identifying the main objections and testing support for compromises. They say the government intends to act by the end of the year.Wells did not commit to implementing Murphy’s recommendation to phase out all advertising for online gambling, but said “the work continues” on the government’s agenda to address gambling harms.Lobbyists for major gambling firms have also been seen in Parliament House this week.Explore more on these topicsGamblingLabor partyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The demonstrators gathered outside the presidential office, shouting anti-government slogans.They want him to scrap a controversial law that effectively places the agencies under government control. In a video address, Zelenskyy sought to deflect criticism by promising a new presidential bill.It would guarantee the independence of anti-corruption institutions and at the same time ensure there was “no Russian influence”, he said. “Of course, everyone has heard what people are saying these days – on social media, to each other, on the streets. It’s not falling on deaf ears,” he added.But the apparent concession left protesters unimpressed. They said Zelenskyy has not agreed to scrap the controversial aspects of Tuesday’s bill and pointed out that the Verkhovna Rada – Ukraine’s parliament, which approved the changes – has gone on holiday for the summer recess.Olha Ivanova, who has worked in the anti-corruption sector, said the government was calculating that the protests would fizzle out. She predicted they would continue. “Civil society is huge in Ukraine. From time to time we have to remind the people in power that we elect them,” she said.Ivanova held up a placard in English and Ukrainian that read: “Have you lost your mind?” She said she hoped Zelenskyy would reverse his decision, adding: “He’s not a dictator. Nobody would say this. He’s a president in a very difficult political context during a war.”Ukraine’s European backers including Germany, France and Sweden have echoed concerns about the new legislation, which the Ukrainian president approved on Tuesday night. They warned it couldhamper Kyiv’s attempt to join the EUand hinder the fight against corruption.The bill gives sweeping powers to the prosecutor general’s office. It can now decide which cases the two independent agencies – the national anti-corruption bureau and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office – are allowed to pursue.The two institutions have been key to fighting high-level corruption and protecting billions in international aid and investment. Critics say they have been stripped of their autonomy, making them indistinguishable from ordinary law enforcement bodies.Zelenskyy says the shake-up was needed to clean Ukraine’s “anti-corruption infrastructure” of alleged Russian connections. On Wednesday, he convened a meeting with the heads of law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies at his presidential office in Kyiv.Olena Kurnytska, a 21-year-old student at York University, took part in Wednesday’s protest for the first time. She waved a placard saying “I would like to see the future, not the flashbacks”. She said: “We feel like its our civic duty to be here. It’s an easy situation to exploit. A wartime government can twist democracy more easily.”Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, was one of several prominent European figures who voiced unhappiness at the legislative amendments. She had asked Zelenskyy for explanations and had conveyed to him her strong concerns, her spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenUrsula von der Leyen with Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a summit in Kyiv in February.Photograph: President of Ukraine/PAThey added: “The respect for the rule of law and the fight against corruption are core elements of theEuropean Union. As a candidate country, Ukraine is expected to uphold these standards fully. There cannot be a compromise.”In a pointed message to Kyiv, the EU’s defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, said trust during wartime was “easy to lose with one significant mistake by the leadership … Transparency and open European dialogue is the only way to repair [it].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crowd on Wednesday was larger than the night before. The street protests, which took place in several cities, were the first since Vladimir Putin’s 2022 full-scale invasion.Civil-society leaders have accused the presidential administration ofviolating an informal contract with society. They say the agreement with government – that it was inappropriate to criticise official abuses because of the war with Russia – is definitively over.0:50Protests in Ukraine as Zelenskyy approves law to weaken anti-corruption agencies - videoAbout 3,000 demonstrators gathereddirectly outside Zelenskyy’s administration complex on Wednesday evening, shouting slogans beneath his window. They included “shame”, “we are the power”, and “veto the law”.Posting earlier on Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians faced a “common enemy” in the shape of “Russian occupiers”. Of public criticism, he said: “We all hear what society says. We see what people expect from state institutions to ensure justice and the efficiency of each institution.”Yuriy Sak, a former adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry, said Ukrainians had a strong historical tradition of protesting against anything that resembled authoritarianism or dictatorship, in Soviet times and today.“It’s in our DNA. We have a very good sense for where the red line is, and for when people cross this line. If anyone tries to tighten their grip on power people pour into the streets,” he said, citing the uprisings in 2004 and 2014 against perceived government misrule.Sak likened the collective mood to the air raid alerts that sound most evenings, when Kyiv and other cities came under Russian missile attack. “Whenever we see authoritarianism on the move, a silent siren goes off in Ukrainian heads,” he suggested.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropeEuropean CommissionVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Local lawmaker Nebi Hatipoğlu and news website BirGün had earlier said 11 had died.High temperatures and strong winds have fanned the wildfire between Istanbul and the capital Ankara since Tuesday morning, with the spread threatening homes and forcing the evacuation of several villages.The victims were wrongfooted when the flames suddenly changed direction, causing them to be “burned alive”, according to BirGün.Twenty-four workers were caught in the “brusque evolution of the flames” of whom 14 were being treated in hospital, Yumakli told broadcasters on Wednesday evening.“Unfortunately, we have lost five forest workers and five (rescuers),” he added.Hatipoğlu, a deputy from the ruling AKP party, wrote on X there were “no words to describe our grief”.Turkey has been sweltering since Sunday under temperatures between 6C and 12C above the seasonal norms and several fires have been declared.Scientists have long warned that burning fossil fuels is making extreme weather events such as heatwaves more likely and more intense.Meanwhile firefighters inCypruswere battling on Wednesday to contain a huge wildfire forcing the evacuation of at least four villages on the first day of a heatwave that sent temperatures soaring.View image in fullscreenA wildfire near Karabuk, north-west Turkey.Photograph: Ridvan Bostanci/APAuthorities said the fire was raging in terrain north of the southern city of Limassol, stoked by strong winds and high temperatures. A fire brigade spokesperson said there had been “considerable damage” to homes in the region, known for its vineyards.The president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides said he had requested assistance to contain the fire under an EU assistance scheme, while neighbouring Jordan would be sending help.“The situation is very difficult and the fire front is huge. All forces have been mobilised,” he told reporters at the scene.Authorities said 14 aircraft and workers on the ground were trying to extinguish the blaze, which broke out around midday on Wednesday. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear.Temperatures on the east Mediterranean island hit 43C (109.4F) inland on Wednesday, forcing authorities to issue an amber weather warning. It was expected to climb further to 44C on Thursday, making it the hottest day of the year.Although heatwaves and forest fires are common, the impact on human life and the damage have become more pronounced in recent years.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyCyprusEuropeWildfiresEurope weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It could take a year to implement.Sources say, however, that France was the only country that called for the immediate implementation of the instrument, arguing it had to demonstrate it was tough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To make countermeasures “clearer, simpler and stronger we will merge lists 1 and 2 into a single list”, he said.Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the EU had missed an opportunity by not warning that it would use the ACI after a trade ministers’ summit early last week, two days after Trump sent it a letter threatening 30% tariffs.“There is a sense that the bloc has fumbled its hand, despite holding decent cards,” he said. “The EU should have immediately retaliated against US tariffs. While the mantra ‘negotiate from a position of strength’ was oft-repeated in speeches, any associated actions never materialised.”The latest EU move comes before a summit with China on Thursday between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU council, António Costa, and China’s president, Xi Jinping.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, she has doubled down on these claims and added more, including in an eight-part podcast series called Becoming Brigitte, the lawsuit alleges.The Macrons sought retractions from Owens, the suit says, for the “demonstrably false” claims she has made about them but she instead “mocked them and used them as additional fodder for her frenzied fan base”.“These outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions included that Mrs Macron was born a man, stole another person’s identity, and transitioned to become Brigitte; Mrs Macron and President Macron are blood relatives committing incest; President Macron was chosen to be the President ofFranceas part of the CIA-operated MKUltra program or a similar mind-control program; and Mrs Macron and President Macron are committing forgery, fraud, and abuses of power to conceal these secrets.“Because Ms Owens systematically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys’ repeated requests for a retraction, we ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue,” the Macrons said in a statement. “Ms Owens’ campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety. We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.”The falsehoods have taken a toll on the Macrons, who are now subjected to “a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”. Beyond the reputational damage, they have spent “considerable sums of money to correct the public record”, including on legal counsel.“Every time the Macrons leave their home, they do so knowing that countless people have heard, and many believe, these vile fabrications. It is invasive, dehumanizing, and deeply unjust,” the suit says.According to the Financial Times, the Macrons are willing to appear in court in Delaware for a trial. They are represented by Clare Locke, a heavyweight law firm that has won major defamation cases, including theDominion lawsuitagainst Fox News.The lawsuit came after the Macrons have sent three separate retraction demands to Owens that included evidence disproving her claims, which she has used to “further taunt the Macrons” and “invent even more damaging lies”, apress releasefrom Locke says.In a statement, a spokesperson for Owens said the commentator was “not shutting up”. Owens is expected to address the lawsuit on her show on Wednesday.“This is a foreign government attacking the first amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It’s America.”The shining: my trip to the G7 horror show with Emmanuel Macron | Emmanuel CarrèreRead moreIt is unusual for a sitting president to sue a journalist, though Donald Trump has filed multiple lawsuits, some of which have led to settlements, against US media outlets in recent months.Attacks on Brigitte Macron’s appearance and falsehoods about her gender havecirculatedfor years, though Owens amplified them considerably in the US. Other prominent women in politics, including Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris have faced these kinds of “secretly transgender” social media campaigns, the Wilson Center noted in a 2021 report on the “deeply misogynistic” trend. “These narratives tap into the trope of the duplicitous woman, implying that not only are transgender individuals inherently deceptive, but that this deception is responsible for the power and influence that these women hold,” the report said.The Macrons have previously filed legal claims against two women in France over their theory that Brigitte Macron is a biological male. They were initially found guilty of libel, though that was then overturned, which Brigitte Macron has now appealed.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFar right (US)Defamation lawMedia lawLaw (US)FranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A second accused Lammy of “complicity by inaction” and warned it could land him at the international court of justice in The Hague. A Lib Dem highlighted that repeated UK expressions of regret had not prevented further carnage.A clearly despairing Lammy attempted to reassure the politicians the government was playing its part. “Me raising my voice will not bring this war to an end. I lament that and I regret that. But am I sure that the UK government are doing everything in our power? Yes, I am.”But as international condemnation ofIsraelover the horrors it is inflicting on starving Palestinian civilians grows, Keir Starmer’s government is struggling to convince the British public that it is doing enough.The outrage in the Commons is reflected across the country more widely, withthe public increasingly regardingIsrael’s response since the7 October attacksas disproportionate, as the atrocities continued.The government has been on the defensive, pointing out that it hasrestored funding to the UN agency Unrwa, provided millions inhumanitarian assistance,sanctioned far-right Israeli ministersandthose who committed settler violence, andbroken off trade negotiations with Israel.But it has struggled to explain its export licensing regime. Ministers say they havestopped the sale of arms, despite there still being more than 300 licences in operation. These include, they say, body armour sent to protect NGO workers, chemicals for Israeli universities and components for goods which are then transported to Nato allies.In particular, there is anger at the UK decision to allow theexport of F-35 fighter jet componentsto Israel, which ministers argue is unavoidable because they are part of a global programme over which the UK does not have unilateral control.It exposes serious weaknesses in the regime and some believe the government should go further – with a fuller export embargo and an end to all military cooperation with Israel. Lammy has only recently sought to explain that RAF flights that overflyGazado not share information to help Israel conduct the war. “We are not doing that. I would never do that,” he said this week.Starmer is also under pressureto immediately recognise a Palestinian state, both from hisown backbenches,within his cabinetandfrom the wider diplomatic community.Ministers say the UK will “play its part” in working towards formal recognition, with a UN conference led by the French and Saudis later this month a key moment. Privately, they warn the move would only be symbolic unless there is a ceasefire first. But for many, who think the UK should be matching France’s more hardline stance, that is not a good enough reason not to. “If not now, then when?” one cabinet minister said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are you not hearing that?” a Labour MP asked. “How could I not?” the foreign secretary responded.But while Lammy may have got the message, he appears restricted by both the caution of the UK prime minister and the realpolitik that there is only one foreign power that could single-handedly force an end to the conflict: the US.“I wish we could, but the truth is … we are unable to do that just as the United Kingdom,” he told MPs. “We have to work in partnership with our allies.” But for many, that will not be enough.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDavid LammyForeign policyIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

He spends much of the day crying from hunger, or gnawing at his own emaciated fingers.At seven months old, he weighs barely 4kg (9lbs) and this is the second time he has been admitted for treatment. His face is gaunt, his limbs little more than bones covered in baggy skin and his ribs protrude painfully from his chest.“My biggest fear now is losing my grandson to malnutrition,” said his grandmother Faiza Abdul Rahman, who herself is constantly dizzy from lack of food. The previous day the only thing she ate was a single piece of pitta bread, which cost 15 shekels (£3).“His siblings also suffer from severe hunger. On some days, they go to bed without a single bite to eat.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Aliwa is in hospital with severe malnutrition.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The GuardianMohammed was born healthy but his mother was too malnourished to produce breast milk, and the family has only been able to get two cans of baby formula since.The ward at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society hospital is crowded with other skeletal children, some doubled up on the 12 beds. There are only two functioning paediatric teams left in Gaza City, and up to 200 children turn up daily seeking treatment.Dr Musab Farwana spends his days trying, but often failing, to save them. Then he goes home to share meals that are too small with his own hungry sons and daughters.The whole family are losing weight fast, because his salary buys almost nothing, and he doesn’t want to risk the deadly race for supplies handed out by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation after another medic, Dr Ramzi Hajaj, was killed trying to get food at one site.More than 40 of the 111 recorded starvation deaths in Gaza occurred over a three-day period this weekGaza has never been hungrier, despite several warnings about impending famine over the course of nearly two years of war. Over just three days this week public health officials recorded 43 deaths from hunger; there had been 68 in total before that.Faiza Abdul Rahman, who has stayed in Gaza City throughout the war, said even the time of the most intense controls on food entering northern Gaza last year were not as bad. “We faced hunger before, but never like this,” she said. “This is the hardest phase we’ve ever endured.”Testimony from local people and doctors, and data from the Israeli government, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the UN and humanitarian organisations, shows food is running out.Empty shelves are reflected in soaring prices, with flour selling for more than 30 times the market rate at the start of the year.Graphic showing rising price of flourEven money or influential employers can no longer protect Palestinians. “Humanitarian organisations are witnessing their own colleagues and partners waste away before their eyes,” more than 100 aid groups working in Gaza, including MSF, Save the Children and Oxfam, warned in a joint statement this week.The journalists’ union at AFP said on Monday that for the first time in the news agency’s historyit risks losing a colleague to starvation. On Wednesday the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,said a “large proportion” of Gaza’s population was starving. “I don’t know what you would call it other than mass-starvation – and it’s man-made,” he said.For months Israel has choked off food shipments. The total amounts allowed in since the start of March are well below starvation rations for the 2.1 million population, and Palestinians are already weakened by the impact of prolonged food shortages and repeated displacement.“For nearly two years, children here have suffered from famine. Even if some days they felt full, it’s not just about being full, it’s about receiving the nutrients the body needs. And those are completely absent,” said Farwana, the paediatrician.Those years of malnourishment make them more vulnerable to other diseases, and their low immunity is compounded by the severe shortages of basic medical supplies, which Israel has also blocked from entry.“Often, I feel devastated because there’s something so simple the child needs to survive, and we just can’t provide it,” he said. Three severely malnourished patients died in intensive care this week, one of them a girl who would have probably survived if doctors had been able to give her intravenous potassium, normally a basic medication, and now impossible to get hold of in Gaza.“We tried to give her oral alternatives, but due to her malnutrition and resulting complications, she had poor absorption.”“These cases haunt me, they never leave my mind. This child could have gone back to her family and lived a normal life. But because one simple thing wasn’t available she didn’t survive.”Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza from 2 March. When the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, lifted it on 19 May he claimed the government was acting to prevent a “starvation crisis”, because some of the country’s staunchest allies told him they would not tolerate images of famine.In fact the Israeli government simply shifted course to draw out the starvation crisis, letting in only minimal quantities of aid so that Gaza’s descent towards famine progressed a bit more slowly.The Israeli government announced plans to channel all aid through a secretive US-backed organisation that runs four militarised distribution points.Hundreds of people have been killed trying to get food handed out at sites Palestinians describe as “death traps”, which have handed out supplies that meet only a fraction of Gaza’s needs.By 22 July, GHF had been operating for 58 days but the food it had brought in would only have sustained the population of Gaza for less than a fortnight, even if it was distributed equally.View image in fullscreenThe Khalidi family children: Sabah, 12, Saba, 11, Zeina, 10, Ammera, two, Mohammed, seven, and Yousef, 13.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The GuardianOn Tuesday Umm Youssef al-Khalidi was preparing to try her luck at a GHF distribution centre for the first time. She had avoided them for months because her youngest child is two and her oldest 13 and her husband is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair.“We have been silencing our hunger with water,” she said. “My fear for my family is greater than my fear for myself. I fear something bad will happen to me, and I’ll leave them without anyone to care for them.”But her family went without food for four days last week, and when they broke the fast, eight of them had to share a bag of rice and two potatoes given to them by a passing stranger.The children were excellent students before the war, who always won scholarships. Now they spend their days sitting on the edge of the street under a bombed mosque in al-Wehda neighbourhood in Gaza City, where the girls try to sell bracelets rather than just begging.There is little demand for cheap jewellery in Gaza today, and although sometimes a passerby takes pity on the gang of skinny kids with dirty faces and tattered clothes, soaring prices means it buys little food.View image in fullscreenThe Khalidi family sit in front of the rubble of a bombed mosque while in front of them is a table where children sell bracelets made of beads.Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The Guardian“My children have become skeletal, skin and bone,” Khalidi said. “Even the slightest effort makes them dizzy. They sit down again, asking for food, and I have nothing to give. I can’t lie and say I’ll bring them something when I know I won’t be able to.”So she had decided that in the grim calculus of risks for her family, the hope of getting a little food finally outweighed the risk of losing the adult who held their lives together.Her husband’s phone had been stolen earlier in the war, so they would have no way to communicate over the long hours that she would spend trekking to the GHF site, then racing to try to get food, and walking back. The family would just have to wait and hope.“I have no one else to send,” she said. “It’s painful to watch them suffer, and their health gets worse every day they go without food.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelFamineHungernewsShareReuse this content"

At least 10 people have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, bringing the toll from hunger to 111, including 80 children, Gaza’s health authority said on Wednesday.Reports of people fainting from hunger on the long-walk towards the few aid distribution points and pictures of corpses with ribs jutting out have become commonplace.View image in fullscreenNajah Barbakh with her 11-month-old malnourished daughter, Seela, at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersDaily aid distribution averages the equivalent of about 28 trucks of humanitarian goods. Before the war, about 500 trucks of aid were let into Gaza to feed its more than 2 million residents.As starvation spreads, Israeli killings of civilians has increased. One person was killed by Israel every 12 minutes in July, making it one of the deadliest months of the Gaza war, ananalysis of UN datarevealed.On Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed at least 21 people, more than half of them women and children, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military said it was “deepening” activity in Gaza City and north Gaza.Among the dead were two Palestinian journalists, Tamer al-Za’anin, and Walaa al-Jabari, who was pregnant, bringing thenumber of media workers killed in the territory to 229since the start of the war.Israel has extended the detention of Dr Marwan al-Hams, the acting director of Gaza’s field hospitals, until the end of the month, Associated Press reported. Hams was arrested earlier this week and has a gunshot wound to his leg, which he reportedly sustained during his detention.Food in Gaza is now distributed by theUS and Israeli-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), whose sites have been described by UN officials as“death traps”.Previous Guardian reportingdescribed the dangers faced by Palestinians seeking food from GHF sites.View image in fullscreenPalestinians rush towards aid trucks as they enter Gaza through the Zikim border crossing in the north of the territory.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockThe GHF claims it prevents the Palestinian groupHamasfrom stealing food via its distribution sites, a point echoed by Israel. Humanitarians have widely condemned the organisation for what they say is a violation of aid principles and potential complicity in the war crime of weaponising starvation.UN officials report that the Israeli military haskilled more than 1,000 Palestinianstrying to reach food distribution sites since the end of May.Israel has killed at least 72 Palestiniansin the past 24 hours, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel alsoattacked World Health Organization facilitiesin Deir al-Balah, and cancelled the visa of the most senior UN aid official in Gaza.Global outcry grows over Israel’s killing of starving civilians in GazaRead moreAs Israeli military activity in Gaza intensified, momentum for a ceasefire seemed to be growing. The US envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,was heading to Rome on Wednesday, where he was expected to meet the top Israeli adviser, Ron Dermer, and Palestinian negotiators.If progress is made on the deal, Witkoff will travel to Doha, where indirect negotiations have been taking place between the two parties.Over the past week, gaps have been slowly bridged between Hamas and Israel on the ceasefire deal, though serious obstacles remain. An Israeli source said Israel was still awaiting a Hamas response, which was expected in the coming day.On 21 July,28 countries, including the UKand other Israeli allies,issued a statementcalling for an end to the war in Gaza and labelling Israel’s “denial of essential humanitarian assistance” as “unacceptable”. The statement also spoke againstIsraeli settler violencein the West Bank, as well as Israeli plans to move Palestinians into a “humanitarian city”, which has been described by a former Israeli prime minister as a “concentration camp” and tantamount to ethnic cleansing.The statement, while strongly worded, did not threaten sanctions or mention any concrete policy steps that would be taken against the Israeli government if it did not change course.Wednesday’s letter from the humanitarian organisations calls for direct action. “Piecemeal arrangements and symbolic gestures, like airdrops or flawed aid deals, serve as a smokescreen for inaction. They cannot replace states’ legal and moral obligations to protect Palestinian civilians and ensure meaningful access at scale,” it says.Israel’s military said that it “views the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a matter of utmost importance”, and worked to facilitate its entry in coordination with the international community.It has denied accusations it is preventing aid from reaching Gaza and has accused Hamas of stealing food, an allegation that the militant group denies.More than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza by Israel’s military campaign there, which started after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

It was “a stain on the conscience of the international community”, and Israel’s “war of aggression” was a “grave sin”, said Stephen Cottrell, the de facto leader of the Church of England.The strength of the language used by Cottrell is a reflection of rapidly shifting opinion as images emerge fromGazaof starving children and accounts of civilians being killed as they try to secure food for their families.In Starmer’s cabinet, there has been a growing sense of horror and despair in recent weeks over Israel’s actions and the scenes inGaza. This week, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, publicly called for recognition while there was “still a state of Palestine left to recognise” and condemned Israeli actions that went “well beyond legitimate self-defence”.On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, urged the UK government to recognise a Palestinian state immediately, saying the scenes in Gaza were “absolutely harrowing”.In astatement on X, he wrote: “The international community – including our own government – must do far more to pressure the Israeli government to stop this horrific, senseless killing and let vital, life-saving aid in. Nothing justifies the actions of the Israeli government.”The letter to Starmer, which was signed by more than 30 former UK ambassadors and 20 former senior British diplomats at the United Nations, said the status quo in Gaza could be broken by recognising the state of Palestine.“The risks of inaction have profound, historic and catastrophic implications,” it said. The state of Israel “cannot be secure from threats in the future if the question of Palestine is not taken forward to a political settlement”.It added: “In the face of the current horror and impunity, words are not enough … A partial suspension of arms sales, delays on trade talks and limited sanctions are far from the full extent of the pressure the UK can bring to bear on Israel.”Recognising a Palestinian state would be a “foundational first step towards breaking the deadly status quo”, the letter said.Signatories included the former UK ambassadors to Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Syria and Turkey.The letter reflects deep concern among former diplomats that Starmer appears reluctant to engage with the Middle East crisis, or understand that ineffective action will do little to assuage British reputation in the region.One of the signatories said the letter reflected a strong current of opinion inside the Foreign Office over the recognition issue, but such a claim is hard to test.View image in fullscreenStephen Cottrell, who has assumed many of the archbishop of Canterbury’s official functions since the resignation of Justin Welby, called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersCottrell’s statement, issued on Wednesday, said: “With each passing day in Gaza, the violence, starvation and dehumanisation being inflicted on the civilian population by the government of Israel becomes more depraved and unconscionable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a stain on the conscience of the international community, and a flagrant breach of international humanitarian law.”He added: “I have condemned many times the horrific Hamas attacks on 7 October, and I continue to call for the release of those still cruelly held hostage. We deplore every assault on the innocent. But … this war is now one of aggression – it is a grave sin and it must stop.”Cottrell called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and captives and for the rebuilding of Gaza. Any policy “that would amount to the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population from Gaza” must be rejected, he said.Earlier on Wednesday, 111 aid organisations said“mass starvation” was spreading in Gazaas a result of continued Israeli restrictions on how aid arrived and was distributed in the territory.The organisations, including Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Save the Children and Oxfam, said: “Our colleagues and those we serve are wasting away.” Israel claims aid is being allowed to enter Gaza but it is being stolen by Hamas.There have been repeated incidents of civilians being shot while trying to access food from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an organisation backed by Israel that replaced the UN aid infrastructure in May. The UN says Israeli forces have since killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, whosaid he felt “appalled, sickened”by the scenes of starving Palestinians being shot as they sought food, said Britain would “play its part” in reaching a two-state solution.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmerForeign policyLabourAnglicanismIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Narendra Modi will meet his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, to sign alandmark free trade agreementbetween India and the UK.The mistakes emerged when the senior coroner for London Inner West, Dr Fiona Wilcox, sought to verify the repatriated Britons’ identities by matching their DNA with samples provided by the families, the Mail reported.A London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a medical college shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on 12 June, killing 241 people onboard, of whom 52 were returning Britons. Another 19 people died on the ground and 67 were seriously injured.A preliminary report found the plane’sfuel switches had been moved to cut-off, deepening the mystery of what happened and leaving families distressed and seeking answers. The report from India’s aircraft accident investigation bureau, published on 10 July, said both of the plane’s fuel switches moved to the cut-off position immediately after takeoff, stopping fuel supply to the engines.While some of the dead were cremated or buried in India, the remains of at least 12 victims had been repatriated, said James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer representing many of the British families.He said he was expecting Starmer to raise these issues with Modi this week at their meeting in London. “The families deserve urgent answers and assurances about the whereabouts of their loved ones,” said Healy-Pratt, who told the Mail he was looking into what had happened during the identification process.“I’ve been sitting down in the homes of these lovely British families over the last month, and the first thing they want is their loved ones back. But some of them have got the wrong remains and they are clearly distraught over this. It has been going on for a couple of weeks [and] I think these families deserve an explanation.”He said while the family who received the “commingled” remains had been able to have them separated to hold a funeral service, the second family had been left “in limbo”.“[They] have no one to bury because it was the wrong person in their casket. And if isn’t their relative, the question is, who is it in that coffin? Presumably it’s another passenger and their relatives have been given the wrong remains.”He added: “The coroner also has a problem because she has an unidentified person in her jurisdiction.”Approached by the Mail, Wilcox said it would be inappropriate for her to comment.Healy-Pratt said the families were in contact with their MPs, the Foreign Office and the offices of the prime minister and the foreign secretary.“On the known evidence, the chain of custody of these lost loved ones was unacceptably poor,” he said. “We are investigating the causes of those failures and demanding answers on behalf of these deserving British families.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Communication was poor. Processes were unclear. And concerns raised by bereaved families – both in India and the UK – were often met with silence.“We will continue to call for transparency, truth, and accountability, not just for ourselves, but for every family affected.”Air India said it had no comment on the report of the wrong remains being sent back. But an airline official, who wished to remain unnamed, noted that the airline had not been involved in the identification of the remains. “It was the hospital, they who were the ones who confirmed the next-of-kin matches,” they said.Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s ministry of external affairs, said: “We have seen the report and have been working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention.”He added that “in the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.”A senior official of the Ahmedabad civil hospital, which was involved in coordinating the identification efforts, said: “Everything was done on a highly scientific basis.” He declined to comment further.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsiaPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

ForIndia, it marks its first major free trade pact outside Asia. For both, analysts say, the agreement signals a long-term economic partnership.“The UK and India, in many ways we have complementarities. We have had a historical relationship. It’s good to have a deeper trade relationship,” said Indian economist Sanjaya Baru.During Modi’s two-day official visit starting on Wednesday, his fourth to the UK as prime minister, he will hold “wide-ranging” talks with his counterpart,Keir Starmer, on trade, defence, technological cooperation and security, and will also pay a courtesy call on King Charles, according to an Indian government statement.India stood firm on key demands during negotiations, winning concessions on work visas, recognition of professional qualifications, and exemptions from national insurance contributions for Indian nationals working temporarily in the UK, all longstanding sticking points.Modi, accompanied by his commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, who led the negotiations, can claim India held its ground while the UK compromised, bolstering his message of India’s rising global clout. However, the deal must still be ratified by both parliaments, likely delaying implementation until mid-2026.Under the agreement, 99% of Indian exports to the UK, spanning gems, textiles, engineering goods, leather, garments, and processed foods, will face zero tariffs. In return, the UK will see phased tariff cuts on 90% of its exports to India. Duties on scotch whisky will fall from 150% to 75% immediately and to 40% over 10 years.British cars, now facing tariffs of more than 100%, will see duties slide to 10% under a quota. Other gains include tariff relief on medical devices, pharmaceuticals, aircraft parts, and electronics.India’s government hopes the agreement will inject new energy into itsMake in Indiadrive and revive foreign direct investment, which has slowed significantly. “More than 5m export-related jobs in India can be linked to UK exports,” said Amrita Saha, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex. “Overall, I believe this agreement is a positive step for India’s labour-intensive sectors,” she told the Hindu newspaper.Crucially, India kept agriculture, an industry that employs more than 40% of its workforce, off the table. This red line for New Delhi has also stalled its trade talks with the US.Still, only the broad contours of the agreement, which marks a significant departure from India’s traditionally protectionist trade stance, are public. “We will have to look at the fine print the morning after,” Baru cautioned.Some provisions, such as phased duty cuts on scotch and cars, could face backlash from domestic producers. Indian whisky makers have already voiced worries about “unfair competition” from imports. Also, in a significant first, British firms will gain access to India’s vast government procurement market, a potential breakthrough for sectors such as clean energy, transport, and infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The policy, which would levy taxes on imports from countries with looser emissions rules, is seen by India as unfairly targeting developing economies.For now, the two sides appear to have kicked that issue down the road. However, “the carbon tax remains the elephant in the room. It could wipe out the benefits of the free trade agreement for Indian exporters,” warned Ajay Srivastava, head of the Global Trade Research Initiative in New Delhi.This article was amended on 23 July 2025.

It is thought to be one of the first structures communally constructed by humans.Jeffery said: “The fact it has survived at all demonstrates how well constructed it was and how monumental in the landscape back in its time.”View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Dudderhouse Hill long cairn in the Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: The Historic England ArchiveThe long cairn, which was built by a Neolithic farming community who were the successors to hunter-gatherers and lived in caves and stone huts, may have had a number of purposes.One of those was funerary, as a “home for the dead”, although not for whole bodies. Evidence suggests the deceased were left to the birds and elements before body parts were ritualistically interred in the monument.Long cairns may also have been positioned, like Stonehenge, to help communities know when seasons started and ended.Heritage groups try to save decaying modernist studio in Scottish BordersRead moreAnother function of the long cairn was to say “this is our land”, said Jeffery. “Building a structure like that would have taken a lot of people a significant amount of time. They would have had to be fed by others, there would have been specialist stonemasons and engineers – a lot of effort would have been invested into those structures. They are a statement of ‘this is us’, ‘we are here’.”Research suggests the long cairn was used as an animal pen in the 16th century and in more recent years has been damaged by people removing and moving stones, sometimes innocently to create way markers for walkers.“The problem is this causes sustained and considerable damage over time,” said Jeffery. “People might only be taking one stone and don’t realise the harm they’re doing. If it was left unchecked, eventually the evidence for its existence would be lost completely.”Scheduled monument status means the long cairn will receive the highest level of protection available and means the national park authority can carry out a project to educate people about the site’s importance.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “Scheduling this remarkable neolithic long cairn ensures that this rare and fragile piece of our prehistoric heritage receives the protection it deserves.”Explore more on these topicsYorkshireNorth YorkshireNorth of EnglandHeritageWalkingNational parksEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And you may not need to walk as far as previously thought to reap those benefits.The NHS recommendsa brisk 10-minute walk every day. Many people aim to walk 10,000 steps, but struggle to achieve it. Now researchers have calculated that even 7,000 steps could be enough to protect health.Scientists examined data from more than 160,000 adults and found that walking 7,000 steps a day was associated with a reduced risk of a number of serious health conditions and death.Whereas previous studies have mainly examined the links between step count and heart health or overalldeath rates, this systematic review and meta analysis, published in the Lancet Public Health,sought to comprehensively examine how taking more steps per day could reduce the risk of a range of other health conditions as well.Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, the researchers found that achieving the 7,000 daily step target was linked to a 37% reduction in risk of dying from cancer, while the risk was 14% lower for type 2 diabetes, 38% for dementia, 22% depression and 28% for falls respectively. It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchFitnessWalkingHealth & wellbeingNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

India’s average tariff rate is 13%, compared with the UK’s 1.5%.Labour ministers clinched the deal within 10 months of entering government, defying expectations – above all their own – about how quickly it could be done.The negotiations were led byJonathan Reynolds, the trade secretary, and his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal. Half a dozen UK officials and aides said the rapport between the pair and a focus on building trust and good relationships were critical to getting it over the line.That sometimes happened in creative ways. After Goyal told them he was a huge fan ofYes Minister, British negotiators brought him a handwritten note from Jonathan Lynn, one of the show’s co-creators.View image in fullscreenJonathan Reynolds first met Piyush Goyal on a visit to Delhi in February. Their rapport is said to have been critical to getting the deal over the line.Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters“Negotiating with India is not the same as negotiating, say, with Australia, or the USA, or Canada. It’s a relationship-based system, very much about who gets on with who and ensuring that you don’t insult anyone in any way,” said one senior UK official who has been closely involved in talks.“People want to get to know you, they want to look you in the eye and be convinced that you are someone they can do business with,” another senior UK official said. “And to some extent, the last year has been a bit of the two governments looking each other in the eye.”This meant a key task for British diplomats in India – including the high commissioner, Lindy Cameron, and the trade commissioner, Harjinder Kang – was to provide UK ministers and officials with something akin to relationship advice on dealing with their Indian counterparts.There were moments of comedy. At one point after a difficult set of negotiations, UK and Indian officials let off steam by doingyogain the corridor outside the room.On another occasion, the British negotiators led by Kate Thornley were at the airport in Delhi about to fly home when they received a call from the Indian side saying they were prepared to make key concessions on food and drink. A negotiator who had not yet gone through airport security turned on his heels to rush back to the negotiation room.“You have moments where it’s almost collapsing, and you have moments where you think you’ve got it over the line,” the first senior official said. “Until there’s ink on a piece of paper, it’s fluid.”Political signalling was crucial. Reynolds first met Goyal when Labour was in opposition, while he and David Lammy were visiting Delhi in February 2024. India and the UK were due to hold elections that year, with Modi widely expected to win a third term and Labour on course to end 14 years of Tory government.The trip was a particularly sensitive one for Labour, which was working to mend relations with India after a nadir in 2019 when Jeremy Corbyn was perceived to havesided with Pakistan over Kashmir.Lammy and Reynolds were having dinner with Indian investors and had not expected to meet Goyal, who like other ministers was occupied with the budget debate in parliament. But during dinner they got a message from Goyal inviting them to his home nearby for a nightcap.Over 11pm chai and kheer, Reynolds and Lammy made it clear that they would support the Conservative government if it finalised a trade deal with India – and would pick up the negotiations after the election if it didn’t.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Narendra Modi reiterated their ambition for a deal when they met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/ReutersA few months later, during the thick of the UK election campaign, Lammy addressed the India Global Forum and said a trade deal with the country was “a floor, not a ceiling, of our ambitions”. He travelled to Delhi in late July, having promised Modi’s government that he would visit in his first month as foreign secretary.“There was an element of, these guys actually mean what they say,” a senior UK official recalled. “In their manifesto, there’s only one country that gets a mention – that’s India. All these positive signals were received.”In November,Starmer and Modi meton the margins of the G20 summit in Brazil and reiterated their ambition for a deal. But, in the months that followed, there was a lull in negotiations which created some frustration on the Indian side, fuelling suspicions that it was not as much a priority for Labour as it had been for the Tories.In truth, Reynolds’s team considered a trade deal with India to be a medium-term goal, one that was unlikely to materialise until later in the parliament. And instead of getting back around the negotiating table straight away, ministers spent several months combing through what had been already agreed under the Conservatives. “We were going through it and bringing ministers of all departments up to speed,” said a senior UK official.In February, a year after first meeting Goyal, Reynolds travelled to Delhi toformally restart negotiations. Progress in those talks significantly exceeded officials’ expectations – and crucially the two sides agreed not to reopen the aspects of the deal negotiated under the Tories. “Things started to fall into place at such a pace,” a government source recalled. A few weeks later Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, who has also been closely involved in the talks, hosted the Indian finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, in 11 Downing Street.View image in fullscreenNirmala Sitharaman, India’s finance minister, met Rachel Reeves in London in April; they attended the UK-India economic and financial dialogue at the London Stock Exchange Group.Photograph: Justin Tallis/PASignificant headway in the negotiations had been made under Rishi Sunak, whose chief economic adviser, Douglas McNeill, would travel to India every other month for talks. Before the Indian and UK electionsstopped things in their tracks, Conservative officials had hoped a deal could be struck by the autumn of 2024.The Tories were hamstrung by two obstacles which disappeared when Labour came into power. The first was Sunak’s political weakness and sense he was on borrowed time. The second and most significant was Tory angst that the deal would trigger an influx of Indian migration. Suella Braverman, as the home secretary,nearly blew up the talksover the issue in 2022.Kemi Badenoch claimed this year that as Sunak’s trade secretary, she stopped a deal with India because of immigration concerns – a claim which some of her former cabinet colleagues have disputed. A Labour source said Goyal “found her disingenuous in that she would always try to present Indian asks around visas as much more than they are”.The final dealdoes not change immigration policy beyond facilitating visa routes in certain sectors and allowing up to 1,800 extra visas for Indian chefs, musicians and yogis a year.The agreement was finalised on 2 May by Goyal, Reynolds and their teams of negotiators over ice-cream on a sunny walk in Hyde Park. They celebrated with coffee by the lido and took pictures together in the park cafe. Civil servants worked intensively that bank holiday weekend before Starmer and Modi spoke on Tuesday to confirm the deal was done.UK hopes have since faded, however, about the chances of agreeing a separate bilateral investment treaty with India, coveted by the UK because of the benefits for the City of London. While negotiations over a treaty continue, multiple ministers and officials privately told the Guardian that they are unlikely to yield anything unless there is significant movement on the Indian side.Nonetheless, officials are bullish about what has been achieved. “People said it would never be done,” one said. “People said this is a country that doesn’t like to do deals, it’s a very protectionist society. They’re changing, they’re growing, they’re developing to become a much more modern economy. They need this is much as we do.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyIndiaJonathan ReynoldsEconomic policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Now, our priority is unity and action.“Teachers have endured years of underinvestment, overwork, and undervaluing of our profession. We urgently need government to invest in education – that means fair pay, manageable workloads, and safe, respectful working environments for staff and students.“I will work tirelessly with our executive and activists across all nations to secure the conditions and respect teachers deserve. This is a critical moment for education, and NASUWT will lead the way in fighting for our members’ rights.”Wayne Broom, the NASUWT national president, said: “This election engaged our members up and down the country, and the result reflects their confidence in his leadership.“Matt will play a vital role in the next chapter of the union’s work on behalf of teachers across the UK. The national executive and I look forward to working closely with him as we continue our mission to put teachers first.“We also want to thank Neil Butler for standing in this election and for his ongoing service to NASUWT – his dedication exemplifies the strength of this union’s democracy.”Wrack was named as the executive’s preferred candidate for general secretary in March. Under NASUWT rules he would have automatically filled the position if no other candidate received enough nominations from local branches.Butler’s initial attempt to collect nominations was ruled out on the grounds that, as an employee, he was not a member of the union. He launched legal proceedings and the NASUWT backed down shortly before a hearing at the high court. Wrack was named acting general secretary and nominations were reopened.Only 4.7% of the NASUWT’s 178,306 eligible members took part in the ballot. Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, was elected in 2023 on a 9% turnout.Explore more on these topicsEducationTeachingTrade unionsWalesFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

The advertising watchdog described the model’s collarbones as “very prominent”.It added that the model wore “large pointed shoes which emphasised the slenderness of her legs” and: “In part due to the camera angle which appeared tilted downwards, the model’s head appeared out of proportion with the rest of her body and further highlighted her small frame.”M&S argued in its submission to the ASA that its “inclusive women’s wear clothing” represented sizes eight to 24. However, it acknowledged that the models in the ads were size eight, and therefore at the lower end of its sizing range.The retailer said it “took concerns about the depiction of body image in their ads very seriously”, “all models were in good health”, and that it “complied with industry standards and best practices to avoid promoting unhealthy body images”.The ASA ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and M&S must ensure all its images “did not portray models as being unhealthily thin”.M&S confirmed that the images had been removed.The ASA said it also received complaints about three other adverts on the M&S app, website and in an email for the company, where two models wear a pink polka-dot dress.In its investigation, it said the model’s face “did not look gaunt”, adding that “while thin, her arms and the leg visible in the shot did not display any protruding bones”.“The model appeared in proportion and we considered that she was not presented as unhealthily thin overall,” the ruling concluded.The other images in the ad, which featured another model, also “showed the model in proportion. We also considered that the model did not appear unhealthily thin in those shots.”The ruling comes amid concerns that the fashion industry is reversing progress made in the body positivity movement in the 2010s due to a recent trend towards skinnier models.Earlier this year,the ASA banned a Next advertfor featuring what it deemed an “unhealthily thin” model in digitally altered clothing.In 2023, it banned Warehouse from using an image of a model in an oversized biker jacket, saying the model’s pronounced collar bone, hip bones and torso gave the appearance of her being “very thin”, which made the ad “irresponsible”.M&S has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerAdvertisingAdvertising Standards AuthorityRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

One leading theory is that ageing equipment belonging to Southern California Edison, the primary electricity provider in the region, ignited the fire.If the utility company is found to have been responsible for igniting the devastating January blaze, then the “financial health of the fund could be strained”, according to documentspublishedby California’s Catastrophe Response Council, a group of lawmakers and members of the public who oversee the state’s wildfire fund.California lawmakers established the state’s $21bn wildfire fund in 2019 in an effort to prevent the state’s largest utility companies from declaring bankruptcy if their equipment caused a fire. The fund is made up of money the utility companies contribute and a surcharge on customers’ utility bills.Power lines and other utility equipment are a top cause of wildfires in drought-ridden California – and have sparked some of the state’s most devastating blazes including the 2018 Camp fire that killed more than 80 people. Although investigators are still determining the cause of the Eaton fire, the utility company has been under scrutiny since the blaze broke out.The wildfire fund is overseen by a seven-member council that includes the governor, insurance commissioner, treasurer and secretary for natural resources, members of the public and lawmakers. Before the council’s scheduled 24 July meeting, the group published minutes from its 1 May meeting and a draft annual report to the legislature. Those documents suggest that insurance claims from the Eaton fire could drain its resources entirely.Insured losses for both wildfires that devastated southern California in January – the Eaton and the Palisades fires – range from $20bn to $45bn, according to estimates from financial services companies, such as Moody’s and Milliman, and the University of California at Los Angeles Anderson School of Management.The risk management firm Verisk estimates that insured losses from the Eaton fire alone could reach$15.2bn.Those estimates have prompted the fund council to warn that, if it is determined that the Eaton fire was sparked by utility equipment, “the resulting claims may be substantial enough to fully exhaust the Fund”.The losses could far exceed the fund pending ongoing lawsuits. Dozens of families who lost homes in the Eaton fire have sued Southern California Edison. If investigators determine the blaze was sparked by utility equipment, the state fund would also be responsible for paying any settlements in those lawsuits.Charred chimneys are all that’s left of these LA midcentury homes. Inside the quest to save themRead moreThe documents published before the council’s meeting include strategies its members are considering in consultation with experts to ensure the financial durability of the fund. The committee also drafted a letter stating that “they want to make sure most of the Fund is going to wildfire recovery experts and not third-party actors”, such as hedge funds or attorneys.The council documents note that hedge funds are purchasing insurance industrysubrogation rights, or the right to the insurance claim, in an attempt to profit from the wildfires. By doing so, hedge funds are agreeing to pay the insurance claim, but would take home any winnings from a legal settlement if Southern California Edison is found liable.The California Earthquake Authority, which administers the fund under the oversight of the council, alsotold the Los Angeles Timesthat it worries attorney fees could shrink the fund further (up to half of settlement amounts can go to legal fees).Another tactic may include paying out “only reasonable claims”. In notes to the fund administrator, one council member asks their colleagues to consider requiring utility companies to “settle claims with diligence” – since the fund, not the utilities, ultimately pay those settlements.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresInsurance industryCaliforniaWildfiresWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Among the supporters are multiple Democratic lawmakers including California’s Ro Khanna and Ted Lieu, as well as The Daily Show’sAasif Mandvi, comedianKristen Schaal, Veep executive producerDavid Mandeland actorFrances Fisher.The petition, led by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee,condemnedParamount’s decision as “blatantly political”, adding: “America needs Stephen Colbert’s voice now more than ever. Save the Late Show.”PCCC’s co-founder, Adam Green, said: “This is so much bigger than one TV show or even one network. This is about the distressing trend of people in institutions pre-emptively caving and complying to a White House that has shown it will abuse power.“If dissenting voices like Stephen Colbert’s can be silenced, in addition to universities losing their leadership and law firms being co-opted, that is yet another step down the road to tyranny and authoritarianism,” Green added.View image in fullscreenProtesters arrive at Paramount headquarters in Times Square on Wednesday.Photograph: Maya Yang/GuardianView image in fullscreenThe boxes of petitions.Photograph: Maya Yang/GuardianThe widespread outrage in recent days follows Paramount’s sudden decision to cancel the show, which came after Paramount settled what the Writers Guild of Americacondemnedas a “baseless lawsuit” brought against 60 Minutes and CBS News by Donald Trump for $16m. Trump had claimed that CBS News misleadingly edited an interview withKamala Harrislast fall during the presidential campaign.Following Paramount’s settlement, Colbert – who has long been a critic of Trump on his show –calledParamount’s settlement a “big, fat bribe” on air last week.“As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended … I don’t know if anything – anything – will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16m would help,” Colbert said.CBS executivessaidthat the decision to cancel the show was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night”, adding that it was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount”.The public remains unconvinced. Outside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Wednesday afternoon, dozens of protesters includingNew Yorklawmakers and former Paramount subscribers gathered in opposition.Many carried signs in protest againstCBSand Paramount, with some saying: “Dump Trump. Keep Colbert”, “This is Complete Bull Shit” and “Don’t Bow to the Orange King”.Addressing the crowd, Susan Staal, a longtime viewer of the show, said: “This country needs dissenting voices. This country has comedians, secondary to journalists, who are now being infringed on free speech, the bedrock of this democracy … We know how bogus and sinister this decision actually was.”Echoing similar sentiments, Heather Cousins, a former Paramount subscriber, called the show’s cancellation a “blatant act of bribery and against our constitutional rights of free speech”, adding: “Paramount and CBS are destroying culture and history in New York City. The Late Show is a representation of hope in a time where our country has very little.”View image in fullscreenAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, at the Save Colbert rally on Wednesday.Photograph: Maya Yang/GuardianSaima Akhter, a former Meta employee who said she was fired by the company last year over her anti-war activism on Palestine, also addressed the crowd, warning of growing attempts at censorship.“We have a serious problem in this country of censorship of information, the silencing of people who speak out against fascist rules imposed by this government and the oligarchy, and the dangerous ties between fascist Trump, bought-out politicians and … corrupt corporations,” Akhter said.She went on: “The control of narrative is the most powerful thing someone can possess … and at a time where things feel so crazy, we need voices like Colbert to be a voice of reason, to say it like it is.”The Democratic lawmakers Tony Simone, a New York state assembly member, and New York City council member Erick Bottcher joined the protesters.“I want to tell the institutions in our nation, from higher ed to the media to CBS: stop kissing Trump’s ass … This [show] is a New York institution, an American institution,” Simone said, adding: “We must save Colbert, we must have him back on air … When you come for one American, you come for all of us.”Similarly, Bottcher said: “We are not just standing in front of a theater. We are standing up for truth, for free press, for democracy, for free speech. The cancellation … isn’t just a bad programming decision, it is a political decision.”Bottcher continued: “This is about fear and pre-compliance infecting our institutions from the newsroom to the boardroom … According to CBS, it was a financial decision. We’re not stupid … We see what’s happening. We will not let a powerful media company silence a truth-teller to appease fascists.”Following the speeches, protesters wound through the streets of Midtown Manhattan, chanting “Save Colbert” and “Fight back!” Accompanying them was a tuba player and a drummer wearing a hat that said: “Make Orwell fiction again”, a nod to the Nineteen Eighty-Four author.Upon arriving outside the Paramount headquarters, the protesters were met with several security guards, as well as two New York police officers, who prevented them from entering the building.As protesters put the boxes of petitions outside the building entrance, one woman held up a sign.“Only a butterfly should be a monarch,” it read.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertProtestCBSTrump administrationNew YorkUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It could take a year to implement.Sources say, however, that France was the only country that called for the immediate implementation of the instrument, arguing it had to demonstrate it was tough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To make countermeasures “clearer, simpler and stronger we will merge lists 1 and 2 into a single list”, he said.Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the EU had missed an opportunity by not warning that it would use the ACI after a trade ministers’ summit early last week, two days after Trump sent it a letter threatening 30% tariffs.“There is a sense that the bloc has fumbled its hand, despite holding decent cards,” he said. “The EU should have immediately retaliated against US tariffs. While the mantra ‘negotiate from a position of strength’ was oft-repeated in speeches, any associated actions never materialised.”The latest EU move comes before a summit with China on Thursday between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU council, António Costa, and China’s president, Xi Jinping.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionTrump tariffsTariffsEconomicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft said it had observed attacks where the attackers had sent a request to a SharePoint server “enabling the theft of the key material”.Microsoft said it had released security updates and advised all users of on-premises SharePoint systems to install them. It warned that it assessed with “high confidence” that the hacking groups would continue to attack unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that it had subsequently scanned more than 8,000 publicly accessible SharePoint servers around the world and had “identified dozens of compromised systems, confirming that attackers are conducting a coordinated mass exploitation campaign”.Microsoft said Linen Typhoon had been “focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organisations related to government, defence, strategic planning, and human rights” since 2012.It added that since 2015 Violet Typhoon had been “dedicated to espionage, primarily targeting former government and military personnel, non-governmental organisations, thinktanks, higher education, digital and print media, financial and health related sectors in the United States, Europe, and east Asia”.Microsoft said it had “medium confidence” that the third group, Storm-2603, was based in China, but said it had not established links between the group and other Chinese threat actors.

This meant the former banker was ultimately “deprived” of a fair trial.The judges stopped short of fully exonerating Hayes, saying there was “ample evidence” that could have led a jury, if properly directed, to find him guilty. “But the jury was not properly directed,” the ruling explained, adding: “The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.”The judgment, which follows a three-day hearing in March, ends a long-running legal battle for the 45-year-old and could lead to several other convictions being quashed in the UK.The ruling also marks a blow for theSerious Fraud Office, which brought the original charges. It said it would not be seeking a retrial.Outside court Hayes said: “I had 10 years to try and figure out what I was going to say at this moment … It feels very surreal, a little bit like my conviction, like it’s not really happening to me.“It’s a day that I dreamt about and hoped for whilst I was lying in prison cells.”He added: “I’m just very grateful to all the justices who heard the appeal. I’m very grateful to all the people who supported me, the strangers and friends alike and … a legal team who’ve worked long hours for little money at times when other people wouldn’t.”When asked whether he would seek financial compensation, Hayes told the Guardian: “I need to talk to my legal team about what civil remedies I might have, whether some money they took from me I might get back. But really it’s not about money today … family and friends, your liberty and your health – those are the things that are really important.”View image in fullscreenThe justices said the history of the cases of Hayes and Palombo ‘raises concerns about the effectiveness of the criminal appeal system in England and Wales in confronting legal error’.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe court also quashed the conviction of the former Barclays trader Carlo Palombo, who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2019 for rigging Euribor – the euro version ofLibor. It stated that Palombo’s original case was also compromised as a result of directions by the judge.Hayes was still on probation after spending five and a half years of an 11-year term in prison, having been accused of being a ringleader in a vast conspiracy to fix the now-defunct London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) – which was used to price trillions of pounds worth of financial products – between 2006 and 2010.The wider scandal, which erupted in 2012, led to fines of almost $10bn (£7.4bn) for a dozen banks and brokerages. Hayes maintained his innocence and claimed during his original trial that he was taking part in an “industry-wide” practice, accusing regulators ofmaking him a scapegoat.He was charged by both British and US prosecutors in 2015 and convicted and jailed in the UK that year. He was released fromprison in January 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2022 US judges had overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders,Matthew Connolly and Gavin Black, for their part in an alleged Libor-rigging scheme. That decision led to all charges against Hayes being dropped in the US.The Hayes case was subsequentlyreferredto the court of appeal in 2023 by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body that investigates potential miscarriages of justice. The CCRC said there was a “real possibility” that the court of appeal would overturn Hayes’s conviction.However, the court upheld the guilty verdict last year, saying there was “indisputable documentary evidence” that he had sought to move Libor and that he had made “frank admissions of dishonesty”.Hayes then appealed to the supreme court, which on Wednesday decided that he had been denied a fair trial in 2015.In the case of Palombo, the court said his case was also compromised as a result of judge’s directions to the jury: “Thus, his conviction also cannot stand.”The justices said the history of the two cases, which both centred on charges of conspiracy to defraud, “raises concerns about the effectiveness of the criminal appeal system in England and Wales in confronting legal error”.A Serious Fraud Office spokesperson said: “We have considered this judgment and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial.”Explore more on these topicsBankingLiborUK supreme courtSerious Fraud OfficeCriminal Cases Review CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

They were still out there more than two and a half hours after they had begun their shot at history, waving at their exultant families and reliving what had just passed. A first European Championship final awaits on Sunday, which may have felt inevitable for three weeks but feels no smaller a milestone for that. England present a familiar last hurdle and what a tie it should be between two sides that, in different ways, had to squeeze over the line.In the end it had to be Aitana Bonmatí. Extra time was drifting to a conclusion and, for the first time this summer, Spain were screaming for a spark from the world’s best player. They had plenty of chances to win inside 90 minutes but, against an outstanding Germany side, could so easily have been vanquished too. Had their keeper, Catalina Coll, not made a remarkable double save at the end of normal time they would finally have reckoned with mortality. Bonmatí, for one, did not fancy playing so loosely with the odds again.Germany offer steely resilience but Bonmatí’s moment of magic solves puzzle | Sophie DowneyRead moreA customary stroke of genius or the spoils of sloppy goalkeeping? The debate will rage about Bonmatí’s winner and a fair reading would err towards the former. Ann-Katrin Berger had been immaculate between the posts for Germany and did not look in immediate danger when Athenea del Castillo played Bonmatí, who had let the ball run through her legs and darted to meet it, through towards the right byline.Presumably Berger had set herself for a cross; she could not react in time to the thrashed first-time strike inside her near post that few players would have dared attempt in the circumstances. Nobody could doubt the scorer’s intention, either. Afterwards Bonmatí explained Spain had been perfectly aware that Berger was predisposed to leaving that area of her goal exposed.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí squeezes her shot past Ann-Katrin Berger at her near post.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/APThis was the same Bonmatí who, a month previously,had been hospitalised by viral meningitisin a turn of events that severely clouded Spain’s preparations. Back then it would have taken an admirable level of optimism to imagine her going the distance in a tense, rugged, enthralling last-four clash and ultimately waving the magic wand. England must find a way to cope with her and the rest of a team that, while short of its best here, remains a notch above any other contender at this competition.A rerun of the 2023 World Cup will hold few surprises. “I know what they can do,” said the midfielder Mariona Caldentey of England’s qualities as sheets of water continued to teem down. “It will be a hard game. They’re in the final even if they haven’t played the greatest football yet. It’s something we have never won and is something we are missing. We respect England, but we will go for it.”For long periods it appeared that, against the pre-match odds, Germany’s muscle memory could win out. They have ruled the continent eight times and it feels a trick of the light that their drought will now extend 16 years to Euro 2029. Even if it takes a colossal stretch to cast them as plucky underdogs they could make that case here, weakened by injuries and suspensions while on the back of aremarkable win over Francein which they had ground through 113 minutes with 10 players.This was a side that, similarly light on numbers for an hour,lost 4-1 to Swedenhere 11 days previously. It helped that they kept a full complement against Spain and the frustration for Christian Wück’s players will be that they played the occasion perfectly. The balance between defensive resolve and attacking thrust was cleverly poised; they knew Berger would be leaned on at intervals but it would have been no scandal had the dice rolled their way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She tested Coll in the second half and arrowed a free-kick just wide but it was a deflected shot from Elisa Senss that, with almost the final action before the additional period, almost broke through. A backpeddling Coll had to scramble the ball from under her bar and, when Carlotta Wamser followed up, reacted to block on the line. It was a defining moment to match Bonmatí’s later flourish.Earlier Berger,hero of that epicagainst France, could count a spectacular tip-over from Esther González among a number of interventions. She was beaten when Irene Paredes headed against her left post but, beyond a flurry before half-time, Spain were kept at arm’s length. They were rarely fluent, at least by their peerless standards, against opponents who had expected to run hard and did exactly that.Now their modern rivalry with England travels from Sydney to Basel with two years and, for those who took in both Euro 2025 semi-finals, several lifetimes in between. “We had the correct mindset at the right moments,” Bonmatí said.Nobody exemplifies it more.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I think a lot riders would see us as arrogant because we want to control every ­single kilometre of this race. We don’t try to be arrogant, we just try to make our race as easy as possible. I think – this will sound super arrogant – but some guys can stay quiet.”Tour de France 2025: Jonathan Milan wins stage 17 sprint finish after big, late crash – liveRead moreOn a day when pro-Palestinian activists waved flags and unfurled banners in Dieulefit as the pelo­ton passed through, Pogacar was also questioned about his feelings on human rights in the UAE.“I ride for UAE Team Emirates and if you go there you’ll see how the sport is growing,” he said. “Kids love us, the locals love us when we ride with them. The sport is growing in the UAE, which I guess is why they have the team, to promote a healthy lifestyle.”In the roadside protest houses were draped with ­Palestinian flags with reports of ­protesters ­holding up “Starving is Killing” ­banners as the riders passed through. Dieulefit was honoured for sheltering Jewish people during the second world war.Last Wednesday a protester ran onto the finish line in Toulouse, wearing a T-shirt stating “Israel out of the Tour.” He was tackled by Tour staff and is scheduled to stand trial for endangering the riders.After that incident, the Israel-Premier Tech team said that it “respects everyone’s right to free speech which includes the right to protest.”If Pogacar remains in a league of his own, with Vingegaard clinging to his coat-tails, the battle for the final podium spot is likely to become intense in the next 48 hours, with Scotland’s Oscar Onley the meat in a Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe sandwich.View image in fullscreenSecurity members stop a man cycling towards the finish line at the end of stage 17 of the Tour de France.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersThe German team’s Tour debutant Florian Lipowitz is securely placed third overall, with Onley two minutes behind. But his teammate, Primoz Roglic, the most insouciant Grand Tour champion in the race, has now crept into the top five.Not everyone has been thrilled to see Roglic’s re-emergence over the past few stages. “Won’t be buying Red Bulls any more,” Onley said on Strava, after the Slovenian moved 38 seconds behind him, following the Mont Ventoux finish. “Not funding those attacks.”Meanwhile, volatile weather is predicted for the two remaining mountain stages, toThursday’s high altitude finish on the Col de la Loze, at 2,304 metres and Friday’s climb to the ski station at La Plagne, topping out at 2,o52 metres.As rain fell heavily on Valence and the Rhone valley, Francois Lemarchand, of race organisers ASO, said that change was in the air. “A few days of cooler weather are coming and we could see a swing of 20 degrees.

The tournament kicked off this year’s Champions Tour, a circuit Carlsen has dominated since its launch in 2020. But now, the stakes were even higher: the tour doubles as a qualifier for the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the winner of the chess section of the tournamentwill take home $250,000 for three days’ work.The chess tournament is part of the broader Esports World Cup, a seven-week spectacle that began on 8 July and stretches into late August. This is only the second edition of the World Cup but with more than 2,000 participating players, 25 different events and a record-breaking $70m total prize pool, it is the largest and most ambitious event of its kind.Magnus Carlsen v The World: chess champion’s 46-day match ends in drawRead moreChess is set to make its debut at this year’s edition. The sport has captured a massive new audience in recent years, fueled by charismatic YouTube personalities, platforms likeChess.com, Netflix hit drama The Queen’s Gambit,and a pandemic that imposed agonizing periods of isolation. Amid this online resurgence, the centuries-old game of intellectual prowess has remerged as a digital-era sensation.Keen to capitalize on chess’s popularity, Saudi Arabiaenlisted Carlsen as the global ambassadorfor the Esports World Cup. Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlsen is expected tolend his name and fanbase to the eventin the hopes of luring new fans to the Saudi-bankrolled tournament. That public relations campaign seemingly kicked off on the opening day of the world cup, when Carlsen issued a friendly challenge to play a chess match against Ronaldo.“I personally don’t know what Ronaldo has done on the chess chessboard, but what he has done in his life, in his football career, is extremely impressive. So, I would certainly be very honored if I could, you know, meet him or play chess while I’m here,” Carlsentold reporters.Carlsen’s decision to peddle Saudi PR came as a bit of a surprise given his limited engagement with the kingdom in the past. He won the 2017 world championships (in rapid and blitz chess) in Riyadh, a tournament that was boycotted by his top female counterpart from Ukraine because of Saudi Arabia’s discrimination against women. The closest Carlsen came to criticizing the kingdom at the time was over the refusal to grant visas to Israeli players. “I hope that if [the rapid and blitz championships] are arranged here several times, that everyone can participate,” Carlsen told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.Carlsen is not known for taking strong stances on human rights issues. On 21 March 2019 – the UN’s international day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination – Carlsen and former chess champion Anish Giri launched the #MoveForEquality campaign to tackle the issue through a symbolic chess match where black moved first instead of white, breaking a longstanding chess rule. However, while Carlsen has largely steered clear of human rights debates, his decision to partner with Saudi Arabia underscores how few sports stars can resist the kingdom’s growing influence … or its deep pockets.Though Carlsen’s deal is technically with the Esports World Cup, the event is entirely owned by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and is part of the kingdom’s broader power plays across sports. Over the past nine years, the kingdom has invested unprecedented sums across a wide range of sports as part of an overarching soft power strategy aimed to rebrand Saudi Arabia as a global hub for sports, tourism and entertainment. The vast majority of these investments – including Saudi’s foray into boxing, its purchase of English Premier League club Newcastle United, and its securing of the hosting rights for the 2034 World Cup, have been facilitated by the PIF, which is chaired by Saudi’s crown prince (and de facto ruler) Mohammed bin Salman – reportedly an avid gamer himself.Carlsen now joins other renowned athletes like Ronaldo, Rafael Nadal, and Lionel Messi as well-paid pitchmen for the Saudi regime. In 2023, Ibroke a story for the New York Timeswhich revealed the details of Lionel Messi’s partnership with Saudi Arabia’s tourism authority – a deal valued at $25m over three years, including publicized vacations in Saudi with his family, as well as a series of promotional material and regular social media posts. However, the real revelation was that Messi’s contract also included a non-negotiable condition for Saudi officials: Messi cannot say anything that might “tarnish” Saudi Arabia’s image.It is possible, if not likely, that a similar clause is included in Saudi’s agreements with each of its ambassadors, including Carlsen. It is a strategy that allows the kingdom to reap the promotional benefits of being associated with some of the world’s most beloved athletes while maintaining full control of the narrative being presented, under penalty of litigation.Nevertheless, Carlsen’s willingness to cooperate with Saudi Arabia is not surprising. The kingdom’s vast investments in sports and entertainment, backed by its seemingly limitless resources, have helped normalize its image, making it more palpable to previously hesitant audiences. Even Saudi Arabia’s increasing human rights abuses, from quashing dissent torecord-breaking execution rates, have had little impact on those eager to participate in the Saudi gold rush. This including the burgeoning world of esports and gaming.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aside from holding shares in Nintendo, Electronic Arts, and Activision, Savvy acquired mobile game developer Copley for $4.9bn, which later went on to acquire Niantic, the games business behind Pokémon Go. Saudi Arabia is also building Qiddiya City, a dedicated district that will house regional esports headquarters, clubs, and arenas. It is an exceptional level of investment that makes Saudi impossible to ignore as the major player in the global esports market.And though it would be easy to write off the kingdom’s efforts as sportswashing – a term that describes efforts to use sports as a distraction from ongoing human rights abuses – I would argue that the term offers an overly simplistic understanding of the kingdom’s aims. It is a multi-pronged strategy that is part foreign policy, part domestic socialization project, a strategy of pacifying the public with entertainment and material goods. With more than two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population under the age of 35 – a significant number of whom are gamers – the kingdom’s heavy investment in gaming has only enhanced bin Salman’s popularity among young Saudis, which further stabilizes his regime.As for Carlsen, his role as an ambassador for one of Saudi’s spectacles underscores the kingdom’s ability to lure almost any athlete across sports and entertainment. Along with the likes of Messi, Ronaldo and Nadal, Carlsen is merely the latest star mobilized to help legitimize Saudi Arabia as a global destination for sports and soften its controversial image among fans.And with every star who signs on, the regime’s image gleams just a little bit brighter.Explore more on these topicsSaudi Arabia and sportMagnus CarlsenChessSaudi ArabiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the captain, Leah Williamson, was trying to explain just how England manage to keep going behind but pulling out victories at the very end.“Whilst there are seconds on the clock, there are seconds that we’re just waiting,” she said. “It’s less ‘if’ and more ‘how’. I don’t know how to explain it, I don’t know how we do it.”Michelle Agyemang hits high notes with ease and takes spotlight in her stride | Tom GarryRead moreAnd frankly, this was the sort of victory that defied rational explanation. By the dying minutes of this game Beth Mead was playing in central midfield as part of a double pivot behind Ella Toone and the strike duo of Michelle Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones. Lauren Hemp, who started the last World Cup final as a second striker, was now left-back. And England were basically just pumping long balls into the area hoping something would happen. The formation: like, 2-6-2? 3-2-1-4?In a way, it scarcely mattered. This is after all tournament football, where the usual logic does not always apply, where the result is the result, however you get it. The new plan is no plan. Just go at it. “Everybody’s fighting and everybody wants to win and everybody feels like they can win,” Lucy Bronze said afterwards and frankly her stirring performances in this tournament suggest that ultimately it may be no more complicated than that.For Wiegman, however, all this represents a certain tectonic shift. When she arrived as England coach in 2021 she was presented not simply as a great leader but a sharp tactician, a coach raised in the Cruyff persuasion, who met the great man at the age of 13 on a television show, who had absorbed his principles of dynamic possession andwon Euro 2017 with the Netherlandsplaying the classic Dutch 4-3-3. Who above all had a philosophy, a defined style of playing.These days, that style is a little harder to discern. England have switched freely between a back four and a back three, often in the same tournament, sometimes even in the same half. Passing principles have been blooded, adopted and then junked in the face of trouble. So what exactly is the philosophy? Four years into the reign of the most successful coach in the history of English women’s football, what exactly is Wiegman-ball? And how is it possible that days before a European Championship final, we don’t even know the answer?Wiegman may be a coach of the Dutch school, but perhaps her formative experience as a footballer was playing at a Fifa invitational tournament in China in 1988. There she met the US national team coach Anson Dorrance, who was impressed with the young defensive midfielder and invited her to train at the University of North Carolina the following year.That year with the Tar Heels opened a world of possibility. “It was a soccer paradise,” she later said. She worked with Dorrance, played with all-time greats such as Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly, trained at world-class facilities, returned to the Netherlands with a creed that would shape her. Creating success in women’s football was not purely a theoretical exercise. It was about building a culture, being professional, showing ambition, exhibiting an elite mentality. Whatever it takes, you do it.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman’s England are known to change formation in the same half.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersPerhaps in retrospect this helps to explain why so many of Wiegman’s triumphs with England have felt vaguely American in character: that sense of manifest destiny, the superior physicality, a cold confidence in getting the job done, a belief above all that trophies are won through sheer force of will. It is by now no coincidence that England have compiled a litany of major tournament wins undeserved on the simple run of play.Spain in 2022.ColombiaandNigeriain 2023.Swedenand now Italy in 2025: victory as an extension of identity.And of course the fumble by Laura Giuliani for Agyemang’s opening goal and the crucial late miss by Emma Severini and the extra-time foul by the same player are not mistakes that happen in a vacuum, but mistakes induced by pressure. Perhaps Wiegman’s greatest achievement is to build a culture in which England’s players can navigate their own way through adversity, never get disheartened, never relinquish their desire to take the thing they do not deserve.This is what sees you through the tough moments, against more limited and tiring opponents. England’s ability to produce a swell of pressure in the closing minutes remains unparalleled. It may well be the closest thing England have to an actual ideology, the “proper England” of which so many in the camp have spoken. “You can never write the English off,” Kelly said afterwards. “I don’t think you’ll find a team in world football with more fight and more resilience,” Bronze said.The fact that this can be read as deeply disrespectful to the beaten Italians – what, did they simply not fight as hard? – is beside the point. Wiegman’s focus on culture – the underrated skill of binding 23 players for a month – is what gets England through the big moments. England do not lie down. England stay united right until the end. Then some things happen, and it’s best not trying to analyse those too much.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gareth Southgate was also a culture guy rather than a tactics guy, a healer rather than a technician, a man whose gift – and it really was a gift – was not to micro-manage or theorise but simply to create the right environment for gifted athletes to thrive for four weeks. To make the chore of international football feel fun. To find the right emotional blend. What is Southgate’s tactical identity? Beyond a weird predilection for playing right-footers at left-back, it’s hard to pin down.The caveat is that while this is a reliable way of progressing in tournaments, it is an extremely unreliable way of winning tournaments. Teams that are tactically inchoate but blessed with gifted individuals and an unshakeable mentality can win big pots in the absence of a genuinely great alternative. We think of the USA in 2019, Portugal in the men’s European Championship of 2016, arguably England in 2022. Meanwhile England’s habit of grimacing their way through knockout football almost won them the biggest prize of all in 2023, only for Spainto outclass them in the final.View image in fullscreenEngland were outclassed by Spain in the 2023 World Cup final.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAIt’s instructive revisiting the postmortem of that match, a spirited and honourable defeat, and yet one in which pretty much nobody in England gear was capable of explaining. But hang on. If victories are all about fight and resilience and spirit and never giving up, then do defeats mean you didn’t try hard enough? That you didn’t want it enough? That you gave up? Of course not.“If we put the ball in the back of the net, it’s game on,” said Millie Bright. Georgia Stanway thought England were “unlucky”. Wiegman, having watched Mary Earps save Jenni Hermoso’s penalty in the 70th minute, was convinced that the momentum of the game would inevitably lead to a goal. “Now we are going to get to 1-1,” she said afterwards. “But we didn’t.”Perhaps it was no surprise that, as England shuffle towards their next final, nobody really seems to be able to put their finger on why they lost the last. Doing so, of course, would involve acknowledging England’s technical inferiority, their inability to take and recycle the ball under pressure, the lack of sophisticated passers being produced by the English game, the basic absence of process. Better by far to file it away as a twist of fate, bad luck, a random bounce of the ball, just something that happens.And if true, then England – one of the best-resourced and most talented squads in world football – have a puncher’s chance of lifting the trophy on Sunday night. Perhaps ultimately this is all they want, all they ever required. The TV ratingswill be goodeither way. Perhaps Wiegman’s description of England’s Euro 2025 as a movie was more apposite than she realised. After all, when you’re watching a movie, you’re not really involved. You’re just sitting there, waiting for the plot to unfold in front of you.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Little could the 19-year-old have known that, just over three months later, she would be the Lionesses’ saviour – twice – in the knockout stages of Euro 2025.A year ago, Agyemang scored a hat-trick for England at the Under-19 European Championship but few could have been bold enough to predict she would burst into the nation’s hearts on the grander stage so soon. Yet, that week in April, events were about to unfold that would transform not only her summer fortunes but England’s too.On the Saturday Agyemang scored in a strong performance to help the under-19s to defeat Austria 5-1 and the following day she was drafted into the senior squad for the first time to cover for the injured Alessia Russo. A few days later she made her senior England debut,coming on against Belgiumin the 80th minute and scoring 41 seconds later with only her second touch.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang has come a long way since her hat-trick for England’s Under-19s a year ago.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/The FA/Getty ImagesIn Switzerland this summer she has showed why she is so special. With the Lionesses struggling for form – and goals – in their defence of the European Championship they won in 2022 she has twice come on to save them from elimination. In thequarter-final against Sweden, England were 2-0 down when Agyemang replaced Georgia Stanway after 70 minutes, scoring the all-important equaliser before the Lionesses won on penalties. In the semi-final against Italy, she entered the fray as late as the 85th minute and equalised deep into added time.Chloe Kelly scored the winnerin extra time and England now have the chance to defend their crown on Sunday in Basel.Agyemang, who grew up in the Essex town of South Ockendon, with parents of Ghanaian descent, was not even born when England hosted Euro 2005 but she has long been tipped to reach the top and has been playing for Arsenal’s age-group teams since the age of six. Football isn’t the only thing in Agyemang’s life. She is studying business management at King’s College London, as part of its sport and wellness programme. She was “brought up on gospel music” and revealed after England’s win against Sweden thatshe has brought her piano over. “The kitman brought it over in a van. It’s calm and relaxing,” she said. “Lottie [Wubben-Moy, her Arsenal and England teammate] asked me to play for her – she came to my room and I played a few things for her, which was nice.”Michelle AgyemangIf ever the Football Association wanted an example of the benefits of integrating all of the youth international and senior sides together at St George’s Park, and of the advantages of the interconnected pathway and dialogue between senior and youth-pathway coaches, Agyemang grabbing her golden opportunity in that week in April with both hands was it.Yes, it is true that it cannot have been in Wiegman’s plans for Russo to pick up a knock during that April camp so that a teenager would need to be called upon for the trip to Belgium, and the Dutchwoman would be the first to admit that. The idea of Agyemang scoring crucial goals this summer to help propel England to their third consecutive major final was surely not one she imagined. It is also true, though, that England’s pathway coaches have admired Agyemang for years and she has long been tipped as a senior star.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang made a huge impact with her late equaliser against Italy in the semi-final.Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAIn the Women’s Super League, however, she was getting relatively few moments to shine during her season-long loan spell with Brighton, for whom she made 17 WSL appearances last term but just three starts, scoring three times in the 576 minutes she featured on the pitch.Asked about Agyemang’s talents, during England’s full-squad media day at St George’s Park in June, Williamson said: “I remember the first time she played because she came and flattened me in training. I was too slow on it and I think I gave her a bit of stick about it, but in my head I thought: ‘She’s got something about her’. [She is] someone who you can’t give a second to.“In training [in June], I was screaming for a pass and she put it top bins and I thought: ‘I ain’t going to say nothing’. So my first impression was, she let me know she was there, which I love. As a young player coming through, you can do all the fancy flicks and tricks you want, but somebody needs to know about you, and you need to tell people that you’re there, and that’s what she does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAsk anyone close to the England squad and you will hear similar stories of Agyemang firing powerful shots into the top corner at England’s training base on the outskirts of Zurich during this tournament, while others also speak of a polite, unassuming and well-spoken teenager who conducts herself with a maturity far beyond her years.Growing up, fittingly one of the youngster’s idols was Theo Walcott, the former Arsenal forward who was the surprise last-gasp inclusion in England’s men’s 2006 World Cup squad. However, the difference is that Walcott – then aged 17 – was not given any match minutes in that tournament by Sven-Göran Eriksson whereas Wiegman has entrusted Agyemang to be a gamechanging substitute.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang scored three league goals on loan at Brighton last season.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/The FA/Getty ImagesWith three goals from her four senior appearances, her fearless and composed performances – she also hit the crossbar against Italy with an audacious effort – have been so strong that Wiegman was asked in her post-match press conference about whether Agyemang’s displays were forcing her to rethink whether she should play even more.The head coach replied: “She’s not forcing me. She is very grateful that she gets minutes. She’s ready for it. Her growth and development went so quickly. From not starting at Brighton, to getting lots more minutes, showing how good she is, and coming into our team, as things go it has been pretty smooth for her and I think she feels very good about that.”To describe her rise as rapid would be a vast understatement. Not even four years ago, Agyemang wasa ballgirl at Wembleyfor Wiegman’s first match at the national stadium. She will surely play a role, one way or another, in the Lionesses’ European final in Basel on Sunday, no longer watching on from the sidelines but now quickly becoming a household name.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trust me, no one is more disappointed in some of my performances than what I am, but the colour of my skin has got nothing to do with that.“It’s been pretty tough. I’m not saying it [speaking out] is going to make a big difference and make a change but hopefully [it is] just making people aware that it’s not OK. Racism is still going on and we’re just here to do our job to the best of our ability and hopefully bring success back to England.“I think the fans today were unbelievable and their support was incredible and I can’t thank them all enough for being on my side and on the team’s.”Speaking up in support of Carter the Labour MP for Warwick and Leamington, Matt Western, revealed on Tuesday that – within the space of three hours – 91 members of parliament had added their names to his call for the major social media companies to take serious action to combat what they called “the appalling racism and misogyny” directed at Carter, with Western adding: “They need to act. Here is our call on them to do so.”View image in fullscreenEngland fans show their support for Jess Carter in Geneva.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APThose MPs have all co-signed a letter saying they were “horrified, but not surprised” to learn of the abuse Carter received.Carter, who grew up in Western’s constituency in Warwick and played for one of the local youth sides, Warwick Juniors, told Hayters TV: “I’ve got mixed-race nephews and nieces.

Arne Slot then outlined his plans for Ekitiké in a call at the end of last season.Newcastle made a move for Ekitiké last week after missing out on Liam Delap and João Pedro but their £70m bid was rejected by Eintracht and the player made it clear his preference was to join Liverpool. United also received the same information when they made a last-minute attempt to derail the deal. United’s director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, is believed to have contacted Eintracht’s sporting director Markus Krösche over a possible transfer but Ekitiké was already set on Anfield.Ekitiké scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in his one full season at Frankfurt, helping the club to qualify for the Champions League, and while he is primarily a No 9 Liverpool believe he can also operate as a second striker or out wide.He is potentially the third most expensive signing in Liverpool’s history behind Florian Wirtz and Darwin Núñez.

Alba had been scheduled to take part in Tuesday evening’s All-Star skills challenge, but was withdrawn. No explanation was given for Alba’s withdrawal, andMLShas not commented publicly on Messi and Alba’s absences.The most aggressive set-piece team in the world plays in MinnesotaRead moreThe MLS All-Star game has been around since the league’s inception in 1996, though it has taken multiple forms. It started as a standard East v West format used in other US leagues, but has also seen a single MLS All-Star squad play against well-known teams from around the world (Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus have all been past opponents). In five of the past six seasons, though, the game has pitted MLS’s squad against Liga MX’s.The event is considered to be a major one among MLS executives and some front offices, with it now being one of the only opportunities for representatives from every club to be in the same location since the SuperDraft ceased being held in-person and MLS Cup stopped being held at a neutral site. The league’s rules contain a provision meant to encourage player participation in the event, stating that, unless they are injured, players must participate in the All-Star game or sit out their club’s next match.This year’s game falls in the middle of a busy period for the league. Inter Miami have played five games already in July after exiting the Club World Cup in a round of 16 loss to PSG. Some of the league restarts play on Friday, less than two days after the All-Star game. The annual Leagues Cup competition pitting MLS teams v Liga MX starts the following week with games on Wednesday.For Miami, Messi and Alba’s absences will loom large – the club’s next match is against FC Cincinnati, who now lead the Eastern Conference and who beat Miami 3-0 the last time they played. Miami then play Atlas in the Leagues Cup on Wednesday.Messi and Alba’s situation is not unprecedented. Zlatan Ibrahimović was suspended one game in 2018 after skipping that year’s All-Star event, a decision he called “ridiculous” in subsequent comments to reporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 31-year-old Greece international had been living in Athens after signing recently for Panathinaikoswhen he diedon 9 October last year.Baldock spent most of his career playing as a defender for MK Dons andSheffield United, having been born in Buckinghamshire, and had played a club fixture just three days before the incident.An inquest into Baldock’s death at Milton Keynes coroner’s court on Wednesday confirmed his medical cause of death as drowning. His family had previously said in a statement that Baldock had “tragically drowned” while swimming in the pool at his home. An investigation by Greek police after the incident also found no evidence of criminal activity.Baldock was discovered in the swimming pool at his address, in the Glyfada district of Athens, on 9 October and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, the inquest heard. A postmortem examination found no drugs or alcohol in his system and that he had a very large heart “that would have meant that he was susceptible to heart arrhythmias”, where the heart beats too fast, too slowly or irregularly.Tom Osborne, the senior coroner for Milton Keynes, concluded Baldock’s death was an accident.Tributes were paid across the country in the days after Baldock’s death, including by his former clubs and at a Nations League match between England and Greece at Wembley where the stadium held a period of silence and both teams wore black armbands.In a statement released at the time, Baldock’s family said: “George you were the most special father, fiance, son, brother, uncle, friend, teammate and person. Your enthusiasm and infectious personality brought so much love to those that were fortunate enough to know you and those that adored you from the stands. We will forever cherish the special memories we have of you and you will continue to live on in your beautiful son.”Baldock was due to fly home the following day to celebrate his son’s first birthday, his family said.Explore more on these topicsFootballSheffield UnitedMK DonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Official resale tickets are unavailable but that is unlikely to stop the Lionesses’ travelling support, who have been planning for this moment for some time.‘A lot of emotions’: England fans bound for Basel after Euro 2025 semi-final dramaRead moreAccording to Deborah Dilworth, the head of women’s football at the Football Supporters’ Association, the final is unlikely to bring a repeat of the England men’s European Championship in Germany last year, whena late rush of fansarrived to hunt down tickets on spec. “The women’s fans seem to want to know that they’ve got their plans in place,” Dilworth said.“I’ve not really seen a trend [similar to with the men’s team]. There might be some people that might just happen to be in the city, and there may be some people that travel out, but the cost is probably prohibitive for them.”The cost of flights, starting at £800 from the UK direct to Basel this weekend, has put off some potential travellers, according to Dilworth. But she observes that the Lionesses have succeeded in persuading a number of new fans to make their first trip to watch England away, many of whom bought tickets for the final months ago.“We asked: ‘Which tournament are you on?’ at one of our events here and we had loads who said it was their first,” Dilworth said. “We’ve also had lots where it was their first ever away tournament, and some where it was their first ever Lionesses game, including at the semi-final.”The sense of a new travelling support being formed has been borne out by the fan walks in which England fans gather to march to the match together. It is a practice enabled and encouraged by Uefa but England notably were not part of the fan march trend in Germany last year.“Possibly one of the biggest questions we get asked at every tournament is: ‘Is there a fan walk?’” Dilworth said. “And we’ve tried mini-walks at previous tournaments. Now we’re collaborating with the FA to do it at a much bigger scale and the England fans have brought the absolute vibe. Their singing, their scarves, face paints, cowboy hats, they’ve presented in the way they usually do but in mass numbers which looks great.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s already real in the digital hive mind | Barney RonayRead moreSporting have wanted the add-ons to be achievable, based on appearances, goals and assists by Gyökeres plus Champions League qualification, whereasArsenalhad wanted to include some more difficult ones. As the negotiations dragged at the end of last week, it is understood Sporting thought €5m of Arsenal’s proposed bonuses were achievable, €5m not so. One clause that was suggested related to Gyökeres winning the Ballon d’Or with Arsenal.The negotiations have been handled largely by the agents, with club-to-club contact kept to a minimum. Sporting are comfortable with the resulting bonuses deal, having in effect held out for what they wanted.Sporting had demanded €70m plus €10m in add-ons; an €80m package was the target, albeit it was less than the €100m release clause in Gyökeres’s contract. They have got there with a basic fee of €63.5m and the agents having agreed to waive their 10% cut of that – a saving to Sporting of €6.35m.The positions on both sides had long been entrenched, Gyökeres determined to force the move to Arsenal,ignoring interest from elsewhere; Sporting digging in hard for their money. There has been conflict, Gyökeresrefusing to report backfor pre-season training with Sporting, but Arteta can at last look forward to working with his man.It was always going to be a pivotal summer for Arsenal and Gyökeres is the latest step in a spending spree. Arteta and the sporting director, Andrea Berta, have overseen the arrivals of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martín Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard and Noni Madueke for a combined £118.5m.Mosquera has travelled to Singapore to link up with the squad on their pre-season tour. The 21-year-old, who represented Spain at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship, has signed a five-year contract which has the option of a further year.Gyökeres was a sensation at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances. Having signed for £20.5m from Coventry in the summer of 2023, the 27-year-old helped Sporting to the league title in each of his seasons with them – plus the Portuguese Cup in the last campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While England unsuccessfully reviewed in the hope of an lbw, Pant was still forced to leave the field on the back of a golf cart.Rishabh Pant’s wounded foot trips up India’s solid start against England in fourth TestRead more“He was in a lot of pain,” said Sai Sudharsan, who was at the other end and top-scored for India with 61, his maiden Test half-century, as they closed on 264 for four after Ben Stokes won the toss. “They’ve gone for scans. We’ll get to know overnight, probably get the information tomorrow.”“I hope he’s all right,” England’s Liam Dawson said. “He’s obviously a very good player. I probably can’t see him taking much more part in this game.”Pant arrived in Manchester with his fitness under focus after a finger injury, sustained while keeping on the opening day at Lord’s, hampered him for the remainder of that Test. Another injury is a significant blow to the visitors, with Pant the second-highest run-scorer in the series.Dawson managed to escape any serious punishment off Pant as he enjoyed a solid return to Test cricket, eight years on from his last appearance in the format. The left-arm spinner took just seven balls tofind the outside edge of Yashasvi Jaiswal for 58, Harry Brook gobbling up at slip. The 35-year-old finished with tidy figures of one for 45 off 15 overs.“I was just trying to bowl my best ball,” Dawson said. “Just land it in the area as many times as you can. Thankfully, it got a little bit of drift and he nicked it.“I’ve said to a few people that at the age that I’m at, I probably thought Test cricket was gone. To be back involved is really cool and I’ve got to try and enjoy each day that I get.It’s just one wicket. I’ve done nothing special there. It’s one wicket but it’s another big day tomorrow.”On how he has changed as a bowler since his first stint in the Test side, Dawson said: “I’m probably a little more consistent, understand pitches a little better. The older you get, you learn how to manage game scenarios.”Reminded that he took 10 wickets and hit a century at Old Trafford in an innings victory for Hampshire last year, Dawson replied:“Do you know what? I completely forgot about that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After making his debut at three in the first Test at Headingley – returning a duck and second-innings 30 – the 23-year-old was left out of the following two matches as India opted for an extra all-rounder. However, the southpaw returned to first drop in place of Karun Nair and hung on for 151 deliveries. Given the short-ball treatment, he eventually perished to Stokes, a miscued pull finding Brydon Carse at long leg. The challenge was still welcomed.“It was actually a really enjoyable experience, to be honest,” said Sudharsan. “Because one of the best bowlers in the country is steaming in and trying to hit you hard. And you being there and giving your best for the team. That’s one of the best feelings you can have.“Playing against England on their home soil, you have to be ready for that aggressive nature.

But he upheld the defendants’ complaints that there had been “serious and widespread failures to comply” with court orders in the ugby league case in particular.The defendants claimed there were “significant gaps” in the medical records in 90% of the claims issued in these cases. At the high court in London, Cook ruled that the claimants, who are being backed by a commercial litigation funder, are liable for the costs incurred in the bringing of these complaints.“These claims mean a lot to the claimants, and the difficulties here have been caused by Mr Boardman’s complete misunderstanding of his responsibilities,” Cook said. Boardman, Cook continued, seemed to be under the misapprehension that “he only had to disclose documents relied on” to the defendants, as opposed to providing them with all relevant material.This has contributed to a delay in the case, which still has yet to come to trial. “There has been no admission, and no apology,” Cook said, “and above and before everything else a complete failure on the part of Mr Boardman to recognise that all this was caused by his misreading.”Susan Rodway KC, of Rylands Garth, argued that the defendants had sent the claimants on “a four-month exercise in following leads down rabbit holes” in search of “some smoking gun” documents which do not exist, and that the firm lacked the resources to comply with the impossible task of providing full medical records for every one of the players involved.“There’s been enough delay,” Cook said. “These claimants need their cases resolving and the sooner the better.”It was revealed in the latest rugby case management hearing that of the 383 claimants who joined the action since the cut-off date this year, only 91 have received a medical diagnosis. Despite this, the legal teams on both sides will now select and agree on a group of lead claimants to go forward to trial, with further case management hearings scheduled for spring in 2026.“Almost five years after legal action began, the claimants lawyers have today conceded in court that many players in the case have not undergone thorough medical testing but instead what the judge called a “self-serving tick box exercise” in order to sign up to this claim,” a World Rugby spokesperson said.“They have no substantive medical diagnosis. The conduct of Rylands Garth meant the judge issued an order which could yet see many more players having their case struck out. There must now be serious doubts over whether players’ best interests are being served. This is a situation that surely benefits nobody.”“We will continue fighting for justice for our players and their families – who continue to suffer every day with the life-altering impacts of the negligence of rugby authorities,” said a Rylands Garth spokesperson in response. “Rugby authorities are fully aware that the testing has been extremely thorough, including brain imaging and neurological assessments. If they’re suggesting otherwise, they are again letting down players who have suffered playing the sport.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRugby leagueConcussion in sportRFLnewsShareReuse this content"

Teammates and staff gathered around Matos for more than 10 minutes as medical personnel attended to him on the field. A helicopter was brought in to transport him for further evaluation.“It’s a really heartbreaking part of the game,” said veteran lineman Austin Jackson. “Very tough.”Trump wants to force the Commanders to revert to a racist name. It’s unlikely he canRead moreMatos’ injury cast a shadow over the Dolphins’ opening session, though the team insisted it was not the reason practice ended early after 90 minutes. First-day sessions are typically shorter, a team official said.A towering 6ft 7in and 334lb, Matos has taken one of the more unusual paths to the NFL. Born in the Dominican Republic, he moved to the United States at 17 to pursue basketball and to learn English.He played two years of college basketball at New Mexico before transferring to South Florida, where he walked on to the football team in 2022 despite having never played organized football. Matos appeared in two games that season as a defensive lineman before switching to the offensive line, where he found his footing.After just one year of college football, he was signed by the Dolphins in 2024 through the NFL’s International Player Pathway Program. Miami valued him highly, guaranteeing him $247,500 – an unusually generous sum for an undrafted rookie – to beat out interest from at least 10 other teams.Though he spent the 2024 season on the practice squad and has yet to appear in a regular-season game, Matos saw preseason action last year and signed a futures contract with Miami in January. He entered training camp as a developmental project with considerable upside, thanks to rare athletic traits including a reported 4.88sec 40-yard dash.“I want to be one of the best tackles to play in the NFL,” Matos said last year.As of Wednesday evening, there was no timeline for his return. The team said it would provide updates “as appropriate”.Explore more on these topicsMiami DolphinsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Yes, there was something special about just being back on a tennis court Tuesday night.There also was this: She really, really wanted to win.And Williams did just that, becoming the second-oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match in professional tennis, delivering some of her familiar big serves and groundstrokes at age 45 while beating Peyton Stearns – 22 years her junior – 6-3, 6-4 at the DC Open.“Each week that I was training, I was, like, ‘Oh, my God, I don’t know if I’m good enough yet.’ And then there would be weeks where I would leap forward. And there would be two weeks where I was, like, ‘Oh, God, it’s not happening.’ Even the week leading up, [I thought], ‘Oh, my gosh, I need to improve so much more.’ So it’s all a head game,” Williams said after her first singles match in more than a year and first singles victory in nearly two.The only older woman to win a tour-level singles match was Martina Navratilova, whose last triumphcame at 47 in 2004.Williams had not played singles in an official match since March 2024 in Miami, missing time while having surgery to remove uterine fibroids. She hadn’t won in singles since August 2023 in Cincinnati. Until this week, she was listed by the WTA Tour as “inactive”.“I’m just constantly praying for good health, so that way I could have an opportunity to play with good health,” Williams said. “A lot of this for me is being able to come back and try to play at a level [and] to play healthy.”Backed by a crowd that clearly was there to see, and support, her at the hard-court tournament in the nation’s capital, Williams showed glimpses of the talent she possesses and the skills she displayed while earning all of her Grand Slam titles: seven in singles, 14 in women’s doubles – all alongside younger sister Serena – and two in mixed doubles.“I wanted to play a good match,” Williams told the fans, then added a phrase that drew appreciative roars: “And win the match.”View image in fullscreenVenus Williams speaks during an interview after her win over Peyton Stearns.Photograph: Nick Wass/APIn Tuesday’s second game, Williams smacked a return winner to get things started, then delivered a couple of other big responses to break Stearns, a 23-year-old ranked 35th in the world.In the next game, Williams sprinted forward to reach a drop shot and replied with a forehand winner.The first chorus of cheers arrived when Williams walked out into the main stadium at the DC Open. Another came when she strode from the sideline to the center of the court for the coin toss. The noise reached a crescendo when Williams began hitting aces – at 110mph and faster – the way she used to.Keep in mind: Williams won four Grand Slam trophies before Stearns was born.Venus Williams hit big serves and groundstrokes just like she always did“She played some ball tonight,” Stearns said. “She was moving really well, which I wasn’t expecting too much, honestly. Her serves were just on fire.”There also were moments where Williams – whose fiance was in the stands – looked as if it had been just as long as it actually has since she competed, including in the opening game, when she got broken at love this way: forehand wide, forehand into the net, forehand long, backhand long.At the end, it took Williams a bit of extra effort to close things out. She kept holding match points and kept failing to convert them. But eventually, on her sixth chance, Williams powered in a 112mph serve that Stearns returned into the net. That was it: Williams smiled wide as can be, raised a fist and jogged to the net to shake hands, then performed her customary post-win pirouette-and-wave.“It’s not easy. It won’t be easy. It’s not easy for anyone out here,” said Williams, who next faces No 5 seed Magdalena Frech. “So I know I’ll have to fight for every match. But I’m up for that.”Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsUS sportsTennisShareReuse this content"

Microsoft said it had observed attacks where the attackers had sent a request to a SharePoint server “enabling the theft of the key material”.Microsoft said it had released security updates and advised all users of on-premises SharePoint systems to install them. It warned that it assessed with “high confidence” that the hacking groups would continue to attack unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that it had subsequently scanned more than 8,000 publicly accessible SharePoint servers around the world and had “identified dozens of compromised systems, confirming that attackers are conducting a coordinated mass exploitation campaign”.Microsoft said Linen Typhoon had been “focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organisations related to government, defence, strategic planning, and human rights” since 2012.It added that since 2015 Violet Typhoon had been “dedicated to espionage, primarily targeting former government and military personnel, non-governmental organisations, thinktanks, higher education, digital and print media, financial and health related sectors in the United States, Europe, and east Asia”.Microsoft said it had “medium confidence” that the third group, Storm-2603, was based in China, but said it had not established links between the group and other Chinese threat actors. It warned that “additional actors” might also target on-premises SharePoint systems to exploit their vulnerabilities if its security updates were not installed.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)ChinaCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The result is a transformation into one of the thinnest and lightest devices available and radically changes how it handles, for the better.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 8.9mm thick when shut – well within the realms of a standard smartphone if you ignore the camera bump on the back. It easily fits in a pocket but opens up to turn into a folding tablet just 4.2mm thick.But at £1,799 (€2,099/$2,000/A$2,899) you pay an awful lot for such a fancy device. It is an expensive, cutting-edge gadget that can, in theory, replace your phone, tablet and PC in one pocketable device.View image in fullscreenThe super-thin frame leaves an enormous camera bump protruding about 5.5mm from the back.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe seventh-generation foldable solves most of the niggles of Samsung’s previous foldables. It weighs only 215g, which is 24g less than last year’s model and about the same as large slab phones, and is shaped just like a regular handset when closed.It fits better in your pocket. Typing messages, answering calls, getting directions and taking photos feel and work like a regular phone. Even the 6.5in screen on the front is top-notch – bright, colourful, crisp and 120Hz smooth – and the improved fingerprint scanner in the power button is accurate and rapid.Open it like a book and the Fold 7 is only a hair thicker than the USB-C port. It is impressively thin yet feels solid. It is difficult to see how a device can be made any thinner without ditching the charging port. The flexible 8in OLED screen is smooth, crisp, super bright and almost square, ready for running two apps side by side.The outside screen and back are protected by the latest technology in hardened glass, but the inside screen is still covered by a necessarily softer layer than a standard phone that picks up fingerprints easily and is relatively shiny. The crease down the middle of the screen where it folds is very nearly gone, only visible in glare.View image in fullscreenFlex mode allows you to watch films with the Fold 7 half-folded like a mini laptop.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsMain screen:8in QXGA+ 120Hz (368ppi) Amoled flexible displayCover screen:6.5in FHD+ 120Hz (422ppi) AmoledProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:One UI 8 based onAndroid16Camera:200+12+10MP rear with 3x telephoto; 10MP+10MP selfie camerasConnectivity:5G, dual sim, e-sim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, GNSSWater resistance:IP48 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes)Dimensions folded:158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mmDimensions unfolded:158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mmWeight:215gPower for multitaskingView image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 fully charges in 82 minutes, hitting 60% in less than half an hour using a 25W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold 7 does not skimp on processing power with the same flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM as theS25 UltraandS25 Edge. That means it flies along in everyday tasks and high-end games and is considerably more powerful than its closest rivals, such as theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold.The battery lasts just shy of two days using the two screens for about four hours each and spending several hours on 5G, which is about the same as its predecessors and similar to normal slab phones. It will last longer when just using the outside screen for phone usage, but most people are likely to need to charge it every other day.One UI 8 for Android 16View image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 can run two apps full size side-by-side, or up to eight in a combination of split-screen and floating windows.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold 7 is one of the first Samsungs to run One UI 8 (Android 16) out of the box. It has not changed that much since last year’s software, which is a good thing all round as One UI 7 was great. It includes all the features from Samsung’s S25 line, including thegreat Now barat the bottom of the lock screen that shows live sports scores, music, timers and other regular tasks.Samsung does a better job than rivals at making the most of the multiple modes and multitasking possibilities opened up by the folding tablet form. You can have up to eight apps open on the internal screen at any one time, and have different home screen layouts for each screen. You can force apps into almost any size or shape, use apps in a partly folded mode, move them between the front and internal screens, and many other small features.The Fold 7 also has all the AI tools from the S25 series, including Google Gemini, Circle to Search, writing and drawing tools, transcription and audio editing tools, and so on. Some are good, others can be safely ignored just like most buzzy AI features. Samsung will provide Android and security updates until 31 July 2032.CameraView image in fullscreenShooting photos is easiest with the Fold 7 closed, but you can shoot with it open or half-folded for hands-free photos.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe large camera lump on the back holds the 200-megapixel main, 12MP ultra wide and 10MP 3x telephoto cameras. The Fold 7 also has two 10MP selfie cameras, one in each screen.The main 200MP camera is the best of the bunch, matching that from theS25 Edge. It is a top-drawer camera capable of capturing great images across a range of lighting conditions, and is a significant upgrade on previous generation Folds.The 12MP ultra wide camera is solid and capable of taking some very good closeup, macro photos, which is always fun. The 3x telephoto camera is equally good, producing great portraits, but it gets a bit soft and grainy indoors and can’t match the 5x zooms on top slab phones. The selfie cameras are a similar story, with great detail in good light that quickly becomes a bit grainy indoors. You can shoot selfies with the main camera using the outside screen as a viewfinder when the phone is open, which produces much better results.The camera app has plenty of modes, is straightforward to use and shoots equally solid video. Overall, the Fold 7 has a great camera system that is not a significant downgrade on flagship slab phones, which is thoroughly impressive.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe Fold 7 looks like a regular slab phone from the front or the back.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery has an expected lifespan of at least 2,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Inside screenrepairs cost about £500. Samsung offers aself-repair programme, as well as Care+accidental damage insurancethat reduces the cost of repairs to £139.The Fold 7 is made from recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements and steel, accounting for 13.7% of the weight. Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices, and breaks down thephone’s environmental impact in its report.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs from£1,799(€2,099/$1,999.99/A$2,899).For comparison, the Galaxy Z Flip costs£1,049, theGalaxy S25 Edgecosts£1,099, theS25 Ultracosts£1,249, and theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Foldcosts£1,399.VerdictThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is an incredible, extremely expensive piece of technology that feels like a giant leap over previous models, removing many of the niggles and compromises that had become synonymous with foldables.By being so much thinner, lighter and normal-sized when shut, it feels just like a regular handset. Open it up and the internal screen is the best on a foldable yet. The crease is virtually gone, it is bright, crisp and makes the most of multitasking.The camera sticks miles out the back but generally doesn’t get in the way except to make the phone wobble on a table – a compromise worth making for a top-quality camera system. You even get the same chip, solid battery life and great software as Samsung’s top regular phones.That leaves the relative fragility of the folding form, lacking proper dust resistance and having a softer internal screen, and the eye-watering price, as the biggest compromises. If you are not sold on the idea of having a phone that is also a tablet in your pocket, I don’t think this will convince you.But the Fold 7 is the best folding phone available and the major upgrade Samsung needed after a few rather repetitive years.Pros:a phone and tablet in one, super thin and light, just like a regular phone when closed, great software with powerful multitasking abilities, fantastic tablet screen, top performance, solid battery life, water resistance, long software support.Cons:extremely expensive, no dust resistance, more fragile than a regular device and costly to repair, limited zoom camera compared with the very best normal phones.View image in fullscreenYou can easily forget the Fold 7 opens, as it feels and works like a regular smartphone using the outside display.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungSmartphonesMobile phonesTablet computersAndroidreviewsShareReuse this content"

It turns out thatHouse of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewskiand a medium-sized Bluetooth speaker aren’t must-haves on a four-day wilderness hike. Who knew? An extra water bottle would have been a better use of that space, something I learned through a series of hardships.For guidance on this topic, I asked experienced campers – including parents with young kids, festival-goers, outdoor guides and lone wild campers – for their must-pack items. Whether you’re taking a £20 tent to a muddy field, glamping in a yurt or going fully off-grid, this list is sure to feature an item you’ll be thankful you threw in the bag.For a comprehensive list of essentials, you should always consider the particulars of your upcoming trip. For more help on getting started, I recommend practical checklists from organisations such asthe Ordnance Surveyand theCamping and Caravanning Club.Camping essentialsHammockView image in fullscreenNorthcore Kick Back hammock£34.95 at SurfSurfSurfThis hammock is great. If you’re camping in, or near, a woodland, you can quickly set it up between a couple of trees to read a book, listen to the birds or take a nap.Dave, north-west LondonView image in fullscreenHennessy Expedition zip hammock£139.95 at HennessyMy hammock is ultra-light compared with a conventional tent; it can be fully zipped open, or closed and covered by the accompanying tarp. It comes with webbing straps to prevent any damage to trees. While my hammock is snug – and not the cheapest option – it’s a really novel, comfortable and fun shelter to take on overnight adventures or multi-day expeditions, and an excellent choice when camping in wooded areas.Joe, CambridgeshireHead torchView image in fullscreenThe Filter’s top pick for camping: Black Diamond Storm 500R£54.95 at WildBounds£65 at Cotswold OutdoorView image in fullscreenThe Filter’s top pick overall: Petzl Swift RL£84.99 at DecathlonA head torch is a non-negotiable. Its usefulness compared with its weight and cost is unmatched. After dark, it’s much harder to do basic tasks such as pitching up, prepping a fire or nipping out of the tent in the middle of the night for a loo break. Get one.Adam, East SussexView image in fullscreenEverbeam H6 Proheadlamp£16.99 at AmazonThere are two main reasons I love this compact little Everbeam torch. First, it’s rechargeable via USB, so easy to keep topped up, either at home or on the go using a battery pack. Second, it has an adjustable angle, so no more tilting your head back and forth; just change the angle of the lamp while it’s on your head! Also, it comes with a great carry case, protecting it from damage when you just chuck it in your bag. It has two white brightness settings and a red light for when you need a low-light option.Dave, north-west LondonTentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianThe Filter’s top pick:MSR Hubba Hubba NX£476 at Cotswold Outdoors£476 at Snow and RockI do like a minimal tent. I’m only using it for sleep after all, so I don’t need fancy extras. And I like the feeling of being fully enclosed. A small tent is all a single camper needs, and it provides more shelter than one of those military-style bivi bags, which I’m not a fan of.Michael, ShropshireView image in fullscreenColeman Darwin 2 Plus£89.99 at Mountain Warehouse£82.52 at AmazonI love this Coleman tent’s extended porch cover. You can leave your pack and shoes outside your tent, so you get less muck inside. This leaves plenty of room indoors for a couple of people, plus a medium-sized dog.

The Boom 3i packs a hell of a punch too, with powerful bass and a 50W/96dB speaker. The RGB lights add to the fun, bringing a party atmosphere to your pitch, but you can always turn them off if you find them tacky. Remember to always adhere to your campsite’s noise rules and regulations: if there’s a designated quiet time, respect it – or else incur the wrath of every other family sharing the site.Tom, north-west LondonCool boxView image in fullscreenThe Filter’s top pick: Coleman Pro£129.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenColeman15l Performance cool box£35 at ArgosMy mates all said it was a waste of space to bring a massive cooler on a two-night camping trip. But who was laughing at the end of the day … when I was the only one with drinkable beer? Coolers aren’t even expensive, and when you factor in the savings from not having to drive out of camp to the nearest petrol station to pick up a few cold cans, it’s more than worth the initial spend.William,South YorkshireFor more,read our guide to the best cool boxesMini stoveThe Filter’s top pick:MSR SwitchView image in fullscreen£115 at LD Mountain Centre£114.75 at AmazonView image in fullscreenJetboil MightyMo£75 at BlacksView image in fullscreenJetboil MicroMo£134.95 at WildBoundsA Jetboil is essential for us whenever we go camping. It doesn’t matter if it’s a family outing or a week-long wilderness trek – the Jetboil is the first thing we pack. It’s lightweight and can bring water to the boil faster than any other camping stove we’ve tried. I’m always grateful to have it when I’m prepping dehydrated meals at the end of a long day’s hike.

It’s mainly used by carers, and it cleans you up without water, so it’s worth its weight in gold when you can’t shower. It was a life-saver for my pits at El Dorado festival last year.Mel, south Londonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

To get this mat ready, all you need to do is lay it out flat, unscrew the valve and … actually, that’s it. Come back later, tighten up the valve and go to sleep. In my experience, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to fully inflate, but if you’re in a rush, you can still inflate it manually.

A nod to theflying geese quilt pattern, which may have served as a coded message for enslaved people escaping to freedom along the Underground Railroad, the design and container serve as a bridge between the past and the future of the African diaspora. At the center of the art project by the Brooklyn-based transmedia artist Stephanie Dinkins, a large screen displays artificial intelligence (AI) generated images that showcase the diversity of the city.Commissioned by the New York-based art non-profit More Art and designed in collaboration with the architects LOT-EK, the AI laboratoryIf We Don’t, Who Will?will be on display until 28 September. It seeks to challenge a white-dominated generative-AI space by highlighting Black ethos and cultural cornerstones.During a time when society has become increasingly reliant on AI, Dinkins wants the models to learn the history, hopes and dreams of Black and brown people to more accurately represent US demographics. She sees her work as shifting the AI landscape, which has been trained on biased data and encapsulates a worldview that is not reflective of the global majority. Black people are underrepresented in the AI field, with Black workers composing just7.4% of the hi-tech workforce. Research has shown that lack of representation in AI can lead to discriminatory outcomes, such aspredictive policing tools that target Black communitiesandtenant screening programs that reject renters of color.“What stories can we tell machines that will help them know us better from the inside of the community out, instead of the way that we’re often described, from outside in, which is often incorrect or misses a mark in some way, or knows us as a consumerist body, not as a human body,” Dinkins said. “I have this question: ‘Can we make systems of care and generosity?’”View image in fullscreenA person examines the If We Don’t, Who Will? AI laboratory in downtown Brooklyn, New York City.Photograph: Driely  CarterAt the AI laboratory, one image on the screen is of a young Black girl with an afro hairstyle who stares at the viewer, her steady gaze belying her artificial nature. QR codes stationed around the public art project lead to anappwhere people are invited to submit their own personal stories or to answer prompts such as “what privileges do you have in society?” People around the world can also answer questions through the app. A ramp leads to the inside of the container, where after a few minutes, a large screen displays a generated image that reflects the information that patrons submitted in the app. Images that appear on a loop until another response is uploaded are mostly portraits of people of color, even if the person who submitted it is not one themselves.‘Art can be a release’: how Black Girls in Art Spaces is bridging cultural gapsRead moreDinkins programmed the generative art to prioritize Black and brown worldviews and figures. She did so by fine-tuning different AI models, programs that recognize patterns through datasets. Dinkins and her team of developers fed the models images by the Black photographer Roy DeCarava, who captured photos of Black people in Harlem. They also programmed it using African American Vernacular English so that the models would learn to recognize its tonality and better generate images based on the stories of people who use it. She also created imagery of okra, a main ingredient in the dishes of enslaved Africans and their descendants, which are displayed in the portraits as a talisman that she sees as connecting the past and present.“We’re in this AI technological landscape that is changing our world. I don’t have a clue how it can do well by us if it does not know us,” Dinkins said. While she empathizes with the public’s desire to protect their privacy in the AI era, she said, “We also have to have those spaces where we say this information isn’t for ourselves. It should be shared because it is a way that we are current, training and nurturing the technology that we are living under.”Democratizing AIDinkins, who was named one of the100 most influential people in AI in 2023 by Time magazine, is a self-proclaimed “tinkerer” without formal technology training. She became interested in AI more than a decade ago after coming across a YouTube video of a Black woman AI robot, Bina48, which depicts Bina Rothblatt, co-founder of the not-for-profit Terasem Movement Foundation, which researches ways to extend human life.Her ongoing projectConversations With Bina48, which began in 2014, features recorded video interviews of her talking with the robot. She later created her own AI system that served as a Black American family memoir. In her projectNot the Only One,Dinkins created a voice-interactive device that spoke to passersby and was trained on conversations that she had with her niece and aunt.Dinkins’s projects are a step toward democratizing AI by bringing technology to underrepresented people in spaces where they normally would not have access to it, said Louis Chude-Sokei, a Boston University English professor. There is a long history of algorithms outputting racist or sexist material because they are trained on the internet, which is teeming with racist and sexist stereotypes, said Chude-Sokei, who specializes in literature as well as technology and race.View image in fullscreenAn image from the If We Don’t, Who Will? AI laboratory in downtown Brooklyn, New York City.Photograph: Driely  Carter“What Stephanie wants to do is [pose the question]: ‘What if we can start to train different algorithms to respond to different datasets that have liberating content or socially just content?’” Chude-Sokei said. “Let’s just take a hold of the datasets and create different patterns for it to recognize and see what kind of conclusions it will produce based on different materials and different patterns.”Dinkins and other artists of color focusing on technology are shifting the paradigm of the AI landscape, he said, by putting the tools into the hands of the global majority. “There’s a much larger reorientation of the social world, the political world, the cultural world that’s happening with AI,” Chude-Sokei said. Dinkins’s work, he added, embraces a philosophy she coined calledAfro-now-ism, which she defines as taking action toward a better world today. It’s a “celebration of seeing technology, not as this horrific thing that we have no control over”, Chude-Sokei said, “but something that we can engage in very joyful, creative and positive ways, while at the same time, being aware of the dangers”.For Beth Coleman, a professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in technology and society, it’s imperative that AI models be trained on a wide range of datasets to ensure that they produce an accurate representation of the world. Dinkins’ work, she said, interrogates which voices are included in technical systems.“There’s a good spirit of ‘how can we build a better world together?’ in Stephanie’s work,” Coleman said, “and at this moment in time that feels pretty revolutionary.”Explore more on these topicsArtArtificial intelligence (AI)Black US cultureRaceBrooklynNew YorkComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could video games be the ultimate relationship tool?Keith StuartWed 23 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 10.03 EDTShareLast week, Radio 4’sWoman’s Hourtalked about the role of women in the video games industry. It featured interviews with gaming insiders, from esports presenterFrankie Wardto members of the inclusive online communityBlack Girl Gamers. It was wonderful to hear so many disparate, expert views on games culture being given so much time on the show.One of my favourite moments was when presenter Nuala McGovern read out some listener responses to the question: why do you play video games? “I don’t think there’s enough recognition of gaming as an activity for couples,” one replied. “My husband and I bonded over our shared love of gaming. Our honeymoon was playing Borderlands 2 while we saved for a flat deposit, and now, with a young child, we explore stories, we visit new worlds, we solve mysteries … There is an underappreciated romance to gaming – we communicate, encourage, collaborate and celebrate together. It’s a joy.”I found this very moving because I know many friends who met their partners through playing games, and who see the act of gaming together as a much more textured and immersive experience than wallowing in front of a TV series. I’ve lost count of the number of couples who’ve told me they especially enjoyed playing survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill together – even though they are strictly single-player experiences. Sharing scary games is a way of lessening the terror while exploring an abandoned orphanage or science lab. It introduces an element of physicality – as does taking it in turns to use the joypad, swapping it from hand to hand, like an intimate gift.View image in fullscreenAn elaborate dating site … Final Fantasy XIV.Playing a video game with someone you’re falling in love with, meanwhile, gives you a new perspective on who they are and what they can do. It’s helpful to know your partner is brilliant at solving spatial puzzles, or that they’re determined and resourceful when faced with tricky tasks. If nothing else, it’s a hint at exactly how it’s going to go when you end up assembling an Ikea bookshelf together. Recently, I wrote aboutthe use of video games in child therapy, and one of the counsellors I spoke to, Ellie Finch, is looking at doing couples therapy in Minecraft because it’s often a space where all the people in the relationship feel comfortable. I suspect that challenging clients to build a simple house together will tell her more about their interpersonal dynamic than two hours of talking.There is a lot of romance in experiencing new places together, getting lost and combining skills to help each other out of calamities. There is sweetness in a shared Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing escapade; there is intellectual challenge in quiet evenings with Blue Prince or Split Fiction. For too long, gaming was seen as the preserve of lonely young men, a hobby too guarded and insular for lovers; now everyone can play and the digital world is opening up. Lots of people are now effectively using online games such as Final Fantasy XIV and GTA Online as highly elaborate dating sites, sometimesmeeting and forming relationships in real life. Games remove many barriers – the expense of going out, the vulnerability of meeting strangers – they are test spaces for the romance-curious.I hope that as this generation of gamers age, they will keep playing together. I hope they show their grandchildren the levels they designed in Super Mario Maker, or the beautiful apartment they constructed in The Sims – the digital photo albums of entire lifetimes together.Gameshave so much to tell us about each other, if we are open to play and being playful.What to playView image in fullscreenTiny fun … Neogeo Super Pocket.Photograph: Blaze EntertainmentLast year I reviewed the Super Pocket from Blaze Entertainment, a funky little handheld capable of playing a range of cartridge-based retro games. Now there’s a newSuper Pocket Neogeo edition, inspired by the cult 1990 console by the Japanese manufacturer SNK, in the familiar black and gold colouring. It comes loaded with 14 Neogeo titles and it’s a really intriguing selection, from bona fide classics such as side-scroller Metal Slug X and formative fighting game Fatal Fury. There are lesser known gems, too, including luscious beat-’em-ups Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy and Mutation Nation. The Super Pocket will also run all the other carts designed for Blaze’s Evercade consoles, opening a whole galaxy of well-emulated retro delicacies.Available on:Super Pocket consoleEstimated playtime:countless nostalgic hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenNothing new under the sun … Shadow of the Colossus.Photograph: Sony Computer EntertainmentVGC hasa translation of a recent Japanese interviewwith Ico and Shadow of the Colossus designer Fumito Ueda, who claimed that “the age ofgame mechanicsis over”. His assertion was that developers were no longer inventing new mechanics and were focusing on existing design techniques as well as the look and feel of games. It’s a provocative assertion, perhaps gaming’s equivalent of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man – but I hope he’s wrong.Valve has been removingadult gamesfrom Steam, reportedly as a result ofpressure from credit card companies. An Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout has claimed responsibility – the organisation recently published an open letter to payment processors such as PayPal and Mastercard claiming that games available on the digital store featured child abuse and incest. Vice has gatheredreactions from Steam customers.Somehow, I’m not surprised by the discovery thatNintendo employeesrarely leave the company. Games site GoNintendo hasshared some employment data from the companyshowing that staff in Japan stay with the company for 14.4 years on average, with people at offices elsewhere staying between eight and a half and 10 years. It’s nice to know that, amid the crisis in the industry, with thousands of staff being laid off, at least one major company apparently knows how to nurture its workforce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nice if you have the money, don’t you think?Emma BrockesYou can’t blame DeGeneres for wanting to escape a toxic atmosphere. But she is of the exalted class who can buy themselves out of a bindWed 23 Jul 2025 12.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 22.12 EDTShareYou may remember the first half of 2020, when, as light relief during the early stages of the pandemic, we could look towards the banks of celebrities trying to raise our spirits and come together in mutual hostility. Schools and industries had shut down, key workers were struggling, but the one certainty in life that remained undisrupted was that, as long as Gal Gadot and Natalie Portman kept sharing their inspo-content, we would never run short of a laugh. Covid ended and now we haveDonald Trump– and guess what, some of that dynamic is back.It’s different this time because the threat is different, but for anyone living in the US who has glanced, longingly, towards Europe or Canada and wondered about the possibility of moving, comments made byEllen DeGeneresthis week may strike a familiar note; specifically, the extraordinary tone deafness that only high net-worth individuals can hit when trying to share in a common experience. DeGeneres and her wife, the actor Portia de Rossi, moved to rural Oxfordshire last year and this week, DeGeneres was interviewed on stage in Cheltenham and gave us some insight into exactly what happened.“We got here [to England] the day before the election and we woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis,”said DeGeneres, to a crowd of 600or so at the Everyman theatre. “We were like, ‘We’re staying here, we’re not going back, we are not leaving.’ So yeah, we bought a house that we thought was going to be a part-time house then we decided we needed a different house and now we’re selling that house. If anybody wants a house. It’s a beautiful house. It’s a beautiful stone farmhouse.”A lot to unpack here, obviously, but let’s start with “we’re selling that house / if anybody wants a house / it’s a beautiful house”. As anyone who has moved countries knows, there are all sorts of problems to be solved in the first flush of arrival, chief among them panic-buying the first eight-figure house you stumble across and then wondering what to do with the horses. So it was that, while the property to which DeGeneres refers has a pool, a helipad and what E! Newsdescribed this weekas a “party barn” – which they may or may not believe to be common British usage – sadly itdoesn’thave a big enough stable. “Portia couldn’t live without her horses,” DeGeneres told the Wall Street Journal this week – there but for the grace of God, etc – anyway if anybody wants it, it’s on for £22.5m and the Daily Mail has all the details.There are, of course, real reasons for Americans in general and DeGeneres and her wife in particular to want to flee the US and at the existential level, fear of Trump can strike anyone. During the talk in Cheltenham, the former talkshow host spoke about the threat posed by the US president to LGBTQ+ communities, mentioning in particular the revived enthusiasm among certain Christian sects in the US for rowing back federal protection of same-sex marriage. If necessary, said DeGeneres, the pair would remarry in Britain.But it is also true that, like wealthy women seeking an abortionbefore 1973or in southern states today, there is almost no bind that money can’t buy you out of – in this case, moving countries without any of the customary friction. And so DeGeneres and her wife find themselves newly absorbed into the immigrant-expat continuum, occupied at one end by undocumented immigrants being seized and deported in the US by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and at the other, by those so wealthy they can go on holiday and seemingly decide, on a whim, to stay for ever. Each experience is attended by different rules, terminologies and demonisations, and is subject to sometimes fiercely defended distinctions from other, less favourable categories.For instance, I remember making the mistake, once, of asking an American friend about her grandparents’ emigration to the US from Europe, assuming rather romantically that they’d gone through Ellis Island. She looked appalled and informed me, crossly, that they’d come in on an ocean liner and docked directly in the city, the family piano safely crated in the hold. No one on that boat was inspected for head lice. “We werelegal.” Those belonging to communities targeted by Trump who also voted for Trump are less baffling when you consider these differences.None of which, of course, pertains to Ellen DeGeneres, who is worth the sort of money (an estimated $450m) that makes the visa problem faced by most Americans hoping to move away from Trump – or stay in the US in spite of Trump – disappear. Still, even among the elite, moving entails a steep learning curve. The new house DeGeneres and her wife have moved into isn’t far from the old one but is a much newer building, enabling the Mail to prod one local into calling it a “monstrosity”, and a possibly different local into saying “it looks like a prison”.DeGeneres, meanwhile, is still in the honeymoon period, and finding it all very beautiful. As she told the crowd at Cheltenham this week, she considers her new compatriots “polite,” the life here “simpler”, and has reached the conclusion that, “everything here is better”. Whether that’s the charms of the English countryside or the insulating effect of super-wealth we can’t know for sure. Either way, we look forward to watching the progress of the entertainer’s application to put up a large stable in an area of outstanding natural beauty make its way through the famously helpful and accommodating English planning authorities.

It’s about us, not themJessica Ciencin HenriquezThe public shaming won’t bring real justice. But it fulfills a fantasy of accountability we rarely experience in our own livesWed 23 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt wasn’t just that a mangot caughtcheating on his wife. It was that he did it in public. With the whole stadium watching. With Chris Martin, unknowingly, teeing it up. With a camera zooming in at the exact wrong – or maybe karmically perfect – moment. The CEO. The HR director. The affair. The panic. The humiliation. All of it caught, dissected and shared a million times over.We didn’t watch that video because we loveColdplay(though, don’t we?). We didn’t watch just for the scandal. We watched because – despite our small steps toward enlightenment – we’re all starving for the satisfaction of seeing someone finally get what they deserve.That’s the part we need to talk about.According to a2023 studyin Computers in Human Behavior Reports, the satisfaction we feel during public shaming isn’t just about justice – it’s about pleasure. Their research found that people experience schadenfreude not only because they believe the person deserved it, but because it simplyfeels goodto watch someone face consequences. We’re not just looking for moral clarity. We’re chasing the emotional high that comes with it. We don’t just want closure, we want content. And cheating, exposed in public, has become the most satisfying genre of all.We as a culture areobsessedwith catching cheaters – not just for the drama, but for the justice. We want to see betrayal punished. We want the liar exposed, the philanderer humiliated, the partner who was faithful and trusting to be vindicated. And if we can’t get that in our own lives, we’ll take it from strangers.Justice is not the same as humiliation. Public shaming feels like accountability – but it rarely is accountabilityThis hunger has only grown over the years as the morally hollow have made careers out of turning scandal into spectacle and walking away untouched. But when the deception is undeniable, and the exposure unfiltered, it gives us something we rarely get: visible accountability.Within hours of that five-second clip surfacing, the internet did what it does best: turned a private moment into public symbolism. Their names were revealed along with their titles. Until the camera found them, they looked unbothered, cozy. Then her hand flew to cover her face. He ducked and waddled behind the seats. Then the entire internet gasped, and reached for their popcorn and pitchforks.You could feel the collective applause ripple through the comments section. We all know the feeling of being deceived. We know the sharp loneliness of loving someone who’s looking elsewhere, of having suspicions but not proof, accusations returned with a side of gaslighting. So when someone gets caught in 4K, we devour the moment. The visuals were almost too perfect: the Coldplay ballad, the cheering crowd turning confused, the abrupt shift from smug to stunned.Don’t we all wish we had that experience? A camera that didn’t look away. A crowd that said: “We see it, too.” Because in our own lives, we confront; they deflect. We cry; they move on. And there’s no applause, no witness. Just you and an unrelenting ache, their version of what happened and the truth.The CEO and the HR director are merely serving as stand-ins for the guy who ghosted you after two years, the woman who swore nothing was going on with her co-worker, the husband who moved on so fast you wondered if you hallucinated your entire marriage. Watching those two squirm on screen is a kind of spiritual revenge. We tell ourselves it’s about ethics, boundaries, accountability. But at the end of the day, don’t we just want someone to answer for the betrayal we never got closure for?Obsessed with the Coldplay kiss cam story? I was too, until I realised the sinister truth at the heart of it | Arwa MahdawiRead moreOf course, pain is not performance. And justice is not the same as humiliation. Public shaming feels like accountability – but it rarely is accountability. As Jon Ronson warns in his book So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed: “An instant digital mob justice can devastate without offering redemption.” Watching strangers get exposed might feel good temporarily. We nod at the cosmic slap, but it doesn’t fix the trust broken in a marriage or the respect damaged in a workplace. It doesn’t change who they were when no one was watching.There’s a flip side to witnessing this embarrassmentthat flickers just below the surface. We might laugh, but something in us recoils as we imagine the real cost to those involved: lost jobs, fractured marriages, psychological fallout for their children. A hyperlink trail that will follow them to the grave.As Evan Nierman, author of The Cancel Culture Curse and CEO of the crisis PR firm Red Banyan, puts it: “The internet has a way of locking people into their worst moment. When a misstep goes viral, the court of public opinion rarely allows space for explanation, nuance, or repair.”And once the pile-on begins, it escalates fast. “Digital shame operates at a scale and speed our psychology isn’t built for,” he warns. “What starts as a laugh can quickly spiral into character assassination, with consequences that long outlast a viral moment.”Yetthismoment – our collective gasp at betrayal made universal – revealed something crucial: we’re craving truth, acknowledgment. We’re craving slow, messy, quiet reckoning with accountability that extends beyond the tap-and-scroll. But in a world where real accountability is rare, a viral headline like thisfeelsclose enough – as though love, loyalty and truth might still mean something, even if only for a moment on the Jumbotron.Jessica Ciencin Henriquez is a writer in Ojai, California, and the author of the forthcoming essay collection, If You Loved Me, You Would Know.

According to the Times, the Democrats’ estrangement from the working class was decades in the making. The party’s enthusiastic embrace of trade and globalization led to the closure of factories across industrial America, eliminating jobs that had been a prime source of stability, identity and prestige.While many Democrats attributed Trump’s success to the left’s embrace of “woke” language and causes like transgender rights, the Times observed, the economic seeds of his victories “were sown long ago”. A longtime AFL-CIO official was quoted as saying that “one of the things that has been frustrating about the narrative ‘the Democrats are losing the working class’ is that people are noticing it half a century after it happened”.Given the long incubation of this development, one might say the Times itself was late in recognizing it. But the question remains: how can Democrats win back those working-class voters?One key question has dominated: should the party move to the left or tack toward the center? Should it stress progressivism or moderation? In a way, though, it’s a false choice. The Democrats could combine both approaches in a policy of pragmatic populism, fusing the insurgent ideas and galvanizing fire of an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with the plainspoken bread-and-butter appeal of a Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, an auto-repair shop owner who represents a rural district in Washington state.The supreme court is giving a lawless president the green light | Steven GreenhouseRead morePragmatic populism would offer sweeping solutions to the economic anxiety facing so many American families but without the polarizing rhetoric. It would avoid labels like “oligarch” and “tycoon”, drop references to socialism and redistribution and refrain from saying that billionaires should not exist (even though a strong case can be made for that proposition).Instead, pragmatic populists would adopt a message of “let us join together to create a more perfect union”. They would promote the idea of a social contract, founded on the notion that those who have surged ahead economically have an obligation to help those who have been left behind. They would argue that the .01% have thrived thanks to an economic system built over decades of public investment in schools, roads, ports, communications, regulatory agencies, the police and the courts, and that the very wealthy need to “give back” (as super-rich philanthropists are fond of saying) so that ordinary working people can share fully in the fruits.To consider how this would work, take the issue of childcare. A pragmatic populist would say: “The skyrocketing cost of childcare is crushing families across the country. In New York City, the typical family is spending a quarter of its income on such care, and many parents, especially mothers, have to quit the workforce to look after their kids. And childcare providers earn so little that many are leaving the industry. We need to provide parents more in tax credits and providers more in wage subsidies. The cost will not be negligible, but such a policy would not only ease the struggles of parents but also make them more productive workers. So we’re going to ask corporations and the very wealthy to contribute somewhat more in taxes to help make that happen.”Or take dental care. While food deserts have gotten a lot of attention, dentistry deserts have not. According to the CDC, nearly 60 million Americans live in areas in which dental services are in short supply. Even where such services are available, the cost of root canals, implants and crowns can be prohibitive, especially for the working class. Two-thirds of the shortages are in rural America, and a program to expand the Affordable Care Act to include dental insurance could help the Democrats make inroads in a part of the US they have all but lost.Small businesses offer another ripe constituency. Such enterprises (defined as having revenues of less than $40m and workforces of under 500) make up more than 99% of all firms in the country. Many of them are hampered by fines, fees and red tape. The Democrats have long been seen as indifferent or even hostile to this sector. In a promising sign of change, the New York mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, has proposed creating a “mom-and-pop czar” to help ease the regulatory burden on the city’s bodegas, pharmacies, barber shops and beauty salons.These businesses also have a hard time getting credit. Most are too small to interest the mega banks that dominate the US financial system. The thousands of small banks in the country that do cater to this community are themselves under tremendous strain. The Democrats could propose ways of easing the availability of credit for small-business owners, especially Black and Latino ones, who often lack the necessary credit records and collateral.The hemorrhaging of Black and Latino voters is among the most troubling developments for Democrats. Many complain that the party shows up every four years asking for their vote, then forgets about them. During the recent election, Trump’s surge among Latinos in Texas’s Rio Grande valley offered a stinging rebuke to a party that had long counted on their support. “I think Democrats have historically taken the Rio Grande valley for granted,” Beto O’Rourke, the former senatorial candidate,told the Guardianlast summer. “Republicans saw an opportunity, they’re hungry, and they’ve gone after it, investing money and running strong candidates with resources behind them.” The Democrats have by contrast spent heavily on Washington-based consultants and lobbyists, starving local operations of funds and hollowing out the party’s infrastructure on the ground.Where the Democrats are present, they have a reputation for being bad listeners given to lecturing people about what’s good for them. This has to change. Here are some recommendations for Democrats – politicians and otherwise:Don’t ask what’s the matter with Kansas.Don’t ask how Trump voters can vote against their interests.Don’t ask evangelical Christians how they can support someone like Trump.Don’t claim that the facts and science are on your side.Don’t claim that Trump voters are victims of disinformation.Don’t blame the Democrats’ unpopularity on Fox News and other rightwing outlets.Don’t campaign with celebrities.Don’t sermonize when discussing climate change.Don’t call Trump supporters stupid.That last suggestion might pose the greatest challenge of all. Even after the accumulation of so much evidence about the resentment that blue-collar Americans feel at the hands of white-collar liberals, condescension remains rampant. This was clear from the more than 2,000 reader comments posted on the Times article about the Democrats’ loss of the working class.Some samples: “They’re just dumb, bitter jerks who were looking for permission to be as resentful and judgmental in public as they were in private.” “The working class has, by and large, left the 4th estate for the purveyors of disinformation.” “I have to live with trump as president the next 4 years and possibly the rest of my life because of these ‘working class’ idiots who vote against their own interests.” “Most working class people are not reading the NYT, or any conventional news sources—this goes double for the Trump supporters amongst them. They are ignorant.”In the end, such an outlook is neither pragmatic nor populist.Michael Massing is the author of Fatal Discord: Erasmus, Luther, and the Fight for the Western Mind.

We need new leadersWed 23 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.18 EDTShareLast week – just a few days after Stephen Colbert called out his parent company for paying Donald Trump millions of dollars – CBScanceledthe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Maybe now people will finally stop saying Trump is good for comedy.In this latest Trump administration, I often joke that I’m just not cut out for being this furious all the time. I’m a comedy writer. I’m built for naming dogs Doctor Reginald Pancakes and writing sentences like “Every woman’s deodorant is called Delicate Whisper and every man’s deodorant is called Beef Shazam!” Igetthat there’s nothing more annoying than a comedian getting all serious, and yet here we are.So first, let’s address the obvious: was the cancellation for political reasons or, as the network claims, for “purely financial” reasons. My answer? Yes. The problem is we keep treating those like they’re separate things.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreCBS isn’t ending the show for 10 months. They could have made the announcement whenever they wanted. But they chose to tell Stephen Colbert, host of thehighest-rated network late night show, just 48 hours after hecalledParamount’s payment to Trump a “big fat bribe”. They chose to cancel the Peabody award-winning show in the midst of an attempt to sell Paramount to a company called Skydance, a merger that has to be approved by the Trump administration. They chose to tell Colbert they were canceling his show,one dayafter the CEO of Skydance met with the FCC anddiscussed“CBS’s editorial decision-making”.Basically, if the decision wasn’t political, then Paramount sure is happy to let itlookpolitical, and at that point there’s no meaningful difference. Whether the network canceled the Late Show to appease Trump or not, they did it knowing he’d think so.CBS wants it both ways. They want the viewers to believe they’re an unbiased network and they want Trump to think they’ll do anything he wants.So that’s what I think as a human being who lives in this world right now. But, as a comedy writer who wrote for late night TV for almost a decade? Well, I can’t stop thinking about the jokes. This cancellation is really sad to me because I believe in the power of jokes.Late night hosts are our way of saying: “Hey, this is crazy, right? RIGHT?”True story: once a guy was mugging me and he started punching me in the face. I told a joke and he STOPPED PUNCHING ME. That is the power of jokes. (No, I will not tell you the joke. Because I’d say it and then you’d be all “C’mon, it’s not that funny” and then I’d have to be all: “No, you had to be there. It’s not as funny when you aren’t punching me in the face.”)The thing about jokes is that they require a shared base of knowledge. A shared reality. If I tell a joke about a commercial and you’ve never seen that commercial, the joke isn’t going to go over very well. Losing late night shows is one more step toward losing a shared reality, and that to me is terrifying.There is a moment every New Yorker knows. It happens when you’re on the subway and someone does something particularly insane: an 83-year-old white lady raps, or a man in a three-piece suit publicly clips his toenails. And then you catch the eye of someone across the train – they raise their eyebrows and you raise your eyebrows back. And then you feel a little better. Because someone else saw what you saw and they can confirm that it’ssomething.Late night hosts likeStephen Colbertdo that on a larger scale. They’re our way of saying: “Hey, this is crazy, right? RIGHT?” In this world of algorithmic bubbles and blatant lies and deepfakes, late night television is a place you can gather at night and say: “Yes, this happened and it is fucking weird.”Here’s another thing I like about jokes: the basis of jokes is truth. I’ve written books, speeches, game shows and news articles and I’veneverbeen fact-checked as hard as I was when writing late night television. Jokes just don’t work if they’re not based on something true.And for our leaders? The ability to take a joke matters. If our corporate overlords and representatives in government can’t handle being joked about on late night TV, we don’t need new shows. We need new leaders. In this current system – with a Congress and a supreme court who want nothing more than to cater to Trump’s every whim – we don’t have a lot of options to hold our leaders accountable. In a free society, joking about our leaders isn’t just helpful or fun, it’s vital.For me, this isn’t just about Colbert. (I met him once. In 2014, the day Last Week Tonight with John Oliver was set to tape our first show, Colbert came to our office and went from room to room to congratulate each member of the staff and to wish us luck. It was a kind gesture that I’ll long remember.)It’s not just about his staff – a couple hundred people who in my experience are thoughtful, hilarious, ridiculously competent people at the top of their game.It’s not even just about the humiliating weakness the television networks continue to display as the president sues them into silence.It’s about the jokes. We need the jokes. Because this country could really use a break from getting punched in the face.Jill Twiss has won multiple Emmys and Peabody awards as a senior writer on HBO’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliverand a staff writer on The Amber Ruffin ShowExplore more on these topicsStephen ColbertOpinionTV comedyTelevisionComedyUS televisionUS television industryCBScommentShareReuse this content"

The number of people admitted to hospital or dying from starvationhas surged. The journalists’ union forAgence France-Presse(AFP) has issued a statement warning that “without intervention, the last reporters in Gaza” will die of hunger.This is horribly shocking, but it is no surprise: after all, we are now more than 140 days into Israel’s total siege on Gaza. In May, Israel abolished the UN’s effective method of delivering aid in favour of a dystopian system in which Palestinians are forced to compete for a trickle of often unusable aid, and are shot at while doing so. About 1,000 civilians have been murdered while seeking food since the end of May. “There is no case since World War II of starvation that has been so minutely designed and controlled,”declares Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on hunger. Under the Geneva conventions, “starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited”.Against this backdrop, on Monday the former Tory cabinet minister Kit Malthouse stood up in parliament and asked the foreign secretary,David Lammy, if he did “not see the personal risk to him, given our international obligations, that he may end up at The Hague because of his inaction?” Lammy bent over the dispatch box and adopted a tone of solemn disappointment, as one might do when seeking to rise above an unprovoked insult. “I have to tell him that it demeans his argument when he personalises it in the way that he does,” he shot back.But Malthouse did not resort to abuse. Indeed, the presiding deputy speaker did not reprimand him for unparliamentary language. Lammy intentionally conflated scrutiny with personal attack to avoid answering the question. Alas, like our prime minister, he is a lawyer by trade, and he should know that thegenocide convention of 1948identifies five punishable acts: one of them is “complicity in genocide”. He should know that signatories to the convention have a legal obligation “to prevent and to punish” the crime of genocide. He should also know that his country signed the convention the day it was published, and incorporated it into law 55 years ago.Israel’s official position is that,when it is finished, no Palestinians will remain in Gaza. “We are destroying more and more homes, and Gazans have nowhere to return to,” Benjamin Netanyahu openly boasts. It is building what its former prime minister Ehud Olmertsays is a “concentration camp”as the first step before deporting Gaza’s survivors. Eyal Benvenisti – theIsraeli lawyerwho is part of the legal team defending it against accusations of genocide at the international court of justice – says this would be a “war crime” and “fits the definition of a ‘crime against humanity’”. He subsequentlysigned a letterdeclaring that this plan “under certain conditions, could amount to the crime of genocide”.Indeed, international law leaves no room for doubt. When the UK ratified thearms trade treaty in 2014, it accepted that it must not “authorise any transfer of conventional arms … if it has knowledge at the time of authorisation … [that] would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes”. It also accepted that this included “parts and components” essential to the functioning of “combat aircraft”. Lammy’s governmentsupplies Israel with components crucial for the functioning of F-35 jets, whose bombs indiscriminately destroy civilian infrastructure and shred the bodies of little children. Lammy also knows, of course, that Britain is a founding member of the international criminal court, which last yearissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and his former defence minister for war crimes and crimes against humanity.When successfully defending the sale of F-35 components in the high court, the government offered its assessment that it had not seen anyevidence of women and childrenbeing deliberately targeted in Gaza, and there was no serious risk of a genocide. This contradicts dozens of American doctors and nurses who served in Gaza, who last year testified they hadreceived the bodies of Palestinian childrenshot in the head or chest by Israeli snipers.Israeli soldiers have confessedthat they are deliberately targeting children. Nick Maynard – a British doctor working in Gaza’s Nasser hospital –says thathe is seeing clusters of young teenagers who have been shot in different body parts: on one day, it’s the abdomen, on another, the head or neck, on another, the testicles. “So there’s a very clear pattern and it’s almost as if a game is being played,” he says.The government’s official position of genocide denial contradicts the consensus of actual genocide scholars who dedicate their lives to the field. That includes Israeli academics such as Omer Bartov, a pre-eminent professor of Holocaust and genocide studies, who said that as a former IDF officer he agonised overreaching his conclusion: “But I have been teaching classes on genocide for a quarter of a century. I can recognise one when I see one.”Those who have facilitated or justified this abomination have no excuses, no place to hide. More than a year ago, South Africa’s legal teamcomposed a dossierdetailing statements of genocidal and criminal intent issued by Israeli leaders and officials: it was 121 – pages long, and is now completely out of date. There is more video footage of civilians being slaughtered and civilian infrastructure being destroyed than any other war crime as it was happening in history.Yet not only does Britain supply Israel with those crucial F-35 components, its government refuses to describe a single Israeli act as a “war crime”, because it knows that then imposes sweeping legal obligations. Britain continues itsannual tradewith Israel, which last year was worth £5.8bn. Days after its tokenistic gesture ofsuspending trade treaty talks, Britain’s embassy in Israelcelebrated the arrivalof the UK trade envoy. When Britain imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, it did so on the grounds of their “horrendous extremist language”, rather than actions, because the latter implicates the British government. They refuse to impose meaningful sanctions on Israel itself.Byproscribing Palestine Action, the government has assured that it is opponents of genocide who face being hauled before the dock in the here and now. Our foreign secretary no doubt believes that the impunity traditionally enjoyed by western leaders and Israel itself will protect him and his colleagues for ever. That assumes the winds will never change. There is no statute of limitation for complicity in genocide. Israel’s crime is not yet complete. Lammy must believe that his freedom is safe for ever: that there will be no knock on his door in five, 10, 20 years.

The other problem is the debate remains bounded in purposeful obfuscation. That is why it is very pleasing to read Acoss’s new report – Taxing income less and consumption more: The case against – which factchecks some myths about Australia’s tax system.Acoss provides three points that need to be the basis of any discussion of tax.Australia is a low-taxing nationIf you can’t admit Australia is a low-taxing nation, then you should not get entry into any roundtable discussion on the topic. As Acoss notes, Australia is the ninth-lowest taxing nation across all the advanced economies in the world. We raise less tax than every nation in the G7 except for the US. We raise less tax than South Korea, Canada, Japan, or the UK.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn 2022 (the latest OECD-wide figures) the average level of tax across the OECD was 34% of GDP, while in Australia it was just 29.4% of GDP.If the graph does not display click hereThat’s the equivalent of an extra $128bn.And sure, you might say, “that’s how it is, we can’t change that”.But we change things all the time in our tax system. Paul Keating introduced capital gains tax, John Howard introduced a 50% capital gains tax discount and the GST. We used to have inheritance taxes, and then Joh Bjelke-Petersen got rid of them in 1977:If the graph does not display click hereWe also change our spending – we haven’t always had Medicare or the NDIS. Nothing needs to only be the way it is or was.In 1970, total government tax revenue was 20.5% of GDP; within 15 years it was 27.5% of GDP – that’s a bigger shift than to go from where we are now to the OECD average.Nothing is fixed.If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is not overly reliant on income taxThe myth that we are a big income-taxing nation refuses to die.Independent MP Allegra Spender, for example, likes to say inher social media videosandtax “green paper”that “we need to lower the tax burden on working people through lowering income taxes” because we need to rebalance “tax revenue from income taxes on labour towards other sources of tax” to ensure “sustainability”.Ken Henry is right to be a bit worked up – he has a solid reform plan ready to go for an emboldened Labor | Tom McIlroyRead moreExcept, as Acoss details, we are the seventh-lowest taxer of personal income in the OECD, and the 11th lowest when you include corporate income:If the graph does not display click hereAs the Acoss report notes, Australia’s “share of personal income and social security taxes is 40%, below the OECD average of 50%”:If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is less dependent on personal income taxes than every country in the G7 and yet, apparently, we need to reduce our dependency even more.Even compared with our own history we’re not all that dependent on private income tax:If the graph does not display click hereIncreasing the GST will hurt low-middle income earnersOften talk about needing to reduce our dependency on income tax is followed by a call to increase the GST. Conservative economists like to argue a GST is the most efficient tax.Caring more about tax efficiency rather than equity is rather revealing but, even still, as Acoss notes, the GST is not actually much more efficient than income tax.They note that previous Treasury research found increasing the GST to 15% and reducing income tax to compensate “would deliver negligible GDP gains”. The difference in efficiency of income tax and GST is so small that it would barely register in the overall economy.So, the only reason you would do it is if it was fairer. But, as Acoss finds, it is decidedly not so.Around the bottom 60% of households would be worse off from an increase in the GST to 15% combined with a 5% income tax cut.If the graph does not display click hereThe government could instead increase low-income benefits but, as Acoss argues, these are notoriously temporary.They note, for example, that the GST support package included “$3 per week per child family payments … together with an increase of up to $7 per week per family for sole parent families”. That was great until “seven years later, income support for sole parents with school age children was cut by $25 per week”.So where does this leave us?Capital gains for the rich and persistent gender pay gaps: what we can learn from the ATO’s annual tax statistics | Greg JerichoRead moreThe problem is not dependency on income taxes but that we have overly generous income tax breaks for those who do not need them other than for reasons that have little economic basis.As Acoss argues, “tax concessions for superannuation are excessively generous for people who don’t need support to save for retirement” and similarly “capital gains tax and negative gearing concessions encourage speculation in land, undermine housing affordability and divert investment from more productive purposes”.We don’t need to increase the GST but we could broaden it to include things like private health insurance and private school fees which would actually be progressive. Some in the private school sector arealready getting antsy about this(as they should).And here’s the thing – we don’t need to only fund things with more GST – we could tax wealth and better tax gas companies and all the proceeds could go into the GST bucket that the states get.There are a lot of ways to improve the tax system but, if you can’t admit the three points above, you really should admit you don’t belong in the conversation.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsTaxGrogonomicsAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

That abuse is what makes it necessary: that call was wrongWed 23 Jul 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 10.33 EDTShareLove or hate: that seems to be the lot of Black England footballers. Score and the nation adores you – you represent the best of British. Have a bad match, and the mob bigotry descends – go back to where you came from, you bloody immigrant.So it is that today England are celebrating supersub teenager Michelle Agyemang, whose last-minute equaliser – for the second match running – kept the national team in the Euros. Meanwhile, teammate Jess Carter was still reeling from the racial abuse she suffered at the hands of England fans after performances in earlier matches that were deemed below par.It’s a similar story for England’s men: “heroes” Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Ollie Watkins scored game-changing goals all the way to the Euros final last year. Three years earlier, when they missed crucial penalties, Saka and two of his teammates faced a tidal wave of race hate.The abuse this month, coming mainly from England fans, led to 27-year-oldJess Carter saying: “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race.”Her England colleagues, including her managerSarina Wiegman, have come out in support and condemned the “disgusting and disgraceful” racism – and last night, in protest, they decided not to take the knee before their semi-final against Italy. Instead, the players remained standing and the substitutes, just off pitch, lined up in support. But I’m left wondering, was that really the right thing to do?Taking the knee has, especially since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, become a signal known around the world highlighting the enduring evil of racism. No one ever claimed it would, on its own, end the bigotry and prejudice embedded in societies for decades. Yet it has given a brief occasional moment, seen by audiences around the world, to remind people that we’ve still got a long way to go.I can’t quite understand how it could possibly be a good thing, when there’s a clear sign that bigotry is still with us, to decide to abandon a protest against it. Worse, it seems that thePremier Leagueis now also considering ditching the gesture.In explaining the Lionesses’ decision, Wiegman – who coincidentally dropped Carter from the starting lineup last night – said taking the knee is not enough. “We’ve done that for a while. It seems that the impact is not good enough, as big as we think … we felt we had to do something else, something different.”Yet is there an equivalent gesture they could make that would be so resonant, so clear, so widely known, especially to an audience of millions beaming in from all over Europe? Last night’s standing protest was completely missable – it’s doubtful that anyone in the arena, let alone those watching on TV, noticed it.0:59Fans react to the moment England made it into Euro 2025 final – videoOf course, racism is not something youcan just “kick out”. Some commentators, including politicians, have claimed that the problem is “online abuse”, as if clamping down on social media will eradicate the problem; as if racism, prejudice and bigotry didn’t exist before social media. Anyone who stood on the football terraces in Britain anytime before the 1990s will know different.If you want to know why racism persists, a good place to look would be the national press, whose front pages provide an almost daily diet of intolerance – towards Muslims, migrants, and minorities in general. Or look to our politicians, who take their lead from those same newspapers for fear of a bad headline. And it’s not just Reform UK or the Tory party on the right. Why else would Keir Starmer – who, let’s remember,took the knee himselfin the early days of his Labour leadership – now talk about Britain being an “island of strangers” and oflegalmigration doing “incalculable damage” to Britain. (Several weeks later, long after the damage was done in making migrants and their children feel isolated and unwelcome, he said heregretted the comments.)The daily demonisation of people deemed outsiders leads to an atmosphere of suspicion, intolerance and prejudice. It denies people jobs and housing, makes them the target of heavy-handed policing, curtails theirfreedom of speech, unleashes hatred upon them on a regular basis – and a year ago led to them beingburned out of their homesbyrace-baiting mobsfor a crime they had nothing to do with. We’ve seen the seeds of this hatred again this week, outside anasylum hotelin Essex.Is now really the time to stop taking the knee?Lionesses stumble into final through blind luck but Agyemang offers glimpse of future | Jonathan LiewRead moreIronically, the England women’s team has its own history of racial imbalance: how was it, many asked – given the array of applicable talent – that the team that won the Euros in 2022, creating so much joy across the nation, hadno Black players? What a contrast with the men’s team, which has been fully multicultural for decades. Even last night, the Lionesses team was all-white through the second half – until Agyemang was brought on with five minutes left.Taking the knee has always been controversial: its originator,American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick, was in effect drummed out of the NFL for daring to challenge racism so publicly. In 2021, then home secretary Priti Patel criticised England players taking the knee as“gesture politics” and said fans have the right to boo them.I can appreciate why Carter and her teammates might feel frustrated by the lack of progress on race equality, and want something more to be done. But I’d look to those who’ve opposed this protest over the years, and how they’ve aligned themselves with prejudice and bigotry. Then I’d ask myself: “What would the racists want?” And do the opposite.Joseph Harker is the Guardian’s senior editor, diversity and developmentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But personal choice shouldn’t come at a cost to herd immunityWed 23 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.48 EDTShareAcross parts of the country this week, nursery workerswill don plastic aprons and gloves. With more than 500 confirmed cases of a life-threatening virus in England so far this year, and one child in Liverpoolhaving died this month, many nurseries are introducing emergency infection control measures such as PPE and social distancing.Stop me if you’re getting a rush of deja vu. It is striking how news of the current rise in measles cases, and the early response to it, could easily be describing the coronavirus pandemic. Except, unlike at the start of Covid, when our only defence was lockdowns, a safe and effective vaccine – the MMR jab – has long existed for measles. The problem is, many of those at risk –about one in six childrenaged five and under – have not had one or both doses. Watching nurseries bring back their Covid hygiene protocols while health professionals urge more people to get vaccinated, it feels as if we are blindly going over an old routine, desperately scrubbing surfaces with disinfectant and denial.There is already a debate brewing again over whether the unvaccinated should be allowed to use some public services, with Melanie Pilcher of the Early Years Alliance recently stating that nurseries shouldn’t turn away children who are not vaccinated against measles because it is “a parental choice”. Squint a bit and you can practically see yourself in your front garden banging a pot and pan for the NHS.There was a period, somewhere between stockpiling toilet rolls and Boris Johnson declaring everything was back to normal, when we had plans to learn lessons from Covid. Vaccine creators and scientists were going to be lauded. The social safety net would be valued; the NHS and key workers finally appreciated. There was some progress. For example, the Labour governmentbrought in sick payfor 1.3 million low-paid workers. But in many ways, the good intentions were chucked away along with the banana bread, not least when it came to public health.The infection control methods we learned during Covid – think regular inoculations, testing, air filters and masks in high-risk settings – have not been continued, and on some level, things are actually worse now. With school absences up, the last Conservative governmentactively encouraged studentsto go to class with mild (but potentially infectious) coughs and sore throats. Meanwhile, vaccine take-up has plummeted. Last winter, the number of NHS staff agreeing to the flu jab to protect patients crashed to its lowest level since 2010 (37.5%) – the fourth consecutive year these immunisation rates have fallen since the pandemic. At the same time, efforts to eradicate cervical cancer in England by 2040 are under threat as the number of pupils getting vaccinated against HPV has dropped by 17 percentage points since before the pandemic.This is in part a clear sign of the “vaccine fatigue” that the pandemic accelerated. Coupled with the rise in misinformation online and distrust of “elites”, the push to get vaccinated after being legally mandated to stay at home for months left a lasting distaste for – and distrust of – public health diktats. For some, the Covid rules were not a lesson in how collective action saves lives, but in how the state can control them.It is notable, though, that child immunisation rates were falling for several years before Covid hit, with the UK remarkably nowfailing to meetthe World Health Organization’s target of 95% coverage for herd immunity foranyroutine childhood jabs.The issue with vaccine uptake is not simply hesitancy but longstanding issues with access. Many low-income parents are unable to take time off work to get their child vaccinated, or can’t afford the transport to get there. There is also a lack of GP appointments in the first place.Meanwhile,aslyum seekersand other marginalised groups can be reluctant to engage with official health services. This makes it even more frustrating that funding has not been maintained for outreach efforts that were effective during the height of the pandemic, such as translators and community engagement.“The reality is we failed to learn from Covid about the investment needed forNHSteams and local authorities to do outreach in a ways that work and to sustain it when needed,” Ben Kasstan-Dabush, an assistant professor and medical anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told me.“Recent plans for integrated care boards to slash their operational costs by as much as 50% will only place further obstacles to vaccine coverage recovery.”Seeing nurseries adopt infection control strategies in recent days therefore feels at once entirely sensible and a dodgysticking plaster. Since the 1980s, we have known a quick injection is the real solution to the scourge of measles. We also know the way to achieve it: a public health campaign for immunisation; vaccinations in the community (as recommended in the government’s recent 10-year plan for NHS England); and a culture of collective responsibility to protect one another.That last one is something we are not supposed to say out loud, lest we intrude on individual liberties. But it is nonetheless a vital piece of any conversation about vaccines. Herd immunity, after all, is at its heart an acknowledgment that “personal choice” about vaccination has consequences–sometimes deadly–for the rest of society.Childrenwith suppressed immune systems, for example, can still fall seriously ill with measles even if they have had the MMR jab. They rely on everyone else doing the right thing and helping them keep safe. Again, stop me if you’ve heard this one before.Perhaps the real lesson does not come from Covid but from the long fight against measles. Public health is not a single victory. One day there is joy in the invention, the next a backlash against it. The great irony of vaccines is that populations become complacent about a disease and the need for immunisation largely because a successful vaccine made it feel as though the threat was consigned to the past. As a nation, we still remember coronavirus patients gasping for air in the ICU. Let us hope it does not take more dead children for the public to be reminded of the danger of measles.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. She is the author ofWho Wants Normal?

Our bodies and ecosystems will pay the priceWed 23 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 09.20 EDTShareIt’s what the extreme right of the Tory party wanted from Brexit: to tear down crucial public protections, including those that defend us from the most brutal and dangerous forms of capital. The Conservatives lost office before they were able to do their worst. But never mind, because Labour has now picked up the baton.A month ago, so quietly that most of us missed it, thegovernment publisheda consultation on deregulating chemicals. While most consultations last for 12 weeks, this one runs for eight, half of which cover the holiday period – it closes on 18 August. The intention is set out at the beginning: to reduce “costs to business”. This, asrepeated statementsby Keir Starmermake clear, meanstearing upthe rules.If, the consultation proposes, a chemical has been approved by a “trusted foreign jurisdiction”, it should be approved for use in the UK. No list is given of what these trusted jurisdictions are. It will be up to ministers to decide: they can add such countries through statutory instruments, which means without full parliamentary scrutiny. In one paragraph the document provides what sounds like an assurance: these jurisdictions should have standards “similar to and at least as high as those in Great Britain”. Three paragraphs later, the assurance is whisked away: the government would be able “to use any evaluation available to it, which it considers reliable, from any foreign jurisdiction”.In this and other respects, the consultation document is opaque, contradictory, lacking clear safeguards and frankly chilling. Lobbyists will point out that a chemical product has been approved for sale in the US, or Thailand or Honduras, then ask the government to add that country as a trusted jurisdiction. If the government agrees, “domestic evaluation” would be “removed”, meaning that no UK investigation of the product’s health and environmental impacts will be required.In the US, to give one example, awide rangeofdangerous chemical productsareapproved for usesthat are banned here and in many other countries. The government has fired the gun on a race to the bottom.To make matters worse, once a country has been added to the list of trusted jurisdictions, all the biocidal products it authorises for use could, the consultation says, be “automatically approved” for use here. The proposed new rules, in other words, look like a realisation of thefantasy entertainedby the ultra-rightwing Tory MPJacob Rees-Mogg in 2016: “We could say, if it’s good enough in India, it’s good enough for here … We could take it a very long way.”There is in fact a means of reducing costs while maintaining high standards: simply mirror EU rules. Though far from perfect, they set the world’s highest standards for chemical regulation. Mirroring them as they evolve would avoid the pointless institutional replication andtotal regulatory meltdownour chemicals system has suffered since we left the EU. But we can’t have that, as it would mean backtracking on Brexit, which would be BETRAYAL. Adopting the weaker standards of other states at the behest of foreign corporations, by contrast, is the height of patriotism.The divergence from European standards is likely to meanbreaking the termsof the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement, as well as landing Northern Ireland in an even greater quandary, as itremains inboth the EU single market and the UK internal market. In many cases, deregulation delivers bureaucratic chaos.The consultation also suggests the removal of all expiry dates for the approval of active chemical substances. The default position would be that, as long as a foreign jurisdiction has approved a product, allowing it to be used in the UK, it stays on the books indefinitely. Those arguing that new evidence should lead to its deletion from the approved list would have a mountain to climb. Worse still, the consultation proposes removing any obligation on the Health and Safety Executive to maintain a publicly available database of the harmful properties of chemical substances on the UK market. No wonder they kept it quiet.Yes, these proposals might reduce costs for business. But the inevitable result is totransfer themto society. Already, we face a massive contamination crisis as a result of regulatory failure in this country, as compoundssuch as Pfas(“forever chemicals”),microplasticsandbiocidesspread into our lives. If the decontamination of land and water is possible, it will cost hundreds of times more than any profits made by industry as a result of lax rules. In reality, we willcarry these costsin our bodies and our ecosystems, indefinitely. The true price is incalculable.Many have paid with their lives, health, education or livelihoods for previous “bonfires of red tape”: through the Grenfell Tower disaster, filthy rivers,collapsing classrooms,consumer rip-offsand the 2008 financial crisis. But as long as these costs can be shifted off corporate and current government balance sheets, that is deemed a win for business and win for the Treasury.Earlier this month, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,told financiersin her Mansion House speech that regulation “acts as a boot on the neck of businesses”. In reality, business acts as a boot on the neck of democracy, a boot the government slathers with kisses.Before the general election last year,Reeves toldan assembly of corporate CEOs: “I hope when you read our manifesto, or see our priorities, that you see your fingerprints all over them.” The catastrophic planning reforms the government is nowforcing through parliamentwere hatched, she told them, at a “smoked salmon and scrambled eggs breakfast” with corporate lobbyists.This was just one instance of a massive pre-election grovelling offensive, involvinghundreds of meetingsbehind closed doors with corporations, which shaped Labour’s plans and explains so much of what has gone wrong since. The point and purpose of the Labour party was to resist economic warfare by the rich against the rest. Starmer and Reeves have turned their party into the opposite of what it once was.Capital demands three things at once: that the government strip away the rules defending the public interest from ruthless profit-making; that the government regulateitselfwith insanely restrictive pledges, such asReeves’s fiscal rules; and that the public is regulated with ever more draconian laws, such as thoserestricting protest. It gets what it asks for. Everything must give way to capital, but capital must give way to nothing.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests at the Guardian’s climate assembly, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

Soon, it won’t just be social media platforms asking to verify your age. Come December, age verification requirements will also extend to search engines – withsignificant ramifications.That means you may need to scan your face or do an identity check to use a search engine as a logged-in user. And it’s unlikely to stop there: the eSafety commissioner is considering rules for mandatory age checks across the entire internet landscape.Whether or not you support the idea of age-gating the internet, this is a huge, unprecedented change. These are not small decisions; they will impacteveryonewho uses the internet in Australia – not just people under 16. There are implications for privacy, digital inclusion, access to information and online participation that go beyond the controversialteen social media ban. All of this warrants meaningful public debate.If this is the first time you’re hearing about it, you’re not alone. Despite the significance of the changes, these latest rules are the result of industry codes, which differs to regular legislation. These codes don’t go through parliament. Instead, they’re developed by the tech industry and registered by the eSafety commissioner in a process called co-regulation. On one hand, this can be good: it can allow for more flexibility or technology-specific detail that is less appropriate in legislation. On the other: it creates risk of industry co-option, and by bypassing parliamentary process, can give an enormous amount of power to an unelected official (in this case, the eSafety commissioner).Face age and ID checks? Using the internet in Australia is about to fundamentally changeRead moreGreens senator David Shoebridge hascalled the implicationsof age verification for search engines “staggering” and noted that “these proposals don’t have to go through an elected parliament and we can’t vote them down no matter how significant concerns are. That combined with lack of public input is a serious issue.”The age verification policy development process has been littered with blunders that make amockery of meaningful consultation and evidence-based policy development. It is particularly striking that these codes were draftedbeforethe completion of the government’s $6.5m trial into the efficacy of age assurance. Later, the trial’s preliminary findings conceded thetechnology is not guaranteed to be effective, and noted “concerning evidence” that some technology providers were seeking to collect too much personal information.While agovernment-commissioned surveyon the teen social media ban found overwhelming support in theory, italso found most people have no idea what that means in practice, with many uncomfortable with the methods it might entail – such as biometric face scanning or handing over your credit card details. And while there was much fanfare around the social media ban, it’s not clear there is a social licence to extend this approach to search engines and beyond. It seems many people may be unpleasantly surprised.Importantly, it’s not just about verifying age, but what happens after that. Assuming a person’s age is accurately verified (this is not a given –research showsit’s fraught with problems), then comes the challenge of identifying and filtering out content. The intention is to limit young people’s access to pornography, high-impact violence and other inappropriate but not illegal material. It may seem like a simple task – you probably have your own gut sense of what should be filtered out. But automating content moderation at scale is anotoriously complex taskboth technologically (how do you avoid accidentally capturing too much or too little?) and politically (who gets to decide what is or is not appropriate?).Some digital media scholars have called the idea of using tech to restrict online content by age “problematic”. In particular, they highlight how automated content moderationoften incorrectly restricts sex education, sexual health information, harm reduction and health promotion. This also challenges digital inclusion. For some, digital identification can be a major barrier to online participation. Digital rights advocate and technologist Kathryn Gledhill-Tucker highlights that search engines are not an “optional luxury” but have “become basic services in a digital world”. Taken together, there are serious questions about the impact these codes will have on people’s right to access information – questions that ideally would be addressed through public scrutiny.None of this is to say the Australian government should do nothing. Nor is it to defend the behaviour of tech giants. Governments can and should intervene to challenge their power and force them to clean up the swamp of online harms.But age verification isn’t the only option on the table. Academics, advocates and digital policy experts have suggested a range of other approaches to enhance online safety. Gledhill-Tucker notes a “profound disregard for human rights advocates, who have called for meaningful legislation to temper the power of large technology companies for years”. For example, Australia could move away from the current “content-first” approach, which becomes a game of whack-a-mole of removal and restriction, towards a “systems-first” paradigm, which prioritises challenging the underlying business models to create systemic change.Australians are going to have differing opinions about how best to minimise harms on the internet, but we should at least all have the opportunity to participate in meaningful public debate about such significant changes to our online lives. In this case, it seems the horse has already bolted.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights advocate and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsAustralia newsOpinionSocial mediaPrivacyDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Yet his Hamlet revamp electrified Broadway and scooped up Tony nominations. As Fat Ham hits the UK, he talks violence, vengeance, strongmen and joyArifa AkbarWed 23 Jul 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 13.01 EDTShareWhen he was still in his 20s and studying for a master’s degree in acting, James Ijames was advised to take a swerve away from all things Shakespearean. His tutors thought his southern accent, the product of an upbringing in North Carolina, was not conducive to declaiming Elizabethan verse. Believing them, he did just one professional Shakespeare production in 10 full years of treading the boards.Now Ijames is righting that old wrong, although he does not see it quite that way. Fat Ham, his latest drama, is based onHamletand features a queer protagonist called Juicy, who is commanded by the ghost of his murdered father to avenge his death. Significantly, Juicy hails from a Black American family in North Carolina. “The thing I kept hearing over and over,” he says, “was that my regionalism – the slowness of my southern accent – would make it difficult for me to do Shakespeare. Ididavoid it for those reasons. That’s a little bit of what’s in this. I wanted to take this thing I was told I couldn’t access and see if I could make it work for me.”My family didn’t say: ‘You’re gay, get out, you’re the worst.’ They just said: ‘Don’t get in trouble’It worked all right. Fat Ham was feted on Broadway, winning a Pulitzer prize and amassing five Tony award nominations. Next month, the play is coming to theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin Stratford-Upon-Avon for its European premiere.Ijames, a playwright with more than 15 dramas under his belt, conceived the idea eight years ago, as he gravitated back to Shakespeare.An easy-going presence with a calm, donnish air, Ijames now makes a robust case for his right to Shakespeare. “I was raised in a Black Southern Baptist church that reads the St James Bible every Sunday,” he says, speaking via Zoom. “So I grew up reading Elizabethan English. Yet I was told the way I spoke would prevent me from being able to do that, when I had seen people speak this language with ease and eloquence my whole life. It just rocked my world, at a later age, to realise it belonged to me. So it was a real revelation working on this play.”View image in fullscreenNo soliloquies … the Broadway production.Photograph: Joan marcus/Joan MarcusIjames has not only embraced Shakespeare but played fast and loose with this most definitive of his tragedies. There are new names, rearranged storylines, with most of the big soliloquies written out. “I can’t compete with those,” he explains. “I can’t be in the room with ‘To be or not to be’. That existential crisis won’t look that way in my characters.”It’s a bold move, not least because of an unconventional programme in the Oregon Shakespeare festival not so long ago, with plays including references to slavery and non-binary actors cast in various roles. Nataki Garrett, the festival’s artistic director, received death threats. “I remember that happening,” says Ijames, “and thinking, ‘This is insane.’” Yet, he points out, Shakespeare hardly wrote from scratch: he took huge liberties with his source material, recycling older stories, borrowing from history. The “almost scriptural quality” some attach to his texts is not something Shakespeare would have endorsed, Ijames believes. “He was trying to evoke the audience’s imagination because he knew that’s where the play actually exists.”View image in fullscreen‘This play was a revelation’ …James Ijames.Photograph: Marc J FranklinActing, for Ijames, was a circuitous way into writing. In 2001, he says, “they weren’t really taking young people into playwriting programmes. So I went to grad school for acting. But I wrote the entirety of my career, in dressing rooms, wherever, until I’d built up enough work.”Learning about writing through acting sounds rather Shakespearean, I suggest. “Yes,” says Ijames. “I don’t pretend to be as earth-shattering a writer as he was, but his curiosities are very similar to mine.” Evidently so: Fat Ham is warmer and more comic than Hamlet – but at its core, it is a story about fathers, sons and the cycle of violence triggered by the drive for vengeance. Except that Fat Ham’s antihero struggles against the violent masculinity his father represents. “It’s perennial for me as a writer to ask, ‘What does masculinity mean?’ ‘What does the performance of masculinity do?’”One reason he is so defined by this theme, he explains, is because he shares a name with his father. “I’m a ‘junior’ – so there’s a kind of ownership, an expectation of legacy, that I’ve lived with my whole life. As an artist, I’m preoccupied with disrupting: this notion of how a man is supposed to act at any given moment.” He wants to explore what lies beneath the ideal of masculinity that young people are fed – an ideal that requires them to stifle many components of their emotional being. “It takes time,” says Ijames, “to bring that stuff back to life.”Alongside Juicy in Fat Ham, there is Larry (based on Laertes) who feels a closeted queer passion for Juicy. Shame and homophobia shape their trajectories. “Many times,” says Ijames, “homophobia is about not wanting to face parts of yourself. I’m not one of those folks who say you’re homophobic because you’re actually gay – but I do think you are homophobic because you think that if you get too close to a man’s body, thenyourbody might betray you.”I remember thinking that I should be elegant because one of my uncles was very elegantIjames grew up in a large family, in the small town of Bessemer City. His father worked in truck manufacturing (“He’s retired military – that type”) while his mother taught elementary school (“She wanted us to be surrounded by art”). What was it like growing up queer in this household, in this corner of the south? “I wasn’t in a family that was like, ‘Oh, you’re gay, get out of here, you’re the worst.’ They said, ‘Just don’t get in trouble.’” And the masculinity in his family contained a “softness”, something he puts down to it being mostly comprised of women. “They were such engines of the family that it changed us. I remember thinking I should be elegant because one of my uncles was very elegant.”What about the greater forces around him, such as the Baptist church? He tells an instructive story about a late family member called Thomas Calvin, who was a theologian. As Ijames’s uncle, he believed a Christian had a simple duty: to make the world a better place. “And that is my framework for Christianity.” Although Ijames has witnessed – and experienced – intense homophobia in churches, he still takes moral direction from the “social justice aspect of the teachings of Jesus”.Fat Ham review – Pulitzer-winning Hamlet revision hits BroadwayRead moreGiven the changes that have swept America under Donald Trump, it is hard to escape “strongman” notions of masculinity. Has it ever felt more toxic, more in crisis? “Well,” says Ijames, “that’s a thing a play can’t fix.” He adds, in his even way, that masculinity is hardly one single thing. “It’s a constellation of stuff. I don’t feel safer with these strongmen, so what is the strength we’re talking about? I don’t feel more protected. I don’t feel like we’re somehow more powerful. I just feel like anxious people – and I’m an anxious person – are being anxious with each other.”All those alternative versions of manhood are there in Fat Ham, rubbing alongside darker elements. But there is playfulness and exuberance, too. Its characters do not seem as villainous as Shakespeare’s and the ending might even be described as happy. Is Ijames deliberately creating a state that is good out of Shakespeare’s rotten one? “I was very much doing that. I was curious about what happens if we spend time figuring out what paradise looks like. What if everyone didn’t die at the end? What if everyone had a place to live, enough to eat. These are questions about civilisation.”There is violence in Fat Ham and it seems implicitly bound to race and US history, but Ijames does not get into cycles of inherited violence within some Black communities. Instead, he goes down another route. “I don’t write that because I don’t know how to be inside that. Joy is a thing I know in excess. It’s one of the tricks of being an actor: you understand what offers pleasure to the audience because you have to do it with your whole body. I think marginalised people in general, and Black Americans in particular, are miraculous. I think we should party once in a while.”Fat Ham is at theSwan theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon, from 15 August until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHamletBlack US cultureRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In those days, his desolate wail had reach and range, and a deep melancholy. That tone was perfect for the subject of this bleak and blasted reflection on cocaine (Vol 4 was dedicated to “the great COKE-Cola company of Los Angeles”). Osbourne sounds like a man who has been wiped clean, both terrified of and in thrall to the drug: “The sun no longer sets me free / I feel the snowflakes freezing me.” At a time when cocaine was still considered a party drug, the fervour in Osbourne’s voice as he celebrates enslavement to it is deeply unsettling – it’s every bit as amoral and devout in its drug worship as Lou Reed’s Heroin.Black Sabbath – Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973)It’s pointless trying to extricate the sound of Osbourne himself from Sabbath as a band: at their peak, they were a single being with four heads, but a single musical will – they were perhaps the first truly monolithic-sounding band. So, inevitably, the better the band sound, the better Ozzy sounds. And, dear God, did the four of them ever combine better than on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, especially in the “dreams turn to nightmares” section, where Osbourne is singing at the absolute top of his range, while Tony Iommi goes to the very bottom of his to play a riff that even 52 years later sounds as though it has been dredged from some primordial sludge, rather than played on a guitar. And on the acoustic passages, Ozzy makes the perfect transition from rage to gentleness. Blinding stuff all round.Black Sabbath – Hole in the Sky (1975)Black Sabbath: Hole in the Sky – videoSabotage was probably the best Sabbath album, both profoundly heavy and strange and experimental. Hole in the Sky, though, was Sabbath at their most traditional and basic: a huge rolling boogie, powered by Bill Ward’s swinging drums, and topped by Iommi’s brutal riff. Near the top of his register, Osbourne – as on Snowblind – sounds possessed by an ecstatic emptiness, like a cult leader. Or, more accurately, a cult follower: he sounds delighted as he sings: “I’m looking through a hole in the sky / I’m seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie.” The contrast between Osbourne’s shriek and Iommi’s roil was a key component of the Sabbath sound – when Iommi was not soloing, his voice was often the only treble in the mix. Though you’re never going to Osbourne looking for vocal pyrotechnics, he had a vital role in the musicality of Black Sabbath. Listen to any doom band with a growling vocalist to hear the difference his voice makes.Black Sabbath – Symptom of the Universe (1975)One of the greatest of all heavy metal tracks – you can hear lightbulbs going off in the minds of a generation young musicians as it plays – has a reputation that rests largely on its riff, and its heaviness, but Osbourne brings it to life. Here, he is vicious, bordering on unhinged, his cries of “yeah” stretching out and getting ragged as his voice fades. Symptom of the Universe depends on its power for Osbourne’s commitment, because Geezer Butler’s lyric is – to be honest – a bit of a dog’s dinner. Osbourne makes it sound credible through sheer force of will. And in the outro – all acoustic guitars and shakers, and Latin rhythms – the desperation turns to grit, and Ozzy is suddenly a kind of soul singer. Told you this was a strange record.Black Sabbath – The Writ (1975)When it opens with that bubbling bassline, you might think you’re listening to an unheard Cure song. Then the guitars and vocals come in. But where The Writ goes is entirely unexpected. Over the course of nine minutes it manages to encompass not just proto-goth, but Zep-esque storming, with bluesy flourishes from Iommi: anthemic arena rock, grinding and faintly psychedelic passages that preface a large amount of US noise rock a decade later and harpsichord ballad sections. And wherever you throw him, Ozzy sounds completely at home. Sometimes his voice was a monotone, but that meant small gradations and changes in tone really registered. The measure of how central he was to the Sabbath sound was that the band had to overhaul it to incorporate his successor,Ronnie James Dio.Ozzy Osbourne – Crazy Train (1981)Banished from Sabbath, seemingly out of control and hardly likely to top anyone’s list of reliable people to ask for a household favour, Ozzy needed to begin his solo career with a bang, and find a way to be something other than Sabbath Part 2, but not as good. He found it in a young, blond California guitarist named Randy Rhoads, who had been playing around Los Angeles with Quiet Riot. Rhoads, who died in 1982, helped reinvent Ozzy – something his employer has always acknowledged. His tone was bright and shiny, a polar opposite to Iommi, and he played with flash and flair – this was the sound of rock guitar to come, and a clean break for Osbourne. For their first single together, Rhoads brought a killer riff, and Bob Daisley gave Ozzy a perfectly self-aware lyric to acknowledge his public perception: “I’m going off the rails on a crazy train.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

You don’t release a single about Britain’smost famous satanistif you want to let people know you’ve changed from your old, evil ways. The version on the album was clunky, which was perhaps why a live cut was selected for the single. Ozzy is fine, but no one is really pretending the hero of this recording is anyone other than Rhoads. After Don Airey’s portentous keyboard intro, it is Rhoads who provides the crashing riff – just evil enough, but no Sabbath parody – and he who provides the two guitar solos that helped cement his international reputation. Rhoads shredded, but played with melody – he didn’t just cram notes in, but made them do things other hard rock guitarists were not contemplating.Ozzy Osbourne – Diary of a Madman (1981)Arguably the standout moment of Rhoads’ career, it’s also a song that illustrates that long before experimental metal was a thing, the genre was far from being unimaginative. Diary of a Madman – and yes, the title is once again on the nose – was an extraordinary song of shifting moods, and Osbourne singing a lyric that is not in the least cartoonish but a darkly empathetic account of mental illness, of someone utterly trapped in their own despair. A technically better singer might have been tempted to overemote, but Ozzy keeps the mood, allowing the music – by the end there’s an operatic choir – to provide the drama, while he offers the feeling.Ozzy Osbourne, the people’s Prince of Darkness, took heavy metal into the lightRead moreOzzy Osbourne – Mr Tinkertrain (1991)Ozzy achieved huge commercial success through the 80s without touching the heights of the two albums with Rhoads. There were high points, but there was a fair amount of hair-metal awfulness, too. Ozzy himself long described 1986’s The Ultimate Sin as the worst record of his career, no matter it going double-platinum in the US. No More Tears, though, was the toughest and best album in a decade, guitarist Zakk Wylde and producers Duane Baron and John Purdell giving him a completely sympathetic backing. The album opener reconfigured Osbourne in villainy and horror, but of a much darker and less fantastical hue than in the devilish days: Mr Tinkertrain is written from the perspective of a predatory paedophile, a creepy lyric with a perfectly judged backing, that manages not to overstep the mark from horror into prurience.Ozzy Osbourne – No More Tears (1991)The seven-minute title track of No More Tears was commercial metal par excellence: epic and grand and stirring without becoming overbearing. And, because it was Ozzy, this one was sung from the perspective of a serial killer. This was another case of a band performance bringing out the best in Ozzy: he sounded stronger than he had in years, actually weird and dangerous rather than acting out a pantomime of weirdness and danger. His singing behind the beat in the pre-chorus, dragging out the syllables, is genuinely creepy. Even in the year of Nirvana’s Nevermind, an on-form Ozzy was still a metallic force to be reckoned with: No More Tears ended up going quadruple-platinum, his second most successful after his first solo record. It deserved its success; it was also his best record since that debut.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneMetalBlack SabbathPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when I arrived, the markings had vanished. Faced with this absence, I found myself seeking a new story, something unplanned.Mustapha was my guide that day. At first, he took me along the typical tourist trails, which didn’t speak to my photographic interests. Then he suggested we explore the sand dunes. Initially, I wasn’t particularly interested in these either, but then we came across this old well. I set up my camera, a 1972 Hasselblad 500, and my tripod. As I started to photograph the well, Mustapha stepped forward, instinctively leaning in to look inside. I hadn’t imagined him in the picture but he didn’t pay attention to me. That spontaneous gesture – part ritual, part desperation – transformed the scene completely. It felt sacred, as though he were praying for the return of something essential: water.This unplanned moment encapsulates the core of my wider project, Before It’s Gone: the fragility of ecosystems, the human struggle for survival, the quiet persistence of memory in the face of environmental loss. I began the project in 2018, driven by my growing awareness of how dramatically oasis environments were changing in Morocco. I started noticing patterns: rising temperatures, shrinking water sources, abandoned palm groves and increasing rural exodus. What was once a source of life and resilience for entire communities was slowly being erased. I felt an urgent need to document this transformation – not just ecologically but socially and culturally.People are being forced to leave the only homes they’ve ever known, not because of war but because water is disappearingOver the years, the project has taken me to dozens of oases and expanded to include Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Mauritania. It has unfolded through travel, extended conversations and long-term engagement with the people who live in these spaces. What drives me is the conviction that these are not just local stories – they are global warnings. The climate crisis is often framed in abstract or future terms. Through this work, I want to make it visible, human and grounded in the present.Including the human figure was essential. Oases are not just geographic features: they are homes, livelihoods and cultural reservoirs shaped over centuries. In this photograph, Mustapha embodies that deep connection. His gesture of looking into the well is both literal and symbolic – it speaks to dependence, resilience and vulnerability, but also to hope and remembrance. This reflects my work, which explores the complex relationship between people and their environments. Whether I’m documenting oases’ decline, Moroccan youth, or the sociology of work and migration, I’m interested in how individuals navigate change.Water scarcity is no longer just an environmental issue. It’s a humanitarian crisis, especially in regions such as the Sahara, where life has always depended on fragile water sources. I hope images like this can serve as visual testimonies – simple, powerful reminders of what is at stake.Photography has taught me to slow down and pay attention to people, landscapes and silence. This shot is a portrait of loss but also of quiet resistance. Communities are being forced to leave the only homes they’ve ever known, not because of war but because the water is disappearing. I hope the image evokes empathy and awareness. I want viewers to connect emotionally – to see the climate emergency not as a distant headline, but to recognise the urgent need to protect natural resources and the cultures and communities that depend on them.This was a fleeting moment, entirely unplanned, yet it now speaks to so much. Seeing it enlarged today as a poster in underground stations across London, advertising theWellcome Trust exhibition Thirst, is humbling.

Rosamund Pike’s stage CV already has plenty of highs, fromHitchcock BlondetoHedda Gabler, but her performance in Miller’s follow-up play has been keenly anticipated, given that it reunites some of the team that made Prima Facie a smash hit.This is an almost deliberate counterpoint to Prima Facie, in which a defence lawyer, expert at playing the system to demolish rape charges against her clients, is undone by her own experience of sexual assault. Miller wanted to highlight how poorly the law serves victims, and Inter Alia presents the same issue from the flipside with a female judge, determined to make the system more just, whose world is upended by an accusation close to home.Jessica Parks (Pike) is the kind of multi-skilled woman you just know the legal system needs more of. She brings humanity and compassion to her courtroom, employing her soft skills to protect vulnerable witnesses while cutting down cocky male counsel with a tone that can “cut through tendons and bone”. But she’s not just a crown court judge, she’s also an expert juggler, in the way that high-achieving women so often need to be. Her career exists “inter alia” – as Miller puts it, in the cracks of everyone else’s lives.View image in fullscreenHumanity and compassion … Jasper Talbot, Jamie Glover and Rosamund Pike in Inter Alia, designed by Miriam Buether.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAll the hallmarks ofJustin Martin’s pulsating direction are here, from the onstage guitar and drums ratcheting up the tension to Pike’s physical, occasionally anarchic performance. She is in constant motion, wearing many different outfits – karaoke queen, sexy wife, Marigold-clad dishwasher and laundrywoman – and Miriam Buether’s set combines with Natasha Chivers’ lighting to capture the dissolution of boundaries between the courtroom and home.“You live like you work, everything done at speed,” a friend tells Jessica: it may sound like a badge of honour, but it’s also an indictment of the society that requires it of her. The term “emotional labour” is never used but is certainly present: while Jessica prepares a dinner party for 16, her husband Michael’s only responsibility is the cheese. He has it delivered.This is not a solo show: Jamie Glover provides the marital tension as Michael, who has been beaten by his wife to both KC and the bench. Harry, their 18-year-old son, mooches about almost silently, alternating, in Jasper Talbot’s portrayal, between sensitive, sulky and comically drunk. But what begin as peripheral figures – to be organised, loved and cared for – are given vital voices of their own as the narrative progresses.View image in fullscreenSensitive and sulky … Jasper Talbot with Rosamund Pike in Inter Alia.Photograph: Manuel HarlanJessica remains the moral and emotional centre: her tragedy unfolds like that of an Ibsen protagonist failed by those around them. As a mother she has done the best she can, both to shield her child from bullies and to raise him true to her feminist beliefs (there’s a very funny scene where they have the porn talk). But she can’t protect him from social media, or peer pressure or, in the end, himself.As a lawyer turned playwright, Miller’s work has an ingrained advocacy – for years, she has used it to argue for social and legal justice. And one of the rare objections to Prima Facie’s script – the way its didactic dialogue impinged on the drama – could be upheld here. Determined to give every issue and angle a fair hearing, Inter Alia sheds its nimbleness and wit as it grapples with the serious stuff in its later stages, meaning the pace slows even as the confrontations become more heightened.As the set darkens and Jessica becomes literally lost in the woods, there’s a sense that we’re all groping, a little blindly, towards an ending, even Pike. But the production remains a searing commentary on the justice system and a purposefully uncomfortable insight into contemporary parenting. Prima Facie remains as relevant as it was three years ago – a UK tour, with a returning Comer, has beenannounced for 2026– and this is an ideal companion piece.At theLyttelton theatre, National Theatre, London, until 13 September.In cinemasfrom 4 September.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreRosamund PikeMiriam BuetherreviewsShareReuse this content"

The band explain how a studio jape has united IrelandKillian Faith-KellyWed 23 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 12.52 EDTShare‘Welcome to the best thing we’ve ever written,” jokes Kingfishr lead singer Eddie Keogh, in a video recorded in a studio in October 2024, before he knew just how right he was. Keogh, flanked by bandmates Eoin “Fitz” Fitzgibbon on guitar and Eoghan “McGoo” McGrath on banjo, reads from his phone as he lends his chesty baritone to the just-written chorus of Killeagh: “They’d go rarin’ and tearin’ and fightin’ for love / For the land they call Killeagh, and the Lord up above / Kill-la la, la la la la la la la la la / For the green and the white I adore / For the parish to last ever more.”It has since spent 18 weeks in the Irish Top 10, gone four-times platinum, and become the first traditional, folk-leaning song to see this level of success since The Fields of Athenry was a hit for numerous artists in the early 80s. But the trio wrote Killeagh in 20 minutes: “It literally could not have been more of a slapped-together job,” says Keogh.Last summer, Fitz was back home in his east Cork village, having a drink with his friend and former hurling coach Phillip “Yank” O’Neill (so-named “because he tried to go to America once”, Fitz explains). All the other teams round here, said Yank, have a song to sing in the changing rooms when they win. We don’t. You’re in a band. Write a song for Killeagh.Fitz says playing hurling for Killeagh GAA club for 20 years was “the biggest thing in my life, the only thing really” before the band took off in Ireland: they broke through in 2022 with their poppy singles Eyes Don’t Lie and Flowers-Fire. His aunt Mary is the club’s secretary, his uncle Moss played for them, his grandfather Tom was their president and also a player. The junior team features Fitz’s brother Cathal, and is coached by their father Ger.Fitz said he would write a song if the juniors got to an east Cork final in 2024. In his head, “it was not going to happen. Killeagh haven’t been in the final since 2001, there’s no way they’ll get to a final this year. And lo and behold, October arrives and they get to the final, and Yank texts me almost immediately.”Kingfishr were recording their debut album at the time, which is now titled Halcyon and set for release in August. The band, who started making music together as a way to pass the time during lockdown-afflicted degrees at the University of Limerick, were in a decent place – they had supported Bruce Springsteen and Dermot Kennedy, and were booked to play a few 5,000-capacity venues in Ireland over the summer. But what was about to happen in that studio would lead, Keogh says, to “conversations about next year’s venues that are hard to make sense of in your brain”.While McGoo was laying down some moody banjo stuff for the album, Fitz and Keogh turned to their hurling song. “We just ran off for 15, 20 minutes,” Fitz says, “and I started rattling it out.” They wrote about local spots the River Dissour and Glenbower Wood. “Thinking nothing of it because it was all a bit of a joke. Then we showed it to McGoo, who said: ‘What if instead oflala la, it’sKill’la la?’ And sure, the three of us were screaming and shouting: this is the greatest thing ever!”The song is a heart-on-sleeve tribute to the sport of hurling and the focal point it provides for the people of Killeagh – and, by inference, communities like it all over Ireland. The first time it reached a crowd, it wasn’t sung by the band, but the Killeagh junior hurlers, who went on to win their final. A few days later, despite some reluctance from Fitz – who viewed the song as “a pisstake” and says it took him “a long time to come round to the idea that it was about more than just my hurling team and the river that flows through my village” – the band recorded it, and it was released in December as a B-side on their single Bet on Beauty.View image in fullscreen‘I thought: Oh Jesus Christ, this could be massive’ … Kingfishr.Photograph: PRNo dials were moved until St Patrick’s Day, when for some reason – perhaps its visceral Irishness, perhaps its mention of green and white – the song began to feature in a series of “get ready with me” videos posted on TikTok, primarily by teenage girls. “I remember saying to someone that we’d get a great weekend out of it, but once Paddy’s Day is over, it’s dust,” says Keogh. “And he said: ‘You haven’t thought about this – the hurling’s about to start,’ and the penny dropped. I thought: Oh Jesus Christ, this could be massive.”The song was written for the people of Killeagh, and has permanently connected the band to the town – their sponsorship of Killeagh’s new under-10s jerseys is testament to that. But it was adopted across the entire county of Cork as it became an anthem for an inter-county season in which the Cork team won the National Hurling League, the Munster Hurling Championship (their regional knock-out competition), and were – according to the bookmakers, their fans, and every expert going – supposed to win the biggest prize of them all, the All-Ireland.Alas, they capitulated in the second half of the final last Sunday and let a six-point lead become a 15-point loss to Tipperary. But on their way there, the song expanded its zone of endearment from Killeagh, to Cork, to everyone in Ireland who’d ever been involved with a GAA club, to seemingly just about everyone in Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Beyond the timing and TikTok virality, Killeagh has a certain musical familiarity: it employs phrasings typical of Irish traditional music, with a verse’s second line ending on a minor note before resolving itself on a major one, for example. There’s the enormously singable chorus – “any eejit can sing la la la la,” points out Joyce – and its evocation of an aspect of Irish life, the community-anchoring GAA club, that so many people either participate in or feel nostalgia for.‘Music is our way of coping with life’: the Mary Wallopers on bringing booze, sex and politics back to folkRead moreJoyce says that although she initially thought the song “a bit stereotypical”, she’s found herself singing it around the house and would “bet my bottom dollar that it’ll be sung at [folk] singing sessions around the country.” Ní Ghallóglaigh’s first words are “what agreatsong!”, and thinks Killeagh is “a modern addition to the Irish folk canon. 100%”. Joyce agrees.When I tell the band this, they’re gobsmacked. Keogh says he always thought of Ireland’s canon of folk ballads as a fixed entity, not something anyone could hope to add to. I ask him if adding to it is, more than streams or venue bookings or TikTok fame, the ultimate success for Kingfishr.“For me, personally,” he says, “success is being in the middle of a crowd of people and singing it with everyone, grabbing on to the lads next to you and looking at the people around you and thinking: you’llalwaysremember this. I think that’s what sportis, and what music is. People are absolutely crying out for that: being part of something bigger than yourself. Being part of a fucking team.”Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could video games be the ultimate relationship tool?Keith StuartWed 23 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 10.03 EDTShareLast week, Radio 4’sWoman’s Hourtalked about the role of women in the video games industry. It featured interviews with gaming insiders, from esports presenterFrankie Wardto members of the inclusive online communityBlack Girl Gamers. It was wonderful to hear so many disparate, expert views on games culture being given so much time on the show.One of my favourite moments was when presenter Nuala McGovern read out some listener responses to the question: why do you play video games? “I don’t think there’s enough recognition of gaming as an activity for couples,” one replied. “My husband and I bonded over our shared love of gaming. Our honeymoon was playing Borderlands 2 while we saved for a flat deposit, and now, with a young child, we explore stories, we visit new worlds, we solve mysteries … There is an underappreciated romance to gaming – we communicate, encourage, collaborate and celebrate together. It’s a joy.”I found this very moving because I know many friends who met their partners through playing games, and who see the act of gaming together as a much more textured and immersive experience than wallowing in front of a TV series. I’ve lost count of the number of couples who’ve told me they especially enjoyed playing survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill together – even though they are strictly single-player experiences. Sharing scary games is a way of lessening the terror while exploring an abandoned orphanage or science lab. It introduces an element of physicality – as does taking it in turns to use the joypad, swapping it from hand to hand, like an intimate gift.View image in fullscreenAn elaborate dating site … Final Fantasy XIV.Playing a video game with someone you’re falling in love with, meanwhile, gives you a new perspective on who they are and what they can do. It’s helpful to know your partner is brilliant at solving spatial puzzles, or that they’re determined and resourceful when faced with tricky tasks. If nothing else, it’s a hint at exactly how it’s going to go when you end up assembling an Ikea bookshelf together. Recently, I wrote aboutthe use of video games in child therapy, and one of the counsellors I spoke to, Ellie Finch, is looking at doing couples therapy in Minecraft because it’s often a space where all the people in the relationship feel comfortable. I suspect that challenging clients to build a simple house together will tell her more about their interpersonal dynamic than two hours of talking.There is a lot of romance in experiencing new places together, getting lost and combining skills to help each other out of calamities. There is sweetness in a shared Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing escapade; there is intellectual challenge in quiet evenings with Blue Prince or Split Fiction. For too long, gaming was seen as the preserve of lonely young men, a hobby too guarded and insular for lovers; now everyone can play and the digital world is opening up. Lots of people are now effectively using online games such as Final Fantasy XIV and GTA Online as highly elaborate dating sites, sometimesmeeting and forming relationships in real life. Games remove many barriers – the expense of going out, the vulnerability of meeting strangers – they are test spaces for the romance-curious.I hope that as this generation of gamers age, they will keep playing together. I hope they show their grandchildren the levels they designed in Super Mario Maker, or the beautiful apartment they constructed in The Sims – the digital photo albums of entire lifetimes together.Gameshave so much to tell us about each other, if we are open to play and being playful.What to playView image in fullscreenTiny fun … Neogeo Super Pocket.Photograph: Blaze EntertainmentLast year I reviewed the Super Pocket from Blaze Entertainment, a funky little handheld capable of playing a range of cartridge-based retro games.

It comes loaded with 14 Neogeo titles and it’s a really intriguing selection, from bona fide classics such as side-scroller Metal Slug X and formative fighting game Fatal Fury. There are lesser known gems, too, including luscious beat-’em-ups Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy and Mutation Nation.

His assertion was that developers were no longer inventing new mechanics and were focusing on existing design techniques as well as the look and feel of games. It’s a provocative assertion, perhaps gaming’s equivalent of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man – but I hope he’s wrong.Valve has been removingadult gamesfrom Steam, reportedly as a result ofpressure from credit card companies. An Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout has claimed responsibility – the organisation recently published an open letter to payment processors such as PayPal and Mastercard claiming that games available on the digital store featured child abuse and incest. Vice has gatheredreactions from Steam customers.Somehow, I’m not surprised by the discovery thatNintendo employeesrarely leave the company. Games site GoNintendo hasshared some employment data from the companyshowing that staff in Japan stay with the company for 14.4 years on average, with people at offices elsewhere staying between eight and a half and 10 years.

But the play has found fresh relevance todayFraser GraceWed 23 Jul 2025 05.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 23 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareIam standing outside the hallowed walls of the Market theatre, Newtown, Johannesburg. This is the place where Athol Fugard – surely the greatest of South African playwrights and one of my all-time theatre heroes – staged plays including Hello and Goodbye and The Island. The latter was co-written with fellow theatre greats, actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona. Now it’s the turn of a little-known English writerand his playBreakfast With Mugabe. This is, as they say, one of the days of my life.In 2001 my script felt like urgent work. Elections loomed in Zimbabwe, andRobert Mugabewas reportedly unleashing terrible violence in his bid to cling to power. To many in the UK “President Bob” had long been a monster. But what, I wondered, created the monster?The play finds Mugabe holed-up in State House, pursued by the bitter spirit of a long-dead comrade. Denied help by traditional healers, the former liberation leader reluctantly turns to a white psychiatrist. Cue the unravelling of history.View image in fullscreenColonial culpability … the Market theatre in Johannesburg.Photograph: Fraser GraceInterest in Breakfast With Mugabe was immediate, and persistent. The late (and much missed) Antony Sher directed a Royal Shakespeare Company production that travelled from Stratford in 2005 via Soho theatre to the West End in 2006. An audio version flourished on BBC Radio 3 and the World Service; a second UK production followed, while in the US a production by Two Planks & A Passion (directed by David Shookhoff) clocked up 100 performances on New York’s 42nd Street. Another production was staged in Berkeley.Since then, Mugabe has died and Zimbabwe bumps along in comparative peace. So a new production – especially inSouth Africa– came as a surprise.According to Greg Homann, the idea blossomed slowly. In 2022, Greg – whose theatre work spans the US, UK and SouthAfrica– was associate artist at the Midlands Arts Centre in Birmingham. Then his “dream job” became a reality. Returning to South Africa as artistic director of the Market theatre, one of the first artists he encountered was a young director fast building a reputation as an innovative theatre-maker. Calvin Ratladi had, sometime in 2016, chanced on a copy of Breakfast With Mugabe. The play stuck with him; would the Market produce it?Sadly, that plan stalled. Then, earlier this year, Ratladi was named Standard Bank’s young artist of the year for theatre. This award is quite a gong (its first winner was Richard E Grant). It brings with it support for a creative project – and an opportunity was glimpsed. If Ratladi still held a torch for his Mugabe project, the Market theatre would host. Remarkably, he was as keen as ever. A theatre polymath and renowned disability activist, for him this four-handed, pressure-cooker play of psychology and spirituality presented exciting new challenges.If this partly answers the “why here, why now?” question, why do Ratladi and Homann think the play resonates in the new South Africa?For Homann, the play typifies the Market’s longstanding commitment to “an entwining of politics and theatre” – a tradition vital to the theatre’s co-founders Barney Simon and Mannie Manim, and to one of the many playwrights they championed,Athol Fugard, who sadly died in March. Recent shows at the Market have examined the life and legacy of other significant South African figures, among them Winnie Mandela and Robert Sobukwe. As Ratladi points out, Breakfast With Mugabe extends this tradition; a play about a hero of the liberation movement – this time from outside South Africa, and one whose legacy is hotly contested.View image in fullscreenPressure-cooker play … (from left) Farai Chigudu. Craig Jackson, Gontse Ntshegang and Themba Ndaba in Breakfast With Mugabe at the Market theatre.Photograph: Ngoma KaMphahleleThis is especially true among Zimbabweans, an estimated one to three million of whom now live in South Africa. Hearings into theGukurahundiin Matabeleland in the mid 1980s have only just begun in earnest. In that massacre, Mugabe ordered his army’s North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade to suppress his party’s opponents. An estimated 20,000 Zimbabweans were murdered.At the production’s first night in Johannesburg, it was clear the play retains its bite. Themba Ndaba and Craig Jackson lock the president and his shrink in a terrible struggle for supremacy; Gontse Ntshegang shines as the manipulative Grace Mugabe, drawing howls of laughter for her indiscretions as “the First Shopper”, while Zimbabwean-born Farai Chigudu exudes menace – and barely controlled violence – as the bodyguard/secret policeman, Gabriel.With the first three performances sold out, audiences (as audiences will in South Africa) whooped, gasped and sighed at every zinger or put-down – verbal or physical – delivered by the cast.I’ve been lucky. The play has almost always been well received by audiences as well as critics. In the US however, what I believed was a play about colonial culpability was celebrated as an essay on interracial conflict, pure and simple. Do Americans struggle to see their country implicated as a colonial power?In South Africa by contrast, it’s the impact of colonial oppression that deafens. Post-liberation rewards – the justice so long awaited by black South Africans – never materialised for many. How the country’s current government can ever deliver redress is a hot-button political issue for President Cyril Ramaphosa – and one critical to the future of South Africa’s 63 million inhabitants.And what does Ratladi’s unexpected, bracing new production offer the playwright? A lesson. Whatever we maythinkwe’ve written, a play can – simply by shifting its context in time and space – make us think and feel something new. It is after allplay– a living, unfolding, mutable thing. Like all true play, its punches do not always land where expected.Breakfast with Mugabeis at the Market theatre, Johannesburg, until 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRobert MugabeAthol FugardSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He arrived in the UK in 1945 to study woven textiles at Leeds University, before setting up his firm Colourcraft in 1952 in Galashiels, the Borders town then at the centre of the region’s thriving textiles industry.His abstract, colourful and often tactile designs won him clients including the fashion houses Balenciaga, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, as well as commissions from the furniture firms G Plan and Heal’s in London. He was also a colour consultant to the then Department of the Environment, an arm of the UK government.Dr Samuel Gallacher, the director of the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, which hopes to lead on the restoration of the building, said that attempting to buy it at auction was “a real unknown”. But doing so would be a significant achievement.“Thinking of Scotland’s rich heritage of 20th-century architecture, much of which is at risk and is poorly adapted to our changing climate, this project can be an exemplar of how to save our modernist and brutalist buildings,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHeritageScotlandArchitectureModernismnewsShareReuse this content"

In addition, he would snack on boiled eggs, almonds and cheese, in order to try to ingest enough protein to transform his body.“Going back to responsibility and resourcefulness and sustainability, it’s just like, ‘What am I doing? I could feed a family with the amount I’m eating,’” Cumberbatch said.“It’s a grossly wasteful industry,” he continued. “Think about set builds that aren’t recycled, think about transport, think about food, think about housing, but also light and energy. The amount of wattage you need to create daylight and consistent light in a studio environment. It’s a lot of energy.”Cumberbatch conceded that actors are frequently accused of hypocrisy when bemoaning the lack of sustainability in Hollywood, but said he does try to “push the green initiative” on sets, in his capacity as both actor and producer.He cited single-use plastic as an example, saying: “You don’t have to give the crew plastic bottles. If you’re in the middle of a desert and you can’t get glass bottles there, fair enough. But we’re in the 21st century.”Movies can emit on average between391 metric tonnes for a small film and up to 3,370 metric tonnes of CO2emissionsfor major blockbusters;the equivalentof powering 702 homes for a year.In 2021, the Producers Guild of America issuedan industry-wide call for a transition to clean energy. “Climate change is impacting our productions. Our health and safety, and filming locations are being irreparably damaged by increased pollution, wildfires, floods, storms, and droughts,” they wrote. “The sustainability measures currently being taken in our industry are sporadic and wholly inadequate to meet the current level of threat.”The Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, which killed 31 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures across the city, refocused attention on the film and TV industry’s engagement with efforts to curb its impact on the planet.View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness..Photograph: Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios./APAmongcelebrities whose homes were destroyed in the fireswere Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton and Eugene Levy, while many – including Meryl Streep and the late David Lynch –were forced to make emergency evacuations.Some studios have made pledges to try to reduce their carbon footprint. The Walt Disney Company aims to “purchase or produce 100% zero-carbon electricity” by 2030, according to its 2023 Sustainability and Social Impact report.Stars including Jane Fonda, Woody Harrelson and Julia Roberts have been outspoken champions of wider action on environmental issues, while Mark Rylance, Bill Nighy and Hayley Atwell were among those whosupported the introduction of a “green rider”to guarantee sustainability on set.Yet the enormous resources required to make most big budget films, as well as to promote and market them, mean Hollywood is an industry whose logistics and mindset are often at odds with prioritising the planet.Leonardo DiCaprio, Hollywood’s most high-profile advocate for ecological awareness, established his self-titled foundation in 1998 to help “restore balance to threatened ecosystems, ensuring the long-term health and wellbeing of all Earth’s inhabitants”.But despite donating money to further these aims, and becoming involved in a number of plant-based companies, such as Beyond Meat and chickpea snack company Hippeas, the actor has been criticised for his conspicuous jet-setting.Last month, DiCaprio was photographed apparently attempting to hide his face while attending themuch-criticisedwedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryBenedict CumberbatchClimate crisisFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily, it’s also highly watchableHannah J DaviesWed 23 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTShareEsi Edugyan’s 2018 novel Washington Black is an unorthodox, steampunk-infused account of the era when transatlantic slavery cast a dark shadow over much of the world. Its hero is George Washington Black – or Wash for short – a Black boy of 11, growing up on a Barbados plantation. He becomes the protege of a well-meaning white scientist, Titch (who happens to be the brother of Wash’s merciless master, Erasmus). Together they work on crafting the “Cloud Cutter”, an experimental airship that offers them an escape from the plantation when Wash is accused of murder – but which crashes over the Atlantic during a storm. Spoiler alert: the pair make it out of that episode alive, with Wash fleeing to Virginia, and later Canada.A Guardian review described scenes from the novel as “[unfolding]with a Tarantino-esque savagery”, and the book doesn’t shy away from graphic depictions of violence and suicide, nor frequent use of the N-word. It is also described as having a “fairytale atmosphere” – something the Disney-owned Hulu homed in on above all else. As a TV series, Washington Black feels less like a grownup drama and more like the sort of quasi-historical show that teachers play to their pupils as an end-of-term treat.View image in fullscreenNot their fault it feels risible … Tom Ellis and Eddie Karanja in Washington Black.Photograph: Chris Reardon/APLet’s start with the positives, though. The stunning scenery of Nova Scotia (which also doubles as Virginia) is a constant – a rugged, romantic backdrop to the action. Everyone looks the part, too: Sterling K Brown (also an executive producer) is rarely out of regal purple corduroy as Halifax town leader Medwin Harris, while the English contingent – among them Tom Ellis’s Titch and Rupert Graves’s Mr Goff – are Regencyfied to the max. (If you are a fan of towering 19th-century headgear, this is definitely the show for you.) The cast are excellent, including but not limited to Brown – who can convey so much emotion with the mere quiver of an eyebrow – and Eddie Karanja and Ernest Kingsley Jr, who do just the right amount of emoting as the young and slightly-less-young Wash. It is very easy to watch, and the four episodes delivered to press (there are eight in total) slip down easily and endearingly.But, really, that lack of friction is a problem. From the mawkish string soundtrack to some of the most heavy-handed dialogue ever committed to screen and the most cliched of death scenes (one character dies while stuttering out their final words and clutching at a stab wound), Washington Black lacks bite.To be clear, I don’t believe that all productions about slavery have to be laced with unending trauma and pain, and the emphasis on science is a nice departure from the harsh realities of the era. But in sanding down the corners of its source material, it ends up with an almost uncanny feel. It’s not Ellis’s fault, but the idea that anybody – never mind the most enlightened abolitionists of the age – would have answered the question “Is this boy your slave?” with “He’s my friend!” is risible. In fact, watching Ellis as an antebellum-era answer to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Caractacus Potts is a jarring experience. Julian Rhind-Tutt is perfectly terrifying as Erasmus, but – with the book’s darker moments removed – he is a sociopath without a cause. One character simply describes themself as “an unhinged disgrace”, as shorthand for the audience learning why they are unhinged or disgraceful. It didn’t have to be “Tarantino-esque” – but did it have to be quite so PG?Washington Black is also something of a romance, another area where it wobbles along. Kingsley Jr and Iola Evans – who plays a mixed-race, white-passing noblewoman named Tanna – give it their best shot. But lines such as “We’ll create a world of our own” and “She breathes life into me” feel as if they have been lifted from a bad pop song. By the time we get to “My everything is better with you”, I have begun to feel queasy. Tanna is distraught that her white father has never allowed her to explore the other side of herself, and her maternal connection to Solomon Islands. Unfortunately, we must learn all this through trite dialogue that sounds less like the stuff of a Disney+ drama, and more like the things that Disney princesses – locked in their gilded cages – sing about in their films.Washington Black comes with plenty of potential and, as an exercise in world-building, it is rich and appealing. But, unlike the Cloud Cutter, this is a creation that never takes flight. The hats really are lovely, but they are just not enough.Washington Black is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSlaveryreviewsShareReuse this content"

It acquired the name thanks to the pioneering efforts of three Dutch scientists – Marie Beatrice Schol-Schwarz, Christine Buisman and Johanna Westerdijk – who identified the beetle-transported fungus that causes it in the 1920s.Nor is the so-called “English elm” (Ulmus minor) really English, inasmuch as it is thought to have been transferred here from Italy, so Reform UK party enthusiasts should probably agitate to repatriate all such specimens. More confidently thought native to these isles is the wych elm (from the Old English for “supple”) or Scots elm, which has long been thought to have healing and protective qualities.Our scholarly guide to this noble plant, Mandy Haggith, delves enthusiastically into such lore. The 17th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper said that elm was connected to the planet Saturn and that its leaves could fix broken bones. Modern “healers” promise that drinking a decoction of elm bark can purge phlegm and stop diarrhoea. Haggith cites a present-day “Massachusetts-based herbalist and druid” who claims that slippery elm milk is good for insomnia.It would be unkind to call this sort of thing merely barking. The author insists that “a western scientific worldview” (in other words, a scientific worldview, shared by scientists in China and India) “is absolutely not the only way forests can be thought about”, which is fair enough. But the fake cures of the “wellness” industry are not without their own ecological downsides: as Haggith writes later, fashionable pseudo-remedies gone viral on TikTok or whatever can inspire the stripping of bark from healthy trees at injurious scale.Happily, elmwood was not only the preserve of quacks; it was also a sought-after material in shipbuilding (most of the hull of the fast clipper Cutty Sark was made of rock elm), and long before that for making spears and bows: an iron age Celtic tribe was known as “the ones who vanquish by the elm” (Lemovices). Medieval London, Bristol and other cities had running water delivered by mains pipes of elm. And elm is also the source of a famous insult: when the great Samuel Johnson claimed that there was no Gaelic literature, a poet responded with the Gaelic for “your head is made entirely of elm, especially your tongue and your gums”.Luckily, although Dutch elm disease has killed hundreds of millions of trees since the early 20th century, the species is not lost, or even on the brink of extinction. Brighton, Haggith sees, is managing the blight well through city-wide surveillance and timely surgery. And the fossil record suggests that elms have previously suffered waves of pandemic disease before bouncing back. There will be time for more poetic mentions of elms of the kind the author rather exhaustively collects towards the end. (“Robert Frost was a big fan of elm trees …”)But the greater part of this book’s devotion, and its delight, is reserved for living specimens in their habitats. Two rows of elms, Haggith notes, can form a “corridor for wildlife, dog walkers and feral children”, or “a church-like nave, an arch-shaped cloister that draws the eye” towards a monastery in Beauly. A cheerfully self-described “tree-hugger”, she is inspired to her best writing by close observation of the trees themselves. On an elm growing horizontally out of the rock near a Scottish loch: “I stand beneath it, neck craned in awe, looking up into the lush green profusion of its living community. It is winter, so all this greenery isn’t the tree’s own leaves, but photosynthesising life using it as a climbing frame”. Elsewhere she finds beauty even in a diseased log, happily noting the “beautiful doily pattern made by the brood-chamber and feeding passages of the grubs”.And her enthusiasm is contagious. As someone who began this book with literally no idea what an elm looks like, I was inspired to download theWoodland Trust tree-ID appand resolve to pay more attention to our ligneous friends.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Now, the veteran sci-fi film-maker returns with Avatar: Fire and Ash, thethird instalmentin cinema’s shiniest blue 3D eco fable. And from a preview of the trailer (to be released before showings ofThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsthis weekend) this is going to be yet another jaw-dropping, box-office smashing triumph of elemental, stereoscopic worldbuilding – or possibly a very long and very heavy bioluminescent deforestation story, depending on your point of view.WhereThe Way of Watertook us out to sea to commune with whales who cry in subtitles, Fire and Ash drags us into the scorched heart of Pandora’s volcanic badlands. Here we meet the Ash People – an angry, soot-streaked Na’vi clan who appear to have spent the last two films building up a healthy mistrust of outsiders. Imagine running into the scariest-looking Great Plains warriors Hollywood ever dreamed up, then dipping them in tar and relocating them to Mordor. They ride screaming banshees through smoke clouds, and if the trailer is anything to go by, they’ve had just about enough of Sam Worthington’s Jake Sully, his adoptive family and the entire colonial project of humanity in general.Which is why it’s a little strange to see Stephen Lang’s Colonel Miles Quaritch, or at least the reborn recombinant that carries the returning villain’s memories, apparently sporting the same scarlet war paint as these newcomers to the franchise. Have the Ash People been conned by humanity into fighting their Na’vi brethren, or are they just the latest poor fools to fall victim to humankind’s time-honoured tradition of co-opting Indigenous resistance to fight its proxy wars?View image in fullscreenNewcomers … one of the Ash People in Avatar: Fire and Ash.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyEither way, this is a first glimpse of Fire and Ash that in terms of sheer scale, spectacle and blue-on-blue action looks likely to match anything the series has so far delivered. Oona Chaplin’s Varang, leader of the new clan, tells a terrified Kiri (the Na’vi born from the dormantAvatarleft behind by Sigourney Weaver’s late Grace Augustine) that her goddess “has no dominion here”, which must be a pretty scary thing to hear when you’ve spent your entire life communing with Eywa-infused floating jellyfish. The Sullys appear to be caught up in their own family conflict, and at one point Sully basically tells Zoe Saldaña’s Neytiri to stop trying to solve all their life problems with arrows and screaming.It is all incredibly intense and unapologetically Cameron. Yet there’s a nagging feeling that if everyone on Pandora would just put aside their problems and try to get along, the extrasolar moon is such a gorgeous vision of eco-spiritual luxury real estate (if you’ll forgive the Trumpian gaze) that they could probably all do quite well financially from low-impact glow-in-the-dark wellness tourism.Surely this is the sort of place that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are really trying to get to with all those expensive, celebrity-strewn missions to the “edge of space”. Or perhaps that’s just where Cameron is planning to take us with the next episode – a scorching allegory for climate guilt, where hordes of spiritually curious billionaires arrive at Eywa’s doorstep in 3D-printed linen and wide-brimmed hats, demanding personalised banshee rides and artisan root-based cleansing rituals. It will be the final defeat of the Na’vi – not by war, but by a full season of White Lotus: Pandora, starring Amy Adams as a well-meaning but culturally disastrous grief yogi who accidentally destroys the Tree of Souls with her Tesla-branded personal eco-hoverpod.In the meantime, Avatar: Fire and Ash. If you liked the last two movies, this one will most likely boil your eyeballs and your conscience in roughly equal measure. If you thought the whole thing was a load of weepy, whale-whispering space guff, you’ll probably spend three hours wondering why the trees are crying again.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekAvatarfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was adapted byPeter Shafferfrom his stage-play about the two real-life composers, one a genius, one a nonentity (itself a theme-variation from Pushkin’s 1830 drama Mozart and Salieri), and directed by the great Czech film-maker Miloš Forman – his English-language masterpiece, or maybe his masterpiece full stop. Abraham was in his mid-40s when he played this Oscar-winning role; when I first saw it, I thought he would surely dominate the movies for decades to come, no doubt in classical adaptations in which he would be a superlative Iago or Faustus. For some reason, he never again got a starring role to match this, but he did have a terrific scene-stealer in season two of TV’s The White Lotus, in which he did not seem one day older than in this film.Abraham’s Antonio Salieri is the court composer of middling saccharine tunes in 18th-century Vienna whose leisured classes gobble his facile work like the chocolate treats he serves to people he wants to seduce. His career and terrible fate are recounted to a solemn priest by the aged Salieri in flashback; he was initially complacently content to regard his success as a reward from God for his bland religious conformity. But – in the film at least – Salieri is an envious, malicious mediocrity and hypocritical time-server, corrosively obsessed by the obvious superiority of the gloriously gifted but ill-mannered newcomerWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played here with many a nitrogen giggle by Tom Hulce. Mozart’s work instantly outpaces his and his genius causes Salieri to petulantly turn against God.Elizabeth Berridge seductively plays Mozart’s kittenishly devoted wife Constanze, or Stanzi; Roy Dotrice is Mozart’s sternly disapproving father; Jeffrey Jones plays the genial, tolerant Emperor Joseph II with elegant aplomb; and Mozart’s tearful maid Lori is played by the teenage Cynthia Nixon, later to find fame as Miranda in Sex and the City. Simon Callow played Mozart on stage for the play’s London premiere opposite Paul Scofield, and was perhaps chagrined to get only a small role here.The word “mesmeric” is overused, largely by virtue of being a notorious critics’ euphemism for arthouse films they secretly find dull – but Amadeus really is mesmeric (as well as deliciously exciting) and watching it again I went into exactly the trance I experienced the first time. Abraham’s Salieri, for all his loathing and rage, is Mozart’s sincerest admirer, electrified and dismayed by the brilliance which has effaced his own forgettable efforts. His face is a picture of elaborate courtesy and evil cunning as he pretends to be Mozart’s friend at court. With pure satanic connoisseurship, Salieri sees how it is not merely Mozart’s naivete but his genius which will be his downfall, how his superbly original work will gradually be rejected by simpering high society, how the resulting poverty and depression will erode his health.And so Salieri conceives his own diabolic masterpiece, greater and more audacious than any of his banal musical work: to exploit Mozart’s shock and guilt at the death of his father (which Salieri has divined from the plot of Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni) by arriving at his door like his father’s ghost in a sinister ball-mask, to commission a “requiem” for ready cash which Mozart can hardly refuse. This work will keep alive the psychic wound of despairing guilt which will drive Mozart to his death, music which Salieri plans to pass off as his own at Mozart’s own funeral; an exquisite flourish of dishonest piety.There are so many superb set-pieces in Amadeus that picking out any individually is almost impossible, but for me the best is Mozart’s first maladroit and nervous arrival in the emperor’s presence. They are surrounded by variously disapproving or admiring courtiers, all intensely aware of the political significance of a new German-speaking genius at the Habsburg court dominated by Italianate culture. Drama school students should study Abraham’s lizardly contempt which pours out of every frame. Salieri has composed a plonkingly uninspired “march of welcome” keyboard piece to be played when Mozart enters and the Emperor, a keen amateur musician, impulsively asks to play it himself as their young guest capers in. What was Salieri’s motive for this? Perhaps he wished to overawe Mozart with this extravagant gesture – or to establish his own primacy as composer at this vital moment. Or perhaps he wished, with machiavellian spite, to tempt Mozart into some brattish display of ingratitude with which he would disgrace himself.But he could hardly have expected the authentic un-political genius of Mozart’s response: having first insultingly demonstrated that he already knew this fatuous jingle by heart after a single hearing by playing it himself – he then improvises around it, conjuring what is to be a famous aria from The Marriage of Figaro, whose instant catchiness causes the courtiers to gather round. (The film uses Harrison Birtwistle’s original clever reworking of a genuine Salieri composition for this ingenious coup.) Poor Salieri’s face is a mask of rage and pain. His humiliation is almost complete.The finishing touch comes when at a masked ball (whose disguises are to inspire his hideous revenge) Mozart calls out for suggestions as to who he should pastiche at the keyboard and the incognito Salieri shouts out his own name – and Mozart grinningly thumps out a grotesque parody. Again: what is Salieri’s motive? Pure masochism, maybe. A need to find out the truth, to find out what Mozart really thinks of him and what everyone really thinks – what God thinks, perhaps. To confront the truth about his own lack of talent. There is a kind of integrity in it.Salieri’s final grim procession down the chaotic hallway of the psychiatric hospital, proclaiming his status as the patron saint of mediocrity is a chilling bravura moment. A treat for the big screen.Amadeus is in UK cinemas from 25 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsPeriod and historical filmsWolfgang Amadeus MozartMiloš FormanTheatrePeter ShafferreviewsShareReuse this content"

In doing so, he moved American new playwriting on from the era ofSam Shepardand David Mamet; he had no particular axes to grind, and he wrote beautifully.Every time you saw a play of his – he was once dubbed “the American Noël Coward” – you understood why his household gods were Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James and Edith Wharton. He was serious, literate, engaging and enlightened.In his breakthrough play, Eastern Standard (1988), he anatomised a yuppie quartet of best friends and siblings sorting out their relationships as they moved from Manhattan to a summer house on Long Island. And he did so in a becalmed atmosphere of guilt-ridden privilege that got some critics’ collective goats.I saw Eastern Standard in the same Broadway season as ARGurney’s The Cocktail Hour andWendy Wasserstein’s The Heidi Chronicles. All three plays reverted to classical structure and narrative in middle-class environments turning their backs on Greenwich Village, political protest and scabrous social behaviour.He told the New York Times in 1988: “The idea that the moral and personal lives of the middle-class do not constitute a subject worthy of consideration is a kind of fascism to me, a censoriousness saying that we know everything there is to know about them.” And it is certainly true that he jabbed and poked beneath the surface of his characters’ lives with uncommon skill, revealing complex layers.Many of Greenberg’s plays (and there were over 30) were set in Manhattan and the socioeconomic satellites of the Hamptons and the Catskills. But his own personal style and demeanour were secretive, withdrawn, uncooperative. As he admitted in a Daily Telegraph interview in 2009: “I love the moment when you just have the dress rehearsal, when no one’s there; that’s kind of the peak to me. When people start filing in, I like to file out.”View image in fullscreenFrederick Weller, Neal Huff, Daniel Sunjata and Kohl Sudduth in Take Me Out, at the Donmar Warehouse, central London, in 2002.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAll the same, he won the Tony best play award in 2003 for Take Me Out – world premiered in London at theDonmar Warehousein 2002 – a play about a major league baseball player coming out as gay that wittily addressed the subject of bigotry and homophobia in sport. Again, he did not tub-thump; he moved gracefully through the arguments.The Donmar had also presented – in 1999 – the clever and absorbingThree Days of Rain(1997), charting the fleshly appetites and passion in two overlapping triangular love stories, with a great cast ofColin Firth,Elizabeth McGovernandDavid Morrissey. The play was triumphantly revived on Broadway in 2006 with a trio ofPaul Rudd,Julia RobertsandBradley Cooper.Greenberg was born in Green Meadow, Long Island, New York, to Shirley (nee Levine) and Leon Greenberg, an executive for a chain of movie theatres. He graduated from Princeton with a degree in English in 1980 and enrolled in Harvard’s doctoral programme on literature before transferring to the Yale school of drama for the playwriting course. There, he wrote The Bloodletters (1984), about a Jewish teenager on Long Island who develops a rare disease that makes him smell like a dirty bathroom. The New York Times critic Frank Rich, a notable champion of his, said that the play was “so daffily conceived that one must admire its promising author’s antic spin of mind even when he is straining too hard”.View image in fullscreenPaul Rudd and Julia Roberts in Three Days of Rain on Broadway in 2006.Photograph: Joan Marcus/APHe signed a contract with the South Coast repertory in California, where several of his plays were first presented. Other important forcing houses in the early days were the Seattle Rep and the Manhattan Theatre club, both springboarding Eastern Standard toBroadway.Patently using James’s Washington Square (in its theatrical format of The Heiress), Greenberg wrote The American Plan (1990) as a pungent, melancholic mother and daughter drama of great psychological and narrative ingenuity. Set in the Catskills in the 1960s, it was hailed as“an absolute cracker” by Michael Billingtonwhen receiving its British premiere in 2013 at the Theatre Royal, Bath, directed by David Grindley and outstandingly well-acted by Diana Quick as the Mittel European Jewish refugee and Emily Taaffe as her daughter Lili Adler, a young heiress scarred by mental illness.The last play of his I saw, an extraordinary one, wasThe Dazzle(2002), presented in 2015 by the Michael Grandage company, directed by Simon Evans, in a pop-up theatre in the former Central Saint Martins school on the Charing Cross Road. The play is based on a true story of two brothers – or at least their decomposing corpses – found in 1947 in their clutter-rammed family home in New York. It had taken a team of people weeks to clear their hoard – books, instruments, newspapers.And it was from this posthumous view of the brothers that Greenberg looked back. He fictionalised what their lives could have been, inspired by the possibilities of how the two men could have arrived in such a sorry state.Andrew Scottplayed, brilliantly, the eccentric pianist, Langley, David Dawson, equally superb, his accountant brother, Homer.The play was set in a small room with a grand piano – relatively uncluttered to begin with – but as the story unfolded the room began to cramp with crap. A bohemian hostess, played by a beautifully poisedJoanna Vanderham, entered their world, almost marrying Langley, then much later almost marrying Homer, before the brothers were left alone, hidden from society, dirty and dying, surrounded by their accumulated memorabilia and detritus.The savagery of these biographies fully exposed the streak of jaundiced melancholia and dissatisfaction running through most of Greenberg’s characters’ lives, the downside to their wealth and privilege. It is impossible not to deduce there was something of this about Greenberg himself, the fuel to his writing.He is survived by his brother, Edward.Richard Greenberg, playwright, born 22 February 1958, died 4 July 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreBroadwayDonmar WarehouseWest EndobituariesShareReuse this content"

Yaël Farber’s production animates the psychological terror that King Leontes (Bertie Carvel) wreaks on his pregnant wife Hermione (Madeline Appiah), out of his unfounded suspicion that she has been unfaithful with his old friend, Polixenes (John Light). Carvel makes a convincingly deluded barefoot king, regarding himself as the vulnerable cuckold. His suspicion turns to solid belief to unleash punishment on Hermione.In its first three sombre acts, the drama plays out as a thriller, with expressionist movement and lighting. A gigantic orb of a full moon hangs over the stage (Soutra Gilmour’s design is spare and striking as a whole), turning cool white or roiling red to reflect the action.View image in fullscreenPsychological horror … Madeline Appiah as Hermione in The Winter’s Tale.Photograph: Marc BrennerFarber recently staged two Shakespeare tragedies at the Almeida: aMacbethfour years ago which was full of slow and meditative dread, andan arresting King Learlast year. This feels like a third tragedy in some ways, lugubrious in mood and with a monochrome aesthetic in the first, darker half.But there is a fuzziness to the storytelling. This modern-dress production is all smoke and shadows, unmoored from a specific time or place, so it is harder to contextualise its themes. More specifically, some scenes are vague, such as Antigonus’s pursuit by a bear which is dealt with symbolically – a static figure takes off the mask to reveal herself as Hermione. It is beautiful but unclear.Tim Lutkin’s lighting design turns warm in the second half, with lovely live music (lone musicians waver around the set). The usually awkward change of mood, from dark to light, works smoothly here: the play glides into a second half with Autolycus (Trevor Fox) its light-fingered highlight.But Farber seems at pains to add her own mythical layers: the figure of Time (also Fox) speak a choral ode from Brecht’s The Antigone of Sophocles instead of the Oracle of Apollo, and this is opaque in its meaning. The feast in Bohemia is inspired by the ancient Greek ritual of the Eleusinian Mysteries, so the programme explains, adding that, for Farber, Hermione and Perdita “wear the mask of Demeter and Persephone”. An interesting idea on the page, it is gnomic on stage.View image in fullscreenConvincingly deluded … Bertie Carvel, right, as Leontes with Richard Sutton as Jailer.Photograph: Marc BrennerThere is more clarity around female strength and resistance, to counter Leontes’ tyranny. Aïcha Kossoko, playing noblewoman Paulina, is a powerful presence while Appiah, as Hermione, exudes pained dignity and courage alongside her bewilderment. When she testifies in court, she is a bereft mother with lactating patches on her dress after her newborn baby has been taken from her. It is an abject scene.The production never stops looking beautiful, and bustles with a wealth of original concepts, but sometimes resembles a puzzling procession. It remains an unsolved problem play, the first half – shaped so artfully as a tragedy of explosive and irrational male rage – still not quite wedded to its second.At theRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 30 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyThe Winter's TaleYaël FarberSoutra GilmourBertie CarvelWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

Released in 1998, it totally reshaped Madonna’s career, embracing trip-hop, electronica and Britpop and essentially proving to an unfriendly public that she was one of pop’s great auteurs. It spawned one of her biggest singles – the haunting power ballad Frozen – and its title track is still a staple of radio and DJ playlists. In the past few years, many of contemporary and underground pop’s most significant names – including Caroline Polachek, Addison Rae, a.s.o., Shygirl and FKA twigs – have referenced Ray of Light, whether directly or indirectly. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make a case for the best or most significant Madonna album – she has at least five strong contenders – but if there’s a consensus pick, it’s Ray of Light.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Veronica ElectronicaWhich is why the announcement of Veronica Electronica, a full-length Ray of Light remix album, was met with such hysteria from fans earlier this year.Madonnahas spoken at length over the years about both Veronica the character – in true Madonna fashion, Veronica stems from a vaguely contradictory concept in which she is both a girl dancing at a club and, somehow, “medieval” – and the album, which she intended to release after Ray of Light but ended up shelving. For diehards, the promised record is something of a holy grail – never mind that this long-awaited release only contains two truly new songs, one of which, an old demo titled Gone Gone Gone, has been floating around on the internet for years.Even so, it’s hard to deny the simple pleasures that can be derived from hearing some all-time great Madonna remixes cut down to radio length and sequenced like the original Ray of Light. Drowned World/Substitute for Love sounds great taken out of its original glacial trip-hop context and turned into a DayGlo acid rager by BT and Sasha; the emotional ambiguities of the original song are replaced with warm positivity, and you can easily imagine the song soundtracking the final minutes of a raging house party as the sun begins to rise. Other tracks, such as Peter and Victor’s remix of Skin – the other new song here – take an opposite tack; they heighten Skin’s innate moodiness with a steely, exploratory techno beat punctuated by big, sharp breaks, turning the original track into something tweaky and unsettled.The trailer for Veronica Electronica – videoMadonna trying standup is no joke: she’s a natural comedian and genuine kook | Shaad D’SouzaRead moreAs is often the case with remix records, there are moments on Veronica Electronica that feel perfunctory – namely, the Club 69 remix of Nothing Really Matters. Perhaps any remix of the original song will always be held to a higher standard, given its status as one of the only out-and-out club tracks on Ray of Light, but unlike many of the remixes on the album, it feels as if there’s no relationship between the source material and the rework here, aside from Madonna’s vocal, which is looped to the point of irritation. It’s frustrating when people claim to “hate remixes”, as if you can put a blanket statement on an entire artform, but this kind of remix may make you sympathise with the sentiment.Fabien’s Good God mix of The Power of Good-Bye, on the other hand, represents all the potential of a curio project like this: a bizarrely minimal drum’n’bass rework of one of Madonna’s best ballads, it finds enormous power in the conflict between Fabien’s increasingly frenetic drums and Madonna’s serene, sorrowful vocal. It’s a surprisingly appropriate lead-in to Gone Gone Gone, a song so brilliantly weird that you really can understand why it was left off the original album. It is, essentially, a wistful breakup ballad set to a squelchy electro beat – a surreal tonal clash that hardly gels with Ray of Light’s placid waters, but which gives a surprising amount of insight into Madonna’s creative state at the time: here is one of the biggest stars in the world, in her creative prime, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. For that peek behind the curtain alone, Veronica Electronica is worth the price of admission.Explore more on these topicsMadonnaPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Donizetti’s bel canto bloodbath has lost none of its power to intrigue as well as entertain in the 190 years since its Naples premiere. In Cecilia Stinton’s thoughtful new staging the heroine is a charmer, a little wacky perhaps, prone to the odd hallucination maybe, but in different circumstances you imagine she’d be fun to be around. It’s also clear from the sexual violence played out behind the backs of her testosterone-fuelled lover and brother as they sing a rollicking duet on the forestage that when this Lucia kills it will be in self-defence.Opera Holland Park is ideally placed to host a traditional production. Neil Irish’s sets, subtly lit by Tim van ’t Hof, seem to grow out of the Jacobean walls of Holland House. The action is partly set inside a crumbling mansion, here pointedly in need of repair. The rest occurs in and around the lichen-encrusted cemetery where the soil is still fresh on the grave of Lucia’s mother. With the orchestra located in the middle of the action, Stinton uses a potentially tricksy space well, though the busy chorus of parlour maids, gardeners and wedding guests could be more imaginatively blocked at times, and the 19th-century Scottish dad dancing was perhaps a step too far.Michael Papadopoulos’ way with Donizetti’s tuneful score is another asset. There’s real care and attention in the way he shapes phrases and encourages the City of London Sinfonia to breathe in time with the singers. The 35 players produce a satisfyingly weighty sound, especially in the lively party scenes and the turbulence of the Act III storm. The OHP chorus is similarly rock-solid.View image in fullscreenHeft and ping … Morgan Pearse as Lord Enrico Ashton.Photograph: Ali WrightLeading a fine cast is Jennifer France, a bright, flexible soprano whose unforced warmth wins the audience’s sympathy from the outset. Playful, even cheeky at first, her descent into the grave – quite literally – where she plasters her blood-stained wedding dress with earth, is both consistent and credible. Her hushed singing is a delight, her coloratura secure. Only the high F feels a stretch, and then only just.Her Edgardo is Portuguese tenorJosé de Eça. His is a thoroughly Italianate sound, rich and ringing, though a couple of softer high notes fell slightly flat. The final death scene is, for once, convincing. Australian baritone Morgan Pearse sings Lucia’s hard-hearted brother Enrico with impressive heft and plenty of ping to the voice.Among the supporting roles, Blaise Malaba is a genially resonant Raimondo and Joseph Buckmaster a sprightly toned Arturo. A shout out too for stylish mezzo Charlotte Badham who made an indelible mark as Lucia’s companion Alisa. Their touching, delicately sculpted relationship was one of the production’s unexpected pleasures.Until 1 August.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

We are not a matriarchy,” says Mare Mätas as she meets me off the ferry. I’ve stepped on to the wild and windswept Kihnu island, which floats in the Gulf of Riga off Estonia’s western coast like a castaway from another time. Just four miles (7km) long and two miles wide, this Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernity, a place where motorbikes share the road with horse-drawn carts, and women in bright striped skirts still sing ancient sea songs. But Kihnu is no museum – it’s a living, breathing culture all of its own, proudly cared for by its 700 or so residents.MapMare, a traditional culture specialist and local guide, promptly ushers me into the open back of her truck and takes me on a whistlestop tour of the island, giving me a history quiz as we stop at the museum, the lighthouse, the cemetery and the school.The men of Kihnu would once have spent many months away at sea, sailing or hunting seals. Out of necessity, the women of the island became the heads of the family as well as the keepers of the island’s cultural heritage. This led to Kihnu being nicknamed “the island of women”, and the BBC even proclaimed it “Europe’s last surviving matriarchy”. But Mare is very clear: “If you must use a word, you could say that our culture is matrifocal. But I prefer to say that on Kihnu we are simply equal.Womenhave status in the community, and older women have a higher status – they are seen as wise elders. Women work as the guardians of our culture, and we look after the circle of life on the island – we have the children, we tend the land, we care for the dead.”This Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernityThe women of Kihnu have been lighthouse keepers, tractor drivers and even stand-in priests. Today, they play ancient melodies on violin and accordion, teach their daughters traditional dances and sing Kihnu’s eerily beautiful runic songs, believed to be of pre-Christian origin. Most eyecatchingly, they wear traditional dress – bright red woollen skirts, embroidered blouses and patterned headscarves. These aren’t just garments donned for weddings or festivals – this is the only place in Estonia where folk dress is still donned daily.View image in fullscreenWhen the men were at sea, the women became the lighthouse keepers.Photograph: Matjaz Corel/AlamyMare is wearing a red stripedkörtskirt and woollen jacket. Her daughters, in their teens and 20s, pair their traditional skirts with slogan T-shirts. The skirts are woven every winter and each tells the story of the wearer. Young women usually wear red – they are supposedly in the “fairytale” era of their lives. If a woman is in mourning, she will don a black skirt. Over the months, her skirts will include more red and purple stripes until she’s dressed in joyful red again. A married woman wears an apron over her skirt, and new fashions and patterns still influence designs today. “When paisley was brought to the island from India, we began using it for our headscarves,” explains Mare. “And in the 1960s, when miniskirts were the rage, we wore mini körts!”I spot women of all ages dressed in bright flashes of red as I cycle about the island’s dirt roads on a sit-up-and-beg-bike. Kihnu is a patchwork of wildflower meadows and pine groves, edged by rocky coastline and dotted with wooden homes painted in primary yellows and reds. Outside one homestead I meet Jaak Visnap. An artist from Tallinn, he has run naive art camps here every summer for 20 years. Historically, many of the island’s sailors were also naive painters (artists who typically have no formal training and exhibit a simplicity in their work), and when I meet Jaak, he and a group of painting students from Kihnu and the mainland are busy working on richly coloured paintings for an exhibition in the island’s museum.View image in fullscreenLocal guide Mare Mätas in traditional dress.Photograph: Sian LewisEstonians often label themselves as cold and standoffish, but the painters welcome me warmly and offer me wine. The sun comes out and transforms the island – moody grey skies swept away by golden light – so I join them for a swim in the warm, shallow sea. As we bob on our backs in the evening glow, Viola from Tallinn tells me a joke: “It’s raining, and a foreigner asks an Estonian man: ‘Don’t you have summer in this country?’ ‘Of course,’ he replies. ‘But sadly I was at work that day.’”Before I leave the painters, I ask Jaak how the island has changed since his first summer here. “This used to be the fishing island,” he says. “Now, it’s the tourist island.” But visitors don’t seem to have transformed Kihnu just yet. Locals may drive modern cars and trucks, but I also pass Soviet-era motorbikes with side cars. There are a few shops and cafes, but they sell smoked dried fish and seal meat as well as coffee and cakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But tourism also allows the next generation to remain on the island, rather than leave for the mainland in search of work. And for now, most visitors seem to embrace slow travel, staying with local people in guest houses and B&Bs, and visiting to join midsummer dances and violin festivals, to learn to paint or knit, or just to find pastoral peace.Baltic beauty: exploring Estonia’s northern coastRead moreThe “island of women” is a misnomer. Instead, Kihnu feels like an old-fashioned yet balanced place that moves to the beat of its own drum (or perhaps, the hum of its own accordion). In winter, cloaked in snow, it must be a tough place to live. But in summer, this slow-paced island is a joy to explore. As I leave, the rain that makes it so lush and green returns. The ferry has barely left the harbour before Kihnu is swallowed in the grey sea, a place of legend once again.Kihnu is reached by aone-hour ferry crossing(foot passengers €4 one way, cars €16 one way) fromMunalaidharbour, which isan hour’sbus journeyfrom the coastal town ofPärnu.

One fabulous way to cook up a glut isscarpaccia, an Italian classic that’s similar tofarinataand a distant cousin of pizza. Thinly sliced courgettes are degorged by tossing them in sea salt to extract their juices, then, true to Italian thrift, the flavourful liquid is used to make a batter that’s then reunited with the courgettes before baking into a thin, crisp slice.ScarpacciaZucchini or courgettes are a type of summer squash that grows so prolifically that even the most amateur horticulturist, such as myself, is often inundated with a cash crop of long green gourds. The leaves, stems and flowers are all edible (the greenery can be used like any other leafy green – it’s wonderful simply sauteed with garlic, lemon and nutmeg).Those who don’t have the luxury of growing their own still benefit from the seasonal abundance, however, because the price of courgettes drops to much more affordable levels, even at the most affluent of farmers’ markets. When I was growing up in Dorset, I remember seeing baskets of the things on garden walls, just left out in return for a donation of a few pennies.500g courgettes, topped and washed500g new potatoes,washedSea salt1 white or red onion, peeled and thinly sliced3 sprigs fresh rosemary, or thyme or oregano, leaves picked150g wholemeal flour– wheat, spelt or plain white50g polenta, or semolina or breadcrumbs, plus extra to finishOlive oilFinely slice 100g each of the courgettes and potatoes and set aside. Grate the rest into a colander set over a bowl, add two teaspoons of sea salt and toss to coat. Place a plate and a weight directly on top of the courgettes and potatoes, and leave to degorge for an hour. Working with a handful at a time, squeeze the courgette and potato mix over the bowl, to collect their juices, then measure out 120ml of the liquid (if need be, top up with water).In a bowl, mix the grated courgettes and potatoes with the sliced onion, herb leaves, flour and polenta, then stir in the 120ml reserved juice and mix to the consistency of thick cake batter; add more liquid or flour as required.Line a large baking tray with unbleached baking paper and brush with olive oil. Spread the batter over the paper so it’s about 5mm thick, then arrange the sliced vegetables on top in neat alternating rows. Drizzle with more olive oil, sprinkle with a little polenta and a pinch of sea salt, then bake in a 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 oven for 45-55 minutes, until golden, crisp and charred in places.This article was edited on 23 July 2025, to clarify that the grated courgettes and potatoes should be mixed with the onion, herbs, flour and polenta.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite their unruliness as a crop, they are mild-mannered in flavour, a culinary chameleon that partners with a wide range of tastes. From the umami punch of parmesan to the fragrant cut-through of citrus, and from the warmth of cinnamon to the char of the barbecue, these green gourds can be used in myriad ways, shining in sweet and savoury contexts alike.Courgette butter, parmesan and lime puff tart (pictured top)There is nothing easier or more gratifying in summer than a tart topped with the season’s bounty. Serve with a rocket salad for a light lunch, or alongside your protein of choice. The courgette “butter” is endlessly adaptable: turn it into a pasta sauce with a spoonful or two of creme fraiche, or use it to fill quesadillas.Prep30 minCook25 minServes6-8For the courgette ‘butter’3 tbsp olive oil3 medium-large courgettes(about 670g)3 small garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced½ tsp fine sea saltFinely grated zest and juice of ½ limeFor the tart320g sheetready-rolled puff pastry3-4 tbsp ricotta, or creme fraiche or cream cheese10g parmesan, finely gratedEgg wash, or milk, to glazePut the olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Meanwhile, top and tail the courgettes, then slice into very fine 1mm-2mm-thick rounds (if you have one, use a mandoline).Tip the sliced courgettes, garlic and salt into the pan, stir to coat everything in the hot oil, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes, until the courgettes start to break down. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook for another 15 minutes, until the courgettes are soft and jammy and a bit like butter; if you like, leave the courgettes to cool and store in the fridge for up to three days.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Unravel the pastry sheet and its paper on to a large baking tray, trimming off any excess paper, if need be, then use a small knife to score a light 1cm border all around the edge of the pastry. Spoon dollops of the ricotta into the centre of the pastry, then spread it all over the base up to the border.Squeeze the lime juice on to the cooked courgettes, then spread them evenly over the the ricotta and top with an even scattering of the parmesan and the grated lime zest. Brush the border with egg wash (or milk), then bake for 25-30 minutes, until the edges are puffed up and deeply golden. Serve immediately.Courgette and brown sugar loafView image in fullscreenThis is a brilliant way to use up a glut of courgettes, turning them into a soft, cinnamon-spiced cake with deep caramel notes from the muscovado sugar and a hit of aniseed fragrance from the fennel seeds. Perfect for an afternoon tea break.Prep20 minCook50 minServes8For the cake210g plain flour1 tsp ground cinnamon¾ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda½ tsp fine sea salt250g grated courgettes(2 small-medium courgettes)100gdark muscovado sugar2 medium eggs200g granulated sugar50g creme fraiche, plus extra to serve1 tsp vanillabean pasteFinely grated zest of 1 lemonJuice of ½ lemon120ml olive oil1 tbsp demerara sugar1 tsp fennel seeds, roughly crushedHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line a 2lb loaf tin with greaseproof paper.In a medium-large bowl, thoroughly whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, bicarb and salt, then add the grated courgette and toss until evenly coated.In a large jug, whisk themuscovado sugar and eggsfor about a minute, until there are no significant lumps and the mix is a little frothy. Whisk in the granulated sugar, creme fraiche, vanilla, lemon zest and juice, then stream in the olive oil, whisking all the time.Pour the wet mix into the courgette bowl, whisk just until combined, then scrape into the lined loaf tin. Mix the demerara sugar and crushed fennel seeds, then sprinkle evenly all over the top. Bake for 45 minutes, until golden on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove and leave the loaf to cool in its tin for five to 10 minutes, then carefully unmould and transfer to a rack to cool completely. The cake is delicious as is, but slices can also be served with a spoonful of creme fraiche and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil (or maple syrup, if you have more of a sweet tooth).Alexina Anatole is the author of theSmall Wins Substackand Sweet: The Secret to the Best Desserts, published by Square Peg at £27.
