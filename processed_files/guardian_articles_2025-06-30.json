What this is really about is a government complicit in the Gaza atrocities seeking to silence dissentJuliet Stevenson is an award-winning actorMon 30 Jun 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 15.23 EDTShareStrongly worded emails are not doing it. Appeals to MPs are not doing it. Taking to the streets in our hundreds of thousands with banners and placards is not working. Elected representatives from every party in parliament have stood in the Commons and asked the government to act. Some government ministers themselves have condemned Israel’s starvation of Palestinians in Gaza. Every poll of public opinion shows that the nation demands we stop armingIsrael, and wants to see an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire. But none of these things are working.Keir Starmer and his cabinet remain impervious to all calls for humanitarian intervention, and Israel is still killing children inGazawith the support of the British government.To proscribe as “terrorist”a non-violent direct action group such as Palestine Action threatens the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, and of peaceful protest. Surely the government should only ever apply the Terrorism Act with the utmost restraint and precision. Otherwise it allows the state to repress civil liberties that have been dearly fought for and won, and which represent the bedrock of our democracy.Those civil liberties have already come under real and dangerous threat. The powers given to the police have incrementally increased to an alarming degree, owing in part to the Terrorism Act of 2000 and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act of 2022. These have both led to the right of public protest being seriously eroded, and afforded the police much greater powers and significantly less accountability. We have for some time seen these powers being used to suppress lawful protest and to detain peaceful protesters.In addition, leaving aside its members, the proscription of Palestine Action will directly affect many other activists who are deeply concerned about the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza. Even to be seen to support PA’s non-violent direct action will be to risk being criminalised.The government’s response to embarrassing security breaches at RAF bases by Palestine Action seems disproportionate, and highlights, I think, the influence on them of vested interests. There has long been a campaign by senior rightwing politicians, arms company executives and pro-Israel lobby groups to shut down Palestine Action and have it proscribed.Lockheed Martin UK is a key manufacturer of parts for the F-35 fighter jetsthat have helped Israel flatten the Gaza Strip, kill more than 56,000 people and createmore child amputees per capitathan anywhere else in the world. The government ended direct sales to Israel of some weapons, but created an “F-35 exemption” allowing sales of these parts to continue to reach Israel via the US, where the planes are assembled.The Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems also operates on UK soil, and our government has lucrative bilateral deals with the company. As far back as 2022 the then home secretary, Priti Patel, held a meeting with Martin Fausset, the CEO of Elbit Systems in the UK,to discuss how to deal with Palestine Action.The definition of terrorism as laid out in the Terrorism Act of 2000 is clear, and includes“serious damage to property”. Doesspraying red paint on to metalconstitute serious damage? The condemnation of this spraying of red paint on to planes as expressed by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, does not appear to be matched by any equivalent condemnation by her of red blood sprayed on to the tented walls of Gaza.So yes, crimes concerning damage to property have been committed, but there are already laws in place to deal with them. Labelling these as terrorism only serves to deepen the UK government’s complicity in the war crimes being committed in Palestine.In a further act of desperation, efforts have been made to try to undermine the motives of Palestine Action by makinga tenuous link to Iran, with unnamed Home Office sources telling newspapers it is investigating the group’s finances.Smear campaigns such as this are part of a wider policy by government to intimidate and clamp down on dissent.I have had a small taste of this myself. On 18 January, I attended a rally in Whitehall organised by Stop the War – and noticed immediately that the tactics of the police that day seemed to be markedly different. Present in their thousands, they were already kettling people at the start of the event, and behaving in a manner that seemed aggressive and provocative. The march to the BBC, which had been planned to protest against its coverage of the conflict, had been prohibited by the Met at short notice, and the gathering was confined to Whitehall. I was asked to join a group of about 12 people who would form a symbolic delegation, and request passage through police lines to reach the BBC. There we planned to lay flowers at the door. Reaching the police lines, after some hesitation and resistance, an officer allowed us through. Shortly after that, however, our progress was curtailed by another police line. It was here that I saw at close hand the disproportionate tactics used by police. I witnessed further vanloads of police arriving in the area, kettling peaceful protesters and making numerous arrests –77 in total that day.Three weeks later I was sent a letter from the Met threatening me with charges under section 14 of the Public Order Act. I then faced a three-hour police interview, before being told after several weeks (and several thousand pounds of legal fees) that I would face no further action.Over the past 21 months, I have met many hundreds of people who come out – often travelling long distances – to protest against this genocide. Old people and young, people of every faith, race, generation and ethnic identity. They come in horror at the brutality being inflicted on the population of Gaza. And many of those in our midst are Jewish.But still we are accused by lobby groups of antisemitism. This I disregard; I am married to a Jewish man, whose mother was a refugee from Hitler’s Vienna. She escaped just in time in 1938 as a refugee, and most of her family were subsequently wiped out in the Holocaust. My children define themselves as Jewish, and we have many beloved Jewish friends, all of whom are appalled by the activities of Benjamin Netanyahu, his government and the Israel Defense Forces. These Jewish friends are people driven by compassion, humanity and a sense of right and wrong that will not yield to intimidation. In Gaza, the world is watching the most heinous acts of violence that I have witnessed in my lifetime. It is as if the skin has been ripped off the face of humanity to reveal terrifying depths of sadism and depravity.I am intensely aware of this thought: I do not want to find myself at the end of my life looking back at this time regretting that I could have done something and didn’t – that I was too frightened to speak out, or to act. Palestine Action and its supporters will have no such regrets. Our current British government, however, may well.Juliet Stevenson is an award-winning actorExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionGazaActivismPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaArms tradeIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

I went off into this surreal space,” said Dainton. “I didn’t feel anything in my heart. I just thought, this is not real. I said: ‘How can you be sure?’ And they told me.”Advances in DNAmeant police had established that the killer was Ryland Headley, a railway worker who at the time of the murder in 1967 lived a mile and a half from 75-year-old Dunne’s home in Bristol.View image in fullscreenLouisa Dunne in about 1927.Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA“I said something to the effect of, my goodness, how old is he? They said: 92. I asked the police: ‘Was he married? Did he have children?’ All they could say was: ‘He’s had a life.’ So I presume that meant he was and he did have children. All I could think was, his poor family too. I don’t think anybody could do that unless they had a very distorted view of what is right and what is wrong.”The arrest of Headley and his trial atBristolcrown court has brought back many memories and feelings. Dainton, 78, did not know her grandmother well – there was something of a family rift – but the impact of the murder never left her and other relatives.“I only met her once when I was a teenager. I remember my grandmother being very keen to be friendly with me and she held my hand very, very tightly.”Dainton’s grandmother was married to a well-known local Labour politician, Ted Parker. “Mum said Gran used to join in with the political chat that went on in the house. My grandmother supported my grandfather. She must have been in the position of a lot of women where she ran the house and looked after the children while he went on with his career.”After Parker died, Dainton’s grandmother married again. Her second husband, a nightwatchman, John Dunne, also died, and by 1967 she was living alone. Dainton said: “I can’t imagine what it was like even living on your own when you’ve been widowed twice.”Dainton was a 20-year-old art student when her grandmother was murdered. “I picked up the [Bristol] Evening Post. At the back, they had the obituaries. And there it was, a tiny little column about my grandmother. I caught the bus to see my mum. She was in a bit of a state emotionally. For me, it was such a shock.”View image in fullscreenRyland Headley was found guilty of Dunne’s murder on Monday.Photograph: Avon and Somerset ConstabularyDainton was told that Dunne had been raped. “I think particularly then it [rape] had a kind of stigma. People imagine things about the victim.”Dainton’s mother, Edna, did not want to talk about the crime. “She told me, basically, ‘Dad and I will handle this. You go away, live your life.’” The default response, Dainton said, was to put on a “stiff upper lip” – but it turned out not to be a good strategy.“My mother had a breakdown. I think she suffered from depression later – she found it very hard to make friends. We weren’t a very close family in the first place, but what there was in the family fell to pieces.”The years passed and every now and then, the memories of Dainton’s grandmother crept up on her.“Years later, I started to think about her. I was going to try and do a series of paintings about my family. I got the pictures out of my grandmother and I suddenly realised I knew nothing about her. And the memories came in then.”0:41Police bodycam footage shows moment of Ryland Headley's arrest – videoDainton resigned herself to the idea that nobody would be caught. “I accepted that some murders never get solved. Some people have to live with that emptiness and that sadness.” She read detective books and knew about DNA but it did not strike her it could help solve her grandmother’s killing. “I never believed they would be able to trace him.”The arrest has made her think again about what Dunne must have suffered. “I think it’s appalling. The poor woman. He was in his 30s and he was a reasonably sized man. And she was tiny. She was extremely skinny and small. It must have been absolutely terrifying. I feel extremely sad. I think he’s probably told himself lies in order to cope with it and he will never probably acknowledge what he’s done.”Louisa Dunne, in hat and rosette, pictured with first husband Ted Parker who was on leave from Southmead hospital to vote in 1945 election.Dainton is grateful that over the years detectives kept reviewing the crime. To her, it is not a cold case.“I’ve encountered people who’ve said to me: ‘Why are the police wasting their time and their money on this?’ But this is the worst crime you can commit as far as I’m concerned.“Rape and murder are horrendous. Are you saying that because somebody is old and because it’s this amount of time between when it happened and when they finally found out who it was, justice doesn’t have to be done?“We have laws. We have punishments. And if they aren’t followed through and pursued as best we can, then there’s absolutely no point in having laws. We might just as well all be anarchists.”Now she would like to find out more about Dunne.“My main questions now are about my grandmother and her life. When she was alive, there weren’t that many choices for women. I get the feeling that she was quite feisty. She probably had quite a lot of strong feelings and beliefs herself.”In photos, Dainton has noticed that Dunne was usually in the second row. “She’s nearly always putting her head round somebody else’s head. I got the idea that maybe it was a difficult life being in the second row to a man who was very clever and very powerful and very idealistic.”Dainton sometimes asks herself why she feels so upset about a woman she did not know well.“But I do feel connected to her and I’ve got no idea why except DNA. The thing that caught him, it’s caught me. I do feel deeply linked to her.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

TheLabourbenches were as tightly rammed as they are for prime minister’s questions and everyone had come determined to have their say. No longer willing to be sidelined by ministers as “noises off”. No one had just turned up because they had nowhere better to be.On the other side of the Commons, only a handful of Tory backbenchers had made the effort to show up. Fair enough. Disabled and vulnerable people have never really been their priority. To be charitable, maybe they just found it a bit awkward intruding on the government’s private grief.IfLiz Kendallhad any nerves about facing down her own party with the concessions – or measures, as she preferred to call them – that had been forced out of the government, then she kept them well hidden. It’s counterintuitive to imagine that some Labour MPs came into politics to make life harder for some disabled people, but Liz might just be that person. She knows – as we all do – that the welfare system isn’t working properly. That we have a far higher proportion of people on benefits than almost every other European country. But she is prepared to make life worse for people with disabilities as collateral damage. For the greater good and all that.Revised Labour welfare measures could still push 150,000 into povertyRead moreFor the first five minutes of Kendall’s statement, you would have been hard pushed to know that for much of the last week she and Keir Starmer had been scrabbling around toprevent a rebellionthat could have killed off her welfare changes at Tuesday’s second reading. Liz spoke of her commitment to equality and social justice, how she was creating real opportunities and support. Just not necessarily for everyone. “The system we inherited doesn’t work,” she said. No one was going to disagree with that.Then we got to the concessions. Sorry, measures. I will try to keep up. Liz had come to all this entirely on her own. Had no idea so many of her own MPs were not just unhappy but furious with it. First, she wanted everyone to live entirely in the present. Well, between now and November next year. It seemed to work for her. Here was the deal. Everything would continue as is till November 2026. After that, anyone who becomes disabled would have to look after themselves. It would teach people to be more responsible. To think harder before they went down with life-changing illnesses or injuries.I can’t say fairer than that, said Liz. People get stuck on legacy benefits the whole time. A two-tier benefits system was the norm. Nothing to see here. You win some, you lose some. It was time to treat personal independence payments on a first come, first served basis. But look, Liz continued, I’m a listening kind of woman. And I’m listening now. Only she didn’t appear to be hearing the murmurs of discontent coming from the benches behind her. She was in a world of her own. She will go to her grave swearing she has always been one of the good guys.Listening also involved announcing a review of Pips in consultation with various disability charities. Only this review was going to have a novel twist. It wasn’t actually going to listen to anyone or accept any recommendations because the changes to Pip were going to come into force regardless, well ahead of any report that nice Mr Timms, a junior minister in the department, might publish. Sorry but not sorry. Liz knew she was right and that was all there was to it. But people with disabilities would feel they had been included. Which was nice.Liz took off her glasses as she neared the end. To show she meant business. There would be an extra £300m of real money for employment support. Not pretend money. Money that has already been announced. It would all cost £2.5bn and she hadn’t a clue how it was going to be funded. But that was the chancellor’s problem, not hers. It was she that had made her do this. It wasn’t easy, she said. Something of an understatement. Her own MPs were twitching, desperate to have their say.First we had to sit through the reply of Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary. She had plenty to say about how she thought the welfare bill might be cut – stop paying out for less serious mental health disorders – but nothing on why previous Tory governments had failed to make any of the necessary reforms. You could almost feel Helen dying a little as she sank into her own irrelevance. Kendall merely observed it was all the Tories’ fault and that they had caused the two-tier system. The very two-tier system she had only just defended. Liz does need to stop living entirely in the present. It’s playing havoc with her memory.During the next 90 minutes or so, the only person defending the reforms was Liz. Not even one Labour MP came to her rescue. The closest we got was the odd damning with faint praise. Thank you for making some concessions, but do you think you could go away and come back with something a little better? We’re all for reform. Just not at the expense of the most vulnerable.Debbie Abrahams expressed concerns that the review would be pointless as the reforms were going ahead anyway. Liz praised her insight. That was precisely the point of the review. Never start a review before you know what the conclusions are going to be. Rachael Maskell said she hadn’t come in to politics topush 150,000 into poverty. Liz shrugged. You win some, you lose some.The chorus of disapproval got even louder. Vicky Foxcroft was also dismissive of the review. Andy McDonald asked for the bill to be pulled. Florence Eshalomi wanted to make sure carers would be protected. They would, said Liz. But only up till November next year. After that carers should stop enabling newly disabled people by refusing to look after them.Come the end, Kendall looked out on her feet. Even her righteous certainty seemed to have taken a small dent. But we’d all be back again on Tuesday for the second reading. Liz would have to suck it all up again. And hope that the whips had done their job in keeping the number of rebels as low as possible. This hadn’t quite been a humiliation. But losing the vote would be.Explore more on these topicsLiz KendallThe politics sketchLabourWelfareBenefitsDisabilityKeir StarmerHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

The Jurassic World film series had looked to be pretty much extinct after some increasingly dire dollops of franchise content:Fallen Kingdom in 2018andDominion in 2022. But now, against all odds, these dinosaurs have had a brand refresh: a brighter, breezier, funnier, incomparably better acted and better written film, with unashamed nods to the summer smashes of yesteryear, that makes sense of the dino-spectacle moments that earn their place.Screenwriter David Koepp and director Gareth Edwards have been drafted in to take us back to basics with a new story, all butretconningthe drama with a “17 years previously” flashback at the start that entirely (and thankfully) ignores the tiresome convoluted dullness of what has recently happened. Then we’re in the present day, when the existence of dinosaurs in the wild is accepted but they’ve all pretty much died out – except in and around the lush fictional Île Saint Hubert in the Caribbean.A creepy corporation (is there any other kind?) has discovered that dinosaur blood has the makings of a profitable medicine, so odious big pharma smoothie Martin Krebs, played by Rupert Friend, assembles a crack special forces team to take a blood sample from each of three types of dinosaur – land, sea and air. Zora Bennett, played byScarlett Johansson, is the ex-military type running the show; bespectacled palaeontologist Dr Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) provides the scientific expertise; and Mahershala Ali brings megawatt charm to the role of Duncan Kincaid, the easy-going boat captain. They and the rest of the crew chance across a family at sea. The dad, Reuben Delgado, is played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and this group have a kind of separate, parallel adventure, providing the conventional family-bond narrative beats.We get all the traditional moments, including some classic Jurassic slow turns: a cast member will be doing something, hear a dinosaur behind (which we can see) and then, aghast, will execute a slow swivel, after which we cut to a hilarious closeup on their suitably gobsmacked expression. We also get a classic Jurassic security guy (played by Ed Skrein), like a Star Trek redshirt, whose job is arrogantly shooting at dinosaurs and who meets an obvious comeuppance.There is some terrific romcom chemistry between Johansson and Bailey. Johansson’s Zora seems to have a tendresse for this shy intellectual – a bit like the crush her character Natasha Romanoff had on Mark Ruffalo’s cerebral Dr Bruce Banner in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It’s a very different performance from the one Bailey gave in Wicked, but just as in that film, he comes close to pinching this one with his adorable high-mindedness. His Dr Loomis wants to die in a shallow sea and get covered by silt, apparently, because it’s better for creating fossils. And he has an interesting line about how intelligence as a factor in survival is overrated; the dumb dinosaurs were around for 165m years and smart humans so far only 300,000.This new Jurassic adventure isn’t doing anything so very different from the earlier successful models, perhaps, and I could have done without its outrageous brand synergy product placement for certain brands of chocolate bar. But it feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs. Maybe the series can’t and shouldn’t go on for ever: we need new and original ideas. This one would be great to go out on.Jurassic WorldRebirth is out on 2 July in the US and UK, and on 3 July in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsJurassic WorldScarlett JohanssonMahershala AliJonathan BaileyreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are some suggestions that you should save 10% or 15% of your salary for retirement, but if I feel like I have a little bit extra I’ll put in 20%.

I love to cook, and I like buying the pricier grass-fed milk or small-farm eggs for $12 a dozen. As someone who works in food production, it’s worth it for me to know exactly what’s in my food.Medical/healthcare: about $309 (£230)$100 for upcoming medical procedure [not included in medical healthcare]$530 for six months of medical testing, so about $89$120 for supplements such as painkillers, vitamins, collagen powder and protein powderSubscriptions:$15 (£12) for Spotify which is my only subscriptionFitness: $40 for gym membership (£30)Cosmetic care: about $175 (£130)I don’t wear makeup but I use a ton of moisturizer due to eczema and dry skin. I guess skincare is where I “splurge”, but for me it’s worth it.Clothes: annual spend is around $500 so about $42 a month (£31)Sometimes I go months without buying anything and other times I spend $200 in one day. In May, I spent $4 for a bra at Goodwill and $62 to get two dresses tailored. I mostly buy clothes secondhand or vintage, but I’ll splurge on a new pair of jeans, because the sizing is so particular.Eating out:about $250 (£185)I’ve almost completely stopped getting takeout for myself. I only save it for social events. Although I will treat myself to a coffee once or twice a month. Most of the money I spend on meals outside the house is for my friends’ birthday dinners.View image in fullscreenVery few of my friends save as much as I do, although one of my closest friends gets to save 60% of his income through living at home. If I wanted to save more, the first thing I would cut out is probably eating out and social drinking. After that, I would swap some of my bougie food choices with alternatives from Aldi.Monthly total:about$4,139 (£3,054)Jake, 28, Seattle, WashingtonOccupation:customer service adviser for a campervan rental companySalary:about $700 a week so $2,800 monthly and $33,600 annually (£24,792)My income is only temporary as my job is seasonal. Prior to last month, I was barely making $1,000 a month. I finished my postgraduate degree last year and spent six months applying for jobs before graduating. It still took nearly two years before I landed my current job. My wife works as a barista and her salary is similar to mine – I just created a shared bank account for us so all our expenses come out of it.When it comes to saving, we put away money for emergency expenses like car breakdowns or vet bills. I don’t believe in having a lot of money just sitting there in a savings account. Anything I do save I plan to put in safe investments but I’m pretty pessimistic about the stock market right now. We would love to build our own small home on vacant land since housing is so unaffordable, but that’s a major long-term goal.Rent:monthly spend for my wife and me is $1,700, so alone it’s about $850 (£628)Utilities:$78 so about $39 (£29)$45 for phone$25 for internet$8 for renters’ insuranceTravel:$575 so about $288 (£213)$150 for gas$250 for car insurance$100 for car repairs$75 for public transportFood and household:$285 so about $143 (£106)$250 for food$25 for bathroom supplies$10 for household suppliesDog bills:$216 so about $108 (£80)$111 for insurance$105 for foodFitness: $17 (£13)Subscriptions:$40 so about $20 (£15)$20 for Spotify$12 for Hulu$8 for Apple arcadeEating out:$100 so about $50 (£37)Monthly total:about$1,515 (£1,121)Mark, 26, Raleigh, North CarolinaOccupation:data scientist for a bankSalary:$72,000 (£53,1325)I paid off my student debt about two years ago and started saving straight after I finished my undergraduate degree. I have high variable entertainment and travel costs as my significant other lives in the UK. My at-home entertainment costs are pretty low. I have no streaming services and if I do spend money, it’s mostly on going out with friends, soccer leagues and seeing movies.Rent and utilities:about $1,850 (£1,366)About $1,825 for rent$25 for phoneRenting is insanely expensive. My aim is to save enough for a down payment on a house and even though I make a pretty good salary, I am still nowhere near able to afford one in an area where I want to live.Travel:$160 (£119)$60 for gas$600 for six months of car insurance, so about $100This month it was $1,200 as I took a road trip and needed to buy new tires.Groceries:about $300 (£222)I’m at home two to three times a week so I tend to cook and bring any leftovers I have into the office.Dog bills:about $50 (£37)$10 for foodAbout $40 for medicine and vet billsFitness: annual spend is around $300 so about $25 a month (£19)I run, play soccer, or use the gym in my apartment block. Equipment like running shoes, football boots and league fees are the only costs and they’re pretty infrequent.Cosmetic care:about $4 (£3)I don’t really spend much on skincare or cosmetics but when I do, it definitely averages out to less than $5 a month.Clothes:I mostly thrift so spend only about $20 a month (£15)Eating out:about $100 (£74)I eat out only two or three times a week – nothing fancy. This can be higher when I’m traveling, which is fairly often.Miscellaneous:about $267 on average for four return flights a year to the UK (£197)I try to visit my partner in London every couple of months. Round-trip flights are around $800 and we spend a bit more on dates, eating out and entertainment while there, but I do have a place to stay when visiting so there are no big lodging costs.Among my friends my expenses are pretty average but it depends on where they live as my friends who live in Washington DC spend way more. Nationwide I’m definitely in the higher-earning, higher-spending category though.Monthly total:about$2,776 (£2,049)View image in fullscreenAnna, 22, WashingtonOccupation: part-time teacher and writerSalary: about $700 a month and $8,400 annually (£6,198)I’m self-employed and still live at home with my family so don’t have any rent or utility expenses. I’m also still on the family’s health insurance. I do not actively budget my money in terms of allocating a specific percentage for different expenses. Rather, I keep a record of my income and expenses and I adjust my spending as necessary.For me, non-essential spending is money spent on things that I can technically live without and be content, such as a special TV/streaming subscriptions, new clothes, decoration for my room, books, CDs/digital music, hobby-related goods, or “fun” purchases, like an antique.Splurges just come at random times for me. Sometimes it’s because I find something really special that I want to purchase, other times it’s because I find something that is the only one of its kind left for sale. My passions are music and history, so it’s usually one of those two things I’m spending money on. For instance, I splurged once on buying antique newspapers from the first few weeks of the second world war. Another time, I splurged on buying an antique first (and only) edition of an old English book by Jane Porter. I will also sometimes give to charities (mostly overseas) that I appreciate – more so lately.Food:$140 (£104) as I don’t eat out much at all.Savings:$455 (£336)I’m young and because of my lifestyle I don’t have certain expenses that I will probably have in a few years (like a car, gas, auto insurance etc.) so I save most of my money.Miscellaneous:about $95 (£71) for TV subscriptions and work-related software costs.Monthly total:about$690 (£510)All names have been changedExplore more on these topicsMoneyBudgetFoodFitnessCost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What does that say about human relationships?Adrienne MateiMon 30 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 13.54 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Raven Jiang/The GuardianEarlier this spring, Nik Vassev heard a high school friend’s mother had died. Vassev, a 32-year-old tech entrepreneur in Vancouver, Canada, opened up Claude AI, Anthropic’sartificial intelligencechatbot.“My friend’s mom passed away and I’m trying to find the right way to be there for him and send him a message of support like a good friend,” he typed.Vassev mostly uses AI to answer work emails, but also for personal communications. “I just wanted to just get a second opinion about how to approach that situation,” he says. “As guys, sometimes we have trouble expressing our emotions.”Claude helped Vassev craft a note: “Hey man, I’m so sorry for your loss. Sending you and your family lots of love and support during this difficult time. I’m here for you if you need anything …” it read.Thanks to the message, Vassev’s friend opened up about their grief. But Vassev never revealed that AI was involved. People “devalue” writing that is AI-assisted, he acknowledges. “It can rub people the wrong way.”Is it true that I ‘don’t get angry’? Or am I actually dangerously suppressing it?Read moreVassev learned this lesson because a friend once called him out for relying heavily on AI during an argument: “Nik, I want to hear your voice, not whatChatGPThas to say.” That experience left Vassev chastened. Since then, he’s been trying to be more sparing and subtle, “thinking for myself and having AI assist”, he says.Since late 2022, AI adoption has exploded in professional contexts, where it’s used as aproductivity-boostingtool, and amongstudents,who increasinglyuse chatbots to cheat.Yet AI is becoming the invisible infrastructure of personal communications, too – punching uptext messages, birthday cards andobituaries, even though we associate such compositions with “from the heart” authenticity.Disclosing the role of AI could defeat the purpose of these writings, which is to build trust and express care. Nonetheless, one person anonymously told me that he used ChatGPT while writing his father of the bride speech; another wished OpenAI had been around when he had written his vows because it would have “saved [him] a lot of time”. Online, a Redditorshared that they usedChatGPT to write their mom’s birthday card: “She not only cried, she keeps it on her side table and reads [it] over and over, every day since I gave it to her,” they wrote. “I can never tell her.”View image in fullscreenOne person anonymously said that he used ChatGPT while writing his father of the bride speech.Illustration: Raven Jiang/The GuardianResearch about transparency and AI use mostly focuses onprofessionalsettings, where40%of US workers use the tools. However, a recentstudyfrom the University of Arizona concluded that “AI disclosure can harm social perceptions” of the disclosers at work, and similar findings apply to personal relationships.In one2023 study, 208 adults received a “thoughtful” note from a friend; those who were told the note was written with AI felt less satisfied and “more uncertain about where they stand” with the friend,according toBingjie Liu, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of communication at Ohio State University.On subreddits such asr/AmIOverreactingor r/Relationship_advice, it’s easy to find users expressing distress upon discovering, say, that their husband used ChatGPT towrite their wedding vows. (“To me, these words are some of the most important that we will ever say to each other. I feel so sad knowing that they weren’t even his own.”)If I heard that you were sending me an email and making it sound more empathetic than you really were, I wouldn’t let it goDr Vanessa Urch DruskatAI-assisted personal messages can convey that the sender didn’t want to bother with sincerity, says Dr Vanessa Urch Druskat, a social and organizational psychologist and professor specializing in emotional intelligence. “If I heard that you were sending me an email and making it sound more empathetic than you really were, I wouldn’t let it go,” she says.“There’s a baseline expectation that our personal communications are authentic,” says Druskat. “We’re wired to pick up on inauthenticity, disrespect – it feels terrible,” she says.But not everyone draws the same line when it comes to how much AI involvement is tolerable or what constitutes deceit by omission. Curious, I conducted an informal social media poll among my friends: if I used AI to write their whole birthday card, how would they feel? About two-thirds said they would be “upset”; the rest said it would be fine. But if I had used AI only in a supplementary role – say, some editing to hit the right tone – the results were closer to 50-50.View image in fullscreenUsing AI in personal messages is a double gamble: first, that the recipient won’t notice, and second, that they won’t mind.Illustration: Raven Jiang/The GuardianUsing AI in personal messages is a double gamble: first, that the recipient won’t notice, and second, that they won’t mind. Still, there are arguments for why taking the risk is worthwhile, and why ahint of AI in aHinge messagemight not be so bad. For instance, AI can be helpful for bridgingcommunication gapsrooted in cultural, linguistic or other forms of diversity.Plus, personal messages have never been totally spontaneous and original. People routinely seek advice from friends, therapists orstrangersabout disagreements, delicate conversations or important notes. Greeting cards have long come with pre-written sentiments (although Mother’s Day founder Anna Jarvis oncescoldedthat printed cards were “lazy”).Sara Jane Ho, an etiquette expert, says she has used ChatGPT “in situations where I’ve been like: ‘Change this copy to make it more heartfelt.’ And it’s great copy.”Ho argues that using ChatGPT to craft a personal message actually shows “a level of consideration”.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Expressing sensitivity helps build relationships, and it makes sense that people who struggle with words would appreciate assistance. Calculators are standard digital tools; why not chatbots? “I always say that the spirit of etiquette is about putting others at ease,” she says. “If the end result is something that is nice for the other person and that shows respect or consideration or care, then they don’t need to see how the sausage is made.”I asked Ho what she would say to a person upset by an AI-assisted note. “I’d ask them: ‘Why are you so easily offended?’” Ho says.Plus, she says using AI is convenient and fast. “Why would you make yourself walk someplace if you have a car?” she asks.Increasingly, people are drifting through digitized lives that reject “the very notion that engagement should require effort”, at perceiving less value in character building and experiences like “working hard” and “learning well”, author and educator Kyla Scanlonargued in an essaylast month. This bias toward effortlessness characterizes the emotional work of relationships as burdensome, even though it helps create intimacy.“People have sort of conditioned themselves to want a completely seamless and frictionless experience in their everyday lives 100% of the time,” says Josh Lora, a writer and sociologist who has writtenabout AI and loneliness. “There are people who Uber everywhere, who Seamless everything, who Amazon everything, and render their lives completely smooth.”Amid thisconvenience-maxxing, AI figures as an efficient way out of relational labor, or small mistakes, tensions and inadequacies in communication, says Lora.Can an AI friend make you less lonely?Read moreWe use language to be understood or co-create a sense of self. “So much of our experience as people is rendered in the struggle to make meaning, to self actualize, to explain yourself to another person,” Lora says.But when we outsource that labor to a chatbot, we lose out on developing self-expression, nuanced social skills, and emotional intelligence. We also lose out on the feelings of interpersonal gratitude that arise from taking the time to write kindly to our loved ones, as one2023 studyfrom the University of California, Riverside, found.Many people already approach life as a series of objectives: get good grades, get a job, earn money, get married. In that mindset, a relationship can feel like something to manage effectively rather than a space of mutual recognition. What happens if itstops feeling worth the effort?Summer (who requested a pseudonym for privacy), a 30-year-old university tutor, said she became best friends with Natasha (also a pseudonym) while pursuing their respective doctoral degrees. They lived four hours apart, and much of their relationship unfolded in long text message exchanges, debating ideas or analyzing people they knew.If the end result is something that is nice for the other person ... then they don’t need to see how the sausage is madeSara Jane Ho, etiquette expertAbout a year ago, Natasha began to use ChatGPT to help with work tasks. Summer said she quickly seemed deeply enamoured with AI’s speed and fluency. (Researchers have warned the technology can beaddictive, to the detriment of human social engagement.) Soon, subtle tone and content changes led Summer to suspect Natasha was using AI in their personal messages. (Natasha did not respond to a request for comment.)After six years of lively intellectual curiosity, their communication dwindled. Occasionally, Natasha asked Summer for her opinion on something, then disappeared for days. Summer felt likeshewas the third party to a deep conversation happening between her best friend and a machine. “I’d engage with her as a friend, a whole human being, and she’d engage with me as an obstacle to this meaning-making machine of hers,” Summer tells me.Summer finally called Natasha to discuss how AI use was affecting their friendship. She felt Natasha was exchanging the messy imperfections of rambling debate for an emotionally bankrupt facsimile of ultra-efficient communication. Natasha didn’t deny using chatbots, and “seemed to always have a reason” for continuing despite Summer’s moral and intellectual qualms.View image in fullscreen‘AI is unable to give meaning to something because it’s outside of the semantics produced by human beings,’ says philosopher Dr Mathieu Corteel.Illustration: Raven Jiang/The GuardianSummer “felt betrayed” that a close friend had used AI as “an auxiliary” to talk to her. “She couldn’t find the inherent meaning in us having an exchange as people,” she says. To her, adding AI into relationships “presupposes inadequacy” in them, and offers a sterile alternative: always saying the right thing, back and forth, frictionless forever.The two women are no longer friends.“What you’re giving away when you engage in too much convenience is your humanity, and it’s creepy to me,” Summer says.Dr Mathieu Corteel is a philosopher and author of a book grappling with the implications of AI (only availablein French) as a game we have all entered without “knowing the rules”.Corteel is not anti-AI, but believes that overreliance on it alienates us from our own judgment, and by extension, humanity – “which is why I consider it as one of the most important philosophical problems we are facing right now”, he says.If a couple, for example, expressed love through AI-generated poems, they would be skipping crucial steps of meaning-making to create “a combination of symbols” absent of meaning, he says. You can interpret meaning retrospectively, reading intent into an AI’s output, “but that’s just an effect”, he says.What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it?Read more“AI is unable to give meaning to something because it’s outside of the semantics produced by human beings, by human culture, by human interrelation, the social world,” says Corteel.If AI can churn out convincingly heartfelt words, perhaps even our most intimate expressions have always been less special than we had hoped. Or, as the tech theorist Bogna Koniorrecently wrote: “What chatbots ultimately teach us is that language ain’t all that.”Corteel agrees that language is inherently flawed; we can never fully express our feelings, only try. But that gap between feeling and expression is where love and meaning live. The very act of striving to shrink that distance helps define those thoughts and feelings. AI, by contrast, offers a slick way to bypass that effort. Without the time it takes to reflect on our relationships, the struggle to find words, the practice of communicating, what are we exchanging?“We want to finish quickly with everything,” says Corteel. “We want to just write a prompt and have it done. And there’s something that we are losing – it’s the process. And in the process, there’s many important aspects. It is the co-construction of ourselves with our activities,” he says. “We are forgetting the importance of the exercise.”"

Including MPs from other parties, the amendment has 62 backers.How the welfare bill went wrong – Politics Weekly WestminsterRead moreRachael Maskell, one of the most vocal critics of the welfare plans, said more were expected to add their names to the amendment, though 83 Labour MPs would be needed to defeat the government majority. The amendment raises new concerns about the changes and has been backed by 138 disability groups.“It was falling apart in the Commons today because MPs were exposing so many holes in the government’s plans,” Maskell told the Guardian. “The faces of MPs said it all. The [upcoming] Timms review shows even more inconsistency on sequencing.“The prime ministertalked about ‘noises off’but what we’re doing is raising the voices of disabled people. It was them he was treating with contempt.”The number of Labour signatories to the new amendment suggests that, unless significantly more join them, the government may have managed to curtail the rebellion sufficiently to get it through its first parliamentary hurdle.View image in fullscreenThe amendment has been backed by 138 disability groups as protests have continued this week.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianMore than 120 MPs had initially threatened to rebel on the legislation by signing an amendment tabled by Hillier. But last week the government offered significant concessions, including that current claimants would not be affected by the cuts and offering a review into disability benefits led by the minister Stephen Timms, co-produced with disabled people.Dear PM, thanks for the welfare concessions, but I still won’t vote for your bill. Scrap the whole thing | Richard BurgonRead moreWhips had initially believed the rebellion would now be contained to about 50 MPs. But dozens of MPs expressed alarm on Monday that the promised Timms review had a “pre-determined” outcome and would only report after the new, tougher system kicked in.One party source said in frustration: “This is like the Brexit rebellions – they don’t know when to take yes for an answer.”On Monday night, whips were frantically trying to shore up support on the Labour benches, including among those who had negotiated the tweaks last week. Officials said they were not ruling out further changes ahead of the crunch vote on Tuesday. The Conservatives have confirmed they will vote against the bill.The backlash comes as new impact assessment has found that 150,000 people could still be pushed into poverty by Downing Street’s welfare measures, despite the change to protect those already on the benefits.On Monday, 86 disability and human rights groups put out a joint statement urging MPs to vote down the bill despite the protections for existing claimants, including Scope, Mind, the Trussell Trust, Sense, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Oxfam.The Guardian understands Kendall had been examining whether to make an offer that new claimants denied under the amended system from November 2026 could have their case re-examined after the outcome of the review. However, that has since been abandoned.The Timms review was another key concession extracted by the rebels but the MPs who negotiated with the government last week said they believed it was not being properly fulfilled.Abrahams, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, said it was impossibly constrained and said she would vote against the bill on that basis.The timing of the review is a key cause for concern. It will report in autumn 2026 – the same time as the Pip changes are scheduled to take effect – which MPs said risked a “three-tier” system, including those new claimants assessed pre- and post-Timms review.Ministers are understood to have stressed to MPs that the review could report sooner – but the timing was in the hands of the disability groups involved in the review in order for it to be a genuine co-production.A number of key rebels – including the Treasury select committee chair Hillier – had initially been won over by promises to exempt current disability claimants from the changes and to increase the health element of universal credit in line with inflation.But speaking in the chamber, Hillier also expressed concerns about the review – a key ask of the Labour rebels. A number of other MPs who had signed an amendment opposing the bill also said they remained concerned, including Vicky Foxcroft, Yuan Yang, Derek Twigg, Maskell and Chi Onwurah.View image in fullscreenMarie Tidball, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said she could still not support the plans.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianMarie Tidball, one of the few disabled MPs in parliament, said she could still not support the plans. “Having no public consultation on these plans excludes the voices of disabled people,” she said.Speaking in the chamber, Abrahams said the review could not be truly co-produced with disabled people if it had a predetermined outcome. “If this is being truly co-produced with disabled people in their organisations, the review should determine both the new process, the new points and the new descriptors, and we shouldn’t predetermine it at four points,” she said.In response, Kendall said the government was committed to a review but added: “The four-point minimum will be in place for new claimants as we look to make changes for the future.”No 10 said the measures were still essential to change the system and to prevent the welfare bill from escalating – though the changes promised last week will cost the Treasury an extra £3bn.In the impact assessment written after the changes, officials said there would now be a “negligible” impact on child poverty, which had been one of the key concerns in the original measures.But it found that an additional 150,000 people could be pushed into relative poverty by 2030 because of changes that would affect future claimants. The original cuts would have pushed an additional 250,000 into poverty.Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said the poverty modelling was “subject to uncertainty” and would not take into account the extra investment in health and social care.The spokesperson added that the government was confident the measures affecting future claimants were legal. “It’s not unusual for systems to operate at different levels, but yes, we’re entirely confident it will be legal,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWelfareKeir StarmerLabourBenefitsDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

It has benefited from the huge growth in the industry, demanding hefty option fees from renewable energy developers to secure areas of the seabed to build their windfarms.The monarchy receives 12% of crown estate profits to fund its work, as well as the 10-year £369m renovation of Buckingham Palace. This fee was lowered from 25% in 2023 to offset the rise in profits from offshore wind projects.According to the new calculation, King Charles is poised to receive official income of £132m from the estate,at the same level as last year. The grant had remained flat at £86.3m for the four years prior.Dan Labbad, the chief executive of the crown estate, said the increase in profits in the past two years was a “short-term” phenomenon. “We expect this year to be the high point of these returns … before profits normalise,” he said.Michael Stevens, the king’s Keeper of the Privy Purse, said last year the expected significant increase in the sovereign grant would be used to fund the final stages of the renovation of Buckingham Palace. Once this is accomplished, he said “a reduction in the absolute amount of the sovereign grant will be sought as part of the royal trustees review in 2026-27, through primary legislation”, to ensure that the work of the royal family “continues to be funded at an appropriate level”.Overall the crown estate, which also includes a portfolio ofLondonproperties and rural real estate, is now worth £15bn, down from £15.5bn last year. The valuation for the marine part of the business dropped by £1bn this year to £3.4bn.The property assets in London were valued at £7.1bn, compared with £6.9bn the year before. Much of its portfolio in the capital is concentrated around Regent Street and St James’s, and includes Victory House, home to London’s oldest Indian restaurant, Veeraswamy.The crown estate also said it was redeveloping about 93,000 sq metres (1m sq ft) of commercial space in London as part of a £490m pipeline, via a partnership with Westminster city council to transform Regent Street, Haymarket and Piccadilly Circus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By Monday evening, the fire service said it was still tackling several wildfire incidents in the area.At 8.40pm on Monday, the fire service urged residents in the vicinity of the fire to “ensure their windows and doors are closed to prevent smoke from entering”.It said: “Our firefighters continue to work tirelessly to tackle several wildfire incidents from Carrbridge in Highland to Dallas, outside Forres in Moray.“A significant number of resources and special resources have been mobilised throughout the area.”A flood alert wasissuedfor some of the affected areas by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which said: “Minor flooding impacts and disruption to travel is possible if the heaviest rain falls in vulnerable areas.”The SGA said that a “round-the-clock effort” from gamekeepers and land managers, working with the fire service, helped prevent two fires from merging into one larger blaze – a move that would have been a “nightmare scenario”.Scottish first minister John Swinney said on X: “The wildfires that are taking place are extremely serious. Please follow all of the advice available. Grateful to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service⁦⁩ and local people for their efforts to get the fires under control.Fergus Ewing, the MSP for Inverness and Nairn constituency, said the wildfires “raging” across the area were “said by many locals to be the worst in our history”.He added that he had already urged the Scottish government to convene its emergency response committee – the Scottish government resilience room, known as SGORR.The SGA called on the Scottish government’s nature advisers at NatureScot to visit the sites of these blazes to see first-hand their impact and the efforts required to tackle them.Speaking about the blazes, an SGA spokesperson said: “This is becoming a danger to human life because firefighters are becoming so stretched dealing with wildfires that they don’t have the resources to attend other fires.”They insisted: “We need to have the Scottish government and their advisers out now to see what is happening, while these fires are ongoing.”One witness, who tried to put the initial fire out,toldBBC Scotland News that the seat of the wildfire was a ring of stones where a camp fire had been lit and camping chairs had been abandoned.Dræyk van der Hørn, a Scottish Greens councillor for Moray, photographed the wildfires from a summit in the Cairngorms earlier on Monday.He said: “Wildfires in Scotland were once a rarity. Not any more.“Hotter, drier springs and summers – driven by the accelerating climate crisis – are turning our landscapes into tinderboxes.“Fires are now more frequent, more intense and more destructive. This is not a distant warning.“Climate change is here, and Moray, andScotlandare on the frontline.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

I really want to see myself in that [list] of champions. I really want to put myself like a champion that always finds a way to win.“I’ve been playing really, really tough matches the last year, the last year in this tournament. Just really proud that I always find a way. Today I did it, even though Fabio was playing great tennis. Just really proud to overcome the problem, to overcome the tough moments.”Grand slam titles cannot be won on the first day of competition, but they can always be lost. So far in his career. Alcaraz has been brilliant at ensuring that he at least gives himself a chance in every tournament. With this victory, Alcaraz maintains his perfect record of 18 wins and no defeats in the first round of grand slam tournaments. He also has 14 wins and only one defeat in five-set matches.At 38, Fognini has been a fixture on the tour for much of the past two decades, with a career‑high ranking of No 9 and several monumental wins. This year, however, marks his final season on the tour and simple victories have been difficult to come by. He has lost all six of his ATP main draw matches this year, losing against multiple players ranked outside the top 350. Across the net, Alcaraz is the most in-form player in the sport after establishing an 18-match winning sequence, including titles at the French Open and Queen’s Club. On paper, this match was not supposed to be close.Despite struggling with his serve early on, Alcaraz appeared to be moving confidently towards victory as he established a 7-5, 4-2 lead. But then, not for the first time, his concentration faltered. He played a dire service game to relinquish the break, and followed up with an error‑strewn start to the third‑set tie‑break. He soon found himself at one-set all and down a break at 2-3 in the third set.View image in fullscreenSpain’s Carlos Alcaraz stretches for a backhand return.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It doesn’t matter that the winning streak that I have right now, that I’ve been playing great on grass, that I have been preparing really well the week before – Wimbledon is different,” Alcaraz said. “I could feel today that I was really nervous at the beginning. Being the first match on Centre Court, it’s a huge privilege for me. Even though I played the first match last year, it feels [like] the first time. I just try to deal with the nerves the best way possible.”Although Fognini has lost much of his speed in his later years, quality shotmaking remains and the lofty occasion inspired the best of his ball‑striking talents. His forehand was precise and lethal, lasering winners from all parts of the court, he continually closed down the net, volleying spectacularly, and he often matched Alcaraz’s supreme variety of shot with his own deft hand skills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the match dragged on, and the pair headed for a decider, the world No 2 cut an increasingly distressed figure, repeatedly unloading his frustration on his player box. In the heat, Alcaraz walked gingerly between points. Early in the final set, play was halted after a fan was struggling with the heat, which prompted Alcaraz to sprint over with a bottle of water. “Obviously playing with such a high heat out there is really difficult to deal with sometimes,” Alcaraz said. “Even tougher when you’re playing long matches, long rallies.”In the middle of some of the most intense months of his young career, which have pushed him to his physical and mental limit, a few efficient, relatively stress-free wins would not hurt Alcaraz.Although such straightforward matches have evaded him, he continues to show his ability to produce his best tennis when most needed. One set away from a catastrophic first-round defeat, he pulled himself together and closed out an important victory that keeps alive his dream of a Wimbledon hat-trick.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazWimbledonTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A US official said Netanyahu would travel to the US on 7 July to meet Donald Trump.The new “evacuation orders”warned of impending assaultsaround densely populated Gaza City and told Palestinians to head south to overcrowded coastal zones, where there are few facilities and limited water. About 80% of Gaza is now covered by such orders or controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).The orders also said that the IDF planned to advance into the centre ofGazaCity to fight Hamas militants based there.On Monday, Israeli tanks and infantry pushed into the Zeitoun neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Gaza City and shelled several areas in the north, while aircraft bombed at least four schools after ordering hundreds of families sheltering inside to leave, residents said.“Explosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes,” said Salah, 60, from Gaza City. “In the news we hear a ceasefire is near; on the ground we see death and we hear explosions.”In the afternoon, an airstrike hit a crowded cafe on the shore in Gaza City, killing at least 22 people, including women, children and a local journalist.The IDF said it struck militant targets in northern Gaza, including command and control centres, after taking steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.Analysts have detected changes in the rhetoric of senior Israeli officials in recent days, which may suggest a new ceasefire is now being considered.Throughout the conflict, Israeli attacks have intensified at significant moments in negotiations. Israeli officials have said one aim of Israel’s latest offensive, which was launched in May after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire in March, was to seize territory that could later be given up during talks as a “bargaining chip”.‘Post-apocalyptic’: medical staff struggle as gangs fight over aid supplies in GazaRead moreOn Friday, Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, said the offensive was close to having achieved its goals. Netanyahu has also reinforced his political position within Israel and so is better placed to ignore threats by rightwing coalition allies to withdraw support in the event of a deal with Hamas.A deal remains difficult though, officials close to the negotiations said, with both Israel and Hamas sticking to previous incompatible positions.Hamas is demanding that Israel agrees to a definitive end to the war and is refusing to disarm. Israel refuses Hamas demands to withdraw entirely from Gaza and says it will end its campaign only when the militant organisation has given up its weapons and its leaders have agreed to leave the territory.Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader, on Monday added his voice to those in Israel calling for an end to the war in Gaza.“There is no longer any benefit for the state of Israel from continuing the war in Gaza. Only damage on the security, political and economic level,” Lapid told a meeting of parliamentarians. “The army has no more objectives in Gaza.”A public opinion poll published the day after Tuesday’s ceasefire with Iran by public broadcaster Kan showed that nearly two-thirds of respondents wanted the Gaza war to end. The result was in line with dozens of similar polls in recent months. Israel’s military has sufferedsignificant casualtiesthis month, which has added to the public pressure for a deal.Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said on Monday it had received the bodies of 11 people who were shot while returning from an aid site associated with the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Fund in southern Gaza, Ten others were killed at a United Nations aid warehouse in northern Gaza, according to the health ministry.The Israeli militaryacknowledged on Mondaythat Palestinian civilians had been harmed as they sought food from distribution centres in Gaza and other locations, saying that instructions had been issued to forces after “lessons learned”.Food, fuel and other basics are scarce in Gaza, with distributions by the GHF coming nowhere close to meeting the needs of 2.3 million people.Israel says Hamas steals aid to finance military and other operations. The group denies that accusation and aid agencies say their monitoring systems are robust.The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza.Israel’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population and reduced much of the territory to rubble.AFP and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Other factors such as timber rather than concrete sleepers, and the speed of trains, increase the risk of buckling or failure.The speed restrictions imposed west of Paddington through the Thames valley area were likely to mean a 10- to 15-minute delay on most trains, according to a GWR spokesperson.Glastonbury organisers warn of traffic delays leaving site amid 30C temperaturesRead moreThe compounding delays were expected to bring more disruption and cancellations later in the day.Glastonbury returneesmostly avoided further duress: GWR said it had already picked up more than 6,000 festivalgoers from Castle Cary station in Somerset on Monday morning before the speed restrictions started.With temperatures expected to nudge higher, railway managers confirmed the speed restrictions would stay in place until 10pm on Tuesday night.The heat has not reached theextremes of three years ago, when services across England and Wales were disrupted and under speed restrictions amid fears that rails would buckle. Network Rail painted critical sections of the railway white this spring to help reduce the impact of heat. The state-owned company is wrestling with theimpact of the climate crisison more than 20,000 miles of track, thousands of signals, stations and level crossings that it owns and maintains.A spokesperson for Network Rail and the train operators said: “With temperatures set to soar as forecast by the Met Office, speed restrictions have to be imposed across large parts of the network to ensure everyone’s safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson added: “There is absolutely no place in society for hate.”Pascal Robinson-Foster, of the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan, led chants of “Death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, and spoke of working for a “fucking Zionist” during their show on the West Holts stage on Saturday.Why did BBC decide to stream Bob Vylan’s Glastonbury set and what will happen next?Read moreThe Irish rap trio Kneecap followed the group with an incendiary performance that included leading the crowd in chants of “fuck Keir Starmer”.Earlier on Monday theBBC saidit regretted not cutting the live stream of Bob Vylan’s performance, saying it contained “utterly unacceptable” antisemitic sentiments, while the US announced it was revoking visas for the band.TheBBCinitially acknowledged that some of the comments were “deeply offensive”. It said a warning was issued on screen about the “very strong and discriminatory language” at the time.However, the BBC went furtheron Monday, saying it should not have allowed the comments to be broadcast and would look to update its guidance around live events.“Millions of people tuned in to enjoy Glastonbury this weekend across the BBC’s output but one performance within our livestreams included comments that were deeply offensive,” it said. “The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence. The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves.“The team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.”On Monday night, the BBC reported that Tim Davie, the corporation’s director-general, was at the festival and is understood to have said that Bob Vylan’s performance should be taken off BBC iPlayer, after being told about the incident.The comments came after pressure from Starmer, Ofcom and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, who questioned Davie over the weekend about what due diligence had been done in advance of the broadcast. The prime minister’s spokesperson said there was “no excuse for this kind of appalling hate speech, and the BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast”.Meanwhile, the band, who had been due to tour America later this year, have had their US visas revoked. “Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” said Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state.Warren Stephens, the US ambassador to the UK, said the chants were a “disgrace”, adding: “There should be no place for this hateful incitement or tolerance of antisemitism in the UK.”The band appear to have been dropped by the talent agency UTA and their page was no longer active on the agency’s website.In an urgent statement in parliament, Nandy said members of the Jewish community at the festival had said they created “their own safe space” because of the imagery on display.She said she was not satisfied with the explanation she had been given by the BBC so far over the broadcast, and she called on the corporation to “quickly and swiftly” answer a list of specific questions from her officials.“Much of this was foreseeable,” she said, saying basic online research would have shown potential issues with the Bob Vylan broadcast.Writing on Instagram on Sunday, Robinson-Foster said his phone had been “buzzing non-stop, inundated with messages of both support and hatred”.He said: “Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place. As we grow older and our fire starts to possibly dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us.”Kneecap, meanwhile,shared a poston social media on Monday night highlighting the situation in Gaza.Bob Vylan’s performance was not broadcast on linear television but could be watched on Saturday via a livestream on iPlayer. The BBC opted not to broadcast the livestream of the Irish rap artists Kneecap, who appeared later on the same West Holts stage as Bob Vylan.Ofcom said the BBC “clearly has questions to answer” after livestreaming the Bob Vylan footage. “We have been speaking to the BBC over the weekend and we are obtaining further information as a matter of urgency, including what procedures were in place to ensure compliance with its own editorial guidelines,” it said.A BBC spokesperson said: “The director general was informed of the incident after the performance and at that point he was clear it should not feature in any other Glastonbury coverage.”Glastonbury festival hadearlier condemnedthe chants started by Bob Vylan, saying organisers were “appalled by the statements” made on stage.Starmer condemned the band’s performance over the weekend, describing it as “appalling hate speech”. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further, asking police to “urgently investigate and prosecute the BBC” for broadcasting it.UK Screen Industry, a group of concerned TV and film professionals, said: “We reject the BBC’s statement that Bob Vylan’s words were ‘antisemitic’ and an ‘incitement to violence’. Saying ‘Death to the IDF’ is not a literal threat; it is a call for the dismantling of a brutal military apparatus that is committing war crimes and killing civilians.”Avon and Somerset police said: “We have received a large amount of contact in relation to these events from people across the world and recognise the strength of public feeling. We politely ask the public refrain from continuing to report this matter to us because an investigation is already taking place.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025KneecapBBCGlastonbury festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

Meet Mr Right. Get rich. Pinned to a board by the entrance of a dimly lit fortune telling bar in Fengtai, an urban district in the south of Beijing, handwritten notes reveal the inner worries of customers coming for cocktails with a side of spiritual salvation.One As All is one of several fortune telling bars to have opened in Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities in recent years. Hidden on the 12th floor of a commercial building, the bar serves a wide range of drinks starting at an auspicious 88 yuan (£9) (eight is considered to be lucky number in China). As well as enjoying a sundowner with a view over Beijing’s skyline, customers can consult the in-house fortune teller who specialises inqiuqian,known in English as Chinese lottery sticks, an ancient style of divination often found in Taoist temples. From a private side-room, the smell of incense burning in front of a genuine Taoist shrine wafts into the bar.In Thailand, where mysticism thrives, AI fortune telling finds fertile groundRead moreDerrex Deng, a 20-year-old student-cum-savant interprets the lottery sticks for customers. Adorned with jade jewellery, his nails manicured with sparkly black and white cats, Deng is a decidedly Gen Z fortune teller. He first felt a mystical calling when he was three or four years old and started seeing spirits, he says. “Everybody trusted me, because I was so correct in telling them the truth in a direct way”.To divine the future withqiuqian,customers pose a question before pulling a flat wooden stick from an intricately carved cylinder. Each stick is engraved with numerals and texts, which Deng interprets.View image in fullscreenFortune telling sticks, orqiuqian. One consumer trends analyst puts their renewed popularity down to a growing sense of cultural confidence.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianHis divination skills are as Gen Z as his fashion sense. Interpreting a stick drawn in response to a question about how to improve communications with an overseas relative, he suggests using more emojis in text messages.Economic worries fuel interest in fortune tellingWorries aboutrelationships and jobsare hardly unique to China. But as the country grapples withslowing economic growth, many young people are feeling particularlyanxious about the future. So some are turning toxuanxue,or mysticism. Cece, an astrology app backed by Tencent, has been downloaded more than 100m times. The trend has been dubbed the “spiritual economy”.“The most obvious sign of economic downturn is that, a few years ago, it felt like hardly anyone believed in metaphysics or fortune telling. But in the past two years,such beliefs have clearly become more common,” wrote one Weibo user.“Drinking and so-called mysticism have something in common, especially in the current environment, when everyone is under a lot of pressure,” says Ma Xu, 33, co-owner of One As All, which opened in April last year. “They both give people an outlet for their emotions or a way to vent.” As a Taoist believer himself, Ma also wanted to accrue good karma for the afterlife by opening a bar that could lift people’s spirits.An economic downturn might seem like an odd time to open a bar. But Ma disagrees. “Now the economy is going down, people can’t buy expensive things, such as travelling abroad. But they can come and drink a glass of wine and chat all night.” Plus, he says, as a Taoist he’s not focused on making a lot of money.“Before we used to go to temples to doqiuqian,” says Dong Boya, 29, who works in public relations. “But this combination of drawing sticks and having a drink is interesting.”View image in fullscreenOne As All bar in Beijing. Co-owner Ma Xu said part of his reason for opening the bar was to lift people’s spirits and accrue good karma for the afterlife.Photograph: Provided by One As All barDong and her friends have come to One As All armed with questions about how to find love and get rich. Neither is easy in Beijing, they say. “The way to make money fast is by breaking the law. The best ways are already written in the criminal law. Or you need to know someone,” jokes Hu Jiahui, 30, who works in artificial intelligence.Qiuqianis one of several types of Chinese fortune telling to be enjoying a resurgence among young city-dwellers. While there is some interest in western-style divination such as tarot, it lacks the cultural resonance of Chinese traditions.“Tarot comes from overseas, so I treat it with some suspicion,” says Ning Ning, 37. She prefers Taoist or Buddhist fortune telling.Mysticism – a delicate place in Chinese societyYaling Jiang, a consumer trends analyst, says the interest in Chinese-style fortune telling can be connected to a rising sense of cultural confidence. In recent months, several Chinese brands or products have gone global, fromLabubustoDeepSeek.Ne Zha 2, an animated film based on ancient mythology, broke worldwide records for its takings in the Chinese box office “The young audience is starting to connect to traditional Chinese culture,” says Jiang.View image in fullscreenWishes on the wall of One As All bar. ‘Drinking and so-called mysticism have something in common,’ says co-owner Ma Xu.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianBut mysticism occupies a sensitive place in Chinese society. The Communist party is officially atheist and has repeatedly cracked down on what it describes as superstitious beliefs. Last year, state media reported that nearly 300 people had been “criminally dealt with” since 2018 for activities relating to spiritualism, with individuals sentenced to up to 17 years in prison. Still, many peoplemaintain individual beliefs in Taoism, Buddhismand other types of spirituality, and praying to deities or ancestors for good luck and guidance is common.Ma, the co-owner of One As All, says that he’s careful to stay on the right side of the “clear red line” of government controls. The bar doesn’t charge forqiuqian,and he also reminds customers not to be superstitious. “There’s big a difference between having a belief and being superstitious,” he says.In China’s current economic predicament, more corporeal factors may create a space for fortune telling bars. Consumer confidence is at historic lows and the government is desperate toget people spending more, especially as the part of the economy that has traditionally propped up growth, exports, is under pressure from theUS-China trade war. Any trend that gets people spending is likely to be welcomed by the authorities says Jiang. “If the final outcome is that it drives consumption, I don’t think it will cause any backlash”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But first, their co-frontmen,Pete Dohertyand Carl Barât, make a stop by the Astrolabe stage for the last of Guardian Live’s in-conversations at this year’s festival. “They are the greatest British rock band of the last 25 years,” says Guardian critic and today’s host, Miranda Sawyer. And Doherty and Barât are two of the most notorious hell-raisers in indie-rock. But this is a changed band, perhaps, who stop for a photograph with Mr Tumble before they walk onstage.They kick off the talk with fond memories of Glastonbury, a place that has long been “part of the mythology of the band,” says Doherty. For him, it was running into his sister, AmyJo, having not seen her in three years. “I heard this couple fighting in the mud.” But then he realised: “I know that voice. It was AmyJo. She was having a full on barney with her boyfriend at the time. We had a massive, warm embrace and a little cry.”Barât’s Glasto experience was emotional in a different way. “It was a bit of a rite of passage when I was kid – to go over the fence. When I finally got through, the festival opened up before me and it was so exciting. I didn’t have any money, so I got food in the Hare Krishna tent and I slept in a Christian Aid tent. I woke up at four in the morning and I heard this rattling – I was getting sprayed. There was some fella pissing on my blanket.”View image in fullscreenLibertines on the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianSawyer notes the similarities between the spirit of Glastonbury and the thrust of the Libertines’ songs about Albion and “Merrie Old England”. The pair agree. “It’s definitely still medieval,” says Doherty, perhaps thinking of the Stone Circle at 6am. “There’s people with chicken powered bicycles and people who are living in the rhythms of the stars and the planet, or trying to make a stand in this time where it’s probably more difficult than ever. Or trying to be in touch with the land or what’s left of it.”An audience with Pete Doherty andCarl Barâtanswering reader’s questions is what it must be like to be on their tour bus. Or a fly on the wall when they shared a flat together in Camden in the mid-2000s. Their wisecracking banter has a tendency to veer off into the surreal, or the profound, with the occasional lighthearted jibe. Sawyer asks about being in a lineage of songwriting partnerships with a push-pull tension, one they mined their relationship for their songs like Can’t Stand Me Now. At one point, the pair even had security guards to protect them from each other. “But we didn’t really discuss it well,” says Doherty to his bandmate. “You’re always good for the arguments but less good at discussing and understanding the love affair.”Their last album, however, All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, was about a different relationship – with Margate in Kent. “We were running a hotel,” says Barât. “And we got so wrapped up in it. I woke up one day and realised I was like Basil Fawlty. I was so stressed all the time.” They’ve since turned it into a recording studio, where they made the album and give studio time to up-and-coming bands “so they can afford to go and do demos. It’s community building.”It’s time for readers’ questions, which range from the future of the music industry to – one for the heads – Doherty’s favourite cheese. Asked what their favourite support act of the past 20-odd years has been, they chorus “Chas and Dave”, or the time they went on after a Guns N’ Roses tribute act called Guns N’ Noses. “The guitarist was called Slosh,” laughs Barât. Another reader wanted to know if Doherty’s opinion on Oasis had changed since he notoriously appeared on MTV in 1997, saying: “I subscribe to the Umberto Eco view that Noel Gallagaher’s a poet and Liam’s a town crier.” “Yeah, I think that still works in a way,” he replies.Next up, Doherty evangelises about his favourite episode of BBC radio comedy Hancock’s Half Hour broadcast: “The Poetry Society [episode] is my go-to. When we used to share a flat, I used to always put that one on for you,” he says to Barât. “He fancied himself as a bit of a poet and he’s in with all these bohemians that hang around.” That sounds familiar. But the musician is also up on contemporary culture. In response to a reader question about new books, he says: “There’s a novel calledEngland Is Mine about a kid who gets turned to online extremism by a young English writer called Nicolas Padamsee. I ran into him at random yesterday; it’s a beautiful first novel. It inspired me and made me want to get back to myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

A reader asked: what is the one thing you would both change if you had a time machine and could travel back to the early 2000s? “My first thought is to try and get involved in some historical events like, I don’t know, contact the New York police on the morning of 9/11 or something,” says Doherty, fancying himself as a hero. “That’s not funny, is it? But something like that, I don’t know. Or just place some bets on certain horses and cup finals, proper Back to the Future vibes. Nothing really in my own life, because I wouldn’t want to tamper with the ….” He pauses. “There’s a few things, maybe. Yeah, so much.”“No, I wouldn’t change anything,” chimes Barât. “Apart from averting catastrophes.” If the Libertines could have avoided implosion, would they have achieved global rock dominance? “I mean, I don’t think we know what to do with dominance,” says Barât.The talk concludes with what there is to look forward to about the Libertines’ live show on the Pyramid. Do they have anything special up their sleeve for the afternoon Glastonbury crowd? “We’re gonna have the shipping forecast as the intro music, that’s gonna be a lovely moment,” says Doherty. “Other than that, it’s the same old shit.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025The LibertinesPop and rockPete DohertyCarl BarâtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the headline acts dominate the coverage, what of the lesser-known artists listed further down the bill? Is anyone stumbling to their strange shows?From an Elvis-fronted Nirvana tribute act to a feminist punk group singing songs about UTIs, via a taxidermy mouse circus and a singalong performance of school-assembly hymns, we went in search of Glastonbury 2025’s most obscure acts.ElvanaFriday, 1.45pm, the Greenpeace stageView image in fullscreen‘People come from all over the world to seek out oddities.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn the baking afternoon heat of the first proper day, a man dressed in an Elvis bodysuit is making a crowd of about 100 people jump into a lively mosh pit.“I might sound like Nick Cage, sometimes like Matthew McConaughey and perhaps like Kurt Cobain, but most of the time I do not sound like Elvis fucking Presley!” he bellows before launching into a vibrato-laden rendition of Nirvana’s grunge anthem Smells Like Teen Spirit.The Newcastle-based singer Paul Kell is the man responsible for this maelstrom. Kell has played in bands since his teens and was always a fan of Nirvana. In 2015, his hobby became more serious when he was asked to perform at a fancy-dress birthday party. “We decided to do Nirvana songs because we knew our mates would love it and for some reason we dressed as Elvis to add a bit of extra fun,” Kell says after his show. “I started singing the Nirvana songs in an Elvis style and that was it. Everyone stood watching it open-mouthed and Elvana was born.”In 2019, they performed at Glastonbury for the first time and have returned ever since. “It always goes down amazingly here. Even though there’s so much happening at the festival, people like to roam and will always find their way to your show,” he says. “Glastonbury is an amazing marketing tool and trade show because people come from all over the world to seek out oddities and take a chance.”Pizza HotlineFriday, 4pm,the BugView image in fullscreen‘It’s a dream come true.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHarvey Jones has been coming to Glastonbury for as long as he can remember. Over by the West Holts stage, his parents have run a vegetarian food stall, No Bones Jones, for the past 25 years. It’s the place where he met his wife and has since played his first shows as the video-game-themed DJ Pizza Hotline.“During the pandemic, I began digging into old video-game music from the 90s and discovered this amazing, optimistic-sounding strain of jungle and drum’n’bass in the soundtracks,” he says. “It gave me a sense of nostalgia and I decided to start making my own tunes that reference it.”During his Friday afternoon set on the roving Bug sound system, Jones works through frenetic versions of the theme tune from the 1997 video game GoldenEye, while mixing in fast-paced percussion and thunderous basslines. His crowd of a dozen, including his two children, bounce happily along.“This is only the second time I’ve played at Glastonbury and it’s been a dream come true,” he says. “It’s always a family affair and in the wider context of festivals it’s hard to find something this colossal that still maintains its experimental roots. There’s nowhere else quite like it.”Feminist Mouse CircusSaturday, 2pm, GlebelandView image in fullscreen‘We bring a bit of playful subversion.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe roving taxidermy show Feminist Mouse Circus is so obscure that it takes 20 minutes to find it in the scorching Theatre fields on Saturday afternoon. Once you chance upon the portable setup, though, it’s hard to miss: an intricately painted wooden doll’s house perched on bike wheels that houses a range of puppet mice, each named after a notable feminist – Babybell Hooks, Germaine Gruyère and Paris Cheese, to name a few.“We started the circus in 2015 with myself and another artist-activist called Jenny Fernbank,” the performer Miranda La Mutanta says. “We were thinking about how gendered circus can be, with men performing stunts and women only doing aerial acts and looking beautiful, and we wondered if there was a way to challenge that while also educating people about feminism.”Drawing on her previous puppetry experience, La Mutanta settled on taxidermy mice as the conduit for her feminist message – “A friend already had them” – and made her Glastonbury debut in 2018.“This is our first time back since then, but it’s always been such a welcoming and open place,” she says. “It’s a festival that is as much about performing arts as it is about music, and we hope we can bring a bit of playful subversion to it.”Primary School BangersSaturday, 3.45pm, the Summerhouse stageView image in fullscreen‘Feel no shame and belt it out!’Photograph: Sarah Phillips/The GuardianOne of the biggest success stories of Glastonbury 2025 is the primary school music teacher James Partridge’s Primary School Bangers. A singalong session of assembly hymns and other nostalgic fare, Partridge went viral for his 2024 performance at the festival. This year, he took over the entire Summerhouse stage on Thursday night.His Saturday afternoon slot is decidedly more relaxed; he works his way through crowdpleasers such as Give Me Oil in My Lamp and He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands on the piano as a seated crowd joins in passionately. “The assembly hall singalong has died out somewhat for kids today, but these songs have such powerful nostalgia for millennials like me,” the 34-year-old says.With five performances booked for 2025, it feels as if Primary School Bangers could become a Glastonbury staple. “It’s the festival that kicked everything off for me and I think the show is the perfect way to spend part of your day here,” he says. “There’s nothing better than pure joy, nostalgia and singalongs – feel no shame and belt it out!”Los Fuckin Surfer SmokersSunday, 1.30am,the Hive stageView image in fullscreen‘We came all the way from Bogotá to be here.’Photograph: Digby FoxCalifornia surf music andColombian cumbia rhythmsmay not seem the most likely match, but for the psychedelic band Los Fuckin Surfer Smokers it proves to be a potent blend. During their late-night set at the tiny Hive stage, a few dozen revellers bounce around to wailing guitars and twanging melodies, celebrating a debut at the festival that has been a goal since their formation in 2017.“We came all the way from Bogotá to be here and have planned the European tour around it,” says Sergio Arias, the guitarist. “We’ve always admired Glastonbury for being such an open space for people to discover music, and even though it’s tough and expensive for us to get here, it’s a milestone we’ve wanted to do since we began as buskers.”Although the crowd mills and disperses throughout their hour-long slot, a closing mix of spaghetti western music with Beach-Boys-style surf and rockabilly injects energy into the remaining audience members. “There is a lot happening in the world; everyone is so anxious and worried. We just want people to jump into the concert and enjoy themselves,” says Arias. “You can take a bit of that joy with you into the future.”Old Man VegasSunday, 10.30am,the Hive stageView image in fullscreen‘I made a woman cry with a poem.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAt a tiny stage in the north-east corner of Glastonbury, Old Man Vegas, AKA 53-year-old Jason Butler, can be found on Sunday morning, blending on-the-spot storytelling with bantering crowd work that keeps bleary-eyed passersby engaged.A hip-hop MC turned improv poet, Butler has a knack for conjuring delightful verses on the spot, including a 10-minute-long ditty about an office-working giraffe who becomes a tennis star, concocted from multiple crowd shoutouts.“Glastonbury is where I started doing improv poetry – since it’s such an open-minded crowd, you’re free to experiment,” he says, still breathless after his set. “This is the seventh or eighth festival I’ve played and I always come as a worker, as that way it’s easier to blag slots on the smaller stages.” As well as performing, Butler is manning a service gate.He spends his free time wandering around the fields, chatting to punters and offering to write poems for them. “It’s such a beautiful way to make a real connection,” he says. “I did one yesterday and it made the woman I wrote it for cry. Glastonbury might be a place where people come to let loose for four days, but it’s also an amazing chance to come together and have a meaningful experience.”Lekiddo, Lord of the Lobsters!Sunday, 2.15pm, the Gateway stageView image in fullscreen‘Feel the lobster love!’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“Show me your claws!” Lekkido, Lord of the Lobsters, commands. Immediately, a crowd of at least 50 people in the Theatre field lift their arms in the air to make pincer movements with their hands, snipping at the sky.Over the next half-hour, Lekiddo pumps through crustacean-themed electro-pop songs (and even a Christmas number in 30C/86F heat), encouraging people to look out for each other, leave no trace on the farmland and, of course, show those claws.“I’ve been coming to Glastonbury every year since 2009,” Lekiddo says. “It’s the people that bring me back every time. Everyone’s having fun, they want to get involved and they feel the lobster love I bring.”It’s unclear what Lekkido’s lobster connection is or where it came from. He simply states: “One day the lobsters chose me,” but the backstory matters little since his crowd is fervent, queueing up to meet him and show their pincers once the show is done.“It’s an honour to be here and I’ll keep coming back,” he says. “As long as the lobsters will have me.”Twat UnionSunday, 10.30pm, ScissorsView image in fullscreen‘We’re excited to get silly!’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThroughout the course of their hour-long Sunday night performance at the queer venue Scissors, the feminist pop punk group Twat Union will go through five costume changes, an entire carton of cranberry juice (downed by saxophonist Beth Hopkins) and bring out props including a vibrator, a drill and a broomstick.“It’s incredible to be performing our theatrical comedy music at one of the biggest festivals in the world, on a stage adorned with a giant pair of open legs,” says Kate Mac, the singer, before their set. “It’s our first Glastonbury, so we don’t quite know what to expect, but we’re excited to get silly with the crowd and make people engage with feminism in the process.”The band will be working through satirical songs from their recently released debut EP that reference UTIs (hence the cranberry juice), red flags in relationships and stereotypical depictions of women in bands, hoping to draw in punters who aren’t already distracted by clashing headline slots from Olivia Rodrigo and the Prodigy. “We’re one member down this weekend, so we’re going to give it our all and can’t wait to hopefully come back,” says Alice Rivers, the keyboardist. “We’ll be full twats at Glastonbury then.”This article was amended on 30 June 2025. The Los Fuckin Surfer Smokers’ guitarist quoted is Sergio Arias, not his bandmate Alejandro Reverend as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several actors portray the title character, which is described as a “time-jumping mosaic” spanning 70 years in the life of an accountant and mother of two in Ohio.It marks a high-profile return to the stage for Sarandon, who made her Broadway debut in 1972 in An Evening with Richard Nixon and … by Gore Vidal before her breakout film role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. By the time she was next on Broadway, in Exit the King in 2009, she was a household name and five-time Oscar nominee (who won for Dead Man Walking). Sarandon said: “I’m so honoured to be asked to be in a play during Matthew Warchus’s final season at the Old Vic,” adding that she was “terrified but excited”.Riseborough, similarly better known as a film star, has not acted on stage for 15 years. Her last major London role was in Ivanov opposite Kenneth Branagh at the Donmar Warehousein 2008. She recently appeared in Warchus’s screen version ofMatilda the Musical. Riseborough said: “It’s an honour to be taking on the role of Mary – amongst others – in Tracy Letts’ poignant play, alongside the extraordinary Susan Sarandon. I’m so very grateful to be working with Matthew again and thrilled to finally work at the Old Vic, a beautiful space.”Warchus called Letts “one of America’s greatest living writers” and said the play would be staged in-the-round – as will all the productions in his final season. Mary Page Marlowe will run from 23 September to 1 November.Letts is best known for his Pulitzer winner August: Osage County, which was directed by Anna D Shapiro in a Chicago Steppenwolf production that playedat London’s National Theatre in 2008. Shapiro directed the premiere of Mary Page Marlowe for the Steppenwolf theatre in 2016. In his review, the New York Times critic Charles Isherwoodwrote: “Some may find the play’s form frustrating; I found it beautiful and affecting, like flipping through a friend’s photo album in no particular order, finding some faces familiar, others unexpected. And then you come upon someone entirely unknown – who obviously meant much to your friend – and you realize, with a pang of sadness, that your knowledge of even those closest to you will always be fragmentary and incomplete.”Susan Sarandon’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreThis will be the play’s UK premiere. Letts said: “From my first experiences as a playwright here 30 years ago, to the run of August: Osage County at the National, London is an integral part of my development as an artist. I’m deeply gratified to have Mary Page Marlowe at the Old Vic, directed by Matthew, featuring these remarkable actresses. A genuine thrill.”Warchus will step down from the Old Vic in September next year, when he will besucceeded by Rupert Goold, who in turn will be replaced in the top job at the Almeida theatreby Dominic Cooke.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSusan SarandonMatthew WarchusAndrea RiseboroughOld Vic TheatreWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a tragedyStuart HeritageMon 30 Jun 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 18.12 EDTShareSpoiler warning: before we start, I need to make it clear that I’m about to discuss the ending ofSquid Game. If you haven’t seen it yet, stop reading now. But if you have seen it, my goodness – what the hell just happened?We knew the signs weren’t great going into the final season. Prior to its release, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk – a man who takes his role so seriously that he lost eight teeth during the production due to stress – said that the series wouldn’t have a happy ending, going as far as calling it “bleak”.But it’s only in the final couple of minutes of the final episode that the bleakness revealed itself. Shave those off and you could argue that Squid Game concluded on something vaguely upbeat. True, this is all within the parameters of the programme’s moral universe – very few shows could murder 500 people, let the baddies get away with it and still be considered uplifting – but if you lay all the elements out, then a happy ending is what it was.View image in fullscreenA newborn becomes the unlikely focus of the final round in Squid Game.Photograph: NetflixBecause, in the end, Gi-hun (the player who won in season one and returned to take down the entire system) ended up making the noblest sacrifice possible. The slightly improbable introduction of a newborn baby as a numbered player brought out the worst in almost everyone. Never in television history have so many characters attempted to throw a baby off a cliff for money. So Gi-hun first became her protector and then, by killing himself to let her win the prize money, her benefactor. In his final moments, his actions went some way to making up for being a horrible absentee father to his own daughter.But more than that, it gave him an ideological victory over the Front Man. For the last two seasons, the two had been locked in an argument over the nature of humanity. Gi-hun saw people as good-intentioned and collaborative, while the Front Man wanted to demonstrate that we are all violently self-interested. But Gi-hun’s decision to kill himself so a baby could thrive seemed to unlock something in the Front Man. After the finale, he collected the baby, delivered it to the people he knew would keep her safe, and gave her a life of unimaginable wealth. And when he delivered Gi-hun’s belongings to his estranged daughter in Los Angeles, he seemed to be genuinely grieving the death of his worldview. So in that respect, the good guys won. There is hope for humanity after all. A happy ending.But then came the bleakness. Because as the Front Man was driving away, he saw something he’d only ever seen on the streets of Seoul: a suited figure flinging a cardboard square to the ground, then slapping a stranger across the face. This, as any good Squid Game fan will know, is how players are recruited to the game. Only this time the recruiter was Cate Blanchett.View image in fullscreenYes, that really is Cate Blanchett – and yes, she’s recruiting!Photograph: NetflixThere she was, an Oscar-winning actor, one of the world’s best, coming out of absolutely nowhere, slapping strangers in the face in what has to qualify as the least-expected cameo of all time. Her appearance was so out of the blue that you probably spent the entire length of the credits contemplating its meaning. On one hand, to watch it was to realise that Squid Games happen across the world all the time, and that we are all pawns at the mercy of the callous billionaires who control our lives. On the other hand: yikes, Cate Blanchett must really need the money.‘People like happy endings. Sorry!’ Squid Game’s brutal finale hits new heights of barbarityRead moreBefore the season began, the expectation was always that Hollywood would find a way to encroach on to Squid Game. When I interviewed the actors who playedseason one’s VIPs– the masked westerners who would bet on the outcome of each game – their assumption was that they wouldn’t return for subsequent seasons because the show would be able to hire George Clooney or Brad Pitt. In the end that didn’t come to pass, perhaps because Squid Game preferred the idea of lobbing in one of the world’s most recognisable women for a gratuitously inconsequential hello at the end.Of course, the truth of Blanchett’s appearance is that Netflix isn’t done with the programme yet. At the end of the year, the streamer is going to start making Squid Game: America, an English-language remake of the show written by Dennis Kelly and directed by David Fincher.And that’s the real unhappy ending. Squid Game is a global sensation, the most-watched TV show in Netflix history. And yet that isn’t enough. We live in a world where a property like Squid Game cannot just ride off into the sunset. Instead, it has to be exploited until its back breaks and everyone starts to resent it for outstaying its welcome. That’s why Cate Blanchett showed up at the end. And that’s why it’s the bleakest ending imaginable.Explore more on these topicsSquid GameTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This show is truly vomit-inducingIn this astonishing and gross series, we stand witness as teams battle to clean up blood, guts and body fluids. Viewer discretion is very much advised – there will be maggotsLucy ManganMon 30 Jun 2025 18.05 EDTShareIt has been a while since we had a good, honest point-and-boke documentary, is it not? “Boke”, for those of you unfamiliar with the term, means to be sick. I use it here because the onomatopoeia gives a better sense of the fight that precedes the act, especially if – say – a programme is unspooling in front of you that keeps the nausea building until you are past the point of no return. Viewer discretion – and a plastic bowl – is advised.So, then, to Crime Scene Cleaners, a 10-part documentary – yes, 10! – that does exactly what it says on the tin. It follows teams from British and American companies as they move in after bodies have been removed and evidence bagged and tagged by police to clean up anything left behind. “Anything” can mean blood – spattered, accumulated in the bottom of a bath tub, trailed along a floor, soaked into a carpet, stained into grouting, arterially sprayed along skirting boards. Hepatitis B, we are informed via a dramatic voiceover, can survive for up to seven days in dried blood, hepatitis C for up to six weeks on hard surfaces. Clever pathogens.“Anything” can also mean faeces. “Anything” can mean body fluids – the worst phrase in the English language – that have leaked from “every hole in your body” during “natural decomposition” into a mattress, perhaps, or on to the floor, if your death has gone undiscovered for long enough. They may coalesce around the legs of a bedside table and leave marks when a team shifts the furniture to start returning the house to a saleable condition. “Anything” will almost certainly mean maggots (“they can be quite voracious”), flies and an overwhelming stench. “I can’t describe it,” says Lauren Baker, the hands-on founder of LIT Biohazard & Trauma Cleaning Specialists. “But, once you’ve smelled it, you’re not going to want to smell it again.” Noted. So very noted.We watch Baker and her team deal with the consequences of an unattended death in a bungalow in Kent. They are not told anything about the scene, although viewers are invited to wonder about the possibility of foul play by the attention the programme pays to a smashed window. The information that this was how the police gained access to the home is withheld until the last minute, which adds the necessary touch of manipulation without which no essentially voyeuristic documentary is complete. Baker opens the window to let the departed’s spirit out – an ancient touch in a room now full of modern equipment and chemical cleaning sprays – and they get to work.In the US, life is a little different. Victor Robles, the owner of Bioclean in Los Angeles, reminisces about the time his company had to clean up a mile-long blood trail by morning. It took 60 man-hours, but they got it done. We see them take a call from a landlord to a property in which most of the blood patterns described earlier can be found. We learn that blood cannot simply be sluiced down the plughole of a bath or shower – it must be soaked up, bagged and disposed of safely. They take up the carpets quickly: “You want to avoid saturation below floor level.” We are told that all of this was the result of an accidental injury, which the tenant survived. Americans are either a lot tougher or they come with extra blood.Over in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Larry Douglas – a former detective and now the owner of Xtreme Cleaners– muses on what life has taught him. “In 22 year,” he says, “I’ve never found an intact eyeball, because they’re so fragile.”One of his teams is given a car to decontaminate. They seem to be suiting and booting up to an excessive degree – until we learn that the car was used to transport fentanyl,the synthetic opioidthat is scything through the US and which is so potent that if you breathe in airborne particles of the stuff, you can overdose and die. A simple traffic stop can become fatal for an officer if they disturb the wrong goods in the boot. We see bodycam footage of them being overcome and saved by their colleagues. It is astonishing. But you live and learn, don’t you? And then die, hopefully peacefully and not alone.Crime Scene Cleaners is available on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The house describes it as having “top notes of lipstick and incense; middle notes of ‘smoker’s leather jacket’ and a base of sandalwood, orris root and vintage fur”. The brand – whose name is culled from a Bob Dylan quote – is one of a growing set of perfumers reinventing scent for new fragrance fans. Like bedroom DJs or T-shirt screen-printers before them, they’re changing the culture of an established industry.The global fragrance market is the biggest it has ever been and still growing; it is set to generate revenue of about £45bn in 2025,according to Statista. The UK market alone reached £1.74bn in 2024 and, if growth continues apace, will top £2bn by 2029 according to a 2024Mintelreport. This growth is driven by gen Z and millennials, who have formed a unique relationship with fragrance due to social media and Covid isolation – PerfumeTok drove 45% of social media scent sales in the US by 2023. Instead of a dab behind the ear, they prefer scent layering – wearing two or more perfumes at the same time – and scent wardrobing (matching fragrances to different occasions). Eighty-three per cent of gen Z wear fragrance as often as three times a week, according to a recent report by Circana.View image in fullscreenPaul Firmin and Niko Dafkos, founders of Earl of East.Photograph: Earl of EastPerfume took off, somewhat unexpectedly, during lockdown, says Suzy Nightingale of the podcast On the Scent. “It was expected the fragrance market would fall, but it boomed,” says Nightingale, an award-winning perfume blogger. “People discovered they could punctuate their day with moments of difference – travel with their noses, revel in nostalgia or excite their senses with novelty. I think that was when people realised it’s not about ‘attracting a partner’ or having a signature scent – if it ever was. It’s donning an invisible cloak of protection, empowering yourself.”Successful perfume influencers play a key role in the storytelling side of these products. Theatrical and charismatic TikTokkers such as @professorperfume and @jeremyfragrance explain new scents so vividly that their followers sometimes buy without smelling the perfume first. They spin tales of the weird girls and confident boys who wear these scents; PerfumeTok influences 66% of gen Z purchases.Teenage boys have become surprising cognoscenti when it comes to luxury aftershave. The TikTok term for scent layering in this age group is“smellmaxxing”, a buzzword that became so prevalent that the New York Times defined it last year as a “term for enhancing one’s musk”.According to a 2025 US trend report by Piper Sandler, teenagers are spending more money across beauty categories in general, but fragrance has grown the most –up 22% year on year. On a recent visit to Bloom Perfumery, a boutique selling independent and niche fragrances in the UK, I watched a boy who couldn’t have been older than 16 chat about cologne with an assistant twice his age with a genuinely inspiring level of passion and sophistication, beaming through his braces as he discussed smoky notes.View image in fullscreenZoologist’s Bee scent features notes of ginger syrup, royal jelly and broom.Photograph: Zoologist“There’s been a lot ofpearl-clutching commentaryworrying about how much [teenagers] spend,” says Nightingale. “But if you actually bother to talk to the younger generations thronging the halls of perfumeries from Boots to the Black Hall of Harrods, you discover they’re saving their pocket money – sometimes for years – and taking on part-time jobs to explore scent.”While previous generations were satisfied with scent juggernauts such as CK One, Le Male, Poison or Opium, an emerging group of “frag heads” wants more. The idea of personalising your scent – smellmaxxing or scent layering – is key for them. Still, what 16-year-old can afford to layer a £90 Loewe scent with something marginally cheaper from Armani – and to that end, how did such expensive scents become the norm?As luxury scents boomed post-pandemic, so too did dupes – replicas of designer products. Offering luxury style at low prices, dupes feel more Robin Hood than guilty secret. Some new brands got their start providing vegan or cruelty-free alternatives to blockbuster fragrances, notably Eden Perfumes, a family-run business in Brighton now lauded for its own scents as much as its knockoffs.Meanwhile, the high street stepped up to do what it does best: producing designer style at affordable prices. The Zara perfume counter is currently the place to go if you want to smell like a million dollars for less than £20. While logos and bottle designs are easy to trademark, you cannot trademark a scent nor patent a perfume recipe under UK law. Some dupes can be poorer quality than luxury brands, but they’re safe as long as you use common sense. A trusted retailer will follow safety standards; an unknown one may not be as stringent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While cosmetics giants such as Coty, Guerlain and Estée Lauder have dominated since the early 20th century, independent pioneers appeared who followed their instincts and taste rather than market research. Brands such as Le Labo, Sol de Janeiro and Byredo changed the game – Le Labo’s Santal 33 was the fashion circle’s signature scent and a Santal 26 candle appeared in Beyoncé’s Lemonade film in 2016. Victoria Beckham and Sienna Miller namechecked Byredo as their favourite perfumer. It is no wonder these brands have now been snapped up by LVMH and other conglomerates.More indie scents launched after lockdown, including complicated and counterintuitive fragrances. The idea of perfume as confrontational, confusing art grew. The Canadian brand Zoologist found fame for its award-winning Bee scent (notes of ginger syrup, royal jelly and broom) in 2020, as did Inexcusable Evil by the Romanian perfumer Toskovat, with its bouquet of bandages, blood and burnt flowers. This year brings Silver Haze from Alloy Studio, which evokes “a backseat smoke session” and has notes of cannabis, chocolate powder and strawberries. Food-inspired fragrances are the latest perfume craze with scents like pretzels and cherries finding favour.View image in fullscreenAlloy Studio’s Silver Haze evokes ‘a backseat smoke session’.Photograph: Alloy StudioSome fans went deep, obsessing over process, rarity or a unique note in a scent, discussing them like oenophiles on Reddit and dedicated scent chatrooms. Some turned to DIY, using Sam Macer’sYouTube channeland forums such asBasenotesto swap tips on sourcing ingredients and aroma combinations.For a few, the hobby became a side hustle and finally a career. Indie companies looked to creators who had taught themselves to blend new scents. As the industry traditionally requires a chemistry degree, a spell at a (preferably French) perfume school – such as ISIPCA in Versailles – then an apprenticeship at a fragrance house, this influx of new blood has been a huge shakeup. You can buy perfume ingredients such as fixatives, solvents and scent compounds online, so, like microbrewers and bakers before them, self-taught perfumers simply got stuck in.How I unlearned the internalised prejudice I had as a Black woman – one braid at a timeRead more“There’s a definite sense of punk-rock impresarios to some indie brands,” says Nightingale. “Not tied up in shareholders’ opinions and having to panel-test everything so that it’s acceptable rather than exciting.”At a time when beauty conglomerates are turning to AI and science for new scents, it’s refreshing to find gatecrashers at the party. The Spanish company Puig used45m brain readingsfrom men aged 18-35 to finesse the ingredients of the cologne Phantom by Paco Rabanne before its 2021launch – the result was a commercial bestseller.Independent perfumers can bring a bit more imagination to the process. The British scent company Earl of East recently collaborated with the musician Bon Iver, who they asked to do a blind smell test, then used his answers to create a custom scent inspired by his latest album. The resulting range of mood mists and candles instantly sold out. The creation process for the two products couldn’t be more different, but the world smells better because both of them exist.Paul Firmin, a co-founder of Earl of East, thinks the lack of formal education behind the brand is a strength. It started as a hobby and a market stall but is now stocked globally. It holds workshops for customers who want to make their own perfumes. “We’ve worked hard to demystify scent, encouraging people to engage with it in a way that feels personal rather than intimidating,” says Firmin. “Removing outdated boundaries – like the idea that scent should be tied to gender – has also opened up the space. That distinction was a ridiculous concept in the first place.”View image in fullscreenEarl of East collaborated with the musician Bon Iver for a range of products that sold out.Photograph: Earl of EastAnother autodidact is Maya Njie, a Swedish-born, UK-based perfumer, who started her fragrance house in 2016. While studying surface design at the University of Arts London, Njie got sidetracked. “I was exploring storytelling through photography, print and pattern and I began incorporating scent.” She was inspired by family photo albums; holiday snaps of Gambian beaches led to her perfume Tropica, which combines sea salt, pineapple and coconut. “Being self-taught has given me the freedom to approach perfumery from an artistic and instinctive place,” she says. “I can do this as the brand owner as I’m only working to my own brief.”Nightingale wishes the new indies of perfume received more support from the industry. “I see so many tiny brands fall by the wayside. I’d love to see retailers celebrate them more – giving them shelf room among the big corporate-owned names.”View image in fullscreenMaya Njie: ‘I’m working to my own brief.’Photograph: Maya NjieCathleen Cardinali, co-founder of Thin Wild Mercury, found that nothing beats word of mouth. As she posted on social media after Roan’s viral message: “[Our] customers went crazy tagging us in an international pop superstar’s Instagram because they were so excited by the notion that she might like their favourite little indie perfume brand.”If you’re looking for the smell of lipstick, sun cream from a day at the beach, smoking in a car, or have some other olfactory fantasy, this new generation of self-taught perfumers are waiting to play it out for you.Explore more on these topicsFragranceTikTokSocial mediaLuxury goods sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has been variably successful at this – the messy relationship between shy, photography-obsessed Max and chaotic blue-haired Chloe in 2015’s original Life Is Strange was left somewhat ambiguous, but Alex Chen in Life Is Strange: True Colors was openly bi and pretty laidback about it. My favourite queer moment from the series, though, came in last year’s Double Exposure.Max Caulfield is now a grownup with a photography residency at a small-town college, and has finally figured herself out. She flirts confidently with Vince, the handsome butterribleit-boy on campus. But when it comes to Amanda, the exceedingly cool lesbian behind the bar at the local pub? She is so awkward it’s painful. I loved this because it is my firm personal belief thatallbisexual people are both terrified by and attracted to cool lesbians. If you get to the point when you take Amanda on a date, you are treated to one of the sweetest scenes I’ve ever seen in a game: they go to an imaginary gig. The women riff off each other, conjuring the most chaotic show imaginable with words and laughter. It is, along withNathan Drake and Elena playing Crash Bandicoot togetherin Uncharted 4, the most believable relationship scene in games. (And yes, even after the date goes really well, Max still hesitates over kissing her.)Keza MacDonald, the Guardian’s video games editorEllie and Dina in The Last of Us Part IIView image in fullscreenPeople with flaws … Ellie and Dina in The Last of Us: Part IIPhotograph: Sony/Naughty DogIt has to be the relationship between Ellie and Dina in The Last of Us Part II. I know this one gets a lot of attention, but it’s for good reason. There are so few queer stories in media that don’t revolve around traumatic experiences. Acknowledging the struggles of any marginalised group is vital to sharing that perspective – but so is highlighting the joy. I think it’s incredible that, in a game that deals with such heavy themes and tragic character development, these two were allowed to experience a joyful, supportive relationship. They could be people with flaws who made choices, instead of being defined solely by their queerness. The evolution of the narrative and eventual conflict between them was the result of Ellie’s choices and actions – which made the story that much more impactful to me.Amanda Hufford, producer of (and voice of Ducky in)Date Everything!, out nowGay marriage in FableView image in fullscreenNo cheat codes required … Fable.Photograph: LionheadWhen I was a teenager,I came across this game called Fable.I played through the tutorial.I wanted to spice it up.I used a cheat engine.I made my character really buff.It felt a little … wrong.Not because I cheated.But because I didn’t look like that.Does this character still represent me?Am I allowed to do this?> Don’t know.I got to the first town.I came across a merchant.I bought out everything he had.I regifted everything back to him.I saw a heart begin to form.Can I … really do this?> Guess so.I gave him the wedding ring.We got gay-married.We moved into this house I bought.And then I never touched the game again.–I was a closeted teenager.Everyone around me knew.Everyone but me of course.I was a chubby little kid.Everyone around me knew.And everyone kept reminding me.I can’t help but laugh.Guilty for being swole in-game.But never for being gay-married.Funny how a teenage mind works.Tanat Boozayaangool of Tan Ant Games, developer ofBuilding Relationships, out later this yearBisexual chaos in Thirsty SuitorsView image in fullscreenMischief and honesty … Thirsty Suitors.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveMy love for queer games exists at two ends of a spectrum. At one end is “beautifully done nuance and subtlety” and at the other is “delightful, wilful chaos”. This feels in keeping with being a gender-wobbly bisexual.In the realm of nuance and subtlety, my earliest love was playingGone Home, and the slow discovery of your sister Sam’s queerness, and the catharsis of her getting to live her life authentically after rejection by her parents. Then there wasUnpacking, about making space for a new partner after the nightmare that was trying to fit your things around a boyfriend who wouldn’t budge. Or most recently, there was the (spoiler alert) very natural growth of Henry and Hans’s relationship inKingdom Come: Deliverance II, which has to be one of the most beautifully written romances in games in years.My unexpected Pride icon: the diva women of fighting video games inspired meRead moreOf course, on the other side of the coin is mischief and honesty.Thirsty Suitorscaptures the messiness and interconnectedness of queer dating, and the fallout that can occur when someone is still figuring themselves out. When it comes to my own game, Crescent County, we absolutely come down on the side of chaos. There is often pressure to perform “perfect” queer representation, but that robs characters of their bite and humanity. I completely understand the draw of pure wholesomeness, but we shouldn’t sanitise ourselves for the sake of acceptability!Anna Hollinrake, creative director ofCrescent County, out next yearA wholesome queer family in UnpackingView image in fullscreenA masterpiece of show-don’t-tell … Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamThe thing about a lot of queer moments in the video game era I grew up in – which my child loves to refer to as “the late 1900s” (my bones aredust) – is that it was the villains who were queer coded. Wholesome queer moments were as rare as a writer who can come up with a new and original “as rare as” simile.That’s why I loved Unpacking so much. On the face of it, the game is simply about unpacking your belongings as you move from place to place, but it’s a masterpiece of show-not-tell. You move out of your parents’ house, get room-mates, and eventually move in with your boyfriend, who immediately minimises your space and self expression. At that point I yelled to my wife “SHE’S GAY!” But I often do that with characters I like, so she took no note. However,I was right.As the game progresses she meets a new partner, grows closer to them, and eventually they have a child together and you’re unpacking the baby’s bedroom. It finishes with the most wholesome lesbian representation I’ve ever seen in a video game.NikkiJay, creator ofQuantum Witch, out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesSexualityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet without us, the system would collapseMon 30 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 04.28 EDTShareIt’s autumn 2024 and I’m talking to an A&E doctor. We’re on the refreshment break at a conference about care. He tells me that he and his colleagues keep their NHS lanyards visible when they take loved ones to medical appointments. It means the doctors listen to them. It’s understandable; they’re peers with shared training and expertise. But it’s also infuriating because I know Mary’s story and many more like it.Mary is 58, and lives in Wales with her husband and their adult son. As a result of epilepsy in infancy, her son has global developmental delay. Practically, this means that he is non-mobile, non-verbal and takes food through a tube to his stomach. I worked with Mary and 15 other unpaid carers last year, supporting them to keep weekly diaries and interviewing them, resulting ina research report.Mary’s son requires medication to prevent excess drooling. He can’t stop himself choking, so it’s essential to minimise his saliva production. But in her diary, she explained that the medication was changed and the new type was less effective – he was having dangerous coughing fits. Mary reported this to his medical team but, in her words: “It was a feeling of, if it wasn’t witnessed by a health professional it didn’t happen.” A few weeks later, she had a meeting in her home with some of his care team. “I was just lucky that he performed,” she told me with a wry, tired smile, by which she meant he had a coughing fit in front of the professionals. His medication was swiftly reverted.I wish Mary’s story was unique. But it’s not. Ada is 80 and also cares for her son. He’s in his 40s, and has autism and several other conditions. She had been warning medical professionals about his escalating panic attacks for months, but nothing had been done. In one incident, he became so panicked that he ran away from his daycare centre and had to be located by police. At other times, when it’s just Ada and him at home, things can turn violent. Still, Ada told me that her concerns were dismissed. She was only believed when, by chance, a psychiatrist happened to witness one of these panic attacks. “He said it was one of the gravest attacks he had seen.”To be an unpaid carer is to be deemed not credible, according to Mary, Ada and several other carers in this study. Mary feels this is especially apparent higher up the professional ladder. The community-based staff listen to her, perhaps because they see what she does for her son on a daily basis. But of consultants and doctors, she said: “I’m lucky if they’ll even look at me.” Yet it is Mary who has been at every medical appointment for her son during his 26 years. It is Mary who spends 15 hours in every 24-hour period providing care for him (alongside her part-time job and the paid care he receives). It is Mary who spots side effects, monitors symptoms and administers medications. It’s not just about feeling respected; for carers such as Mary and Ada, being heard is a matter of life, death and safety. Of that meeting at which her son “performed”, she wrote that there had been too few chairs to seat all the attenders, so she perched on the periphery. “The irony that there was no room for me at the table was not lost.”Family members provide far more than hands-on care at home in the absence of paid workers – their unpaid labour is woven through the entire health and care system and at all times. At the most basic level, they perform a high volume of administrative tasks, made harder by disjointed and complex systems. In fact, the carers in the study spent up to 220 hours over 12 weeks on these sorts of tasks for the people they are caring for. The diaries read like broken records – endless arranging and rearranging of appointments, prescriptions and finances, automated phone services that lead to dead ends, digitised forms that aren’t fit for purpose. “I wish that we did not move in circles,” wrote Philippa, 86, and caring for her 60-year-old son, after a long week trying to sort out his future care.In a cast of changing medical and care professionals, family members also act as essential living repositories of their loved ones’ medical histories. Jared’s wife had an industrial accident in 2011, after which she was in a coma. Jared told me that her medical notes were about 900 pages long. Medical professionals have rarely, if ever, had time to read all of the notes. In this context, Jared becomes indispensable as “the only one who can say, well, this happened in this order”.Beyond project management and medical histories, carers also reported enabling what professionals call “person-centred care”, ensuring that the personality and preferences of their family members are understood. Lisa’s mum is 75, and has diabetes, multiple sclerosis and cognitive decline. She is supported by a live-in paid worker. Lisa settles in the paid workers when they rotate. She does this practically – showing them where things are in the house – but she also communicates “the nuances of Mum … I want to get across to them that they are going to see the worst side of her, but she’s not that.” She tells them about the dinner parties her mother used to throw, her flirtatious and bubbly nature. “She’s such a different person now that you want her care workers to understand who she was.”Throughout the interviews and diaries, carers such as Lisa explain repeatedly how they lubricate the system, enabling it to function when care-receiving loved ones cannot. They are the unseen but essential lifeblood of the health and care system: it’s not about them, but it does not function without them. Since being a carer myself, and subsequentlywriting a bookabout carers’ experiences, I have developed a keen sense for when a policymaker, politician or simply a member of the public has failed to understand the contribution of carers.The Labour party manifestolast year was a case in point. It managed to set out a plan on care yet omit carers, that is, the people who perform the vast majority of care in the UK. Subsequentgovernmental announcementsfall into the same trap, paying carers cursory attention.While we wait for politicians to catch up with reality, perhaps carers need to pirate those NHS identity cards. I’m not serious, of course. But I think, too, of Mary, Ada and all the other carers I’ve met, walking a tightrope of their loved ones’ safety on a daily basis, steeped in loving and practical knowledge. It shouldn’t take a piece of laminated card for them to win legitimacy.Emily Kenway is a social-policy doctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh and author ofWho Cares: the Hidden Crisis of Caregiving and How We Solve ItExplore more on these topicsCarersOpinionHealthDoctorsSocial carecommentShareReuse this content"

In one, a young man with hopeful, progressive politics went up against the decaying gods of the establishment, with their giant funding and networks and endorsements from Democratic scions, and won. In another, in an appalling paroxysm of racism and Islamophobia, a Muslim antisemite has taken over the most important city in the US, with an aim to impose some socialist/Islamist regime. Like effluent, pungent and smearing, anti-Muslim hate spread unchecked and unchallenged after Mamdani’s win. It takes a lot from the US to shock these days, but Mamdani has managed to stir, or expose, an obscene degree of mainstreamed prejudice.Politicians, public figures, members of Donald Trump’s administration and the cesspit of social media clout-chasers all combined to produce what can only be described as a collective self-induced hallucination; an image of a burqaswathed over the Statue of Liberty; the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, stating that Mamdani’s win is what happens when a countryfails to control immigration. Republican congressman Andy Ogles has decided to call Mamdani “little muhammad” and ispetitioningto have him denaturalised and deported. He has beencalleda “Hamas terrorist sympathiser”, and a “jihadist terrorist”.It is a measure of how racist the reaction has been that Donald Trump calling Mamdani a “communist lunatic” seems restrained in comparison. Some of the responses have been so hysterical that I often couldn’t tell what was real and what was parody. Because the idea that Mamdani, whose style is, above anything else, wide-grinned earnestness, was some sinister Islamist sleeper agent is so clearly a joke.But it’s not a joke, and if it is then it’s on me for still, after all these years, underestimating what Muslims in the public sphere do to people’s brains. And how utterly comfortable many are with anti-Muslim hate. And why shouldn’t they be? To date, the most senior figures in Mamdani’s own party, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, havenot called outthis onslaught, and those politicians and public figures who made them will suffer no censure or consequence. Because, fundamentally, anti-Muslim hate, like all racism when it becomes normalised, thrives when there is a systemic blessing of it through not even registering its offensiveness.But the apathy towards assaults against Mamdani is because he is an outsider in more meaningful ways, not just in his religious background. His crime is not one of daring to be Muslim and a politician – he might have “passed” if he was a conventional Democratic apparatchik – but of having strong opinions about economics and politics that mark him out as a challenger of mainstream orthodoxies regarding capitalism andIsrael.Given his leftwing opinions ontaxationand rent control, and objections to the slaughter of Palestinians on the US’s dime, a backlash to Mamdani was always likely. But he has done much to counter it. He has made thoroughexplanationsof his abhorrence of antisemitism, of his pledge to combat all hate crime, and of the fact that his economic agenda is based on making the city, from itsfoodto itschildcare, more affordable.LiveZohran Mamdani: who is New York's Democratic mayoral candidate? – video profileHis offence has been in his unwillingness to water down his principles, not toeing the line on Israel, and not making frankly embarrassing assertions, likethose running against himdid, that Israel would be his first foreign trip. He has refrained from debasing himself through serial condemnations of phrases that have arbitrarily been erected as litmus tests of a Muslim’s acceptability in the public domain.Mamdani’srefusalto reject the phrase “globalise the intifada”, on the grounds that it expresses “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights” has been seized upon as an indication that he supports some kind of violent jihad – a reading that ignores his frequent assertions that Israel has the right to exist and condemnations of any violence against Jews. What are we doing here?There is no degree to which Mamdani could have become acceptably Muslim while holding these opinions – even though they are clearly universal enough for him to receive emphatic support from New Yorkers, including fromJewswho voted for him, and the Jewish candidate Brad Lander, whoendorsed him. He cannot be secular enough, American enough, or elite enough, as the son of a film-maker and a professor, to hold politics that will not be reducible to his inherently suspect identity.Even in demeanour, he has spoken of how he constantly has to measure his tone, lest he be smeared as a “beast”. And in this, he mirrors a broader, exasperating reality – one where Muslims and pro-Palestinians are condemned as threatening, while there is a colossal attack on their rights and safety across the world, simply for opposing an incontrovertible crime being perpetrated in Gaza. From detention and deportation proceedings against activists such as Mahmoud Khalil in the US, to the vilification and securitisation of pro-Palestinian speech and activism in theUKandEurope, the messenger is shot, and then framed as the aggressor.But smears and diversions and outrageous extrapolations will not change the facts on the ground, which are that the Israeli state is occupying the West Bank, starving and killing Palestinians inGaza, and accused of war crimes and genocide, all with the sponsorship of the US and support of western regimes. In that sense, Mamdani’s victoryisa threat, because it reveals how finally, all attempts to maintain an indefensible and intolerable situation have lost their grip on the growing number of people who are thinking for themselves.A roadmap to beat Trump? How rise of Zohran Mamdani is dividing DemocratsRead moreMamdani isn’t even mayor yet, and he will probably face an escalating campaign using his identity as a way of discrediting his beliefs, both economic and political. And here is where the response to his win is both alarming and potentially propulsive, like the clammy buildup to the final breaking of a fever. Mamdani is where he is because he is not alone. Not by a long shot. And in drawing out such naked and explicit anti-Muslim hate, Mamdani has inadvertently revealed the ugliness and weakness not just of his opponents, but of the wider political establishment, as well as their anti-democratic impulses.In drawing them out, Mamdani has shown how prejudice is rarely about individuals, but the fear that marginalised minority views could ever become powerful majority ones. In this mayoral race, from Palestine to local policing, anti-Muslim hate is not just a repellent phenomenon confined to Mamdani, it is a barricade against the desires of the voting public. Once people start making that connection, it really is over.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the government won’t admit itZoe WilliamsWe can’t fix this crisis with vouchers, loyalty cards or supermarket displays. Either prices have to come down or incomes have to go upMon 30 Jun 2025 08.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTShareThe government’spolicy on obesity, announced on Sunday, sounds as though it’s tough on the supermarkets: they really must do better on the health front, ministers say. Put the fruit nearer the doors (where it is already), make sure loyalty cards reward good choices. Calorie for calorie, a basket of healthy food costs more than twice as much as a basket of less healthy food, according toa report by the Food Foundation.That statistic sounds stark until you engage your brain. Processed food is cheap because that is the “process”: the relentless prioritising of the profit margin over every other consideration, such as nutritional value. What else are you going to use all that big, capitalist brain power for? Making food more colourful?There are other suggestions: voucher rewards for people who live more healthily; doubling the number of spaces on the NHS digital weight-management programme. There are cute little facts, too: cutting 50 calories a day would reduce the obesity numbers by 2 million adults and 340,000 children; a reduction of a single sugary fizzy drink a day would halve obesity.The missing plank in this raft of suggestions is the only one that would make any difference: addressing the price of food. There is a reason that one in three children in deprived areas are overweight, compared with one in five in the general population – people on low incomes cannot afford healthy food. Prices have to come down or incomes have to go up. It’s amazing how many words a government paper can put into not saying that.Any kind of government intervention on pricing sounds pretty radical, right? The kind of thing a Marxist might suggest; the slippery slope to a collectivist five-year plan. In fact, in August 2023, at the height of the inflation crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Francecapped the price of 5,000 grocery products, with the finance minister criticising big food by name – Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo – for failing to lower prices sufficiently.But the French have form on revolutions and whatnot. Hungary’s nationalist strongman Viktor Orbán? Not so much. Yet even he imposedmandatory price cutson some basic food items in June 2023.Kamala Harris initially fought her election on three“opportunity economy”measures: tackling the cost of groceries, housing and medical care. She sounded much more corporate-curious by the end of that campaign than she had at the start and the jury is still out on whether that was a good idea (not).Majority of children will be overweight or obese in nine areas of England by 2035, study showsRead moreIf we imagine, though, that no UK politician could ever take a stand as dangerously disruptive as the communist firebrands Macron, Orbán and Harris, there is one other tiny thing we could try: raising incomes. You could call this the elephant in the room, but you know the other thing they say about elephants: how do you eat one, except one bite at a time? Ahead of a coherent plan to raise incomes, the government could start by notrestricting disability benefits. Even though those people exist in different headlines, they are part of the same reality – when you don’t have enough money, you can’t afford healthy food.In a report published in November,The False Economy of Big Food, the economist Tim Jackson identified the mechanisms by which deprivation causes chronic illness in a more granular and sophisticated way. Food processing isn’t just blase about sugar, salt and saturated fat; it strips out nutrients and fibre in the quest for shelf life and profitability.It’s uncontroversial to say that processed food is cheap and that it makes us ill, but the logical conclusion – that we are being poisoned by an industry against which only surplus wealth can protect us – is peculiarly unsayable. Never accuse them of that: you will sound like a nitwit. Instead, we get a flurry of suggestions, pitched between rearranging the fridge displays on the Titanic and imploring individuals to just do better.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Scrap the whole thingRichard BurgonYour government is choosing to balance the books on the backs of disabled people. That’s not the country we are supposed to be buildingRichard Burgon is Labour MP for Leeds EastMon 30 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 11.18 EDTShareIn the face of growing opposition, the government finally stopped ignoring the warnings from its own backbenchers and made changes to its disability benefits bill. No one doubtsthese concessionsare welcome. But the real question is whether they go far enough. For me and many of my Labour colleagues, the answer is clear – they don’t.At best, these concessions make a terrible bill slightly less bad. But the bill still represents a devastating attack on disabled people. It still strips billions in support from those who need it most, still forces huge numbers into poverty, and still undermines the dignity and independence of disabled people. As an example of just how cruel these cuts still are, MPs will be asked to vote on Tuesday for a bill that will take away essential support from disabled people who will need help with basic daily tasks such as cutting up food, washing themselves or using the toilet.If these cuts go ahead, approaching half a million disabled peoplewill lose their personal independence paymentsbetween the end of next year and 2030. On average, theywill lose £4,500 a year– about £100 a week. That’s a life-changing reduction for people who rely on Pip to help with the extra costs of disability, including the one in six Pip recipients who are in work, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.On top of that, there are deep cuts to the universal credit health component for low-income sick and disabled people. Three-quarters of a million new claimants will be forced on to a rate that’s half the current level and be left£3,000 a year worse off. For people already struggling to make ends meet, this is not just a cut – it’s a catastrophe.And how can it be right that someone who would qualify for support today would be denied it simply for becoming disabled after next November? Do we really want a two-tier system where future generations of disabled people receive less support than disabled people today? Especially when already three in four of those using food banks aredisabled themselvesor live with someone who is.All this flies in the face of what should be a key purpose of every Labour government: to lift people out of poverty, not push them further into it. It’s no wonder that disabled people’s organisations, including Labour’s own affiliateDisabilityLabour, remain so firmly opposed to this bill.Of course, ministers have been sent out to claim that these changes are all about helping people. But if you cut billions in essential support to disabled people, you cannot then sincerely claim to be helping them. The truth is these changes are driven by the desire to make savings. Even after the concessions, the majority of the original cuts planned are still in the bill – totalling a staggering £3.5bn.Sadly, the government has made a deliberate choice to balance the books on the backs of disabled people instead of pursuing the much more Labour option of taxing those with the broadest shoulders. So many fairer alternatives exist. As an example of one of them, I will be presentinga petition in parliamenton the eve of the vote, already backed by more than 75,000 people, calling for a wealth tax. Such a tax of just 2% on assets over £10m could raise £24bn a year – over six times more than the government’s so-called savings from these cuts.No 10 climbs down over welfare bill in move to win over Labour rebelsRead moreIt would also be popular, with one recent poll showing that two-thirds of people support tax increases on the super-rich. It’s a policy that would placeLabourfirmly on the right side of public opinion – something the government has struggled with in its first year.As we count down to Tuesday’s vote, there will be increasing pressure on MPs to fall into line, accept the concessions as sufficient and back the bill. But the question MPs need to ask themselves isn’t whether this bill is better than it was before the concessions. It’s whether this bill will leave disabled people worse off than they are now. The answer is obvious.That’s why I will vote against it. And that’s why I am calling on the government to withdraw the bill entirely.The government has treated this as a political problem to be solved before Tuesday’s vote. But it’s an artificial deadline. Why not postpone the vote and then use the next few months to get this right? Working with disabled people, we could design a welfare system that is fair and compassionate, that recognises the barriers disabled people face and provides the support they need to live full, independent lives.As we mark one year of Labour in government, this is about our values – and the kind of country we want to build.Richard Burgon is the MP for Leeds East and secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPsOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionWelfareBenefitsKeir StarmerDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

It hasn’t done us any goodMon 30 Jun 2025 07.13 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 11.50 EDTShareOur lesson today is taken from St Paul’s first letter tothe Corinthians, chapter 14, verse eight:“For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?”In the macho and combative world of Westminster politics, certainty is a highly valued commodity. If you are not decisive then you must be a ditherer. The logic, and the alliteration, are irresistible. Hence the prime minister’s current difficultyover three (count ’em!) recent U-turns: over the winter fuel allowance, a national inquiry into grooming gangs and now on proposed cuts to personal independence payments (Pip).U-turns are good news for reporters and political commentators. They provide an opportunity to confirm how insightful they are, and wise after the event (admittedly some are wise before the event). They also mean that the adjective “screeching” is likely to be used far too often, along with references to the smell of burning tyre rubber. Some words – unlike some policies – just stick. Older readers may remember that under the lastLabourgovernment it was compulsory for an extended time to refer to the transport secretary, Stephen Byers, as “the beleaguered Stephen Byers”.Why are U-turns always regarded as being such a bad thing? Isn’t it a good idea to change direction once you realise you are heading the wrong way? With the holiday season approaching, overheated children and spouses must brace themselves for that tense moment when the driver is told he has picked the wrong route, only for the man behind the wheel to declare grumpily: “No, I’ve decided, we’re sticking with the A591!” A no U-turns policy can make a Daddy Pig out of anyone.But what explains the enduring, emblematic power of the U-turn to make grown men and women in London SW1 tremble? Here we must point to the usual suspect,Margaret Thatcher. In October 1980, the Conservative party was heading to its annual conference in Brighton. The new Tory government was less than a year and a half old, but was already extremely unpopular and under intense political pressure. Unemployment and inflation were both high. Thatcher was seen as an inflexible and insensitive leader. Surely there would be an adjustment, and some acknowledgment of the severe economic pain the country was suffering?But, (in)famously, Mrs T said this in her conference speech: “To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say: you turn if you want to.The lady’s not for turning!”It did not matter that Thatcher may not have fully appreciated the joke which her speechwriter Ronald Millar had provided for her (a pun on the 1948 play The Lady’s Not For Burning by Christopher Fry). The line stuck. And the mythology around Thatcher began to grow: that she was resolute, unflinching, impervious to counter-arguments and determined never to change her mind.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher on the last day of the 1980 Conservative party conference in Brighton.Photograph: Peter Johns/taken from picture libraryBut hang on a minute. What happened only four months after she gave this speech, in February 1981? A government plan to close 23 coalmines was withdrawn in the face of opposition from the National Union of Mineworkers, then led by Joe Gormley. It was a complete and utter … U-turn. The headline on the BBC’s website where the story is featured says: “Thatcher gives in to miners”. People remember the moment when, three years later and with much higher coal stocks, Thatcher battled the miners again when the timing suited her better. This too fed into the “no U-turns” myth. But it was not the whole story.Westminster orthodoxy and the real world are not always in perfect alignment. In SW1-land, you can never go into a general election committed to any kind of tax rise. But if the current government had said that, if elected, it was going to reverse the second of Jeremy Hunt’s employee national insurance cuts how much happier (fiscally and politically) it might be today. The gap between what everybody in Westminster knows and what normal people think might also help explain why some free-wheeling populists like Nigel Farage get away with their bogus yet apparently “authentic”, so-called “common sense”.Starmer says he lost grip on Labour welfare revolt due to focus on foreign affairsRead moreNo one wants to be led by a vacillating or broken “shopping trolley” (the label Dominic Cummings applied to a chaotic Boris Johnson in No 10) that has no consistency or sense of direction. But it is OK to change your mind based on a fresh assessment of the evidence.In theiraward-winning 2006 book, Why Should Anyone Be Led By You?, Rob Goffee and the late Gareth Jones wrote about the power of leaders admitting to doubt and even, on occasion, weakness. “By exposing a measure of vulnerability, they make themselves approachable and show themselves to be human,” they wrote. It is possible that the parliamentary Labour party might agree with that. Until it changes its mind.So, U-turn if you want to. Perhaps you should. It beats going full steam into the rocks.Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre.

The cost was €1,000 a month – a bargain by market standards but still well over double what my downstairs neighbour, Henrika, paid under the lifelong social housing contract she had obtained four decades earlier.In the intervening years, Amsterdam had shifted from a pinnacle of inclusivity and progressive housing politics to one of Europe’s most unaffordable markets. In the last year, Dutch house prices have surged bymore than 10%, homelessnesshas risen by more than 20%, and rents in the private rental sector haveclimbed by more than 7%.Divides in Amsterdam’s rental system have never been starker. Outsiders – primarily young people, newcomers and lower earners – are increasingly forced into an overpriced, insecure rental market to access the city. Meanwhile, insiders – typically older residents who secured affordable homes under better conditions – are assured stability and a place to grow old. But they are not the villains in this story, just a reminder of how quickly housing politics have changed. So, how did this two-tier system come to be?Over the past 40 years, the general direction of Amsterdam’s housing policies has shifted, from prioritising social to private housing. There has been an underinvestment in affordable housing for lower-income groups and a deliberate shift towards market-based housing geared toward the affluent. The bigger political and ideological agenda behind this shift was to gradually transform the capital from a relatively poor workers’ city to a richer city for the middle classes.Encouraging home ownership was one strategy to invite richer residents. And historically low interest rates, easy access to credit and mortgage interest tax deductions offering clear incentives to buy meant home ownership used to be an achievable goal for many Dutch people. However, with the average property prices in Amsterdam rising beyond what even educated professionals could afford, efforts to attract and accommodate the middle classes have shifted from home ownership towards a transformation of the rental sector.Around 70% of the city’s population rents, but the social housing sector, where rents arecapped at €900 a month, has steadily shrunk. Social housing accounted for nearly 60% of the city’s rental housing in the late 1980s, with most new construction intended for this segment. However, decades of sell-offs, demolitions and limits in new construction have reduced social housing supply by a third since this point. Now, many local governments arestruggling to meet the 30% social housing targetin new housing projects, where the majority of new builds are aimed at higher-income residents.Chart showing how rental prices vary in EuropePreviously, social housing in theNetherlandswas available to both low- and middle-income households, driven by social-democratic values of inclusivity and social cohesion. Access has been gradually restricted to lower earners, and even those who qualify face long waiting lists – over a decade in high-demand areas such as Amsterdam. This starkly contrasts with the past. Young Amsterdammers could register for social housing at 18 and expect to secure a permanent home within a few years – a luxury that seems unimaginable to today’s newcomers looking for affordable housing in the city.With both social housing and home ownership out of reach, the Dutch government turned to the market to address shortages. The private rental sector hasmore than tripled in sizein Amsterdam in the last two decades. A key strategy of expansion was loosening regulation: short-term leases replaced lifelong rental contracts, and price ceilings were removed on a growing share of properties. With the sector becoming more attractive to investors, everything from small-scale landlords, real-estate investment trusts and big companies such as Blackstone began to look to Amsterdam’s private rental market as a place to park their cash. Now, a quarter of properties in major Dutch cities are owned by investors. Between 2007 and 2020, an estimated €23bn in rental real-estate transactions by institutional investors took place in Amsterdam. This makes it one of Europe’s hottest institutional investment markets, falling only just short of London.With growing concerns over theever-worsening housing crisis, there have been recent attempts to calm the rental sector and curb investor purchases. Measures such as limiting short-term rental contracts andrestricting rentals in homes under a certain valuehave had some success in prompting some investors to sell up. While this may free up properties for lower-income residents and first-time buyers, it is yet to be seen how far these will go in addressing house prices and continually rising rental costs.Single rooms in shared housesfrequently fetch €1,000 a month, and spending half of an income on rent is not unusual any more. It is unsurprising that stories of young people being unable to move out of the parental home, sharing well into their 30s, orpostponing graduation to keep their student housinghave become commonplace. For thoseunable to find an affordable home, housing policy isn’t just about economics – it shapes their entire lives. It stalls independence, strips away stability, and puts futures on hold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have mobilised the mass dissatisfaction with housing to push racist and anti-migration sentiments. This was seen clearly during therunup to the November 2023 election, which resulted in the first far-right win in recent history.Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-Islam Freedom party, blamed labour migrants, asylum seekers and foreign students for monopolising housing supply and driving up prices.During my six-month sublet, I spent many nights listening to Henrika’s tales of Amsterdam in the past. Her stories left me wondering how people could continue to build a life in the city without wealth or privilege, the way she had done. They left me questioning the city’s future, and whether it would remain a place of creativity, openness and diversity if it continued to transition to a playground for the rich. Mostly, they left me doubting whether the recent wave of housing regulations would be enough to undo a housing crisis decades in the making, or if they’ve come too little, too late.Amber Howard is a researcher in social policy at the University of Bristol.

Mass defiance suggests a shift in the political zeitgeistMon 30 Jun 2025 13.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 15.23 EDTShareIn late 1980s Hungary, courageous environmentalprotestsagainst an unpopular dam project played a part in the eventual collapse of the country’s communist regime. Originally focused on protecting the quality of drinking water for about 3 million Hungarians, some of the largest demonstrations seen since the 1956 revolution came also to symbolise a wider rejection of one-party political rule. An era was coming to an end, as authority began to drain away.It would be premature to predict a similar fate for Viktor Orbán’sself-styled“illiberal” government, which presides over what the European parliament has described as a “hybrid regime of electoral autocracy”. Mr Orbán has ruthlessly consolidated his power since becoming prime minister in 2010, not least through gradually exercising a suffocating hold across the media and civil society. But the extraordinary events of the weekend, after his government’s attempts tobanBudapest’s annual Pride parade, suggest a new vulnerability.Organisers had hoped that maybe 40,000 people would brave intimidation, possible fines and the controversial use of facial-recognition technology, after an amendment to Hungary’s constitution allowed LGBTQ+ events to be designated a threat to children. In the event, on a scorching summer’s day in Budapest, theyestimatedthat between 185,000 and 200,000 may have turned up in solidarity. It was, by far, the biggest Pride event ever to be held in the city. Out on the streets were large numbers of first-timers, parents with sons and daughters, and demonstrators fromacrossthe mainstream political spectrum.The scale of this backlash points to a significant prime ministerial own-goal. Trailing his former ally turned bitter critic,Péter Magyar, by a substantial margin in polls, Mr Orbán chose to target the LGBTQ+ community, just as he has targeted migrants in the past. In attempting to become the first European Union leader to ban Pride, his principal aim was to rally support across the right, goad Brussels and set a polarising trap for Mr Magyar. But the outcome was the largest anti‑government demonstration since 2010, and a mass mobilisation in defence of the broader principles of freedom of assembly and minority rights.Mr Magyar, who did not attend the march,limitedhimself on Saturday to criticising Mr Orbán’s perennial efforts to “turn Hungarian against Hungarian, in order to create fear and divide us”. Eschewing the prime minister’s culture wars, his Tisza party has focused campaigning relentlessly on living standards, healthcare and corruption. In a country that, on Mr Orbán’s watch, has become one of thepoorestin the EU, that is a sensible approach.But the size of thePrideturnout should stiffen sinews in Brussels if, as seems inevitable, Mr Orbán resorts to ever more desperate tactics to retain power. More than 70 MEPs took part in the march, and the equalities commissioner, Hadja Lahbib, was also in Budapest to meet civil society organisations. Overall, though, Brussels’s response to Mr Orbán’s provocation was constrained by a fear of being seen to interfere in the lead-up to next spring’s election.That now looks like a misreading of the national mood. Freedom of assembly and non-discrimination are core, non-negotiable values that must be respected by any EU member state. As they passed in such numbers over Erzsébet Bridge, with the Danube below, Saturday’s marchers made that point in unforgettable fashion.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pamuk created asmall museumof everyday objects based on the novel in celebration of his home city of Istanbul. A long way from the Bosphorous, this is whatBeamish, the Living Museum of the Northsets out to do, recreating the 19th- and 20th-century working-class history of north-east England over 350 acres in County Durham. Last week it won the prestigious Art Fund museum of the year award.Theshortlistincluded museums from the UK’s four nations:Perth Museum, which opened last year;Chapter, a multi-arts space in Cardiff;Golden Thread, a contemporary arts hub in Belfast; andCompton Verney, an 18th-century Warwickshire mansion, whose sculpture park is home to Louise Bourgeois’s Spider.Inspired by the open-air museums in Scandinavia, Beamish was founded byFrank Atkinson, who became its curator in 1970. At the time, his vision of rebuilding a slag heap really did mean taking coals to Newcastle, but he recognised that the region’s industries, and with them its identity, was in danger of disappearing. The people of north-east England “tended to have a chip on their shoulder about their past, proud of it and yet feeling that it was undervalued”,he said. “The museum was for them. Tourism didn’t exist up there when we first planned it.”Where many museums have struggled to return to pre-pandemic figures, last year Beamish welcomed839,000 visitors– the highest number in its 55 years. As part of a£20m development project, a 1950s village has been added to its Edwardian town, with miners’ cottages and a farm. Buildings from the surrounding area have been transported brick by brick and many of the 3m objects have been donated from people’s attics.From teapots to trolleybuses, this is the ephemera of ordinary lives. More than 800 local volunteers and staff in period costumes bring the past alive. There are no glass walls, velvet ropes or wall captions. You can buy bread from the Victorian bakery, pat pit ponies and get a 50s bouffant blow‑dry at the hairdressers.This is clearly a sanitised version of the past, where you can go down a pit without getting your hands dirty. The cultural historian Robert Hewison included Beamish in what he identified as a Thatcherite phenomenon of ersatz nostalgia and commercialisation: “Instead of manufacturing goods, we are manufacturing heritage,” he wrote in his 1987 polemicThe Heritage Industry.In a region where the waiting list for social housing hasincreaseddramatically in the last five years, an idyllic “model” village might have been expected to cause resentment. Instead,research showsthat it is a source of pride. Local museums tell local stories. They also employ local people and bring in visitors. In its first year,Perth Museumexceeded its visitor target by 50%, whilecity-centre footfall also increased.For many, museums are as much a part of the British summer as music festivals and sporting events. They are certainly a lot cheaper. With the world’s treasures in our pockets, and limitless information at our fingertips, today’s museums must offer something more, especially for children. Long before mobile phones, Beamish was one of the first immersive museum experiences. Here the past is not a foreign country – you can get there on a tram.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The all-British clash featured two players – attired similarly in matching outfits and golf visors – who captivated the home crowd.While Raducanu has been a fan favourite since her fairytale 2021 US Open triumph, the grand slam ­debutant Xu, ranked No 300 in the world, has impressed in junior circuits and shown significant promise on the senior tour.Wimbledon 2025 day one: Raducanu eases through, Alcaraz survives huge scare, and more – liveRead more“It was an interesting dynamic today,” Raducanu said. “It is really awkward playing a Brit, especially someone younger. I think the crowd were great both ways and it was nice for [Xu] to receive that sort of welcome and support.”The celebratory mood of two ­Britons facing off led to some fans popping a champagne bottle, with the cork landing on the court in front of the world No 40. “It was a first. Pretty entertaining, though. I am glad [the crowd] were having a good time. It kind of loosened me up a bit. But I couldn’t reach it [to have a sip].”Despite the party atmosphere, reality came crashing down for Xu in her first tour meeting with­Raducanu. The gulf in class was evident from the start. Raducanu’s powerful forehands down the line, blistering serves and astute court craft allowed her to seize control immediately. Xu’s opening service game began with a double fault, foreshadowing a series of errors that led to a break in the first game.View image in fullscreenThe British No 1 was never in trouble during her straight sets victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA stunning ace from the more experienced player left Xu rooted to the spot, followed by a backhand winner that secured the British No 1’s first service game to love, winning eight of the first nine points of the match.For the 17-year-old, this match was a cascade of firsts. The Welsh player, who watched aged 13 as ­Raducanu won the US Open, under­standably struggled early on, ­exhibiting weak serves and even slipping on court twice in the fourth game.Despite an assured hold to get on the scoreboard, Xu’s attempts at tricky drop shots often backfired, allowing her opponent to establish a 4-2 lead. Raducanu secured another break before a strong service game from Xu that included a scorching 116mph serve. Nonetheless, she was consistently playing catchup, battling hard to hold her own serve but ultimately failing to break Raducanu, and conceded the first set 6-3.The second set started as more of the same, with Raducanu asserting her authority. A backhand beyond Xu’s reach and a double fault contributed to the younger Briton ­facing three break points. Xu saved two, including one with a service winner, and clawed her way to deuce. A well-executed smash at the net even prompted a rare moment of frustration from Raducanu.The momentum shifted back when Xu hit a drop shot into the net, forced by an 80mph return from Raducanu. Back at deuce, Xu saved a fourth break point with an ace, but Raducanu responded with two formidable forehands – one down the line, one crosscourt – beyond Xu’s reach, finally converting the break for a 2-0 lead.Raducanu consolidated with three consecutive aces in her subsequent service game with pinpoint accuracy. But against the run of play, and from 40-0 down, Xu remarkably broke back. She forced deuce with a forehand winner, then capitalised on a long lob from Raducanu to snatch the game.View image in fullscreenMimi Xu makes a backhand return.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APRaducanu broke straight back before racing to a 30-0 lead on her serve again, only for Xu to ­capitalise on a weak first serve. Xu’s backhand winner secured another break point before finishing the game on a high with a forehand high and hard across court, well out of her ­opponent’s reach.Yet as much as Xu’s confidence grew in the second set, Raducanu never wavered, breaking back once again with a forehand down the line to make it 4-2 and conclude five breaks of serve in a row between the pair of them.The British No 1 ultimately mana­ged to fend off the late threats and recovered from 30-0 down in the final game to serve out the match.Up next for Raducanu isMarketa Vondrousova, who won her first and only grand slam title at Wimbledon in 2023 and, more recently, was vic­torious on grass at the Berlin Openin late June, beating Madison Keys and the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka en route. “Amazing grass player,” Raducanu said of the Czech. “I am going to need to play really well to get over the line.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Folks could be heading for a stroll in Cannon Hill Park, or their weekly shop at Aldi, only to suddenly find themselves watching Jasprit Bumrah let fly.Steve Smith plots return for second West Indies Test after baseball cage hitoutRead moreSadly, the fences were covered with tarpaulins after some hecklers over the weekend. There was a decent subplot playing out inside as India trained, too, over whether Bumrah will play the sold-out second Test that starts . Having bowled these past few days, the man himself offered a passing “hopefully”.Things are not so straightforward here. The plan has long been that India’s spearhead plays three of the five Tests to manage his lower back, something reaffirmed by Gautam Gambhir, the head coach, after the loss at Headingley. Now trailing 1-0 in the series, and with Bumrah having had a week to recover from that match, one would think this is the time to play the second of those three cards.Yet with the third Test starting a week on Thursday at Lord’s, the ground where every touring cricketer wants to play, it sounds like he may yet be held back.Ryan ten Doeschate, India’s assistant coach, hinted as much, saying Bumrah was “ready to play”, before going on to add that, with possible rain in Birmingham at the weekend, and Edgbaston a typically flat surface, they are still to decide their configuration.“We feel we can go 1-1 or keep the score at 1-0 without Jasprit,” said Ten Doeschate. “That is putting the eggs at the back [of the series]. But we are going to need him at some stage. You have to decide when to play your strongest suit. Whatever team we put out there, we can compete in this Test match.”Thoughts go back to England’s disastrous Ashes tour in 2021-22, when they went 1-0 down and then immediately rested Mark Wood for the second Test in Adelaide. Wood took 17 wickets during that 4-0 defeat but 12 of them came after the urn was lost. Sometimes teams can overthink the future at the expense of the situation staring them in the face, even if England are wary of seeing this as an opportunity.View image in fullscreenMoeen Ali joins England at training in a coaching capacity.Photograph: Jacob King/PA“The worry for us would be to focus too much on [Bumrah],” said Chris Woakes, who will lead the England bowlers on his home ground. “You have to look at their whole attack, and what they bring to the table, and how you can combat the skills they bring. India have got guys that can come in and cause us issues.”Even with possible rain showers, India eyeing a draw against an England team that scores at 4.5 runs per over – something that in turn broadens the canvas for taking 20 wickets – is high risk.Ten Doeschate also hinted at India playing two slow bowlers the options being an attacking wrist-spinner in Kuldeep Yadav or the off-spinning all-rounder Washington Sundar.If the latter, it would probably be with half an eye on scoring the lower-order runs that were missing at Headingley – a potentially negative outlook when taking only 15 of the 20 English wickets was the bigger problem.Better catching would help, with Monday’syesterday’s training session suggesting Yashasvi Jaiswal will be whipped out of the gully position after three costly drops in Leeds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may not be Moeen’s only encounter with India this year, with South Africa understood to be interested in him joining their coaching staff for a Test tour there in November.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Fifpro is calling for extra measures to protect footballers after what it describes as the “wake-up call” of the Club World Cup, which has beenplagued by extreme temperaturesover the past two weeks.Fifa protocols allow for a cooling break lasting for three minutes in each half if temperature thresholds are exceeded. According to Fifpro’s medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, an extended half-time break would provide a necessary additional tool in helping to keep players’ core temperatures within their normal range.Harry Kane sinks Flamengo to set up Bayern Munich’s Club World Cup tie with PSGRead more“A cooling break generally lasts three minutes and they are designed to decrease the [player’s] temperature through the use of ice,” he said. “But we are lacking the evidence in terms of what is the optimal duration for a cooling break. A half-time of 15 minutes might not be enough to decrease the core temperature. So a lot of research is being done into alternative mitigation strategies and it could be that a half-time of 20 minutes is significant. It has been shown [to work] in the laboratory. Together with the national [players’] union in Portugal, we are going to test this kind of mitigation strategy in August.”Complaints from players and coaches at theClub World Cupover temperatures in the US that have breached 40C have been a theme of the tournament. Fifpro’s general secretary, Alex Phillips, said the organisation had been engaging with Fifa over the issue during the past fortnight and that progress had been made.“We are partially happy because Fifa have been quite responsive once the tournament was under way,” Phillips said. “So they have actually modified how they have been dealing with heat during the matches based on Fifpro’s input.“Obviously, it would have been better if that had happened in advance, but it’s better that they have adapted and they’ve put in place various different mitigation measures. There’s additional water around the pitch, towels and so on, and the threshold for the cooling breaks has come down. So there has been a positive reaction from Fifa, which is good.“But going forward, it’s not just Fifa. It’s any competition organiser staging tournaments in this kind of heat. Their protocols [need to] reflect more of the good practice in Australia, US and other countries that deal with this week after week in their national leagues.”In the US, for example, they do not stage MLS games at midday in Florida and in Australia there are thresholds for the delay or postponement of matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it might not just relate to, let’s say, off-season breaks of the players but also to other issues that relate to player welfare or safe attendance by spectators, or the performance on the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025FifaClub World CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her 12 goals in the Women’s Super League played an integral role in the Gunners’ second-place finish and earned her a share of the Golden Boot, alongside Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw. She was also Arsenal’s top scorer in their run to securing the Champions League. Her productivity in front of goal has been the biggest improvement to her game.If Euro 2022 was Russo’s breakout tournament and the 2023 World Cup the one where she came of age, this summer is a chance for the 26-year-old to stamp her authority as one of the best strikers on the continent. Her game is about much more than just her finishing ability, with her strong hold-up play, aerial presence and pressing ability all assets. She sets the tone for England from the front and has become a quiet leader in the squad.Lea Schüller (Germany)The 27-year-old Schüller is an instinctive striker and her form for club and country this season has made her one to watch. She amassed 16 goals in all competitions as Bayern Munich claimed their first domestic double with the striker scoring a hat-trick in the DFB Pokal final against Werder Bremen.Schüller is a constant in the international setup and has been part of the squad at the last four major tournaments. She was Germany’s top scorer when they claimed the bronze medal at last summer’s Olympics and was similarly prolific in their latest Nations League campaign. Her five goals in the group stage played a key role in helping Christian Wück’s team to this autumn’s semi-finals. In a team full of attacking talent, she provides the focal point up front, supported by Klara Bühl, Jule Brand and Laura Freigang.View image in fullscreenLea Schüller scores against Poland in a Euro 2025 qualifier in May last year.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersClàudia Pina (Spain)In a team full of stars, Pina is threatening to shine the brightest. The 23-year-old has taken the headlines this season with some sensational performances.Pina’s potential has never been in doubt, with her natural technical ability and eye for goal clear. At the age of 13 in 2014-15 she scored 100 goals in 20 appearances for Barcelona’s Infantin-Alevín youth side (a season in which her team scored 279 goals in 21 games), and she made her senior debut at 16. Her 24 goals in all competitions this season helped Pere Romeu’s team secure a domestic treble, while she finished top scorer in the Champions League. Her 25-minute cameo in the first leg of the semi-final against Chelsea, in which she registered two goals and one assist, was particularly memorable.She returned to the national setup in 2024 after a two-year absence. She was one of“Las 15”– the group of players who demanded better conditions from the Spanish football federation in 2022 – and subsequently ruled herself out of the 2023 World Cup. Her recent gamechangingdouble against Englandsent Montse Tomé’s side into the Nations League semi-finals.Lineth Beerensteyn (Netherlands)Over the last two seasons, Beerensteyn has started to realise her potential, finding the kind of form many expected from her when she first broke into the Dutch setup. In the absence of Vivianne Miedema, she has stepped up to lead the line. She finished as the Netherlands’ top scorer in Euro 2025 qualifying and in their recent Nations League campaign.Domestically, she has also been prolific, winning the Frauen Bundesliga Golden Boot with Wolfsburg. It was a disappointing domestic campaign for the She-Wolves, who finished second behind Bayern Munich. Beerensteyn’s 16 goals, however, meant she matched Hoffenheim’s Selina Cerci at the top of the scoring charts.The pacy 28-year-old can play anywhere across the front line. An injury towards the end of the season is a slight concern but the Dutch coach, Andries Jonker, seems confident she will be fit for the summer.Esther González (Spain)González’s four goals in her last four games for Spain have put her in the frame to be their first-choice No 9 this summer.The 32-year-old is one of a handful of the Spanish squad to play abroad and has taken the National Women’s Soccer League by storm since joining Gotham FC in August 2023. She scored the goal thatwon them their first NWSL Championshipa few months after joining and has been prolific at club level in the first half of this season.González has been in and out of the national side since making her debut in 2016. She scored against England in theirquarter-final defeat at Euro 2022and captained the side on a couple of occasions at the 2023 World Cup. She has struggled to nail down a consistent starting role but her impressive recent form might change that in Switzerland.View image in fullscreenEsther González lines up a shot in the Nations League game against England.Photograph: Eric Alonso/Getty ImagesMarie-Antoinette Katoto (France)Katoto is one of the most naturally talented forwards in the women’s game. Her domestic career to date has been played solely at Paris Saint-Germain. In the decade after making her senior debut, the 26-year-old racked up 180 goals in 223 appearances. She finished as their leading goalscorer in the 2024-25 season, her 12 Première Ligue goals helping them to a second-place finish in what turned out to be her final season at the club before this summer’s move to Lyon.The tall striker is now looking to make her mark on the international stage. Her Euro 2022 was heartbreaking – sheruptured an anterior cruciate ligamentin the group stage – and she failed to recover in time for the World Cup, so last year’s Olympics was her first major tournament for the national team. She finished as the Golden Boot winner on home soil despite France’s quarter-final exit and will be eager to replicate that form in Switzerland.A special mention should go to Ewa Pajor, who will be captaining Poland in their first major tournament. Being placed in Group C with Germany, Denmark and Sweden is a tough challenge for the newcomers but Pajor’s stats cannot be ignored. She finished her first season at Barcelona with 43 goals in 46 appearances and will looking to continue that form as her nation makes history this summer.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballEngland women's football teamGermany women's football teamSpain women's football teamNetherlands women's football teamFrance women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you give me that option today, I’ll bite your hand off. I want to be in the World Cup final competing to win a World Cup so, whoever you’re facing, it’s going to be a top, top side, and I don’t get emotional about it – it’s England but I’m repping the USA so my focus is on the USA.View image in fullscreenCould it be a USA v England World Cup final in 2027?Photograph: Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images for USSFWhat sets good coaches apart from great coaches?Amalia, AustraliaNumber one: to be a great leader you have to show great empathy and a great understanding, that helps you connect with people. Yes, natural emotional intelligence levels will help, but you have to develop the skills to be able to bring the best out of people. Number two: have clarity in your vision so everybody can align to that and they know what they’re signing up to. And number three: don’t be afraid to be vulnerable with them. You can’t always be right, so remember they’re partners with you. You go along the journey of coaching teams where, even as the leader, the team’s insights and their guidance should form a part of the narrative, because they play the game, they know it, and their experiences of it are equally as valid as your direction as the leader.What are you most looking forward to about the Women’s Euros?Kevin, BirminghamThe closeness in games. I want to see more games being tougher to win because then coaching comes into it. You get to see more coaching when the matches are tighter.Euro 2025 is sure to showcase just how far women’s football has come | Emma HayesRead moreAs someone who understands the global game and its power to unify, what do you think US Soccer should be doing to help rural communities, like ours in western Montana, grow the game where there are no lights, few coaches and limited infrastructure but a deep hunger to play?Nick Lawyer, MontanaIn the US, so much focus is about “pay to play” and I hope that, with the Soccer Forward legacy programmes of 26 and 31 [the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2031 women’s World Cup] that we’re really started to develop more connections with communities that don’t have the same access to the sport.Do you feel the USWNT players who play in the NWSL are at a competitive disadvantage to those playing in Europe?Rob Coughlin, ChicagoThe NWSL and the European leagues are competitive, but they are different experiences. The Champions League offers something that the NWSL cannot, but that is changing. The parity in the NWSL, week-in, week-out, and the competitiveness of the league, ensures there is always a top fixture every week, so it’s the diversity piece that’s different. In Europe you get the Champions League but the development of the Concacaf W Champions Cup – which Gotham FC recently won – will help to bridge that gap.In your vision to remake women’s soccer in the US, what are the top-three actions you most want and hope to see from NWSL clubs?Luke, PortlandThe first will be to just keep adding to their own staff, so they’re providing the players with all the professional services in and around them in a deeper way. The second is keep attracting the best quality to the NWSL because it helps our own players develop when they’re playing in the best training environments with the best players. And expansion, because it is another step in the right direction, showing that the game is developing.What skills should young American players with nationalteam ambitions be practising in their back yards?Marissa, DenverHit the ball against the wall, practice one-v-ones, do rebound balls – you develop your own technical stuff by practising a lot of your tight-area skills and ball control.View image in fullscreenBarcelona are among a number of clubs who provide online coaching courses for fans looking to enhance their coaching skills.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAWhat can young players do to increase their tactical awareness and knowledge of the game, particularly if they harbour ambitions of being a coachwhen they are older?Chris Wragg, BournemouthThere are a couple of things: watch football and try to watch it through the lens of a coach, not as a fan. Educate yourself, but outside England. Don’t just go to your run-of-the-mill location, go to somewhere like Barcelona’s innovation hub and see if you can do some positional play coach education courses and go to other countries where you can experience different coach education.Thanks for all the wonderful work you did at Chelsea. First, would you like to manage England one day? Second, have you dropped the F-bomb on US live TV yet and, if so, what was the reaction?Peter Collins, LondonI’m always sceptical that people can’t use the F-bomb in the right context, but I’d say I think I’ve refrained from it for now – I’ve been working on that. As for managing England one day, I’ll never say never.If the world’s most expensive footballer cost around £200m – Neymar’s fee when moving to Paris Saint-Germain – how much is the world’s best football manager worth?Rick, LondonA manager, like a player in many regards, is someone “on the team”, but someone who is heading that up. You can see with the fees for managers as they stand, when buying them out of contracts, the transfer fee isn’t at that same amount as players but they certainly are expensive amounts. I don’t think managers’ fees will ever be that of a player because of marketing reasons, which is also why players’ transfer fees are that high. You can sell players’ shirts, but we don’t sell managers’ shirts so I don’t think their fees will ever meet that same level.Do you think Chelsea paying recordtransfer fees season after season is good for the Women’s Super League? You were against WSL introducing fair-spending levels. Was this because it would have stopped Chelsea efforts in winning the Champions League?Ted Harvey, IpswichI know Naomi Girma is worth at least $1m, at least.

Bitter because you probably would have preferred it to be Chelsea who won, but also sweet because you were assistant coach to Vic Akers last time Arsenal won the trophy in 2007. Also, when you and Renée Slegers talked before the final, what advice did you give her?Ingrid, New ZealandIt was far from bittersweet. Arsenal were a massive part of my life since I was 10. I coached there for a long time so I was delighted for them. I brought Renée to England as an academy player in 2006 so I’ve had a strong relationship with her and I’m so impressed with her. She’s incredible, she did an amazing job, and, yes, we did speak in the week leading up to the game, but she doesn’t need my help. She’s got that under control and I’m very happy to see an English team win it.Your coaching career goes back to when there were a lot more independent clubs run without the backing of a pre-existing men’s team. Now only two in the WSL and WSL2 run independently. Do you think this will ever changeor are the majority of successful women’s team going to be operated by men’s clubs?Liam, Newcastle-under-LymeWe’re potentially going to see more independent teams and that’s a good thing. Both can exist, but having strong independent women’s teams with strong ownership can only aid the development of the game.Toone scores twice in England’s easy test against Jamaica ahead of EurosRead moreThomas Tuchel resigns tomorrow – do you want the job?

Then it was time for Giles to do likewise with Bryan Mbeumo, who is the subject of a bid from Manchester United. Brentford value their 20-goal top scorer from last season at about £65m. United are nearly there with it.“We’ve made our point clear,” Giles said. “If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.” With that, Giles glanced at the man to his left – the newBrentfordhead coach, Keith Andrews, presumably the source of said headache if Mbeumo were to leave.Football transfer rumours: Arsenal join Premier League race for Hugo Ekitike?Read moreWhat a summer it has been so far at the west London club. The longstanding manager, Thomas Frank, has gone to Tottenham, together with three key members of staff, including the assistant, Justin Cochrane. Now the team are being picked over. The goalkeeper Mark Flekken has left for Bayer Leverkusen.This is the backdrop to the appointment of Andrews and it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room at the Gtech Community Stadium; the 44‑year‑old has no previous experience as a manager. But here he is, about to succeed an authentic club legend in Frank and cut his teeth in the “toughest league in the world” (Andrews’s own description). Is Giles completely sure about this?The short answer is yes. The longer one, delivered over 45 minutes on Monday afternoon by him and Andrews, illustrated why there are actually no headaches or stresses. It might look like upheaval but internally at the club it is considered as smooth and easy evolution.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank has departed for Tottenham along with other key members of staff.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockAt Brentford every player, every member of staff, has a price. Frank’s was £10m, which Spurs met, albeit the final portion of his release clause is understood to be payable if performance-related targets are reached. Nørgaard and Mbeumo have theirs. If and when they are triggered, there will be no wailing or soul-searching, only pragmatism; the identification and nurturing of their replacements.It is what Brentford have done for a long time, certainly since Matthew Benham bought in as the owner in June 2012 with the club in League One and began to change everything with his data-based approach. Caoimhín Kelleher, who has joined from Liverpool, looks a smart successor to Flekken. Brentford’s faith in their model is unshakable.“If a club comes in for a player or member of staff and you find yourself saying: ‘We cannot sell them under any circumstances,’ you probably have to look at yourself as to why you put yourself in a position where that person is so important that it’s impossible to do anything about that,” Giles said.“Most of the time when the big clubs are coming in for your players, it’s been an opportunity for them. So, yeah, pretty relaxed about the transfer ins and outs. If the players we’ve mentioned stay, then great. If they leave, it will be on our terms.”Like Frank before him, Andrews has been promoted from within, having joined last summer as the set-piece coach. It is an interesting detail that the club’s past five promotion-winning managers, going back to 1991-92, were internal appointments. Frank got Brentford up and out of the Championship in 2020‑21. Before him, the successes were provided by Mark Warburton, Andy Scott, Ron Noades and Phil Holder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for us.”View image in fullscreenKeith Andrews joined Brentford last year as the set-piece coach.Photograph: Tony O Brien/ReutersThe important thing to say about Andrews’s coaching career is that it has been a long time in production. And he is not just about set pieces, however much he impressed in that area last season – offensively and defensively. He started coaching during his playing days at Blackburn, taking the club’s under‑14s at the age of 29.There have been short-lived assistant manager roles at MK Dons in the Championship and Sheffield United in the Premier League, either side of a five-year stint with his native Republic of Ireland, first with the under-21s and then the seniors.Andrews spoke well at his presentation, personable as usual, promising to be himself and draw upon his varied experiences, including those from his 12-club, 16‑season playing career that took in time in all four English divisions and 35 caps for Ireland. It is tempting to say he has seen it all. Except that it is only just beginning.Explore more on these topicsBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The good news is that in return he’s about to become reacquainted with something he has missed as much. For some players, this is a competition too far, played on poor pitches in half-empty stadiums and suffocating heat, something they could do without, but it has been good for Real Madrid’s captain, something to aim at.Now, 270 days later and 4,400 miles away, just as theClub World Cupgets real, he is back to face Juventus in the last 16 in Miami. “And I know what I’m like: if they let me loose, there’ll be no fear,” he says.Bellingham and Vinícius shine as Real Madrid top group at Club World CupRead moreCarvajal has not played since October 2024, when in the final moments of Villarreal’s visit to the Santiago Bernabéu he tore the anterior cruciate ligament, the fibular collateral ligament and the popliteus tendon in his right knee. At 32 years old, a European champion with club and country, fourth in the Ballon d’Or three weeks later, it came at the worst time, or so it seemed. Carvajal, though, believes it came at the best moment, personally and professionally – which, in the end, go together in a long process that has been psychological as well as physical. Now here he is at Madrid’s Palm Beach HQ before training. Just one more session before he is back in the squad.“If it had happened when I was younger, I think I would have gone over and over it much more, it would have eaten at my mind,” Carvajal says. “Until you go through it, you don’t know the impact. But it happened at a mature moment when thanks to my family, my kids, I have a much more structured life, which has alleviated [the process] and helped me recover better. If I had been younger, without my wife, I would have worried more, wondered if I was really going to be come back 100%.”The Club World Cuphelped. “It has been very good for me to have an objective, to be able to say: ‘I want to get there.’ Because if not, I would have reached fitness on the summer [with nothing happening]. Maybe [in terms of performance level] it would have been better for this competition to have fallen next year or the one after, when I could have started on the same level as everyone else, but I will never know that. I have adapted to the circumstances and it has been very good for me to be here, to be back with my teammates, train fully. It’s been two weeks now with them and, thank God, I am ready.”“I have had a very stable recovery, very even. I have been setting very, very short-term objectives and also trying to break the injury-recovery routine when I could, with my family and kids, enjoying being with them. Whether planned or not, you’re not playing, not travelling, and I have been able to create a connection with them that’s been very special, really spectacular. I said to my wife that I have never missed anyone like I have missed them in this trip.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso during training in the US for the Club World Cup.Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters“There are moments when it’s a pain being injured but I woke up every day feeling that I had the energy and happiness to take it on. If I needed to go to the gym, or use a crutch to walk, well, you do it. I have managed it very well. I thought I would be climbing the walls but, far from it: I approached every phase, every challenge, with an enthusiasm.“There has been no complications in the knee. You know it’s practically a year before you’re in perfect physical condition, until you have that sharpness; understanding that is the most important thing, not to rush, not to hurry. It’s been almost nine months.“I took this competition as a challenge, an objective, so that I could have a target but always being realistic, aware of the situation I was in. A month and a half ago, I would have said I can’t see it [returning to the team], because I felt I wasn’t ready but now I see myself as ready to compete.

Xabi Alonso’s structure may open an opportunity as a third centre-back on the right side and if there is one thing that has always defined Carvajal it is a fierce competitiveness. Alexander-Arnold won’t simply be handed his spot, that’s for sure. The knowing smile when Carvajal talks about new signings tells you that.‘Trent’ brings fluency and ‘impeccable’ Spanish to grand Real Madrid unveilingRead more“Trent has adapted phenomenally well, he has got on with everyone fantastically,” he says. “He has been super friendly: when we have had an afternoon off, he has come with everyone to eat, he seems a very, very good lad. He already knew Jude [Bellingham] but it’s with everyone. And, professionally, it’s normal: at every team there are new signings, new players, and I took that as a personal challenge too: I love to compete, I love to have challenges in front of me. I hope that healthy competition can make the team even better.“As for the position: I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it, because if the manager asks me to play on the left wing I play in the left wing. It’s not something that concerns me, far from it. I just want to help.

The club werebanned last week from paying transfer feesuntil January 2027 for exceeding “30 days of late payments” to players in the previous 12 months, having also paid salaries late in March and missed payroll seven times in the past four years.The EFL is monitoring the situation closely and is expected to refer Wednesday to an independent commission, with a longer transfer embargo, fine and points deduction among the sanctions open to it. The Professional Footballers’ Association is also involved and providing support to the players.Röhl is also expected to leave and was not at the training ground when most of the players reported back last Thursday for pre-season. All of the German’s coaching staff are out of contract from Tuesday, and he is understood to be negotiating his own severance terms.The club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, is willing to sell Wednesday and has received offers from at least two US consortiums, but neither has met his valuation. The Thai businessman has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on Wednesday over the past decade, but his source of funding has dried up as a result of the declining profitability of his family’s food empire, the Thai Union Group.The EFL and PFA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Not only had the Gloucester scrum-half been performing well but his unfortunate early exit with a torn hamstring means the squad’s Welsh representation is now so skinny it can fit into a single pair of jeans.While that inevitably places extra responsibility on Jac Morgan’s shoulders as the last Welsh player standing, it also tweaks the bigger picture at scrum-half.Injury rules Tomos Williams out of rest of tour in blow for British & Irish LionsRead moreBen White has been summoned from Scotland’s tour of New Zealand to be Williams’s replacement and now has an opportunity to vie with Alex Mitchell for a place in the matchday 23 for the best-of-three Test series.Even at this juncture, though, the Lions’ first-choice half-back combo is all too obvious. The arranged marriage between Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell has been delayed by a niggling injury to the former but the pair will be united for the first time when the Lions play the Queensland Reds on Wednesday.The mere fact Russell is the solitary squad member asked to back up fromlast Saturdayshows the management’s urgent desire to see their twin playmakers combine on the field. The only question now is how long the partnership will take to flourish; previously these have been rivals seeking to stifle each other’s talents.Gibson-Park, 33, has played with numerous talented fly-halves in his time, not least Johnny Sexton who is a contrasting character to the ever-smiling Russell. It is Gibson-Park’s firm belief, though, that he and Russell could have a productive and exciting future together.View image in fullscreenFinn Russell is the only Lion who started against Western Force on Saturday to double up.Photograph: Trevor Collens/AP“He’s a hugely impressive player, isn’t he?” said Gibson-Park, finally recovered from the strained glute that forced him to miss the United Rugby Championship final.“Every team he’s in he has a huge impact. I can only speak from the times I’ve come up against him and the preparation time it takes to try to limit what he is able to bring. That in itself is a huge compliment to him.”The Lions head coach, Andy Farrell, has seen enough of Gibson-Park to regard him as potentially a linchpin in his Test side. “It’s there for all to see. I don’t say this lightly: he’s 100% a world-class player and he would make any team better. His speed of play is like it is because his speed of thought is ahead of the game.”Quick GuideLions team to face Queensland RedsShowBritish & Irish Lions: Keenan; Freeman, Jones, Aki, Van der Merwe; Russell, Gibson-Park; Porter, Kelleher, Stuart, Itoje (capt), Chessum, Curry, Morgan, Conan.Replacements: Cowan-Dickie, Genge, Bealham, Ryan, Earl, Mitchell, F Smith, Ringrose.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Blend the two together and the Lions are hoping for an instant rapport, even if Gibson-Park accepts that not all great half-back pairings are forged overnight. “There is a gelling period with any 9/10 combination. We have spent some nice time together off the pitch, which is hugely important … and hopefully we can see it out there on Wednesday.”It will be fascinating to see how they do dovetail, with Bath’s captain, Ben Spencer, having previously revealed his first interaction with Russell involved the Scot placing him in a head lock and saying, “give me the ball”.

Everybody is entitled to their opinion and that’s fine. Aussies like to wind people up, it is part of their background, but it doesn’t bother me.”Itoje said the Lions would be taking a phlegmatic approach after copping some nationality related flak from the matchday PA announcer in Perth. “It’s the Australian way, isn’t it?

And the government has a lighter burden of proof in civil cases than they do in criminal ones.The memo claims such efforts will focus on those who are involved “in the commission of war crimes, extrajudicial killings, or other serious human rights abuses … [and] naturalized criminals, gang members, or, indeed, any individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the US”.The directive gives justice department attorneys wider discretion on when to pursue denaturalization, including in instances of lying on immigration forms, cases where there is financial fraud or medical fraud against the US or against private individuals; and cases referred by a US attorney’s office or in connection with pending criminal charges.The justice department’s civil rights division has been placed at the forefront of Trump’s policy objectives, including ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs within the government as well as ending transgender treatments, among other initiatives.That comes as the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency registered its 13th in-custody death for the fiscal year beginning in October 2024. There had been 12 such deaths during the entire fiscal year that finished at the end of September 2024.On Friday Jim Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, resigned amid an investigation by the justice department’s civil rights division. The investigation took aim at the university’s DEI programs and its continuing to consider race and ethnicity in various programs and scholarships.The justice department also took the unusual step in recent days of suing 15 US district attorneys in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removal.The justice department’s civil rights division is reportedly in disarray as its traditional mission – to combat racial discrimination after the civil rights movement – is reshaped by priorities stemming from the president’s executive orders. About 250 attorneys – or 70% of the division’s lawyers – were believed to have left the department in the time between January and the end of May,according to a recent National Public Radio (NPR) report.The memo’s focus on denaturalization comes as at least one person has been denaturalized in recent weeks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last time anyone had contact with Williams was two days earlier, a court was told, when a friend said it was evident the entertainer had taken ketamine.Five drug snap bags were found in The Vivienne’s property, including in a bedroom drawer and a bin in the bathroom, an inquest at Warrington coroner’s court heard on Monday.Although the performer had struggled with drugs in the past, Williams’s family told the hearing they should not be remembered for their use of ketamine and that drugs did not define the person they were.Friends and family had no worries about Williams’s mental health, the hearing was told, and the performer was looking forward to future roles on TV and in the theatre, although did “occasionally” take ketamine.Jacqueline Devonish, the senior coroner for Cheshire, concluding the inquest, said: “The medical cause of death is cardio-respiratory arrest due to ketamine use. The conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, is that I’m satisfied that James Williams’s death was a misadventure, he took ketamine but he did not intend to take his own life.”A report from a toxicologist, Dr Kerry Taylor, said tests showed a relatively high level of ketamine, but not at a level normally causing death. However, the drug can cause drowsiness, seizures and heart stimulation, and the concentration may have dissipated over time.Williams was the winner of the first series of RuPaul’sDragRace UK and years later spoke about having been a drug addict. In April, their sister, Chanel Williams, questioned whether the “stigma” surrounding drug use had prevented them from seeking help.Shetoldthe BBC Two current affairs programme Newsnight that The Vivienne did not discuss their relapse, including a hospital stay, to “protect” their family, after a “really long period of sobriety”.“It’s hard for me because I think, if that stigma wasn’t there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?” she said. “To think that, if we’d known, or if he’d have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could’ve been different. That’s why we’ve shared James’s story.”Williams’s family have said they would work with the drug charityAdferiadon future campaigns. Their sister has called for ketamine to become a class A drug rather than class B, because people “think it’s less harmful than other drugs”.The government is seeking expert advice as the illegal use of ketamine hassurged to record levels.Explore more on these topicsDrugsCheshireDragnewsShareReuse this content"

But her case was rejected by the islands’ courts and her final appeal was dismissed by the privy council.Raznovich said the decision could have implications for ongoing litigation in other British overseas territories, such as Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands.But he was less confident about the impact on cases involving independent Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, which still have colonial era laws that criminalise consensual anal sex and where same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are prohibited.In 2018, ahigh court judgmentrepealed Trinidad and Tobago’s so-called “buggery law”, but in April thecountry’s supreme court upheld a government appealagainst the ruling and recriminalised the act, forcing campaigners to take their case to the privy council.Controversial “savings clauses”, which typically were created when countries gained their independence, and were designed to preserve colonial laws unless they are changed by parliament, complicates the situation in Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean countries.Anglin told the Guardian she would provide a response to the decision on Thursday when she has had the time to fully review the judgment and meet with her legal team.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCayman IslandsLGBTQ+ rightsJudicial committee of the privy councilnewsShareReuse this content"

By the 1950s there were barely 700 Eurasian lynx left in Europe, but in recent decades the population has bounced back to18,000, boosted by a reduction in persecution andsuccessful reintroductionsto areas of Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland and other countries.Natural England officials have told theLynx UK Trustthat a trial reintroduction cannot proceed because the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) rules it illegal under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act.According to the trust, this could be solved with a simple statutory instrument – a legal tweak – but the charity’s chief executive, Paul O’Donoghue, said Steve Reed, the environment secretary, had not responded to attempts to arrange a meeting despite giving an initial warm response. O’Donoghue said that if the government would not review the trust’s application for a licence for a trial release, it would launch a court challenge.Asked if he believed lynx could be reintroduced, Juniper said: “It should be looked at and I know people are looking at it.” He said he hoped that “a cross-border conversation with colleagues in Scotland” could boost prospects for the return of the species.“Lynx do need big areas of habitat and there could be some opportunities to combine nature recovery over parts of northernEnglandwith what’s going on in southern Scotland,” he said. “It is still quite polarised and some of these things will remain divided no matter how much effort you put in, but we need more engagement to understand how communities that would be living with these animals would be able to continue with what they do. There are in some places still serious doubts about that.”O’Donoghue said calls for more engagement were a waste of time and money. “Unless he has been living under a rock for the past 30 years, Tony Juniper must know that sheep farmers will never change their position on lynx reintroduction, making more calls for more engagement utterly futile,” he said. “The sad and stark truth is that currently the government are actively blocking any legal attempt at lynx reintroduction.”As well as the draft application from the Lynx UK Trust, two other charitable collaborations are conducting consultations over lynx reintroduction. TheMissing Lynx Projectis exploring the feasibility of reintroducing the carnivore to Kielder, while theLynx to Scotlandpartnership last month produced a100-page reportafter consulting 53 stakeholders including farmer interests about a potential return to the Cairngorms.The report identified potential conflict between lynx and sheep farmers and recommended payments for losses and coexistence, as well as a funded rapid-response system for farmers experiencing sheep predation. Any reintroduction in Scotland requires approval from the Scottish government after another public consultation and ecological assessments.Four lynx were illegally released in the Cairngorms in January, with one dying and three females recaptured andrehomedat the Highland Wildlife Park. Rogue rewilders were blamed, but the animals were tame and many believe they were simply released from a private collection.O’Donoghue said the Kielder reintroduction area in England – where Lynx UK Trust had an application declined in 2018 – would be ideal, offering the spacious landscape that most benefits lynx in a forest environment with relatively few sheep-farming interests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lynx have naturally recolonised countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands with great celebration and no issues,” he said. “Lynx are proven drivers of both economic and ecological restoration. They would generate millions of pounds every year to the local economy in Kielder, providing both green, sustainable jobs and improving the health and resilience of forest ecosystems. In Germany, areintroduction in the Harz mountainshas been so successful that a second reintroduction is now planned in Bavaria.”Juniper agreed that lynx reintroductions such as that in Harz had boosted regional economies with lynx-related tourism. Juniper also sits on the board of theFauna & Floracharity, which has projects helping Romanian farmers coexist with the wolf and bear.Juniper said: “It’s not so much about the ecology of whether these animals would have enough to eat or whether they’d have a big enough home range, it’s much more about the social conditions that they arrive in and the attitudes of the communities that would live with them. And so we probably do need to do some more work there to be able to get to that point. But that’s work in progress and people are working on that and Natural England is talking to those folks who are doing some of that work.”Asked about a potential legal challenge over the latest lynx reintroduction application, a Defra spokesperson said: “This government is absolutely committed to restoring and protecting nature and we support species. We will continue to work with Natural England on species reintroductions in England.”It is understood that the government wants more evidence of the effects of the management of large predators before any reintroduction is considered.O’Donoghue said: “The fact that the UK is one of the only countries in the world without an apex predator should be a source of huge shame for the government. We are in a biodiversity crisis. It is time for the greenwashing and needless conversations to stop and for real actions to occur.“It really is a no-brainer. Lynx are the perfect predator to reintroduce as they pose zero threat to humans yet provide so many societal benefits.”Explore more on these topicsRewildingNatural EnglandWildlifeNorthumberlandEnglandAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The transition to clean energy is not enough to tackle the widespread and mounting harms caused by the fossil fuels, she argues.In order to comply with existing internationalhuman rights law, states are obliged to inform their citizens about the widespread harms caused by fossil fuels and that phasing out oil, gas and coal is the most effective way to fight the climate crisis.People also have the right to know how the industry – and its allies – has for 60 years systematically obstructed access to this knowledge and meaningful climate action by peddling disinformation and misinformation, attacks on climate scientists and activists, and by capturing democratic decision-making spaces including the annual UN climate negotiations.“The fossil fuel playbook has undermined the protection of all human rights that are negatively impacted by climate change for over six decades,” said Morgera in the imperative ofdefossilizing our economies report.States must ban fossil fuel ads and lobbying, criminalize greenwashing (misinformation and misrepresentation) by the fossil fuel industry, media and advertising firms, and enforce harsh penalties for attacks on climate advocates who are facing a rise in malicious lawsuits, online harassment and physical violence.Communities across the world are facing growing threats from sea level rise, desertification, drought, melting glaciers, extreme heat, floods, and other climate-related impacts. This is on top of the deadly air pollution, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and forced displacement of Indigenous and rural peoples associated with every stage of the fossil fuel lifecycle.Meanwhile, fossil fuel and petrochemical companies have benefited from huge profits, taxpayer subsidies, tax avoidance schemes and undue protection under international investment law – without ever reducing energy poverty and economic inequalities. In 2023, oil and gas companies globally earned $2.4tn, while coal companies pocketed $2.5tn, according to the report.Removing fossil fuel subsidies, estimated to have topped $1.4tn for OECD members and 48 other countries in 2023, would alone reduce emissions by up to 10% by 2030.Redirecting these subsidies would help wealthy fossil fuel-producing states fulfill their legal obligations to aid developing countries to phase out fossil fuels – and provide financial and other remedies for the widespread human rights violations and environmental damage they have caused – and continue to cause.The compensation could also be funded by enforcing penalties for damages caused by fossil fuel companies, and cracking down on tax evasion and avoidance by the industry, as well as introducing wealth and windfall taxes. States could – and should – require the industry to finance climate adaptation, mitigation and loss and damage through climate superfunds or other mechanisms that are directly accessible to affected communities.World’s climate fight needs fundamental reform, UN expert says: ‘Some states are not acting in good faith’Read moreLand unjustly appropriated for fossil fuel operations should be cleaned up, remediated and returned to Indigenous communities, people of African descent and peasants, if they want it back, or they should be fairly compensated, Morgera argues.The report lays out the human rights case for decisive and transformative political action to limit the pain and suffering from the climate crisis. The recommendations offer a glimpse at a world in which the basic rights of all people are prioritized above the profits and benefits enjoyed by a few, but will probably be dismissed by some as radical and untenable.“Paradoxically what may seem radical or unrealistic – a transition to a renewable energy-based economy – is now cheaper and safer for our economics and a healthier option for our societies,” Morgera told the Guardian.“The transition can also lead to significant savings of taxpayers’ money that is currently going into responding to climate change impacts, saving health costs, and also recouping lost tax revenue from fossil fuel companies. This could be the single most impactful health contribution we could ever make. The transition seems radical and unrealistic because fossil fuel companies have been so good at making it seem so.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Among survey respondents, confidence in the police was at 34%.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverViolence against women and girlsMost women in England and Wales have seen abusive male behaviour in past year, poll findsSurvey reveals 69% of women have seen or experienced sexual harassment, domestic abuse, violence, stalking or other offencesVikram DoddPolice and crime correspondentMon 30 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTFirst published on Mon 30 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTShareA majority of women have direct experience of violence or harassment, or know someone who has suffered it, in the last year, a poll has found.The poll finds little faith in the police or government to stem the tide of male violence, and most believe the problem has got worse.The survey was presented to a private meeting attended by police chiefs and police and crime commissioners just under three weeks ago.Domestic abuse is ‘public health emergency’, experts say after critical NHS reportRead moreIt was conducted by Zencity and based on almost 1,800 female respondents aged over 16 across England and Wales.The large scale and high frequency of violence against and harassment of women is something law enforcement and the government are trying to get a grip on.Women were asked: “In the last 12 months, have any of the following behaviours happened to a woman/girl that you personally know … or have you heard or seen them happening to any woman/girl … (in your daily life) … domestic abuse, sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, taking/sharing intimate images without consent.”Of women surveyed, 69% said they had first or secondhand experience of women being ill-treated within the last 12 months.The figure was 55% for women aged 55 and over, and 74% for women aged 16-34 and a similar number for those aged 25-54.Three out of four women surveyed said violence and harassment was a serious problem and, asked whether it had got worse in the last five years, 42% agreed, 28% disagreed and 30% thought it was the same.Those who argue the system is failing have battled for years to have the issue taken seriously. A watershed occurredafter a Metropolitan police officer kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everardin March 2021 and anotherMet officer, David Carrick, was unveiled as a serial sexual offenderafter the force missed repeated chances to identify him as a threat to women.‘We’re here to spot predatory men’: the new force patrolling Dua Lipa’s Wembley showRead moreThe poll found that four out of 10 women do not believe police treat violence and harassment of women seriously, and 16% disagree.Asked about confidence in key institutions – the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts and local councils – to keep them safe confidence in police was 34%, and lower for courts and prosecutors at three out of 10, and lower still for councils.The new police national lead on violence against woman and girls (VAWG), Helen Millichap, said: “We need to keep these issues at the top of the agenda, and the societal outrage we see in response to these crimes needs to remain. We need to challenge misogynistic views that only serve to drive these crimes.“Policing has a role to play, and we are up for the challenge, but we are only one part of a wider system that must play their part.“What I want, is to show the public that progress is happening and for them to be confident that it is happening everywhere.”Four out of 10 told the survey they would report online harassment, almost the same number said they would not, and more than one in 10 said they would not report a rape or assault by a partner.Police believe the extent of violence against women is under-reported and the survey said: “The most common reasons for hesitation [in reporting] are the belief that the police wouldn’t act (31%) or wouldn’t believe them (25%). These concerns outweigh more practical barriers such as the process being too hard or slow (18%). This indicates that hesitation is driven more by distrust in the outcome than by the mechanics of reporting … Restoring trust that reports will be taken seriously and lead to action is essential to encouraging more women to come forward.”As part of the effort to show that police are serious, the Met today unveiled new technology that it said would increase charge rates of men who attack women such as their partners.It enhances pictures of the wounds such as bruises suffered, and is being issued to frontline officers.Police were finding bruises were harder to record on darker skin, and the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, said the new breakthrough was “equalising the service” to female victims.DS Sean Oliver said: “The device makes the image clearer. The definition of the image is better with the device. It can be shown to a jury.”He said in a pilot the device led to an increase in charge rate of more than 10% and, in some cases, allowed prosecutors to bring higher charges carrying more jail time.Rowley told the Guardian that he had protected the Met budget to tackle VAWG, with cuts expected elsewhere because of a funding crisis: “We’re making multiple steps and all of those steps help us improve the outcomes of victims.“VAWG we have to seeas an epidemicthat society has to fix.“I think we can be showing that we’re starting to win on this … bringing more people to justice, growing people’s confidence to come forward and report matters to us.”The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said courts and prosecutors, and not just police, had to improve and catch up: “There have been too many cases in the past where institutions have let down women and girls.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsMetropolitan policePoliceSexual harassmentUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

He was not charged but a sample of his DNA was taken.Last year the cold case team sent the blue skirt that Dunne was wearing when she was attacked and samples of her hair for analysis. Semen was found on them and a DNA profile produced. The profile matched the DNA sample Headley gave in 2012.View image in fullscreenJo Smith at the former home of Louisa Dunne.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe conviction means the full story of how Headley was brought to justice 58 years – almost to the day – after Dunne’s rape and murder can be revealed.Jo Smith, a crime review officer with Avon and Somerset police’s major crime review team, told the Guardian how in 2023 she was asked to take another look at the case. She pulled 17 cardboard boxes of paperwork and exhibits from the archive at police headquarters.Smith said: “I opened them and went: oh my word, I don’t think these have ever been subject to any modern forensic examination.” She fetched a colleague, they “gloved up” and started to go through the boxes. “We pulled out item by item and made a record of what we had. I had that feeling maybe we were sitting on something.”View image in fullscreenThe cold case team sent the blue skirt Louisa Dunne was wearing at the time of the attack for analysis last year.Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA MediaLast year, exhibits including the skirt and samples of hairs taken from Dunne were sent to a forensic scientist, Andrew Parry. He obtained a profile of the suspected rapist and killer.Describing the moment she heard this, Smith said: “I had a message from my sergeant. She said: ‘Oh my god, you’ll never guess. Andy Parry’s just found a full DNA profile on Louisa Dunne’s skirt. We’re going to load it to the NDNAD [the national DNA database]. That was 10am and at 3pm she sent me a message: ‘We’ve got a hit.’”Smith said it was “mind-blowing” when she learned of Headley’s previous convictions. Shortly after the murder, Headley and his family moved from Bristol, and in 1977 he admitted raping two women aged 79 and 84 in their homes in Ipswich, Suffolk.He was originally jailed for life but at an appeal doctors told the court the rapes arose of sexual frustration arising out of his marriage to an “ambitious and demanding” wife. The sentence was reduced and he spent only about two years in jail.The cold case team is small and made up mainly of part-timers including retired detectives now working as civilian investigators, but they persuaded their bosses that they had the skills to pursue the investigation. “We were conscious of his [Headley’s] age and that we hadn’t got the luxury of time,” Smith said.A priority was to prove Headley was in Bristol at the time. One investigator, the former detective sergeant Barry Frayling, spent days at the city’s archives digging up electoral roll and rate payment records that proved Headley and his wife lived in Bristol at the time.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Louisa Dunne taken in about 1919.Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA MediaThe team traced an officer involved in the original investigation, Bob Day, to ask him what he remembered. “He was flabbergasted,” Smith said.They also found the doctor called when Dunne’s body was found, Norman Taylor. He described the impact the murder had on him and Bristol. “He says the murder lives with him,” Smith said.In the boxes, they found the statements of Dunne’s neighbours from 1967 whodescribed hearing screamson the night of 27 and 28 June, and Suffolk police provided the statements of Headley’s Ipswich victims. They told how he crept into their rooms and threatened to kill them. “Those ladies have almost given Louisa the voice that she didn’t have,” Smith said.The team also tracked down Dunne’s relatives and broke the news to them that they had a suspect. Last year, Headley was still living in Ipswich, where neighbours did not know his past and regarded him as a friendly man who doted on his family and had recently taken in a kitten.Smith, who was there when he was arrested last November, said: “It was surreal. He’s an old man but there wasn’t any bit of me that felt sorry for him. I’ve seen what he did to Louisa.View image in fullscreenThe investigating officer DI Dave Marchant.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian“He thought he’d got away with it. But we’ll never stop hunting these people. His actions have caused massive ripples and consequences. This is such a violent horrific crime of a vulnerable old lady in her own home where she should have been safe. It doesn’t matter if it’s 58 years ago or if it’s 58 days ago.”DI Dave Marchant, of Avon and Somerset police’s major crime review team, said police had never given up on solving the rape and murder. He said: “We should never set a time limit of how far back we’re going to go.”Marchant hopes the conviction will comfort Dunne’s family members. “There are people who have lived with the pain, lived with the horrible memories. If we’re able to try and bring them some semblance of peace and understanding, that is important.”The jury took nine hours and 53 minutes to return its verdicts. The murder verdict was a majority 10-2. The rape verdict was unanimous. Headley will be sentenced on Tuesday.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

It sounded easy enough: he was to travel from his home in easternUkraineto the western city of Rivne, pick up a rucksack containing a paint canister and spray it outside the local police station.It would require nimble feet to flee the scene without being caught, but the money on offer – $1,000 – was good, fantastic even, for what amounted to a morning’s work for the 19-year-old.But when, on a snowy morning in early February, he opened the bag outside Rivne’s police station, he recoiled in horror. Instead of a paint canister, he saw something that looked like a homemade bomb, with protruding wires and a mobile phone attached to it, apparently a crude remote detonation mechanism.The device, if it had detonated, would have made Oleh an unwitting suicide bomber, part of a sinister new trend of attacks inside Ukraine that the country’s SBU security agency says are organised by Russian intelligence officers using local one-time recruits. So far, there have been more than a dozen attacks in which the perpetrator was injured or killed, according to a Ukrainian law enforcement source.Russia’s sabotage campaign inside Ukraine started last spring, SBU spokesperson Artem Dekhtiarenko told the Guardian. To begin with, it involved arson attacks on military vehicles, conscription offices and post offices. It was primarily aimed at western Ukrainian regions, far from the front.Ukrainians, often teenagers, were offered money via Telegram to carry out the attacks by “curators” who used a mixture of enticements and blackmail to snare their recruits.Starmer to give missiles to Ukraine paid for with £70m interest on Russian assetsRead moreThe perpetrators then had to make a video of the fire on their phones, and send the recording as proof the deed had been done. The videos would invariably find their way on to Russia-friendly Telegram channels, as supposed evidence of discontent inside Ukraine, stoking realsocial tensions over issues such as conscriptionthat have flared during Russia’s war on the country.These attacks were part of a secret shadow war, raging in parallel with the conflict on the frontlines. Russia is alsocarrying out arson and sabotage attacks in European countries, according to multiple western intelligence agencies, while Ukrainian services are believed to be behind a number of arson attacks at conscription offices in Russia earlier in the war.At the end of 2024, Russia apparently decided on a major escalation, moving from simple arson attacks in Ukraine to bombings that are more reminiscent of the tactics of terrorist groups. “They started the mass recruitment of Ukrainians to plant bombs: in cars, near conscription offices, near police departments, and so on,” said Dekhtiarenko.This account of Russia’s new campaign of bombings in Ukraine is based on prison interviews with perpetrators, who are currently detained and awaiting trial. Their names have been changed. It also draws on access to case materials and interviews with several SBU operatives who have worked on similar cases.The Russians recruit networks of Ukrainians, the SBU believes, with one person making the bomb and leaving it at an agreed spot. Someone else then collects it, without knowing what it is. The Russian curators can thus set off explosions deep inside Ukraine, without needing to set foot in the country.The SBU says it has detained more than 700 people since the beginning of 2024 for sabotage, arson or terrorism. Many are unemployed or need money to feed addictions, but about a quarter of them are teenagers, the youngest to date being an 11-year-old girl from Odesa region.“In some cases, the agents don’t only plant the bomb, but unconsciously perform the role of a suicide bomber. Russians blow up their own agents; this is becoming common practice,” said Dekhtiarenko.Oleh, 19 and unemployed, was badly in need of cash. “I sat at home and mostly did nothing,” is how he described the last three years, since he left school.In 2024, he became a father, and he now had a baby to support. So he spent a lot of time on various “work in Ukraine” Telegram channels, looking to make some quick money. On one of them he spotted a post by a man called Anton.“He said he had easy jobs, payment in dollars. When I contacted him, he told me to take photos of the courthouse, the conscription office, the police station [in my home town]. He paid me $50, to a crypto wallet,” Oleh recalled. The payment was made in USDT, a cryptocurrency stablecoin.Russian curators usually start off with simple tasks like this, say SBU officers. Taking photographs of sensitive sites is one common request, printing out and hanging a few copies of subversive flyers is another. Then, once the recruit is drawn in, they up the stakes.“⁠Sometimes they use threats, sometimes they are friendly and encouraging. It depends on who is curating the agent; they use different psychological manipulations on different people,” said Dekhtiarenko.Often, the curators use youth slang to give the impression the recruit is talking to someone their own age. Sometimes they flirt with the recruits, or offer them moral support about difficult family situations. They will not usually reveal themselves as Russians; they might claim to be Ukrainians who are “tired of war” and want to show there is opposition to it.If the recruit is proving unwilling, the curator might reveal the Russian connection and use blackmail to push for further action, threatening to send evidence of previous cooperation to the SBU.“After people perform the first task, they are on the hook,” said Dekhtiarenko. In one case, malware was sent to the mobile phone of a teenage female recruit and the curator threatened to publish intimate photographs and videos hacked from the phone if the girl did not continue to cooperate.Soon after Oleh had taken the photographs, Anton offered him a new task: to burn down a building in his home town. Oleh didn’t want to do that; he wasn’t a terrorist, he told the man. When Anton insisted, Oleh blocked his account.But the exchange stuck in Oleh’s mind, because he really needed money. So when another man, who claimed to be called Alexander, got in touch with him on Telegram a few weeks later, and suggested the possibility of earning $1,000 without the need to burn anything, he was sorely tempted.Oleh was worried about doing the job alone, so he called his old school friend Serhiy and suggested they did the job together. He offered to split the $1,000 down the middle.“He said: ‘I’ve got some work, wanna come to Rivne?’ I said: ‘What’s the work?’ and he said: ‘I’ll tell you later,’” Serhiy recalled in an interview. Serhiy quickly agreed; he was also unemployed, and had two children. The money would be useful.Oleh told his girlfriend he was off for a couple of days to make some money for her and their child. Alexander, the Telegram curator, sent him about $200 up front for expenses, again in cryptocurrency, and he bought tickets for a bus from Sumy region to Rivne. The ride took all day; Oleh and Serhiy arrived in Rivne late in the evening. Alexander told Oleh he should find a cheap hotel for the night and await instructions.The next morning, Alexander sent Oleh a location pin – a garage cooperative on the outskirts of town. “He said all we have to do is pick up a rucksack there with some paint in it,” said Serhiy. The duo set out, a little nervous.When they got to the location, Oleh called his Telegram contact, who guided him by phone. “He said, ‘Turn right, between garage number 32 and number 33, and you’ll see a tyre,’” Oleh recalled. Stashed inside the tyre, he found a black rucksack and a white plastic bag. He picked up both of them, as instructed.0:28Surveillance footage shows two people collecting explosives they believed to be paint – videoAlexander told Oleh not to open the bags but to head to the next location he would share via Telegram, which was a pin for the local police station, and then call him. The canister was primed to explode when the bag was opened, Alexander said, spraying the walls of the police station with paint and delivering an anti-establishment message about the futility of war. Oleh called a taxi and the pair headed into town.Oleh and Serhiy agreed they would split up ahead of reaching the police station; Oleh would be in charge of coordinating with Alexander where he should leave the bag, while Serhiy would keep lookout to check they were not being followed and tell his friend if he spotted anything suspicious.The Telegram chat between them, seen by the Guardian, shows Serhiy was deeply uneasy. “I’ve seen the same BMW again, and the same woman,” he wrote, suspecting they were being watched. “Let’s hope everything’s going to be OK,” Oleh wrote.Alexander called Oleh and told him he should open the white plastic bag and take out the box he would find in it. Then he should walk, holding it, towards the entrance of the police station.Oleh did so, but grew suspicious and opened the box to check the contents. He was startled to see something that looked like very much like a bomb. Panicking, he decided to rush to the nearest police officer, and announced that he feared he was carrying explosives. Just as he did so, SBU operatives pounced on both Oleh and Serhiy, grabbing the packages and forcing the two men on to the ground.An SBU team had been watching Oleh and Serhiy ever since they picked up the bomb, according to an operative involved in the case. Just three days earlier, Rivne had experienced a very similar attack. An unemployed 21-year-old was recruited on Telegram to pick up a device and take it to one of the city’s military conscription offices. The device exploded, killing the attacker and wounding eight soldiers.The operative described the scheme in Oleh and Serhiy’s case: the black rucksack contained a homemade explosive device, packed with screws and nails; the smaller bag held a white box containing a less powerful explosive device.This box had a small hole cut into it, with a cameraphone that transmitted geolocation and images of the surroundings to Alexander, who was also speaking to Oleh on a Telegram call. He could watch video of Oleh’s location in real time and direct him to a suitable spot packed with people. Then, as Oleh waited for the command to remove the supposed paint canister from the bag, the curator would detonate both devices, by calling the phones attached to them.View image in fullscreenSBU surveillance footage of Oleh and Serhiy in Rivne.Photograph: Security Service of UkraineIf this had happened, Oleh would most likely be dead, just like the attacker three days previously. The entrance to the police station was crowded with officers coming and going, and visitors queuing to receive building passes, so many more may have been killed with him.But the SBU had followed the pair and had special equipment on hand, the operative said, expecting another attack after the previous blast. “We had certain technical means to block the signals to the telephone,” said the source. When Alexander rang the phones strapped to the bombs to detonate them, the calls did not go through.As for the real identity of Alexander, the SBU is not certain, thought it is confident in the assessment that, one way or another, he represented the Russian services. It is believed that sometimes the curation is done by staff officers of GRU military intelligence or the FSB domestic security service, but both services also recruit go-betweens to make the actual calls.The SBU has not yet found the person who made the bombs that Oleh and Serhiy picked up, although the assumption is that it was done by another Ukrainian teenager recruited by Alexander. Previously, the SBU in Rivne detained a teenage girl for making similar explosive devices. She had also been recruited on Telegram and was then sent video tutorials on how to make the devices from commonly available products.To try to counteract the recruitment of teenagers for such tasks, the SBU has launched an awareness programme in Ukrainian schools, to warn children of the dangers of accepting offers to make money from strangers on Telegram.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The agency has also set up a chatbot where young Ukrainians can report any suspicious approaches or Telegram accounts to the authorities.The big question for European intelligence services, which have been dealing with awave of Russia-linked arson and sabotage attacksover the past year, is whether Moscow will export its latest tactic in Ukraine to the west. So far, attacks in the west have sought to cause chaos and sometimes material damage, but have not been directly designed to cause bloodshed.A Ukrainian law enforcement source said that could change:“Ukraine is the testing ground for Russian conventional and hybrid warfare. Look at cyber-attacks, look at arson attacks, look at the sabotage on railways. They test things here, and then they do it in western countries,” said the source.For Oleh and Serhiy, being caught may have saved their lives, but they are now behind bars, awaiting a trial in which they could be sentenced to up to 12 years of prison time. Oleh said he is not sure yet if he will plead guilty; he insists he did not realise he was working for the Russians, or that his actions could have led to carnage.In a brief telephone conversation from the prison where he is being held in Rivne, his girlfriend told him to forget about ever speaking to her or their child ever again. He also had a short phone call with his parents, the content of which he summed up glumly and succinctly: “They said I’m an idiot.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least two robots were stretchered off after failing to regain their feet after going to ground.Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offered the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots. He said humans could play robots in the future, although judging by Saturday’s evidence the humanoids have some way to go before they can hold their own on a football pitch.Cheng said: “In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe.”The competition was fought between university teams, which adapted the robots with their own algorithms. In the final match, Tsinghua University’s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University’s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5–3 to win the championship.One Tsinghua supporter celebrated their victory while also praising the competition. “They [THU] did really well,” he said. “But the Mountain Sea team was also impressive.

The severed heads were found in a bag at the site.The grisly finding comes at the end of the most violent month so far in a war between factions of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful drug-trafficking organisations, amid growing evidence that its main rival, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, has joined the conflict.The war broke out on 9 September 2024, six weeks after thearrest of two of Mexico’s most powerful crime bossesin El Paso, Texas.Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained along with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane touched down in the US. El MayoaccusedEl Chapo’s son of betraying him and delivering him to US authorities. Now a faction led by El Mayo’s son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo, who remain free in Mexico.The Mexican government has piled thousands of soldiers into Sinaloa, but has proven unable to curb the violence. The last two months have been the most violent yet. Overall, the war has left nearly 3,000 dead or missing.A message found alongside the bodies under the bridge indicated that the perpetrators belonged to La Mayiza, the faction led by El Mayo’s son.In the face of mounting losses, El Chapo’s sons, known as Los Chapitos, have reportedly struck a deal with their one-time rival, the Jalisco cartel. The US Drug Enforcement Administrationwarned about the potential alliancein a report last month.Such an alliance could shift the balance of power in a war that, until two months ago, seemed to be gradually reducing in intensity. It could also lead to a restructuring of the two groups’ criminal empires, which extend not just across Mexico but the world.US authorities have previouslyidentified the Chapitosas key drivers in the trafficking of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid responsible for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the US in recent years.Under pressure from the Trump administration, Mexican authorities have striven to show greater action against fentanyl trafficking, especially in Sinaloa, with more lab busts, arrests and drug seizures.According to US Customs and Border Protection data, fentanyl seizures at the border with Mexico have fallen by almost 30% this year compared to the same period last year.The Trump administration has alsodesignated the cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, while threatening the possibility of unilateral military action on Mexican soil, and recentlyaccused three mid-sized Mexican banksof laundering drug money, cutting them out of the US financial system.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The sandals’ origins go back to the 12th century, to the city of Kolhapur in western Maharashtra state.View image in fullscreenA model wears items from Prada’s spring-summer 2026 menswear collection, including leather sandals, at Milan fashion week on 22 June.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersThe buffalo-hide shoes with their distinctive braided T-strap are worn by everyone from farmers to millennials and business leaders.The sight of models walking the runway last week in the footwear blandly described as “leather flat sandals” triggered a widespread backlash in India and charges of “cultural appropriation”.The row tapped into a broader debate about how global fashion houses frequently repackage traditional craftsmanship as luxury goods without credit or compensation to the original artisans.The sandals, known for their durability, cost about $12 (£8.75) in India, whereas Prada sandals retail for upwards of $800. Indian artisans “lose, while global brands cash in on our culture”, said Harsh Goenka, the chair of the pharmaceuticals-to-IT conglomerate RPG Group.As photos of the show spread online, Indian outrage mounted. “From the dusty lanes of Kolhapur to the glitzy runways of Milan … will the world finally give credit where it’s due?” asked the news outlet DNA on X.Gandhi asked Prada to seek ways for “collaboration or fair compensation that could benefit” Indian craftspeople. Bertelli replied the sandals were still in the “early” design stage, but that Prada was willing to open a “dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans”.“While Indian artisans and small-scale producers excel in craftsmanship, they rarely have access to capital or business acumen” to position their products globally as luxury goods, Dhanendra Kumar, an ex-World Bank executive director, said in India’s Economic Times.“By not calling their new line of sandals ‘Kolhapuris’, Prada is guilty of monetising cultural appropriation,” Kumar said.Still, some believe the row could have an unexpected upside. Sales of the sandals have plateaued in India in recent years, but local designers believe the spotlight could boost interest in the classic design, especially among younger consumers.“Until now, it hadn’t been considered part of the ‘cool’ or aspirational footwear space in India’s luxury market … I truly believe in the ripple effect of what Prada has done,” said Shirin Mann, the founder of Needledust, a label known for its contemporary take on traditional Indian embroidered slip-ons.Mann could be right. Since Prada’s runway show, Google Trends has shown a rise in searches for Kolhapuri sandals, and retailers report interest has surged, according to local media.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPradaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

When we were trying to get it on the radio, one station said it was too intelligent and they wouldn’t play it’As told toBen CardewMon 30 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTShareWookie, producerPeople say Battle reminds them of some really good years for Britain as a country. We were entering a new millennium, everyone was running their own business, making money and the underground record industry was thriving. I wanted to do a UK garage version ofSouthern Freeez, by the 80s UK funk band Freeez. Initially, Battle was going to be another instrumental, and then Lain, the singer, came in the room and goes: “Let me put something on this.” I was like: “I’m not sure it’s really a vocal song.” But Lain stacked the vocals, and someone compared it to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, with all the harmonies.At the time, some people believed that I had copied a dubplate by [UK garage figure] DJ EZ. It is similar – his bassline doessomethinglike that. But I know I didn’t copy him, because I didn’t go out that much! So I’d never really heard EZ at that stage.I didn’t know Battle was going to be as big as it was or have the impact it did – it was just another tune. Then it started to float around: a few DJs had it, the A&R people. Ears started to prick up. I think we added a level of sophistication to garage, even though people like MJ Cole and TJ Cases were already doing that. When we were trying to get Battle on the radio, one station said it was too intelligent for their listeners and they wouldn’t play it.Battle eventually reached No 10 in August 2000. Louise Redknapp got the No 9 spot by 2,000 copies. It allowed me to appear on a TV show that I had watched my whole life as I was growing up: Top of the Pops.A lot of people say: “Oh, garage is on the comeback.” But for me, it has been for the last 13 years. I started DJing in 2012 and every year I’m working. It’s been well received by a wider audience ever since, younger and younger.Lain, singerJason Chue, AKA Wookie, was knocking about in jungle, drum’n’bass, trying to siphon off that whole energy and then putting songs to it.I remember him saying about Battle: “I’ve done something strange with the intro.” I was like: “No, just play it.” He was almost apologising for it – but it was like a godsend. That intro had such an urgency. It felt like it was piercing your soul. I said: “Give me a minute.” Then I walked out and I don’t even know if it was half an hour, but I came back and I had written all of the vocal. That’s divine. For the song title we wanted one word. There are a lot of three-word titles, but one word is strong. Whether it’s bringing up three kids on your own, or addiction, everyone’s battling through something, every day.One guy had a Maserati and blew out his speakers playing itPeople call Battle a gospel song. Back then I was doing a lot of regular R&B but I really wanted to do something that involved my faith. When Jazzie B [founder of Soul II Soul and mentor to Wookie] called me about working with Jason, I thought he was going to say: “No, we don’t want that.” But he said: “Just go for it.” We had all these record label bosses trying to sign Battle – one guy had a Maserati and he blew out his speakers playing it. Months later he said: “I didn’t realise I was blowing out my speakers to a gospel tune.”I first realised Battle was going to be big at [seminal UK garage night] Twice As Nice. Jason said: “You should come down to Twice As Nice because I think this tune’sgoing.” I was a bit worried because I don’t really go out. So they played the tune and everyone started going: “Booooo!” OK, that’s not a good sign. But Jason was like, “No, no, no – that means they really like it!”Battle has endured because of what it means to the person who hears it. Back then, we would do PAs and people would say: “That song – my mum was going through cancer and that helped me.” And, 25 years later, someone said: “While I was in prison, that song got me through.” That’s everyone. That’sanyone.I remember Jason sending me a picture of someone who tattooed the middle eight of Battle on her forearm: “I can always rely / On my faith to get by.”Wookie’s new single Back 2 Us (ft Kyno) is out nowExplore more on these topicsDance musicHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rainforest scenes of parrots, anacondas and jaguars that he and his brothers used to sell to riverboat tourists for a dollar apiece have given way to visions of a landscape that is darker, more despoiled and more desperate than it was six decades ago.However, as his first solo internationalexhibition– at the Whitworth in Manchester – will show, the old beauties and mysteries have not faded completely. His work is populated by shape-shifting spirits, mermaids waltzing with pink river dolphins, enormous pipe-smoking lizards and shamans who trap their adversaries in rum bottles, but they exist alongside depictions of the genocidal crimes of the past and the ecocidal crimes of the present. Oil refineries are consumed by fire, rubber trees weep tears of sap, forest spirits are displaced by drought, and memories of a century-old slaughter – replete with torn and branded flesh – echo through the forest and down the generations.Some were thrown into a hole​ 15 metres deep. Others had an ear hacked off“When I was a child, there was a huge abundance of animals and fish in the Amazon,” says the 65-year-old Indigenous Peruvian painter, when we meet in Madrid, ata joint exhibition of work by him and his partner Nereyda López. “There was a lot of land to make into farmsteads and there were a lot of animals to hunt. But people have come and taken land – hectares of land, kilometres of land – and they’ve come for the wood andthe gold, too.”The artist and his family are all too aware of what happens when the Amazon attracts the greedy gaze of the outside world. Today, they are the last 12 members of the White Heron clan of the Uitoto nation still living inPeru. Just over a century ago, Yahuarcani’s grandfather, then 16, was forced from Colombia to Peru during the genocide that was waged against the Indigenous population of the Putumayo region during the rubber boom. The painter was five or six when he learned what had happened at La Chorrera rubber station.View image in fullscreenRiver dance … Untitled.Photograph: CRISIS Gallery/© Santiago Yahuarcani“My grandfather would call us together at night and tell us about the era of rubber,” he says. “He told us how the bosses arrived with rifles and started to force the Indigenous people to collect the sap of trees for rubber. They demanded 50kg of sap from each person every two to three weeks. They gave them the materials they needed to get the sap and they gave them food, but not enough food.”Anyone coming back with less than 50kg was punished. Some were thrown into a hole​ 15 metres deep. Others had an ear hacked off. “There was also a guy, my grandfather told me, who’d make everyone watch​ as he cut off a lump of your fles​h with a knife. They wanted to scare people so they’d get their 50 kilos.”Then came the time when the bosses decided to plant sugar cane, coffee and corn for the women to harvest. “These women worked with their babies on their backs,” says Yahuarcani. “One baby started to cry because of the heat of the sun. The overseers came and took the little boy from his mother’s back and threw him on the fire.​”My grandfather told me the butterflies were the spirits of the victims, of the people who had been burnedWhen the inevitable uprising took place, the response was characteristically barbaric. Men, women and children were burned alive in a large house where they had sought refuge. Those who escaped the flames were shot. “My grandfather told me that, a month after the fire, thousands of butterflies of a kind never before seen in the Amazon began to sprout from the site,” says Yahuacari. “All different kinds of butterflies with all different kinds of colours. My grandfather told me they were the spirits of the victims, of the people who had been burned.”Those atrocities are recounted in one painting – called The Stone-Hearted Man – that shows gangs of pale men in white hats and with pistols in their belts branding, decapitating and burning their way across a stretch of rainforest that has become a hell.All around them are the charred and broken bodies of Indigenous people.A century later, the rainforest is once again besieged. “Today, Indigenous groups are having to fight back,” says Yahuarcani. “We have to fight to protect our vegetation, our trees and to reforest.” But the odds are not in their favour. While more and more outsiders are coming to the Amazon in search of land, timber, gold and oil, many of the region’s young people are abandoning their homes in search of education and employment. Respect for the rainforest is dwindling.View image in fullscreen‘I show our myths, our problems’ … Yahuarcani.Photograph: Julia Moro, courtesy Crisis GalleryWhenever they set out to hunt or fish, the Uitoto make an offering to the guardian of the forest animals: “He’s small and furry like a monkey and has the face of an 80-year-old person.” And, unlike the logging and mining corporations, they never take more than they need. “In the Amazon,” he says, “when we want to eat, we go to our supermarket – it’s in the mountains, in the jungle, where there are fish and fruits. You bring home what you need and you don’t destroy everything. God has said that man should not destroy nature, he should take care of it, because it is his home, too. You can’t destroy your own house.”If the artist’s subject matter has changed over the years, his techniques have not. Yahuarcani has always created his works by applying paint prepared from pigments, seeds, leaves and roots, to large sheets ofllanchama,a cloth made from the bark of theojétree. His works are often inspired by the hallucinations brought on by the ritual ingestion of tobacco, coca, ayahuasca and mushrooms – substances long used by the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon when in search of help, knowledge or revelation.While gettingllanchamarequires the skills he learned from his bark-cutter grandfather, the use of hallucinogens harnesses and honours the cosmology, myths and traditions of Yahuarcani’s people as he strives to draw attention to the threats they and the forest face. Perhaps the greatest of those menaces is indifference. Yahuarcani’s home town of Pebas, which lies on a bend in the river as it meanders from north-east Peru towards Colombia, is as far removed as it could be from the artistic, political and media centres of the coastal capital, Lima. As a result, getting his work and its messages noticed has been a struggle.Yahuarcani is polite but insistent as he reflects on the difficulties that he and other Indigenous artists – not least his son Rember - experience when it comes to visibility and exhibition space. “I use my work to show our myths,” he says. “How our culture used to be, how we came to have the problems we now have. But it’s been very tough because we were from the Amazon and we were Indigenous. We weren’t allowed to exhibit in the museums, or do the interviews, because we were always put to one side.” Artists from Lima “have always had more opportunities and more press”.Part of the problem, he says, lies in Peru’s own view of its culture and history. “When we were in school, we were taught about the Incas. About how the Incas built Machu Picchu, and so on. But there was nothing about us or our history, and that’s been one of our complaints. Our stories aren’t in the textbooks.” Yet he is adamant that this is a history people need – and want – to know about. When he exhibited a picture of the Putumayo atrocities in Lima ​a decade ago, “the newspapers and the magazines were saying, ‘Look at this! Look at this!’ But the authorities were not at all interested.”View image in fullscreenFantastical worlds … an untitled work from 2016.Photograph: CRISIS Gallery/© Santiago YahuarcaniYahuarcani has been buoyed by the enthusiastic reaction to the Madrid show – even if it has meant braving the heat and chaos of the Spanish summer. He hopes the Manchester exhibition will be equally well received. But the recognition has been as hard won as it has been belated. Time is running out and, as one of his recent works plainly shows, the Amazon is changing rapidly and irrevocably. Painted earlier this year, Optic Fibre in the Depths of the Amazon River is a riotous, funny and faintly disturbing picture that shows dolphins, frogs, fish and turtles clutching mobile phones as technology reaches ever farther into the rainforest. One or two of the smarter fish are ringing their friends to let them know where the fishers are gathered so they can avoid them.The current cycle of expansion, encroachment and exploitation appears unstoppable. And if the forest goes then so does a branch of the Uitoto, their way of life, and their half-forgotten history. “I hope Peru will do something about these issues,” says Yahuarcani. “That there will be a book of these stories so young people can learn what happened to their grandparents. Today, we are the only family of the White Heron clan. There are no more. When we disappear, the White Heron ends.”Santiago Yahuarcani: The Beginning of Knowledge is at the Whitworth, Manchester, 4 July to 4 January; part of Manchester International Festival, 3-20 July.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPeruAmericasArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In short, Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson are apparently dead, having been shot out of the sky by a double agent. Vin Diesel seems certain to die, having ended the film at the bottom of a dam that Jason Momoa just exploded. And Gal Gadot is back. And the Rock is back.All these threads need to be resolved urgently. And yet, Fast X was a box-office disappointment. The fourth most expensive film ever made, Fast X was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2023 and still managed to lose $20m. And suddenly the prospects of a sequel looked dimmer and dimmer. Or at least they did, untilVin Dieselstumbled across a foolproof plan to revive the franchise forever: human resurrection.This weekend, Diesel appeared at FuelFest, a car enthusiast event in California. During his speech, Diesel gave an insight into howFast and Furious11 could make people excited about the series again. “The studio said to me, ‘Vin, can we please have the finale of Fast and Furious [in] April 2027?’ I said, ‘Under three conditions.’ First is to bring the franchise back to LA! The second thing was to return to the car culture, to the street racing! The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O’Conner.”Now, within the context of Fast X, none of these things make sense. You cannot make a film where Rome gets nuked and Spain is devastated by a 30bn-gallon dam collapse, and then pretend like none of it happened so you can make a scaled-back little car-racing film in LA. Unless Fast 11 starts with Dominic Toretto waking up in a cold sweat and growling “Woah, I thought I was involved in one of the most egregiously ugly CGI blowouts in all of movie history, but it was just a crazy dream!” then the series cannot simply reset itself like this.More worrying, though, is the promise to reunite Toretto and Brian O’Conner. This is for the simple reason that O’Conner was played byPaul Walker, and Paul Walker died 12 years ago. Needless to say, that didn’t stop them before. When Walker died, he was in the middle of making Furious 7, and production brought in his brothers to act as body doubles before VFX house Weta grafted a digital copy of Walker’s face on top of it. The results were actually fairly convincing, but this is arguably because the job was easier. The bulk of Walker’s performance had already been committed to tape, so they could carefully weave in additional shots without drawing too much attention.But bringing the character back for an entirely new performance is something else entirely. They would have to create a digital Walker from scratch, and then convincingly voice him. You don’t need to be told that it’s tough to do it well. The Star Wars series has tried it repeatedly, with everyone from Peter Cushing to Carrie Fisher, and there is always something creepily plastic about the execution. Not even turning Harold Ramis into a ghost for Ghostbusters: Afterlife could mask how off-putting he looked. And the orgy of digitally created multiverse cameos that ended The Flash was the ugliest thing to be put on screen since, well, Vin Diesel drove down the side of a dam.Surely the Fast and Furious franchise doesn’t need to debase itself by taking a beloved co-star and yanking him around like a puppet. You have to imagine that Diesel’s intention is to cut back on the full-tilt bombast and return to something with real emotional depth, but in reality that means he’ll have to spend a lot of his time emoting at a tennis ball, which doesn’t exactly scream nuance.Plus, as much as I hate to say it, people don’t go and see Fast and Furious films for emotional complexity. They go because they want to see stuff smash into other stuff, ideally when some of it is on fire. If Fast 11 wants to pay tribute to Walker, then doing it in the credits might be the best way to go. After all, it’s hard to pay tribute to a colleague when there’s an exploding dam to outrun.Explore more on these topicsFilmVin DieselAction and adventure filmsPaul WalkerFast and FuriouscommentShareReuse this content"

His films delve into loneliness, yearning and doomed love affairs, carried along by a melancholy undercurrent.

Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Takeshi Kaneshiro play the heartbroken policemen, both deep in denial over the end of their relationships. We watch them cope in very different ways with their heartache. Kaneshiro’s Cop 223 pines outside his ex’s flat, buys cans of pineapple because they were her favorite food and goes on jogs so his body has no water left for tears.One night, he comes across Brigitte Lin’s mysterious femme fatale in a dimly lit bar. Decked out in a bouncy blonde wig, sunglasses and a trench coat, perpetually prepared for both sunshine and rain, she has problems of her own. Their encounter is told as a noir-style crime caper that looks at the seedy underbelly of Hong Kong complete with shootouts and runaway drug mules.‘Full of delightful surprises’: why Spy is my feelgood movieRead moreThe film then moves on to Leung’s Cop 663, whose story combines light-hearted romance with a dash of screwball comedy. He mopes at home in his underwear after his girlfriend leaves him, giving objects around his flat a tough talking to for letting themselves go. Cantopop singer Faye Wong plays a music-loving fast-food worker, also named Faye, who develops a crush on him and tries to work her way into his heart by secretly cleaning his flat. It’s an act that is less domestic servitude and more a cunning plot to change someone on a cellular level without them realising.If that all sounds too zany and affected, it’s not. Chungking Express somehow manages to be both gently whimsical and beautifully profound while mining plenty of laughs even in the desolate gloom of breakup despair. All four leads are unbelievably charismatic, and watching the two couples dance tentatively around each other is an unadulterated delight.I was 16 when I first saw Chungking Express and even though I grew up in Surrey, there was something about its depiction of alienation and not quite belonging in the big city that resonated with me. Perhaps because I also felt the same way as a second-generation Chinese immigrant; my family was one of the few ethnic minorities living on a very white council estate. I would borrow arthouse films from my local library, dreaming of a more exciting life.My parents were big fans of mainstream Chinese blockbusters, martial arts epics and triad crime films.When they brought home a VHS copy of Chungking Express, they had no idea of the impact it would have on me. It wasn’t so much a breath of fresh air as a neon-hued tornado obliterating everything I knew about Hong Kong cinema.‘Never fails to make my day’: readers on their feelgood moviesRead moreOver the years, I’ve rewatched all of Wong’s films many times. I am just as smitten by his romantic masterpiece In the Mood for Love and the moody drama Days of Being Wild, but Chungking Express is the one I return to the most. It is as effervescent as the Coca-Cola that is blatantly plugged in the film and as exhilarating as the Mamas & the Papas’ song California Dreamin’ that Faye plays on repeat.It never fails to cheer me up. Each and every time I’m ridiculously charmed by the sight of Leung asking a giant white teddy bear if he’s been in a fight, Faye dancing behind the snack bar counter brandishing condiments like glow sticks, and Kaneshiro trying to hit on women in a bar by awkwardly asking them if they like pineapple. The film is just so incredibly sweet, so astute about our interior lives, and so stylish in a way that still feels fresh and exciting even years later. Despite the sadness at the heart of Chungking Express, watching it feels like basking in sunlight.One of my favourite lines from the film comes from Cop 223, touched by a surprise message, as he speculates: “If memories could be canned, would they also have expiry dates? If so, I hope they last for centuries.” My love for Chungking Express will never expire. Unlike other, more straightforward feelgood movies, it doesn’t shy away from depicting the rough edges of urban life and how it can leave you feeling unmoored. But it shows how there’s always a chance to make a meaningful connection, hope emerging like a rainbow after the rain, scattering the grey clouds from the sky.Chungking Express is available on Max and The Criterion Channel in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieWong Kar-WaiComedy filmsRomance filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mustachioed ringleader Stefan Klincewicz, interviewed here, looks exactly like the kind of provincial accountant he originally was, neither a smooth master criminal nor a geeky Moneyball-style statistical genius. Klincewicz merely worked out that the capital needed to buy a ticket for every possible combination of the six numbers in the Lotto game would cost less than IR£1m. That strategy would significantly lower the 1 in 2m odds a punter usually faced, but only if they could manage to buy all the tickets needed.When a rollover weekend came around, making the pot worth the gamble, Klincewicz and his micro army of chancers, including teenage daughters and friends press-ganged into the effort, went to work. But the accordion-playing head of the national lottery at the time tried to foil their scheme by limiting how many tickets individuals could buy at once. The concern was that the public would feel discouraged from playing Lotto if they thought syndicates would usually win.The director, Ross Whitaker, works his way towards the inevitable conclusion, with its mixed success, by deploying lashings of 1990s TV footage, the low-resolution cinematography as endearing as the pre-millennium fashions worn by the interviewees of the time. There are clips from talkshows hosted not just by Irish institution Gay Byrne, but some of the many others, prompting the thought that Ireland must have more daytime talkshows than any other world economy of comparable size. But there is not much going on here in terms of wider contextualisation or deeper themes, just a very meat-and-potatoes, TV-friendly story of a scam played, as nearly everyone says, for “the craic”. And the money, of course.Beat the Lotto is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas, andBertha DocHouse, London, from 4 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrelandGamblingEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Mendelssohn wrote his Italian symphony in 1833, revising it the following year. Berlioz wrote hisHarold en Italiesymphony in 1834, following a stay in Rome during which the two composers had spent quality time together. Thus theAurora Orchestracame up with the smart idea of putting the two Italian symphonies side by side.Beyond their loosely shared inspiration and form, however, the two works have little in common. Mendelssohn’s is an expert and extrovert piece of symphonic writing, tight and technically impeccable. That of Berlioz, meanwhile, follows a wandering star all its own, broodingly romantic and constantly innovative, exemplified by the solo viola that depicts the melancholy of Byron’s introspective heroChilde Harold.Left to themselves, these two works could have formed a well-contrasted programme of a traditional kind. But the Aurora and their conductor Nicholas Collon don’t do traditional. They are above all else performance players, committed to immersing themselves and the audience in the excitement of live musical experience. It is one of the many reasons audiences love them.So in the second half, the Mendelssohn was played from memory, an Aurora speciality, the score taken at terrific tempos and with the players standing up and interacting. It was hard to resist, especially when the players then dispersed into the hall to encore the Italian symphony’s breakneck final movement saltarello. Watch out for the Aurora giving the same treatment to Shostakovich’s fifth symphony atthe Proms this summer.View image in fullscreenWhen in Rome … viola soloist Lawrence Power.Photograph: Julian GuideraHarold, meanwhile, was presented as a “dramatic exploration”. Texts based on Berlioz’s Mémoires were declaimed between movements and from amid the orchestra by actor Charlotte Ritchie. Collon and the viola soloist Lawrence Power chipped in, too. Power even whistled hisidée fixetheme before wandering Byronically through the hall as he played the lonely music at the symphony’s heart.It would be churlish not to be caught up in this. But it can sometimes distract. Inhis recordingof Berlioz’s symphony under Andrew Manze, Power is as poetic and nuanced a Harold violist as any on disc. But amid so much other activity, the Aurora’s orchestral balance sometimes did him fewer favours. When he stood stock still to deliver Harold’s skeletal arpeggios at the end of the second movement, it was a reminder that Berlioz’s music provides its own theatre.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicAurora OrchestraSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s such a stirring, sinewy antidote to despair that I want to prescribe it to everyone. Solnit stares unflinchingly at the facts of our age – Trump, Gaza, climate catastrophe, the assault on truth – and argues for the power of uncertainty as opposed to foregone conclusions. Yes, the future looks bleak, but that does not mean we are doomed. Only giving up guarantees that. Instead, persevere.The Safekeep, whichwon this year’s Women’s prizefor fiction, is an extraordinarily accomplished first novel from the Dutch author Yael van der Wouden. Set in the Netherlands 16 years after the end of the second world war, it is an exquisite character study, a historical reckoning and a slow-burn forbidden romance.To Exist As I Am, which has just come out, is an account by a young doctor,Grace Spence Green, of being rendered paraplegic while at medical school when a man lands on her after jumping from three floors above. The collision breaks her spine in multiple places, permanently paralysing her from the waist down. To anyone thinking “not another medical memoir”, please know that this immersive, deeply moving book is so much more than a meditation on learning medicine. Spence Green’s physical injuries are severe enough, but she also has to contend with the million microaggressions and forms of systematic exclusion that disabled people face in modern Britain. It’s a beautiful, powerful, indelible read.The Story of a Heart by Rachel Clarkeis published by Abacus (£10.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

As he did inRestless, Boyd makes the spy story fit perfectly with the individual protagonist. The action is well paced and the ending feels as if there could be a sequel … but I’m not sure Boyd would do that. Perfect holiday read!Vincenzo Latronico, authorI’ve just finished translating Tony Tulathimutte’sRejectioninto Italian – so in a way I’ve been reading it constantly for the last couple of months. It’s a book that transforms over successive readings. It is being widely celebrated – and rightfully so – for being so twistedly funny, so precise in depicting the way our digital life can warp or constrict our physical existence, and so formally inventive. But looking more closely, you realise Tulathimutte also tackles a serious question all writers are facing today: how can the novel, a form of storytelling that is linear and slow, depict a way of living that is fragmented and multiplied by technology? What use is a “scene” – things happening at a specific place and time – when, on the phones in our pockets, so many things are happening at once?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Think peak Chabon and Eugenides; the intellectual gymnastics of Helen DeWitt; the last profane and puckish gasp of Tom Robbins. That brief window – before 9/11, smartphones and the chokehold of autofiction – when the novel felt as playful as it did expansive: bold and baggy as wide-legged jeans. Joyce Carol Oates channelling Marilyn Monroe. Jonathan Franzen snubbing Oprah. You can feel that early-00s energy jostling through a new crop of American novels: Lucas Schaefer’s The Slip, Kaveh Akbar’sMartyr!and Maggie Shipstead’sGreat Circleare top-shelf examples. They’re big in all kinds of wonderful, infuriating ways: antic, overstuffed and richly peopled.While it’s less hyperactive than some of its book-fellows, Susan Choi’s Flashlight still has the wide-legged feel of turn-of-the-century fiction: domestically sprawling, geopolitically bold. Stretching from a strawberry farm in Indiana to the North Korean border, Choi’s sixth novel reckons with the lies that undo families and underpin empires.Flashlight first appeared in the New Yorker as a short story – a standoff in a psychiatrist’s office. The novel opens here too. It is the late 1970s: 10-year-old Louisa has been dragged in for a consultation, and she’s not playing nice. She waits out the clock, evading, deflecting; a tight little knot of fury. “This room is full of tricks to get children to talk, but you’re too smart for them,” the doctor flatters her. “I’m too smart for compliments,” Louisa snaps back.Louisa’s father has drowned, and her mother has turned into a strange new invalid. What the girl feels defies grief or sympathy. This isn’t mourning, it’s mutiny; and it will take more than some avuncular desk jockey to tame her. While the doctor is distracted, she steals an emergency flashlight from his office and smuggles it home – a low-stakes theft with high-voltage meaning. The night Louisa’s father disappeared into the water, he was holding a flashlight.Portentous torches will appear throughout these pages (it’s not the subtlest of metaphors for a novel about absence and secrecy). There’s one at a seance, its battery case loosened to summon some otherworldly flickering. Another at an archaeological dig in Paris. This is a story told in brief illuminations, like a child spinning a torch in a dark bedroom. Slices of light; slices of life.We begin with a flashback to Louisa’s parents, meeting them before they meet each other. Her father, Serk, an ethnic Korean raised in Japan, is a child of postwar limbo. Caught between two nations, and claimed by neither, he trades his borderland life for a blank American slate – or so he thinks (America has other ideas). Louisa’s father will be known by many names over the course of his life – Hiroshi, Seok, the Crab – but none of them will quite belong to him. Louisa will know him as Serk, an anglicised version of his Korean name.Louisa’s mother, Anne, is an obstinate, spiky creature, allergic to expectation. Pregnant at 19, she gives birth to a child she’s not permitted to keep, and her adult life shapes itself around her son’s absence, like a house built around a locked room. Louisa will inherit her mother’s bone-deep stubbornness – twin contrarians.They make an implacable, inscrutable pair, Serk and Anne; secret-keepers to the core, lonely apart and lonelier together (“Anne the odd white woman who had married the foreigner; Serk the odd foreigner who had married a white woman”). When Serk drowns, he leaves behind a silence so complete it swallows the past whole. And so Louisa is left with two absent parents: one right in front of her; the other near mythic. “The sum of things she knew about her father could fit inside the sum of things she’ll never know about him an infinite number of times,” Choi writes. “The things she knows are as meagre as a pair of backgammon dice rattling in their cup.” Flashlight is a study of absence – absence of narrative, of inheritance, of place, of affection. Who are you, it asks, when there’s no story to inherit, no history to claim? How might that void be filled, or inhabited or weaponised?It’s a year for canon building, and as the best-of-the-century (so far) lists are tallied, Choi’s previous novel, 2019’sTrust Exercise, remains firmly on mine. It begins as a high-school drama, libidinous and gossipy, but midway through, Choi triggers a controlled implosion. From the wreckage, another story emerges: one about power, authorship and blame. Truth isn’t fixed, Choi shows us here – it’s framed. I love this novel’s confident chaos, its metafictional brio.Flashlight delivers a comparable jolt – a truth-rattling rupture. We feel it building with a cruel inevitability, and when it arrives, it shifts the novel’s moral (and political) terrain. To spoil the reveal would be churlish. The question is whether the novel can withstand the shock. It can – just. Choi is one of contemporary literature’s great demolition artists, and her emotional foundations hold. She can build as well as she detonates. Choi gives her cast the room they need to live; to be more than vessels for political wrangling. The opening of Flashlight isn’t the only set piece that could stand alone – and tall – as a short story.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Choi confronts a chapter of North Korean history that American fiction has barely touched. But there is something missing. That Y2K brand of irony – glib, evasive, laddish – is gone.

Counsellor Bella Jackson will presumably be hoping that her account of two years spent training as a mental health nurse will resonate in a similar way.Jackson worked in social care for five years before embarking on her nursing degree. The book is “pieced together from scattered notebooks and scribble”. But from the outset, it is not entirely clear what is fact and what is fiction. She explains that she has constructed three “composite” settings from her contemporaneous notes: an acute psychiatric ward, an A&E department and a community psychiatric team. Although based on real situations, the stories she tells are also composites in which names and identifying details are changed. So too are the healthcare professionals depicted.The verisimilitude of what is described matters greatly because it is used by Jackson to mount a furious assault on the failings of modern psychiatry. The gross underfunding and understaffing ofNHSmental health services is, she argues, “only half the story. The other half is messy and confronting. It is philosophical and systemic. It is uncomfortable enough to make us look away sharply.” Without spelling out exactly what she means, she sets out to document the messiness unflinchingly.Entering the ward on day one triggers a powerful childhood memory. As a six-year-old child, Jackson accidentally locked herself in a bathroom while her parents hosted a raucous party. Recalling the overwhelming panic and powerlessness of being incarcerated causes her to reflect on the ward patients’ plight: “It’s easy to walk in and out of a locked ward and forget the significance of that power. Does The Door protect the vulnerable people inside from an unkind world? Or does it protect our fragile society from the people who embody its failings?”Jackson’s answer to this question is emphatically the latter. Seen through her eyes, locked psychiatric wards are bleak, punitive places patrolled by staff who are – with only rare exceptions – at worst cruel and at best indifferent. In the first few pages, psychiatrists are set up as uninterested, inhumane, work-shy pill-pushers. A patient spends hours hovering by the door, trying hopelessly to catch the eye of the consultant psychiatrist as he “flitted in and out, always with somewhere else to be”. When another patient recounts a harrowing tale of homelessness and childhood beatings, the same consultant merely shuffles his papers as if the patient “were absent”.Nurses are, if anything, even worse. A particularly aggressive nurse called Leon tells Jackson that he hates the ward because “these patients get away with anything they want … asking whatthisis, whatthatis. What thefuck?” Two healthcare assistants laugh together about forcibly injecting patients with rapid tranquillisers.Amid the racist, abusive and offensive staff, who mock, belittle and chemically cosh their patients, are individual tales of heartbreaking social and psychological circumstances. Patients have experienced sexual assault, childhood abuse, domestic violence, poverty, exclusion and multiple suicide attempts. All of this is ignored by staff. High doses of antipsychotics leave the patients drooling and gurgling. One man has the face of “a tired waxwork” while others “remained shapes against the blank walls”. Jackson finds herself frequently intervening to stop a trigger-happy nurse or doctor casually slapping a potentially life-changing diagnosis such as psychosis or bipolar disorder on to a distressed patient.The problem with this account, for me, is that it doesn’t really resonate with my experience. I spent my first rotation as a junior doctor in psychiatry at the same time Jackson was training. I simply didn’t see the kinds of abuses Jackson documents – despite being a former current affairs journalist who was, and remains, highly attuned to the power dynamics inherent in medicine and potential injustices against patients. A particularly extraordinary moment is when Jackson describes a nurse telling her about a junior doctor “who used to legit say, ‘Let’s quetiapine them today!’ And I asked him why quetiapine, and he said, ‘They put you in the best hotels for conferences.’” Really? That kind of pharma corruption was rooted out long ago – and I can scarcely imagine a junior doctor of my era using such a ludicrous phrase.Jackson has sacrificed complexity for polemic. The crux of her argument is: “The medical world doesn’t really know what to do with distress, so we drug the person, because that’s what the medics are taught to do,” as one of her colleagues puts it. But the truth is not this simplistic. Psychiatrists do indeed have an almighty power to do things to patients that in any other context would be considered human rights abuses – restraining them, injecting them with drugs, depriving them of their liberty. Yet this is because the most seriously unwell patients often have no idea they are ill and will not engage with treatment voluntarily. Sectioning a patient is a last resort, not a cavalier act of malice. And though talking therapies are desperately lacking, this is due to endemic underfunding, not because psychiatrists regard them as pointless. Most of the psychiatric nurses and doctors I worked with were decent, run ragged, and longed to be able to offer their patients more.The truth is, we still understand very little about the root causes of serious mental illnesses and are painfully aware of what blunt tools psychotropic medications are. Jackson implies that treating serious mental illness is simply a matter of listening to, believing and empathising with patients. If only this were true for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There is much to be fixed in NHS psychiatry, but I’m afraid this book feels like scaremongering.Fragile Minds: Stories from an NHS Mental Health Ward by Bella Jackson is published by Doubleday (£20).

Eventually, we’re told, the poems will be “manifested physically at site-specific locations and in different guises” – as installations, treasure-trails, sculptures and so on. Dwell, therefore, is an illustrated print preview, an informal, engaging, often humorous short collection that will appeal to younger readers, and occasional readers, and sharpen every reader’s ecological conscience.The Lost Gardens project, today and in its future planned restorations, has supreme ecological significance, as Dwell makes clear. It’s a story with major historical-political dimensions, too, concerning class, regionalism, and the first world war. I’m already speculating, and hoping, that a full-length collection might emerge later from the poet laureate’s heartfelt engagement with the “Willow Garden” (as its Cornish name translates). It is rich material.While the poems in Dwell are simultaneously grounded and freely imaginative, Nest Box addresses more fundamental questions about what we define as real. It reminded me, on a first reading, of similar questions raised by one of my favourite children’s books, Skellig, by David Almond. There, the eponymous protagonist might almost be any homeless man, but, as he eventually admits to the children who have helped rescue him, he’s really “something combining aspects of human, owl and angel”. Almond acknowledges the influence of a short story by Gabriel García Márquez, A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings, usually classified as magic realism.Armitage’s poem is more oblique: not contained easily in any genre box, it’s essentially concerned with questioning the human response to natural phenomena, and asking how we can provide “evidence” to challenge our possible illusions. There is an ecological force to the inquiry: humans need some enchantment to draw them into a less than self-centred concern with the environment, but we need to know what we see when we see “nature”, to best be able to preserve it. It’s a big question for ecopoets, too.Nest Box begins when the “drunken old fool” (or supposed one) swears “blind” that he saw an angel in the sky. He burbles a riff of conflicting images: “half-human, half eagle”, “white flames in mid-air // a ghost with wings”. The reporters investigating the story, after the man has “keeled over”, search for evidence, but find only the remains of an owl’s last meal.Armitage’s narrative, casual but determinedly objective, pursues the qualifications of rhetorical argument, the “strange” and the “but then”… A second observer, a young girl, swears her own sighting to have been a barn owl. But are the two visions incompatible? The evidence for the sighting of the angel consists of the remains of small mammals (“pellets of small bones and teeth, // and skulls, and part-digested fur / and knotted hair”). The evidence for the barn owl is pursued by birdwatchers, a breed of narrator we’d expect to be less unreliable than reporters. They check the nest box and find a mysterious, mixed assemblage: “tinselly silver threads / and luminous turds // and a warm meteorite / and a few feathers made only of light.” Are the angel and the owl sharing the nest box by any chance?There are lively if not unpredictable “turns” as Armitage’s fast-moving, rhymed and half-rhymed couplets unroll, blending journalese and lyric tones. No adjudication is imposed: ultimately, the evidence for the nest box angel may be as unreliable as the old drunk’s sighting of the creature itself. The young and not-so-young reader’s imaginative intelligence is well-nourished. What evidence, we wonder, would show that an angel had used a nest-box meant for an owl? What is an angel? What is this one like? It’s clearly not a grumpy old man with wings, and not as grand and strange as what was seen by the “drunken old fool”, either. It’s an angel the size of a barn-owl, or smaller. Should we think of Thomas Aquinas’sSumma Theologica? Perhaps it’s not any traditional kind of angel, but, in view of the “warm meteorite”, not essentially supernatural. The muscles of ratiocination and imagination need to be continually exercised by us earth-dwellers, not least because life-forms on planets other than ours are almost certain to be discovered one day soon.Armitage’s “Welcome Note” to Dwell is relevant to Nest Box. He describes how his grandparents fought to guard the eaves of their proudly well-maintained council house against messy nesting house martins. “This kind of inhospitality,” Armitage writes, “has increased in direct proportion to soaring human populations, and the consequence of homelessness for most living things is extinction. House martins are now a red-listed bird.” It’s something to bear in mind as we enjoy the magic and humour of the angel-owl but ponder the last traces of its residency in the well-meant nest box.Dwell by Simon Armitage, illustrated by Beth Munro, is published by Faber & Faber, priced £10.

Two years on, the New York cabaret diva now tells the story behind that cancellation. Judging by her previous scintillating shows (including 2019’s award-winning The Twist?

But could such youthful appreciation become a rarity?Katy HesselMon 30 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 03.02 EDTShareIwent to see Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Painting at theNational Portrait Galleryrecently and the exhibition was swarming with teenagers. Equipped with notepads and sketchbooks, scribbling down words like “expressive”, “daring” and “beautiful”, the budding art enthusiasts seemed enraptured by Saville’s portraits: from blemished backs and wounded faces to colossal closeups of girls and fleshy nude women. I got talking to an art teacher and her sixth formers and we discussed how Saville’s bodies are the antithesis to the idealised forms we see online today; and how stunned we were by the landscape of textures that can exist within a single cheek.Seventeen-year-old Laurence – who makes drawings with a ballpoint pen – admired the “messy side” to Saville’s work and was fascinated by “just how much emotion she could portray in one image”. His classmate Georgia, also 17, was drawn to her “vibrant colours” and felt “positively overwhelmed” by the paintings, in particular Propped, an exposing early self-portrait that was part of the artist’s Glasgow School of Art degree show. Fusing beauty and brutality, a softness and sharpness, a nude Saville sits on a precarious-looking stool (spikily jamming into her ankle), with bitten-down nails that violently claw into her skin.Portraits so powerful they override reality – Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Painting reviewRead moreLook closer and you’ll see the painting is overlaid with text (written backwards) that reads: “if we continue to speak in this sameness – speak as men have spoken for centuries, we will fail each other”. It’s a translation from the French feminist Luce Irigaray’s 1980 essay When Our Lips Speak Together, and draws not only on the importance of art history not repeating itself (by excluding voices and subjects), but – more powerfully today – about the failings of current leaders.View image in fullscreenExposing … Propped by Jenny Saville.Photograph: David Parry/National Portrait Gallery“It’s really inspiring for young women in art to be controversial,” Georgia said. “It also makes you more confident in your ability and appearance, because you see Saville create it in a beautiful painting.” Frustrated at how “inaccessible” being an artist has been for women in history, and questioning why men get to be covered up with a fig leaf, whereas women are often fully exposed, she said: “When [a self-portrait like this] is done by a woman, it’s empowering in itself – it’s women taking back control.”Georgia’s words took me back to my own experiences as a teenager with Saville, who I studied as part of my GCSEs in the early 2010s. I remember my classmates and I coming into school with printouts of our faces pressed up against glass windows (no doubt reluctantly taken by our mums) that distorted our features like Saville’s 2002Closed Contactself-portraits, made with photographer Glen Luchford. Full of expression, and evocative of our teenage angst, the works got us thinking about how portraiture, like our lives, could be messy, fractured, emotional, internal – seemingly worlds away from the gilt-framed pictures that we often saw in museums, or the airbrushed photoshoots in magazines.But only now, at this show, have I been able to understand the monumental impact of her paintings. Not only in challenging notions of beauty in a patriarchal world, but in her ambition to push paint – and charcoal, in her mesmerising drawings – to new limits, in order to viscerally confront, stun and challenge.View image in fullscreenInspiring … Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Painting at the National Portrait Gallery.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockWhether it be a bloodied face examined under a bright white light, bodies fading from life right in front of us, or her truthful insights on motherhood, Saville’s works hold the attention in ways that affirm the power of painting in a world overtaken by mindless scrolling. It was this that I also discussed with the teenagers, whose astute observations made me feel so encouraged about what art can offer us, in this tumultuous world.But these precious youthful discussions could become a rarity, thanks to ever decreasing government funding in arts education. As outlined in the recent spending review, the total expenditure of Department for Culture, Media and Sportwill be reduced by 1.4% over the next three years, and research shows thatonly 38% of A-level students are taking at least one humanities subject(a statistic that drops to 24% when it comes to arts subjects). As a result, we are experiencing a crisis when it comes to lack of opportunities for creatives fromlower socioeconomic backgrounds.Incredibly, Saville’s exhibition is free for anyone aged 25 and under, thanks to a private donor. I hope this will encourage young people of all backgrounds to enter these spaces and feel welcome to discuss, debate and come back again – and to understand the raw, visceral power that painting and the arts can have.Explore more on these topicsArt and designThe great women's art bulletinJenny SavilleNational Portrait GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often ranked as a lesser aspiration for the work of a true artist, when humor does find its way into the graphic arts, it’s as more of a condiment than the main dish.How refreshing then to see the Phoenix Art Museum’s substantial new exhibition, Funny Business, which boldly and decisively leaps into the realm of comedic photography. Showcasing humor from a wealth of angles, including slapstick, whimsical, acid, surreal, ironic, parody and so many more, the show offers ample opportunity to consider just what purpose laughter serves – and to enjoy a hearty laugh or two on a summer’s day.Edward Burtynsky: ‘My photographs are like Rorschach tests’Read moreAccording to the show’s curator, Emilia Mickevicius, photography is an ideal medium to explore humor because, unlike other forms of art, it has a particular relationship to reality. “Jokes deliver punchlines, deliver surprise, disrupt hierarchy or expectations – the disruption of expectation is essential to how humor works.Photographyis good at doing that because of its special relationship to the pre-existing visual world. When you look at a photo, it’s the opposite of the suspension of disbelief – you’re like, wait a minute, how can this be?”Some, such as Duck and Boxer by the Hungarian animal master Camilla “Ylla” Koffler, embody precisely the sensation that Mickevicius is talking about. Her snap of the titular creatures hanging out together on a beach, both looking off with curiosity to the the right of the frame, feels just too good to be true. In its hard-to-believe cuteness and absurdity, it resists the notion that every photograph is a fractional moment of reality, complicating the question of just what truth is recorded when photographic film is exposed to the light of day.“Humor shows just how contextual photographic meaning can be,” said Mickevicius. “When someone tells a joke, it’s doing all this sneaky linguistic work, assuming that you as a listener have all these prior assumptions that the joke disrupts somehow. It’s so context dependent. Photos are too – they take on meaning in relation to one another, they are so porous to different fields, different areas of knowledge and experience.”View image in fullscreenJo Ann Callis – Parrot and Sailboat, 1980.Photograph: Center for Creative Photography, University of ArizonaJo Ann Callis’s 1980 shot, Parrot and Sailboat, looks similarly composed – just how did a parrot end up on the lip of a bathtub, eyeing a toy sailboat floating placidly in the water? Yet her shot moves in a different direction than Ylla’s, drawing away from a storybook sweetness and instead pulling toward a Lynchian surreal – there are overtones of menace and uneasiness, as though something unseemly is occurring just out of frame.Together, the two photos indicate the layers of representation present throughout the show, the degrees of irony, the many tones and shades of nuance and emotion that these photographs tidily contain. The photos in Funny Business very much have the feeling of riddles, each one challenging viewers to interpret just what is going on and how it got into film. “I never get tired of thinking about how complex photos are, how not-straightforward they are,” said Mickevicius. “Humor is just such a great lens to do that.”Other pieces in the show, such as the street photographer Garry Winogrand’s untitled 1963 snap of a woman in cat-eye sunglasses staring into the camera while two rhinoceroses butt heads behind her, come more in the “you can’t make this up” variety. What makes this photo is how everything – from the woman’s blank expression and bored posture to the positioning of the animals themselves – comes together in the decisive moment, demonstrating how humor can sometimes be a matter of milliseconds.More contemporarily, Funny Business features iPhone videos from the street photographer Jeff Mermelstein’s Instagram feed, where he captures strange little bits of street life in New York City. “He has been working for decades with traditional cameras, but got super excited in the last few years by working with his iPhone,” Mickevicius said. “They’re these ultra-zoomed in moments of the jostle of people in New York, these instances of touch between people. It comes from a place of what I’ve called an affectionate voyeurism, this kind of exhilarated eye that roves around and is like, ‘Wow, look at how interesting people are!’”View image in fullscreenGarry Winogrand, New York, 1963.Photograph: Courtesy Fraenkel Gallery, San FranciscoFunny Business also makes room for the sublime whimsy of the American photographer Leslie Krims’s Porsche Rainbows, in which the artist sprayed a garden hose at the titular vehicle, capturing the beautiful rainbows that resulted. In the faded golden tones of the Porsche and the lo-fi aesthetic of these 70s pieces, they have a glorious throwback feel to them, bringing to mind a kind of lazy afternoon Americana redolent of Slip ’N Slides. “They’re a simple and concise action that shows how photography can record these moments of magic,” Mickevicius said. “It’s just a pretty, joyous piece.”As if this isn’t enough range yet, for something complete different Funny Business presents the Mexican-American multimedia artist Steffi Faircloth’s Bordertown ASMR series, in which she offers short videos depicting her lived experience of the US border with Mexico. In one, Faircloth simply enjoys a Mexicanelote– a barbecued ear of corn – before the border wall. Her genial act of consumption renders the miles of razor wire streaming out behind her completely ludicrous. “By performing this act of pleasure in front of the wall, it’s like she’s able to cleverly and tenderly and playfully be like multiple realities can exist at once, joy and suffering can coincide,” said Mickevicius.Faircloth’s series also now seems prescient, as earlier this year the official White House X account published a video of individuals being deported, ironically deeming the clink of handcuffs and swooshing of jet propellers as “ASMR”. “Faircloth reposted that on her Instagram stories at the time and was like, ‘Wow, do they know I did it first?’” said Mickevicius. “It’s totally horrifying, but also a really striking moment of how she anticipated them mobilizing this form in such an insidious way.”As much as Funny Business can be a cerebral experience, it is first and foremost a pleasurable one. And that is music to Mickevicius’s ears. “I’ve been delighted to hear people laughing in the galleries,” she said, adding that she hopes the laughter can be a way in for audiences to think about art and society in new ways. “With all of my shows I like to move people to explore how photographs work and how truly sophisticated and slippery they can be as representations. When you go to a museum, you encounter perspectives that are different from your own. It has such a power to it – you can complete the interpretive circuit.”Funny Business: Photography and Humor is on show at the Phoenix Art Museum until 4 January 2026Explore more on these topicsPhotographyComedyExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actually, it is made out of sand, a reminder of the fragility of such features as the buildings they are housed in are knocked down or modernised.View image in fullscreenTiles typically found in the old quarter of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, recreated out of sand.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianDana Awartanihas a diverse background. Her father is Palestinian while her mother is Palestinian and Syrian. Awartani was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and has Jordanian nationality.She said the work in her exhibition, her first solo public gallery show in Europe, was inspired by the “strange dichotomy” of some countries in the Gulf booming while places such as Syria and Palestine were “obliterated”.Awartani said: “The destruction of cultural heritage creates a sense of displacement in the local population. If you remember what happened with Notre Dame, it was devastating seeing it burned to the ground. It’s the same thing, but hundreds of Notre Dames.”View image in fullscreenDana Awartani with Standing By the Ruins. The piece recreates an ancient bathhouse floor in Gaza believed to have been destroyed in Israeli attacks.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe first piece the visitor comes upon are recreations of the red, black and white floor of the Hamam al-Sammara in Gaza, one of the oldest bathhouses in the region but which is now believed to have been destroyed.Awartani worked with a collective of adobe brickmakers – craftspeople of Syrian, Afghan and Pakistani origin – and deliberately omitted the final binding agent so the work, called Standing by the Ruins III (2025), is delicate.The second large-scale piece, Come, Let Me Heal Your Wounds. Let Me Mend Your Broken Bones (2024), was created for the Venice Biennale last year. Sheets of handmade Indian silk are dyed with medicinal herbs and spices and represent maps of countries in the Middle East.Awartani tore spots on the “maps” that matched sites where archaeological or cultural sites have been damaged. She then darned them. “It’s a cathartic, meditative experience where you’re mending something.” Sadly, since Venice, she has had to expand the work to take in new sites that have been wrecked.It took two technicians six days to set up the third large piece at the Arnolfini. The work is called I Went Away and Forgot You. A While Ago I Remembered. I Remembered I’d Forgotten You. I Was Dreaming (2017) and is the recreation of a Jeddah floor made out of sand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what to do about itPhil DaoustMon 30 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTShareAnyone who has ever dropped their phone in the toilet – and isn’t that all of us? – knows something about the importance of a good strong grip. We come into the worldready to grasp anythingplaced in our hands, and if we are lucky we leave it the same way. In between, grip lets us cling to our parents, hold our lovers, rock our babies. The morning I wrote this, before I was even dressed, it enabled me to strap on my watch, lock the kids out of the bathroom, wash my hands, insert my contact lenses, strip, shower, brush my teeth, take my medicine and check my phone. A few hours later, as I hung upside down on some gymnastics rings, it stopped me slipping off and cracking my head on the floor.But you know what? This just scratches the surface. Not only does grip help you work, play and pull your trousers on in the morning; it offers an immediate insight into your health. To put it bluntly, the weaker your grip, the more likely you are to die early.Find that hard to swallow? A study of 140,000 adults in 17 countries found that a weak grip went hand in hand with a higher risk ofheart attack and stroke, and was a better guide to “all-cause mortality” than blood pressure. It is associated withosteoporosis,diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,fall riskandobesity, as well ascognitive decline. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, it is also linked to age-related muscle loss, or sarcopenia.For all these reasons and more, doctors often use grip strength as a quick measure of a patient’s health, including their ability to recover from surgery or live independently. “It’s a really easy thing to test,” says physiotherapistSarah Milner. “You don’t need to hook someone up to a machine, you don’t need to look at their muscle mass, you don’t need to take their weight …”The only real drawback is that it focuses on upper-body strength, which is why patient assessments often combine a grip test with asit-to-stand, which gauges lower-body strength.Grip strength reliably reflects “total body strength, neuromuscular coordination and cardiovascular resilience”, in the words of Delhi GPRamit Singh Sambyal. He says that patients in their 50s with a surprisingly weak grip often report fatigue, slower recovery after minor illnesses and a higher percentage of body fat. Conversely, those with a stronger grip tend to have better functional fitness and recover more quickly.View image in fullscreenStaying active will slow the ageing process.Photograph: Nikola Ilic Pr Agencija Za Dizajn Studiotripod Surcin/Getty ImagesTo be clear, no one is saying a weak grip will kill you directly, in the way that heart failure will. But it usually indicates problems far beyond your hands and wrists. We don’t yet have the scientific studies to back this up, but it seems reasonable to assume that anything that improves it will also improve your overall health. It will certainly improve your quality of life.Some weakening of the grip is inevitable as we get older. “From about 50, muscle mass and nerve function gradually decline,” saysSamantha Shann, occupational therapist at Oak Tree Mobility and director of The OT Service. “But staying active – particularly with meaningful and hands-on tasks – helps slow the process.”Actually, we should be talking aboutgripsrather than grip. As well as crush grip, which lets us shake a hand or hold a dumbbell, we mostly rely on pinch grip (think of turning a key or holding a plate) and support grip (to carry something like shopping), though there are enough subcategories to make your head spin. The more precise types may need to be trained with more delicate exercises, but in general what strengthens one grip also benefits the others, by working the flexor muscles that clench our fingers and thumbs, and the extensor muscles that straighten them, as well as our wrists and forearms and sometimes our upper arms and shoulders, too.How do you know whether all this needs attention?Sometimes looking is enough.Lucy Joslinteaches calisthenics, which features a lot of dangling from rings or pull-up bars, and handstands, where often the only thing keeping you balanced is the way your hands grip and flex against the floor. Every class begins with exercises for the hands, wrists and shoulders – bending them, stretching them, putting weight on them, frequently in quite uncomfortable positions. “I look at people’s hands all day long,” she says. “You can tell unconditioned hands from conditioned hands – the people who are in touch with their fingertips and the people who are not. And then they go to grip a pull-up bar and it’s like their hands can’t close properly. And as forhanging off the bar, which is something I take for granted …no. And it’s not just because they don’t have the strength in their shoulders.”Milner, meanwhile, says her job has given her “monkey grip”. As a result, “I like doing bar hangs. That for me, is like, ‘Where’s my grip strength at?’ And I know that if I’m fatigued my bar hang is a piece of shit.” On a good day she can hang for 90-120 seconds.When she told me this, I thought I’d see how long I could manage. Thanks to almost a year of calisthenics I made it to 90 seconds – but the last 45 were pretty unpleasant.There are gentler ways of testing, though. “You can do it by squeezing a tennis ball and seeing how long you can hold your tightest grip,” Milner suggests. Do that regularly and you’ll be able to track whether your grip is improving or deteriorating.“I encourage clients to notice how they manage everyday tasks,” says Shann. “Can they open a tight jar, wring out a cloth or carry a kettle comfortably? These are all functional ways of assessing grip.”View image in fullscreenTesting grip strength with a dynamometer.Photograph: microgen/Getty ImagesFor a more formal measurement, you’ll normally squeeze (all right,crush) a device known as a dynamometer. You can get one of these for less than £20, though it may not be as accurate as medical-grade equipment. “Grip strength varies with age and gender,” says Shann, but broadly speaking here’s how much force you should be able to exert:Age 18 to 25Women 27-31kg, men 46-52kgAge 26 to 35Women 26-30kg, men 44-50kgAge 36 to 45Women 25-29kg, men 42-48kgAge 46 to 60Women 20-28kg, men 35-47kgAge 61 to 75Women 18-26kg, men 30-45kgOver 75Women 16-20kg, men 25-40kg“While everyone’s baseline differs,” Shann says, “these numbers can highlight the need for support or intervention. It could mean a person is at risk of frailty, especially if combined with fatigue or reduced mobility.”Remember what I said about accuracy? Naturally, I had to try a dynamometer myself. The first one I bought gave me a reading of 39.1kg, which as a 61-year-old I should have been happy with. It still felt a little low given how much time I spend hanging from things. So I got another and squeezed it all the way to 46.6kg. I’m not sure which reading is more realistic, but I know which is better for my ego. Still, to put both into proportion, the world-record squeeze is more than 170kg.But what can you do if you’re not happy with your result?“I often recommend turning everyday activities into opportunities for strengthening,” says Shann. “Tasks like cooking, gardening or carrying laundry all challenge grip in a natural and functional way. Structured exercises can be added in when more support is needed, such as a tennis ball squeeze (hold for three seconds, release, and repeat 10 times per hand, daily) or a towel twist (roll a towel and twist it in opposite directions, for one or two minutes a few times a week). I usually tell clients they can expect to notice small improvements in four to six weeks if they’re consistent.”View image in fullscreenHold for three seconds, release, and repeat.Photograph: Stopboxstudio/Getty ImagesAnd those little gadgets where you try to force two handles together with your hand, against the resistance of a spring? I’ve somehow accumulated five of them, rated all the way from 50lb (23kg) to 250lb (113kg). I can barely make that last one move.Forget them, says Milner. What originally attracted me to them – that it’s so easy to crank out squeeze after squeeze after squeeze – is also what makes them dangerous. “They’re terrible,” she says. “People start using them and they give themselves some form of tendinopathy [tendon damage] from overloading. That repetitive gripping is awful.”Better to take a less direct, more holistic approach. “When it comes to strengthening,” she says, “it’s really important to talk not just about your hand and your forearm, but about the wholekinetic chain.” This is the physios’ way of saying that everything is linked; no muscle is an island;the toe bone’s connected to the foot bone…“The shoulder and the scapula – the shoulder blade – are intrinsically linked to grip strength,” Milner says. “So I would do things like full-body strength training or functional strength training.”Imagine you’re in apush-upposition, say. “If you’ve got your hands on the floor, and you’re weight-bearing with a flat palm, or you start doing different types of grip on the floor, you’re already strengthening your palm muscles and your forearm muscles, and you’re loading up the shoulder blade. And then you can play with taking one hand off the ground and doingshoulder taps, or doingdown dogsor ahigh plank.View image in fullscreenIf you have one of these, get rid of it.Photograph: Athima Tongloom/Getty Images“That’s going to strengthen your wrists and hand muscles, but it’s also going to hit you higher up the chain. It will also train yourproprioception, which is basically knowing where your wrists and finger joints are in space, as well as your elbow and shoulder. And that is massively linked to strength, because if you have no idea where anything is, you’re going to really struggle to be strong in that area.”Train your grip, in other words, by training things that aren’t obviously your grip. And throw away those squeezy things.Grip it real good!Six ways to improve your grip, by physiotherapist Sarah MilnerAt homePush-upsThese come in many variations, so if they seem intimidating, you can adjust the difficulty by changing the angle, the position of your hands and the distribution of your weight. Start standing with your hands on the wall for a simple push exercise and progress this to the classic horizontal version on the floor. You can make this more challenging by playing with the position of your hands (wider, more narrow) and where your weight goes through (fists, just fingertips).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Towfiqu Ahamed/Getty ImagesWet towel wringsSoak a towel in water, then grip and twist it to wring it out. Use both hands, and twist in both directions to improve the strength of your forearm and hand flexor muscles.Pinch grip holdsFind the heaviest book in your house and take it between your fingers and thumb in a classic “pinch grip” position. See how long you can hold it. You can play with the position of your arm (by your side, out in front of your body, above your head) and how bent or straight your elbow joint is.In the gymDead hangsTry to hold on to a bar as long as your grip will allow you. You can change your hand position to challenge different hand and forearm muscles (neutral, supinated or pronated). This is a great exercise that helps activate your shoulder muscles, which are so important for grip strength. (Confused about those hand positions? If you stand with your arms by your sides, thumbs facing forwards is neutral. Palms facing forwards is supinated. And palms facing back is pronated.)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Getty ImagesBarbell bent-over rowsThis is a great multi-muscle exercise; the heavier you go, the harder your arm muscles, shoulders, shoulder blades and core have to work. Make sure you progress the weight steadily, and get a professional to guide you if you’re concerned about your form. You can use either a pronated or a supinated grip.Reverse kettlebell above-head shoulder press. Hold on to the handle of an upside-down kettlebell (the ball part should be at the top and handle at the bottom). Try to keep your wrist in a neutral position (and straight) as you complete a strict above-head shoulder press. Try to move slowly and avoid the kettle collapsing down. This will challenge all of your arm and hand muscles as well as improving joint control and stability through the shoulder, elbow and wrist.Explore more on these topicsHealthFit for everFitnessHeart attackStrokeObesityDiabetesAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then came an invitation to something newCaroline ButterwickMon 30 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 05.01 EDTShareI take a calming breath, then step up to the microphone. Here, in this crowded bar, I know that, despite my nerves, reading out my poetry will be a joyous experience.I had been attending these open mics for a year and this was my first time performing. As a student, I had been active and sociable, but a period of mental ill health in my early 20s dented my confidence. I am partially sighted, too, which means going somewhere new can be daunting; I can miss the visual cues for striking up conversation, while navigating unfamiliar surroundings is tricky. By the time I was 28, I was stuck in a cycle of safe activities, such as dinner with my circle of friends in our go-to restaurants.I also felt disconnected from my community in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, where I had moved for university. Sometimes, I felt lonely, especially as most of my uni friends now lived further away – social occasions were something that needed to be planned weeks in advance. I didn’t know many people locally any more and realised I needed to do something to forge new connections.Then a new friend of my husband asked if we wanted to join her at a poetry open mic that night. I was unsure – at the time, I often felt an internal resistance to new experiences. But I knew I had to move forward.View image in fullscreen‘I was moving out of my comfort zone.’Photograph: Supplied by Caroline ButterwickWe arrived at the bar and perched on stools at the back. It was busy. I sipped my drink awkwardly. Then the person opposite said hello and we chatted until the host took to the stage. Everyone applauded and cheered as the poets performed. During breaks, I chatted to others with ease. These were people who lived in the same city as I did. They were sharing their poetry with one another, laughing and joking. I was hooked. It reignited the spark of impromptu nights out that seemed to belong to a past version of me. I remembered how much I loved the shared experience of art.The one change that worked: A friend pulled out of a trip – and it left me with a newfound love of solo travelRead moreI became a regular and started to recognise familiar faces, looking forward to catching up over a pint of cider and spoken-word poetry. The acquaintance who had first invited me soon became a good friend.And it wasn’t just the poetry night. I started trying other experiences, eager to make more connections within my community. Yes to a gig at that new venue. Yes to a community fair. I was moving out of my comfort zone. I posted on Facebook to ask for recommendations of places to visit locally and soon found myself exploring a beautiful country park with a friend. I now feel a stronger connection with my adopted home town and with the people who live here.Watching others perform their poetry, I was inspired to write my own. Standing on the stage two years ago, reading my fledgling poems, I felt buoyed by the community spirit. That open mic showed me the joy of stepping out of my comfort zone. It helped me find myself again. I am beginning to feel that I belong.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The grated courgette melts into the pasta, and works perfectly with the lemon, trout and a hit of chilli. If you have one of those multi-nut and seed mixes (the M&S 35-plant one is excellent), by all means add a scoop to finish; otherwise, a scattering of toasted pine nuts will add a welcome crunch. An elegant dinner for two.Courgette linguine with trout, lemon and dillPrep10 minCook20 minServes22 trout fillets2½tbsp olive oilSea saltJuice and finely grated zest of ½ lemon,plus 2 lemon slices180g linguine2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated1tsp chilli flakes1 large courgette, trimmed and coarsely grated10g fresh dill, roughly chopped4tbsp pine nuts, or 4 tbsp omega nut and seed mixHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the trout fillets on a small lined baking tray, drizzle with half a tablespoon of olive oil, scatter over a pinch of sea salt and top each fillet with a slice of lemon. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until just cooked through. (If you have an air-fryer, the fish will take eight to 10 minutes.)Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, then cook the linguine according to the packet instructions, until just al dente. While the pasta is boiling, get all the remaining ingredients ready.Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. Return the empty pasta pan to the hob on a low heat, add the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil, then fry the garlic, chilli and lemon zest for just 30 seconds.Add the grated courgette, fry for a minute, until just starting to soften, then add the drained pasta, dill, lemon juice and a teaspoon of salt. Stir well – there should be enough liquid from the courgette to form a clinging sauce; if not, add a tablespoon of the reserved pasta water. Flake the cooked trout in large pieces into the linguine, then stir gently to combine. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Use tongs to divide the pasta and trout evenly between two warmed bowls, top with the pine nuts and serve hot.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkQuick and easyPastaFoodVegetablesFishMain courseStarterrecipesShareReuse this content"

I stopped to collect a coffee from theStarbucksdrive-thru in a retail park near the airport.I asked the assistant if it was OK to park up to drink it and was told there were 60 minutes’ free parking. In total I was on the site for 16minutes.Soon afterwards I received a £100 from MET Parking Services. I immediately contacted Starbucks, which told me I was supposed to enter my car registration on an iPad in store.This had not been mentioned by the staff and there was no iPad available at thedrive-thru kiosk.Stansted travellers beware!CF,Sudbury, SuffolkScores of other drivers have been charged £100 for sipping a coffee at the Southgate Park retail park which lies off the A120 by the airport, according to online forums.This must make it the most expensive latte in the UK. The car park seems to also be ranked one of Britain’s trickiest traps for motorists.The Guardianfirst exposed its opaque rulesback in 2018 and it seems it’s still providing a lucrative income stream for the enforcement firm, MET Parking Services.Signs greeting arrivals proclaim that parking is for customers only. Terms and conditions are detailed on separate notices in font illegible through a windscreen.Many of those caught out parked outside Starbucks and ordered from the adjacent McDonald’s, or vice versa. That’s because the Ts and Cs decree that the lot is divided into two sections – one for each outlet – and that, as well as pulling up in the correct bays, customers must register their vehicles within the correct restaurant.Starbucks told you helplessly that it has no control over parking charges, and referred you to MET. It ignored your question about why you were not properly informed by staff.It also ignored my requests to know why drive-thru customers are not automatically told of the registration requirement and provided with an iPad.There’s little point in a drive-thru if they have to walk into the cafe to comply. I wanted to know whether it has pressed for clearer signs, and how many complaints it has received in the last year, but it didn’t bother to reply.I found MET to be just as uncommunicative. In vain I asked why the signs are not clearer, whether it, or the landowner, keeps the charges levied on unwitting drivers, and how much it collected in the past year.MET’s parking charge notice may be unenforceable, in any case. Parking companies obtain the address of a vehicle’s registered keeper from the DVLA, but they can’t prove it was the registered keeper at the wheel. In most cases that doesn’t matter. The 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, which applies to England and Wales, allows the registered keeper to be held liable for breaches of conditions on private land if the driver is not named.However, keeper liability does not apply to land where parking is covered by specific laws – known as statutory control – such as railway stations and airports. You should be asked if you were the driver, and if you refuse to confirm who was at the wheel the charge notice can’t be pursued.In at least one case the independent appeals service, Popla, allowed an appeal because MET failed to rebut the appellant’s claim that Southgate Park is within the boundary ofStansted airport. Your fine has since been cancelled by MET – I suspect the prospect of a headline was the nudge it needed.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

In most people, that sugar is broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is found in our small intestine. It helps our bodies digest and absorb lactose without causing discomfort. “We’re born with plenty of lactase. But as our diets diversify, our lactase levels decline,” says Avery. “If there is minimal milk in the dairy diet then lactase levels may be zero, thus people from some cultural backgrounds and countries where dairy intake is negligible may be intolerant.”People who don’t produce enough lactase may find themselves having gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and loose stools when they consume dairy. Some people can find their lactase activity is temporarily reduced when their gut function is disrupted by antibiotics or stress. This can lead to “transient lactose intolerance” – a period where your body struggles to digest dairy even if you weren’t previously sensitive.If people cut out dairy and then reintroduce it, they might also experience abdominal symptoms for a short period while their lactase activity is being restored, says Avery. But this doesn’t necessarily mean you’re permanently intolerant. It could just be your gut enzymes playing catchup. “Good practice, even if you do think you are slightly intolerant, is to try to keep a little dairy in your diet – cheese or yoghurt should be OK.Cheesehas very little lactose, and in yoghurt, much of the lactose is broken down by the bacteria. Even having a little bit of milk in your tea helps,” says Avery.So, is it true that we’re all a little bit intolerant to dairy? No, but our ability to digest it can definitely fluctuate. For many, it’s not a lifelong intolerance but a temporary reaction.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingIs it true that …Food scienceFoodDairy-freeMilkCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It should suggest character, create intrigue, and kindle desire. Who doesn’t want to explore the Crazy Mountains of Montana, or make a fiery pact with California’s Diablo Range? While studying a map of Spain, my interest was piqued by a patch of grey and green emptiness bearing the enticing words: Sierra de la Demanda.I’ve travelled all overSpainfor work and play in the last two decades, but somehow these “demanding” mountains had eluded me. Located in the remote northern interior, halfway between Madrid and Santander, their isolation (and a dearth of English-language Google results) only added to the mystique. The Sierra de la Demanda covers a vast area across Spain’s least populated regions of Burgos, Soria and La Rioja. An investigation of more detailed maps revealed an almost roadless expanse of limestone peaks, valleys, ravines, rivers, gorges and glacial lakes, with the highest peak, San Lorenzo, towering at 2,271 metres (7,451ft). The calling was real.View image in fullscreenAn abandoned railway station speaks to the depopulation of this region ofEspaña vacía.Photograph: Lois PryceThis is not the Spain of white villages and dusty olive groves. On the Demanda’s north face, where the climate is wetter and cooler, the improvised allotments, stone ruins and makeshift shacks are reminiscent of the forgotten corners of eastern Europe. Climbing higher, above the treeline, the terrain becomes harsh and rocky with sweeping views across plunging, pine-covered valleys. But unlike the dramatic outline of Spain’s more famous mountain ranges, the Demanda appear gradually, almost secretly, their true splendour only emerging once you’re deep in their midst. Every season brings its own charms. Winter is a snowy picture postcard, but in spring the meltwater sends waterfalls thundering down the mountainsides among wildflower meadows. Summer is hot and arid, but by autumn the temperatures hover in the mid-20Cs with (mostly) solid blue skies, and the ground is swathed in pink heather and alpine flowers.The views are stupendous in every direction – fold upon fold of untouched mountain wilderness and nothing human-made in sightThe town of Ezcaray, on the north side, is the closest thing to a tourist hub – a scenic former textile centre on the River Oja that operates as a base for the small ski resort of Valdezcaray, built in the 1970s (thePalacio Azcáratehas doubles from €90, B&B). The sealed road ends abruptly after the ski centre, becoming a rocky trail that makes for a nail-biting drive (especially in a hire car) along a ridge that’s at more than 1,800 metres (6,000ft), before looping back to Ezcaray in a dizzying descent of hairpin bends. The views are stupendous in every direction – fold upon fold of untouched mountain wilderness and, apart from the occasional hiking trail signpost, nothing human-made in sight.Halfway around the loop road, if you’re craving more back-country adventure, a dirt track, appearing as an almost imperceptible black line on the Michelin map and marked with a rusty, hand-painted sign, takes you down into the southern foothills via the Lagunas de Neila, a cluster of glacial lakes, surrounded by cliffs and pine forests. The lakes can only be reached on foot, and at an altitude of 6,000ft make for an invigorating dip. The Laguna Negra is named after its dark waters, but in the late afternoon sun it appears a deep, shimmering blue. The water is, as you would expect, bracing, but it’s the sheer scale of the surroundings, and the solitude, that will take your breath away. The only sound accompanying my swim was a chorus of surprisingly loud frogs, ribbeting from the reeds.View image in fullscreenThe eerie Necrópolis de Cuyacabras, where dozens of adult- and child-sized tombs are carved from a slab of rock in a pine forest.Photograph: AlamyOn their south side, heading downhill from thelagunas, the Demanda feel different. The climate turns drier and warmer, and Spain becomes familiar again, with its oak forests, medievalermitas(chapels) and sleepy villages where old men wave from their chairs outside the taverna.Although there are plenty of well-marked hiking and mountain bike trails here, this is still “España vacía” – empty Spain – and human activity remains a rare sight outside the towns. This phenomenon of the interior’s depopulation is much discussed by Spanish politicians and citizens, and the low density is tangible here – traffic is light and most of the activity is among the animal kingdom. Deer leap through the trees, boar amble across the road, and as the forests give way to open rocky landscapes, griffon vultures perch in their hundreds along the high cliffs before swooping and circling in the late afternoon thermals.The village of Quintanar de la Sierra, in the southern foothills, makes a good base to explore the Demanda, and theHostal Domingooffers affordable rooms (doubles from €55, room-only). Like all the villages in the area, life moves slowly and peacefully. Locals get around on horses and in beat-up 4x4s, the shops shut all afternoon, nobody speaks English, and everyone, young and old, socialises in the town plaza where acafé con lechewill set you back €1.50. Like the ski centre, the hotels and bars are a non-ironic throwback to the 1970s, their only concession to the 21st century being charmingly rudimentary websites and an email address. This is the land that social media forgot, and is better off for it. Although it may appear on the surface that there’s not much in the way of tourist attractions, as you delve deeper into its hidden corners, an intriguing and eclectic landscape of history and culture reveals itself.Just over the hill is one of cinema’s most well-known locations, where The Good, The Bad & The Ugly was filmed in 1966Dinosaurs roamed this part of Spain, and hundreds of their footprints are visible near the town of Salas de los Infantes, which also boasts adinosaur museum. Moving on a few miles, and a few million years, is the eerieNecrópolis de Cuyacabras, dating from the ninth to 11th centuries, where dozens of adult- and child-size tombs are carved from a slab of rock in the depth of a pine forest. Meandering through the villages, Roman bridges, abandoned monasteries and ruins of all eras – from medieval to mid-century – appear at every turn. For lovers of industrial archaeology (AKA clambering around abandoned buildings), an enticing disused railway runs through Salas, its crumbling stations and rusty tracks half hidden beneath tangles of vegetation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twenty miles west, venturing deeper into fantasy land, is theTerritorio Artlanza, which claims to be the largest sculpture in the world. A magical, full-scale reproduction of a medieval Castilian village, created by Félix Yáñez, a local artist, from materials salvaged from rubbish dumps, it includes porticoed squares, a perfectly equipped school, a carpentry shop, bakery, forge, canteen, wine cellars, an alchemist’s pharmacy and even a small chapel.Empty patches on maps that elicit few Google search results are rare in these hyperconnected, overshared times. There is a timelessness to the Sierra de la Demanda that feels like innocence, and while other parts of Spain struggle with the pressures of over-tourism, these mountains are a lungful of fresh air. The charms of the Demanda are simple and unshowy, and ironically, make few demands on the visitor – except to breathe deeply and tread lightly.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a very beautiful hairbrush: it comes in a choice of seductive colours and it is fashioned from the keratin-rich fibres of south-east Asian boar and from biodegradable cellulose acetate (entirely free of petrochemicals). It was advertised to me on social media and I later sought it out, Googling it again and again, admiring photos of it from different angles and imagining the reassuring weight of its handle in my hand. If ever there were a hairbrush that could help me build a better life, I thought, this surely would be it.How disturbingly close I came to buying this hairbrush I really cannot say. However, Icantell you when I knew that it was never going to happen. It was just now, when I realised with shock, after months of Googling and ogling, that I don’t use a hairbrush. I haven’t used one in close to 25 years – not since I was old enough to understand that my hair is curly and terrible frizzy things happen when I brush it. I use a wide-toothed comb once a day in the shower.So, I now find myself wondering, what happened here? What purpose was served by this fantasy of buying an expensive hairbrush that I do not need?Regular readerswill be unsurprised to hear that I think it probably has something to do with avoiding my feelings. For some people (hello, friends), buying things serves to neutralise an unwanted emotion. Another person might punch someone, or watch pornography, or do some work on the weekend, or eat a hamburger, or spend a whole night scrolling on their phone. You do it, then you feel a little bit better – and a little bit ashamed.What is the emotion I was turning away from? I don’t know. And if I ever find out, it probably won’t be for publication. But perhaps the answer is less important than the question.For some people (hello, friends), buying things serves to neutralise an unwanted emotionMany readers will think I am asking the wrong question and that the answer to the question Ishouldbe asking is: that’s capitalism for you! And if ever there were a socioeconomic system that could sell a woman an exorbitantly priced and exquisitely fashioned hairbrush when she had no need for one, capitalism would be it. But I also think that shouting: “That’s capitalism for you!” does not build a better life. It may even take us further away from it.It is very tempting, when faced with something we don’t understand about ourselves, to turn away from our own minds and towards our society. To shout about capitalism, about the internet, about social media – to find an answer in the outside world. But what has helped me to build a better life is noticing my tendency to do that and then, as a patient in psychoanalysis, to wonder what it is that I don’t want to see in my inside world that makes me turn away from it so quickly.In other words, I think shouting: “That’s capitalism for you!” would, for me, serve the same function as drooling over an unnecessary hairbrush. It is all serving to close down a feeling. You could call it a kind of self-soothing.Terrible things happen in life – but it is possible to recover from themRead moreI remember as a fairly new mum, in the depths of sleep-deprived horror, reading and hearing a lot about self-soothing and wondering what people really meant by this. Experts seemed to think the solution to every difficulty was my baby learning to self-soothe. I was not able to think very clearly at that time, because my child was sleeping – or rather, as it felt to me, waking – in 45-minute cycles throughout the night and therefore so was I. We were going through something quite intolerable that nevertheless had to be tolerated. We both had a lot of feelings about this, which it felt as if everyone wanted to soothe away.Well, I think there is too much soothing going on, self and otherwise. This is why Netflix, social media, parenting experts, south-east Asian boar bristles and capitalism itself can have such power over us – because they feed our compulsion to self-soothe rather than nourishing our need to feel and to try to understand what is going on inside.Perhaps we don’t realise that there is an alternative to soothing. This alternative is difficult to imagine if you have never experienced it, but it is something my analyst offers me and that I try to offer my patients. It involves developing a capacity to survivenotself-soothing. Instead, bear whatever you are experiencing without trying to soothe it away, without trying to brush out the knots – including not knowing what feels wrong. Understand how enraging, frustrating, disappointing and frightening it can be not to know. This can be far more containing than reaching for an immediate answer to a question that actually takes us further away from a truer understanding. (That’s capitalism for you.)Perhaps our crying babies, and the crying babies inside us, need something different from self-soothing. Perhaps we all need to develop a capacity to bear our distress and to realise that we can survive it and grow through it. This is something that can truly help us to build a better life, and a better society – far more valuable than a beautiful hairbrush that will sit in a drawer, never to be used.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why spend billions on weapons – soft power would keep us safe, 26 June). He writes: “Every conceivable tool should have been deployed to introduce Russia into the European community of nations.”Russia was incorporated into the G7, received a state visit from the Queen, and was added to Eurovision. Tony Blairgave Vladimir Putin silver cufflinksfor his birthday, and supported Russia’s war in Chechnya. None of this, not the facilitating of Russian oligarchic investment in the UK, not BP investing billions in Russia, not Russia hosting the Winter Olympics and World Cup, has worked.Sometimes soft power simply ensures that tyrants continue to act with impunity, and ensures that the message “We disagree with your actions and want you to stop” falls on deaf ears.Chris RousellDurhamSimon Jenkins is absolutely correct. To spend $1.3bn on US aeroplanes whose operational use is subject to US approval serves only to repeat the continuing and expensive folly of Trident et al. To announce this in the same week as proposing to cut support for some of the most disadvantaged people in our grossly unequal society beggars belief.Many years ago, Ralph Miliband argued that theLabourparty had become a “party of modest social reform”. Even this now seems overly optimistic. As a party member since the early 1970s, I am one of many thousands who are seriously thinking of resigning.Richard TaylorPooley Bridge, CumbriaSimon Jenkins makes a compelling case. Arming ourselves to the teeth sustains hostility rather than fostering peace. The west missed the golden opportunity to end the cold war whenMikhail Gorbachev dismantled the Soviet Union. The end of the cold war would have made Nato redundant. Instead it was treated as a victory of capitalism over communism, and Nato was strengthened. That has led inexorably to Putin.Soft power fosters mutuality. Overseas aid, properly targeted, helps communities to health education and self-reliance. It engenders a friendly disposition towards the aid-givers when it is politically unconditional. That is surely a more successful path to a safer world, rather than retreating behind a fortress mentality and spending on defence, which soaks up our public services resources while not solving real, existential global problems.John StoneThames Ditton, SurreyApparently Simon Jenkins thinks that in dealing with Putin’s Russia, soft power will keep us safe. It is a huge pity that the great Russian journalistAnna Politkovskayais not alive to comment on this story, but she was shot dead outside her Moscow apartment in 2006 – on Putin’s birthday as it happened.Natalia Estemirova, the Russian human rights activist might have said something, but she was murdered in 2009. PossiblySergei Magnitsky, the Russian tax lawyer, might have said something, but he died in police custody in 2009.Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition politician, would surely have offered a different point of view but he was assassinated within sight of the Kremlin in 2015. SadlyAlexei Navalnyis unable to rebut the wishful thinking of Jenkins as he died in a Russian gulag in 2024.Brendon BonnerPorirua, New ZealandOf course Simon Jenkins is right to emphasise the importance of soft power, but surely we need both the hard and soft options?

However, the real problem is that the reason we have such disparities in health is that they are directly related to the gross disparities in wealth and income in this country.AsProf Michael Marmotand many others have demonstrated, some of the most important factors in determining health are social and economic. It is all very well for the NHS to make efforts to actively address the effects of social and economic deprivation in poor areas, but this is managing symptoms rather than the cause.It is no coincidence that the UK has some of the worst health outcomes of developed countries and also among the worst levels of inequality. As the greatest advances in health in the past were not attributable to improvements in healthcare, but to improvements in the conditions in which people lived, so now it is reducing levels of poverty and inequality by economic and social change that are required to meaningfully address the problems identified in the article. While politicians pretend to want to address the problem, there is a consensus of inaction on the radical changes necessary because the consensus of our politics has drifted so far to the right.Stephen SmithGlasgowRe Britain’s “medieval” health inequality in what has been termed “broken Britain”, surely the only way in which the “break” can be mended is tax increases. Why does this obvious solution not get the traction it requires? Those on reasonable incomes could pay more. Those with a lot of wealth should pay more.

The earliest evidence of its usage that we found was inHenry David Thoreau’s book Walden(1854); in it he lamented society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas in favour of simple ones, viewing it as indicative of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort. The term has been applied variously to reading too many books, watching too much television, and listening to “pimpley music”, bringing us up to date with the digital content that takes the blame currently.While it took the last year or so to really cement it in the language, it seems that nothing much has changed except the medium.Concerned parents, citizens, or even linguists can take comfort in one fact revealed by our research: the supposed consumers or victims of brain rot are often the very people using the term (to mean both the content itself and its impact on them). This suggests that – whatever the cost to intelligence or attention spans – they at least retain self-awareness or a sense of irony.

Within a day of posting there were armed police at his door.It was Father’s Day, and the 31-year-old father of two was in his pyjamas when they arrived. He had no idea his post would land him in trouble; after all, he had campaigned for a long time, under different governments, for action on jobs for young people.But this month’s video by Thakeli, asking why the premier, Sam Matekane, had not delivered on a promise to create jobs, had struck a chord with young people, who began sharing and discussing the post online.Initial attempts to charge him with insulting Matekane and inciting violence were abandoned due to lack of evidence. He was released but re-arrested the same day and charged with sedition.“They just threw me into the holding cell. Here they are very bad: they’re very small, dark, dirty, stinking and it’s cold in there,” he said. He was held for two days. Thakeli was then summoned by Lesotho’s head of police and told to never mention the prime minister’s name again.View image in fullscreenLesotho’s prome minister, Sam Matekane.Photograph: Molise Molise/AFP/Getty Images“The police commissioner said, ‘You can talk however you want, but never mention his name again, and we cannot guarantee you any protection should you go out there again and mention his name.’ He was basically saying should anything happen to me they would not do anything about it,” said Thakeli.But Thakeli has ignored the warning. He said he has no choice but to keep speaking out and has continued with social media posts and videos that attract tens of thousands of viewers.A public debate on youth joblessness was prompted recently whenthousands of peopleturned up to an army recruitment drive seeking to fill 500 vacancies.Maketane announced he would create 70,000 jobs in just three weeks. Thakeli’s video questioned the substance of this promise, highlighting that there was no provision for such job creation in a budget announced in February and asking why there had been no action in the three years since Maketane’s election.Lesotho struggles with16% unemployment, with the rate rising to24% for young people, according to the World Bank. Thakeli, now a business owner, said he struggled to find a job after graduating as a lawyer.He has long campaigned for action on unemployment, staging a one-man protest on the issue outside parliament in 2016, long before Maketane took office.‘A revolution is building’: can young people force change across Africa?Read moreThakeli’s arrest sparked protests in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, but alsoconcern among human rights activistsin the wider southern African region over the attack on an individual expressing concern over basic social problems.“These are questions any citizen should be asking about – for democracy, for society, they should be able to ask this. He’s not asking for the PM to be removed, he’s just asking the question. The response from the government is terrifying,” said Makomborero Haruzivishe, of the activist group Action for SouthernAfrica.On social media, Thakeli uses humour and memes, including a picture of his lawyer looking unimpressed and captioned, “[the] face he makes every time I make a live video.”But in reality he is concerned for his safety and that of his wife and daughters.Now on bail, his lawyer has heard that the authorities are considering revoking it to force him to remain in custody before a trial on 2 July. Thakeli is baffled by being suddenly seen as a security threat.“I’m a citizen of this country: the issues of concern to the people – they affect me. I know what we go through every day. The situation keeps deteriorating and nothing is being done about it; corruption scandals fill the headlines each week,” said Thakeli. “I’m not armed, I don’t belong to any organisation, I’m just a concerned individual who wants what’s best for my country and fellow citizens. I just want to hold my government accountable as that’s my duty as a citizen.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentProtestLesothoAfricaHuman rightsUnemploymentnewsShareReuse this content"

Prime minister Carney andCanadacaved to president [Donald] Trump and the United States of America,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a daily briefing.“The president made his position quite clear to the prime minister and the prime minister called the president last night to let the president know that he would be dropping that tax.”Carney told reporters on Monday his decision to backtrack on a controversial tax was meant to revive trade negotiations with the United States after Trump halted talks on Friday, alleging a Canadian effort to coax payments from American tech heavyweights operating in Canada was a “direct and blatant attack on our country”.On Monday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told Fox News that Canada’s decision “absolutely” meant both sides would resume talks.In an announcement late on Sunday, Carney said key talks with the administration would resume now Canada had repealed the levy, which applied to US tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Uber and Airbnb.Canada’s finance ministry said Carney and Trump would resume trade negotiations in order to agree a deal by 21 July.Trump says he is ending Canada trade talks amid tech tax disputeRead moreThe tax was first announced in 2020 and was designed to remedy the fact that many large American technology companies operating in Canada did not pay tax on revenues generated from Canadians.The tax has long been an irritant for Donald Trump, and he usedthat frustrationFriday to “terminat[e] all discussions on trade” with Canada, calling the digital services tax “a direct and blatant attack on our country”.Canada’s decision to cancel the tax comes as the US and Canada are locked in negotiations over a trade and security deal. Carney wants tariffs imposed by the Trump administration removed as part of an agreement.Currently, Canada faces tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum exported to its largest trading partner and a 25% on tax on cars, as well as blanket tariffs on all other goods exported outside the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.Canada was set to collect a 3% levy on digital services by major tech companies. The first payments were due on Monday and large American companies were expected to pay more than US$2bn to Canada’s federal government – a fee retroactive to 2022. Over a five-year period, the tax was expected to raise more than US$7bn.Hassett said Trump had raised the tax issue with Carney at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta earlier this month.“One of the things that the president asked for was that they would take the … tax off. It’s something that they’ve studied, now they’ve agreed to and, for sure, that means that we can get back to the negotiations.”US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick thanked the Canadian government for dropping the tax as others in the administration rushed to credit Trump for the policy shift.“Thank you Canada for removing your digital services tax, which was intended to stifle American innovation and would have been a deal-breaker for any trade deal with America,” Lutnick posted on social media.The walkback suggests the “Canadian government misreading the tech sector has become a hallmark of its policy”, according to Michael Geist, a law professor at University of Ottawa and the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law.“It is hard to overstate how badly the government managed the [digital services tax] issue over the past five years,”he wrote in a blogpost, adding the move to pursue the tax “alienated allies” and “solidified opposition, and continually downplayed the concerns of successive US presidents and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle”.Geist said moving forward with the tax left Canada in a “no-win situation” and suggested the government had “overplayed its hand”.“Unfortunately, the government has too often viewed tech primarily as a source of revenue for policy projects – the proverbial ‘make web giants pay’ – while overestimating the attractiveness of the Canadian market and underestimating the risks of costly regulation,” he wrote. “Canada desperately needs a tech regulation reset. Perhaps the embarrassment of walking away from $7bn will provide the wake-up call.”Business groups praised the move.“This tax would have fallen on Canadian consumers, businesses and investors in the form of higher costs and hurt our economy at a critical time,” David Pierce, vice-president of government relations at the Canadian chamber of commerce said in a statement, adding the end of the tax “moves us one step closer to a renewed, reliable trade deal” with the United States.Explore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMark CarneyInternational tradeAmericasGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

The severed heads were found in a bag at the site.The grisly finding comes at the end of the most violent month so far in a war between factions of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful drug-trafficking organisations, amid growing evidence that its main rival, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, has joined the conflict.The war broke out on 9 September 2024, six weeks after thearrest of two of Mexico’s most powerful crime bossesin El Paso, Texas.Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained along with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane touched down in the US. El MayoaccusedEl Chapo’s son of betraying him and delivering him to US authorities. Now a faction led by El Mayo’s son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo, who remain free in Mexico.The Mexican government has piled thousands of soldiers into Sinaloa, but has proven unable to curb the violence. The last two months have been the most violent yet. Overall, the war has left nearly 3,000 dead or missing.A message found alongside the bodies under the bridge indicated that the perpetrators belonged to La Mayiza, the faction led by El Mayo’s son.In the face of mounting losses, El Chapo’s sons, known as Los Chapitos, have reportedly struck a deal with their one-time rival, the Jalisco cartel. The US Drug Enforcement Administrationwarned about the potential alliancein a report last month.Such an alliance could shift the balance of power in a war that, until two months ago, seemed to be gradually reducing in intensity. It could also lead to a restructuring of the two groups’ criminal empires, which extend not just across Mexico but the world.US authorities have previouslyidentified the Chapitosas key drivers in the trafficking of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid responsible for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the US in recent years.Under pressure from the Trump administration, Mexican authorities have striven to show greater action against fentanyl trafficking, especially in Sinaloa, with more lab busts, arrests and drug seizures.According to US Customs and Border Protection data, fentanyl seizures at the border with Mexico have fallen by almost 30% this year compared to the same period last year.The Trump administration has alsodesignated the cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, while threatening the possibility of unilateral military action on Mexican soil, and recentlyaccused three mid-sized Mexican banksof laundering drug money, cutting them out of the US financial system.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The runner-up who had been considered a favorite – the former interior minister Carolina Toha from the traditional Democratic Socialist party – took 27.7%.Chilean president makes historic trip to south pole amid Antarctica sovereignty claimRead more“Today begins a new path that we will walk together, with the conviction to build a fairer and more democratic Chile,” Jara wrote on social media. “In the face of the threat from the far right, we respond with unity, dialogue and hope.”After Boric’s 2022 election, voting was made compulsory, adding unpredictability to this year’s race.Preliminary turnout figures from electoral authorities showed that turnout was much lower than expected, with just 1.4 million people casting ballots. Chile has about 15.4 million eligible voters.Although Jara’s landslide win represents the rise of hardliners within Boric’s coalition, analysts have described Jara as less dogmatic and more diplomatic than some of her communist peers. As labor minister, she earned praise for a program that increased minimum wage and reduced the working week to 40 hours.She has earned comparisons to Michelle Bachelet, Chile’s former center-left president and an icon of female empowerment who governed 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018.Paying tribute to Bachelet in her victory speech, she said: “She was the one who showed us the path that nothing is impossible.”But Jara faces a tough climb to the top job. Recent opinion polls show the leftwing government declining in popularity at a moment of sluggish economic growth and rising fears over organized crime and migration in what has long been regarded as one of the region’s most stable and prosperous democracies.Those hot-button issues have helped mobilize support for Chile’s rightwing candidates, particularly theultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker José Antonio Kast, and set the stage for a deeply polarized election.Another favorite on the right is Evelyn Matthei, a former minister of labor whose business-friendly policy proposals have charmed investors.Chileans will go to the polls on 16 November to elect a president for the 2026-2030 term.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Night-time lows plunged well into the negative double digits. One weather station in Chile – located 69 metres above sea level at an airport near the city of Puerto Natales – recorded a minimum of -15.7C on Sunday evening, nearly 14C below the average June minimum.Although subzero temperatures are not uncommon inChilein early winter, the severity of this cold spell prompted the Chilean Meteorological Directorate to issue warnings late last week highlighting the risk of severe frosts.While the south contended with frigid conditions, a storm system farther north brought torrential rainfall to the far south-east ofBoliviaand southern Brazil over the weekend. A weather station in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul reported 92mm in just 24 hours on Sunday. This came a week after the same state was hit by devastating floods, which killed three people and forced the evacuation of at least 6,000 people as rivers overflowed.The storm system, which is now clearing into the southern Atlantic, has made way for the high pressure to expand northwards. This is expected to extend the cold air into more central regions of the continent, including Paraguay, Bolivia and south-eastern parts of Peru. In these areas, daytime highs in places that typically reach up to 30C may struggle to exceed the mid-teens.In China, relentless rainfall over the last two weeks has led to destructive floods across parts of the south-east. In the provinces of Guizhou and Guangxi, two separate heavy rainfall events last week, both intensified by the east Asian monsoon, triggered historic floods as rivers overflowed. One of three rivers that converge near the city of Rongjiang rose 2 metres above its safety threshold early last week after rainfall totals of twice the June average fell in just 72 hours. Later in the week, further downpours pushed the river 4 metres above the limit. Much of the city became submerged, resulting in six deaths and 300,000 evacuations. Regional meteorologists described it as a one-in-50-year event.View image in fullscreenRescuers evacuate residents in Rongjiang county after flooding in China’s Guizhou province.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockFarther south, a tropical depression that originated from the South China Sea made landfall on the island of Hainan on Thursday before its remnants moved north-east into the mainland. The rainfall associated with the system brought further disruption to densely populated areas already struggling to recover from the recent Typhoon Wutip.Scientists have said rising global temperatures and the resulting increase in atmospheric moisture have led to an increase in the intensity, frequency and unpredictability of extreme rainfall events in China in recent years.Explore more on these topicsAmericasWeather trackerChileArgentinaUruguayBrazilBoliviaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Authorities estimated that some of the remains could have been there for up to two years.According toearlier local news reports, 60 bodies had been found at the site.Instead of ashes, relatives were given “other material”, Garcia said.Garcia alleged “carelessness and irresponsibility” by the crematorium owners, adding that all such businesses “know what their daily cremation capacity is”. “You can’t take in more than you can process,” he said.One of the administrators of the crematorium had already turned himself in to prosecutors.Authorities did not specify whether the corpses belonged to victims of criminal violence.Mexico, a country hard hit by organised crime, has been suffering for years from a crisis in its forensic system, saturated by the high number of bodies to be processed, the lack of personnel and budgetary restrictions.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

At least two robots were stretchered off after failing to regain their feet after going to ground.Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offered the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots. He said humans could play robots in the future, although judging by Saturday’s evidence the humanoids have some way to go before they can hold their own on a football pitch.Cheng said: “In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe.”The competition was fought between university teams, which adapted the robots with their own algorithms. In the final match, Tsinghua University’s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University’s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5–3 to win the championship.One Tsinghua supporter celebrated their victory while also praising the competition. “They [THU] did really well,” he said. “But the Mountain Sea team was also impressive.

Incheon receivedmore than 100 reportsin a single day this year.The outbreak has triggered heated debate over pest control methods.“They have a disgusting appearance but are actually beneficial insects,”Seoul authorities saidin public announcements, warning that spraying chemical pesticides indiscriminately would kill “various other organisms” and harm humans.

ASeoul Institute surveyfound 86% of residents consider lovebugs as pests despite their ecological benefits, ranking them the third most unpleasant insect after cockroaches and bedbugs.Government researchersare reportedlydeveloping fungal pesticides that target lovebug larvae while minimising ecosystem damage.Natural population control is also emerging as birds, including magpies and sparrows, learn to eat the insects, causing numbers to drop in previously affected areas.The lovebugs typically disappear by mid-July, as their brief adult lifespan means populations crash rapidly after about two weeks of intense activity.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaInsectsClimate crisisAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It was expected to approach the NSW central coast later on Tuesday before turning and moving offshore into the Tasman Sea on Wednesday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.The NSW State Emergency Service had deployed vehicles, helicopters and personnel to areas likely to be heavily affected.The SES had responded to more than 600 incidents since Monday morning and had received about 1,000 calls to the state operations centre, a spokesperson said.“We’re seeing a lot of debris and trees down, requests for sandbags and also leaking roofs,” they said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe bureau had classified the system as a “vigorous coastal low” – not an “east coast low” or “bomb cyclone”, as some reported.Bureau meteorologist Helen Reid said the current weather system was more mobile than an east coast low.While the low-pressure system early on Tuesday had some similarities, there were some important differences in physical characteristics, duration and moisture, she said.A severe weather warning was in place for people in the mid-north coast, metropolitan, northern tablelands and parts of the northern rivers, Hunter, Illawarra, south coast, central tablelands and north west slopes and plains districts.Weather warnings were issued for Taree, Newcastle, Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong and Port Macquarie.The mid-north coast region was an area of concern for emergency services because the soil was still saturated from the May floods.A ‘vigorous’ coastal low is headed for Australia’s east. But what does that mean, and how worried should we be?Read moreReid said the wind and rain were likely to increase into Tuesday afternoon and overnight.With the rain continuing, some places along the coast could record more than 100mm and “even a couple that might get up to the 200mm mark”, Reid said.Several places received nearly a month’s worth of rain. By 7.30am on Tuesday, Jervis Bay had recorded 109mm, Currarong 85mm and Williamtown 70mm. Several places in the northern rivers had already seen 40mm of rainfall, she said.The bureau was also warning of destructive winds averaging 60-70km/h, with peak gusts of up to 125km/h possible.By Tuesday mid-morning, wind speeds of 91km/h were recorded at Wattamolla south of Sydney.“Winds could bring down trees or tree limbs, lead to dangerous driving conditions due to crosswinds or debris being thrown across the roads, and lead to power outages and possible damage to cars and property,” Reid said.Conditions were expected to be treacherous on the water from Seal Rocks to Batemans Bay, with the potential for waves up to seven metres.

Conditions could lead to coastal erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure.Widespread heavy rainfall could cause flooding, although there was some uncertainty over the exact location and timing of the heaviest falls.“The rain will be very rapid, it will be heavy, it will be short and sharp,” said SES deputy commissioner Debbie Platz. “We do expect this system will cause potential riverine flooding from minor to moderate in some catchments.”Catchments likely to be affected included: Wallis Lake, the Myall River, Wollombi Brook and the Lower Hunter River, the Upper Nepean River, Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean rivers, Upper Coxs River, the Colo River, Macdonald River, northern Sydney, southern Sydney, the Parramatta River, the Cooks River, Georges and Woronora rivers, Illawarra coast, St Georges basin and the Snowy River.Platz reminded people not to drive into flood waters. “A vehicle can move in about 10cm of water and be washed away depending on the intensity and flow of that water system,” she said.Warragamba Dam was 98% full and was expected to spill in the coming days based on forecast rainfall, WaterNSW said in a social media post.Transport for NSW urged public transport users, motorists and boaters to be prepared.A spokesperson for Sydney airport said flight schedules could be affected. “We recommend passengers check with their airline regarding the status of their flight.”Airservices Australia said aircraft movements had been reduced on Tuesday morning and it was working to manage the impact of severe weather conditions in Sydney.The SES urged people to be vigilant.“We’ve been asking people to prepare their homes and properties since last week and now it really is too late to be outside in the weather,” a spokesperson said.The bureau’s Reid said: “On Wednesday, the focus for the rain will shift further south. Scattered showers and rain areas will still impact the east coast, between the mid-north coast to the Victorian border, but the heavier falls will be focused through the Illawarra and the northern parts of the southern coastal district.”– with Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsAustralia weatherNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to knowRead moreTheirreportanalysed nearly 1,900 videos of Tate from YouTube between May 2024 and May 2025, and filtered them down to the 100 most-viewed videos containing misogyny, accounting for nearly 54m views on the site.In one video, Tate says: “Nowadays it’s gotten so fucked up – you got the men and the women, the husband and wife, all together on the same table. The men are trying to have a conversation, some dude’s wife fucking pipes up.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn another video, Tate says: “Have a solid bottom bitch, if you have one girl who truly is out … and is on your side, and you can use her to control other girls, it’s so much easier.”Some of the videos had ads running on them, meaning YouTube receives revenue for views of the videos.YouTube said it had removed hundreds of thousands of Tate videos since the ban, and terminated thousands of accounts that had sought to circumvent the original decision and attempted to upload content from the banned creator.A spokesperson said it had not received all videos from the centre to check for a breach of company policies, but had removed most of them.“As with all terminated users, not all content that features Andrew Tate will be removed, including for example, a news report featuring the individual. But all content on YouTube, including content that discusses individuals whose channels have been removed from our platform, is subject to our community guidelines – we remain committed to removing any material that violates these policies.”Some of the videos cited in the report had since been removed for violating YouTube policies, or had their accounts deleted.The chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Imran Ahmed, said YouTube, like all platforms, is “incredibly poor at enforcing its own rules, even when we notify them about it.”He said the head of the Metropolitan police in London had recently told him about the growth of teenager-on-teenager violence against girls.“That is being dubbed the Tate phenomenon, because what we’re seeing is a significant increase. We’re seeing significant evidence around the world of young men moving to sort of extremist and in particular, far-right politics,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was not until Monday, three days later, that a text message was sent to 47,000 people apologising for the error.“Thousands of Norwegians were mistakenly informed that they had won a large prize in the Eurojackpot. This was a mistake that affected many and which we take very seriously,” wrote Norsk Tipping’s managing director, Vegar Strand, in the text message.“We deeply regret what has happened, and on behalf of us at Norsk Tipping, I would like to apologise to everyone affected by this. We are incredibly sorry to have disappointed so many.”Among those who received the text message was Ole Fredrik Sveen, 53, who had received a notification informing him that he had won 1.2m kroner (£86,650) while he was on holiday in Greece. It later turned out he had won a modest 125 kroner (£9).“At first you’re ecstatic and happy about the message you got, that says you won 1.2m kroner,” said Sveen, a culinary school teacher from near Oslo.But his elation had been short-lived. After 15 minutes he grew suspicious and started checking Norwegian news sites only to discover that many people had similarly been told they had won big sums of money.“You could have been really unlucky and spent a large amount of money then found out it wasn’t true,” he said. “But thankfully we kept our heads cool and realised it wasn’t meant to be this time either.”Sveen said he had put the disappointment behind him and while 125 kroner would not get him very much, he would be celebrating the win anyway. “You don’t get too much champagne for that money. It’s more like a glass of prosecco or crémant than champagne,” he said.Norsk Tipping has been strongly criticised for the mistake by players and authorities. Sveen said he had lost confidence in the lottery and would think twice about playing in future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One was the migration minister,Makis Voridis, a former far-right activist and prominent figure in the governing New Democracy party who was agriculture minister when the fraudulent scheme is alleged to have operated.Greek court strips three far-right MPs of seats over electoral fraudRead moreIn a rare display of damage control, Mitsotakis acknowledged the failings of a state apparatus that ought to have changed. “The state’s inadequacy is obvious,” he said. “Clientelism [political patronage] cannot govern the way we conduct business.”The scheme, which allegedly saw hundreds of applications being made by nonexistent owners of pasture and grazing land over a five-year period beginning in 2017, was brought to light by the European public prosecutor’s office (EPPO). The Luxembourg-based office launched its inquiry in 2021.The funds were distributed by the state subsidy agency, OPEKEPE, which has since been dissolved.On Monday the centre-right prime minister told his cabinet that the new taskforce would be expected to act speedily. “I await results quickly. We will investigate the incidents immediately and exhaustively in line with internal and European legislation. Since OPEKEPE didn’t manage to do its work the state will do it centrally.”The scandal has been described as “one of the biggest farming frauds of recent years” according toPolitico, which said the illegally siphoned funds could amount to €45m (£38.6m) a year. The misuse was such that citizens with no known links to the agriculture sector, including a lawyer based in Athens, had applied for the aid. Some had posed as the owners of fictitious plots and others making claims as fake livestock breeders.Officials who had tried to alert authorities after uncovering irregularities were either discredited, demoted or removed from top posts. OPEKEPE has had six presidents over the past five years.The revelations have fuelled public anger and come against a backdrop of disaffection with a political elite seen asinefficient, out of touch and corrupt. An MRB poll last week revealed a stunning 74.5% of Greeks believed ministers had a hand in the scandal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than 50,000 people in Turkey have been evacuated from their homes due to forest fires, according to the interior ministry’s disaster and emergency management authority.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said at a development conference in Seville on Monday: “Extreme heat is no longer a rare event – it has become the new normal.”View image in fullscreenPeople queue at a fountain during a heatwave in Saint Peter’s Square, Vatican City.Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPAInPortugal— his home country — a reading of 46.6 C (115.9F) was registered in Mora, about 60 miles east of Lisbon. Weather officials were working to confirm whether that marked a new record for June.The southern Spanish city is forecast to roast in more than 40C heat for the next three days and face night-time temperatures of at least 25C until Thursday morning. Doctors have expressed alarm at the combination of hot days and uncomfortably warm nights, which can place a lethal stress on the human body.InItaly, where 21 out of 27 cities were placed on the highest heat alert on Sunday, hospital admissions in some of the hottest regions – such as Tuscany – are up 20%. People have been advised not to venture outside between 11am and 6pm.InFrance, heat warnings covered nearly the entire mainland for the first time in history.

The highest temperature previously recorded for June was 45.2C logged in Seville in 1965.Sunday was the hottest 29 June in Spain on record, according to records from Aemet, the Spanish meteorological agency, that stretch back to 1950.

The German weather service has said heat and dry weather are stoking the risk of forest fires, with some cities imposing limits on water extraction as temperatures in parts of the country approach 40C by Wednesday.In Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, the government has urged employers to take the danger to their staff into account. “Companies are bound by heat protection rules at the workplace,” the regional health minister Britta Müller said, including maintaining an acceptable temperature indoors and guarding against excessive sun exposure.The UK is projected to have temperatures of 34C in London and the south-east of England, with the Met Office warning that high temperatures and humid conditions will be “quite uncomfortable” for those working outside, as well as people leaving Glastonbury and attending the start of Wimbledon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For this reason, outdoor workers are particularly at risk and should take regular breaks to hydrate in the shade.”1:21Wildfires rage across Turkey's Izmir province – video reportThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its teams were supporting responders who were battling fires in Turkey,Greeceand Norway. In other countries such as Spain, Italy and the UK, its volunteers were handing out water and checking in on vulnerable people.Heat kills an estimated half a million people globally each year, with older people and those with chronic illness particularly vulnerable.The extreme temperatures across Europe are a result of a heat dome that is trapping an area of high pressure and hot air – a phenomenon that is also currently scorching the US. It comes amid an ongoing marine heatwave that has left the Mediterranean 5C hotter than normal, according to data from the University of Maine’s climate change institute.Dr Michael Byrne, a climate scientist at the University of St Andrews, said heat domes were nothing new but the temperatures they delivered were. “Europe is more than 2C warmer than in preindustrial times, so when a heat dome occurs it drives a hotter heatwave,” he said.Doctors across the continent warned people to take extra care in the hot weather, encouraging them to stay out of the heat, drink lots of water, wear loose clothing and check in on vulnerable neighbours.Researchers estimate that dangerous temperatures in Europe will kill 8,000 to 80,000 more people by the end of the century, as the lives lost to stronger heat outpace those saved from milder cold.“The planet is getting hotter and more dangerous,” said Guterres, who called for more action to stop climate change. “No country is immune.”Additional reporting from Angelique Chrisafis in Paris, Angela Giuffrida in Rome and Deborah Cole in BerlinExplore more on these topicsEurope weatherExtreme heatSpainFranceItalyPortugalGreecenewsShareReuse this content"

After giving evidence, he was denied bail and remanded in custody by the judge, Leopoldo Puente.The investigation began after the anti-corruption unit of the Guardia Civil police force handed material to the court that suggested Cerdán had discussed taking kickbacks on public contracts with the former PSOE transport minister José Luis Ábalos and one of the minister’s aides, Koldo García. Ábalos and García are also under investigation and have denied wrongdoing. Cerdán, who stepped down from his party role and resigned his parliamentary seat shortly after the news broke, has vowed to clear his name.Sánchez, who became prime minister in 2018 after usinga motion of no confidence to turf the corruption-mired conservative People’s party (PP)out of government, is already contending withgraft investigations relating to his wifeand his brother, who both deny any wrongdoing. A former PSOE member was also recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil police unit investigating the corruption allegations.Speaking after the judge’s decision, the prime minister said: “We acted firmly and now it will be up to the judicial authorities to establish Mr Cerdán’s responsibility.”But the move led the PP to renew its demands for a fresh election.“The person who Sánchez personally chose as his number two six months ago is today off to prison, accused of criminal charges including bribery,” said the party’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo. “If that doesn’t call for a resignation and an election, then it means [Sánchez] has totally lost touch with reality.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also directs Rubio to review Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa’s designation as a terrorist leader and Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and to consider measures for sanctions relief through the United Nations.“We welcome the cancellation of the majority of the sanctions program imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic, pursuant to the historic executive order issued by President Trump,” said Syrian foreign minister Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani. “By removing this major obstacle to economic recovery, the doors to long-awaited reconstruction and development are opened, along with the rehabilitation of vital infrastructure, providing the necessary conditions for the dignified and safe return of displaced Syrians to their homeland.”The White House sought to portray the decision as one that would protect US interests, noting Trump’s efforts to “address foreign terrorists”, promote the normalisation of ties with Israel, and prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State.“President Trump wants Syria to succeed – but not at the expense of US interests,” the White House said in a statement.White House officials said that the executive order would maintain pressure on the former leader Assad and his entourage.Trump news at a glance: president gives Syria ‘chance at greatness’ with promise of sanctions reliefRead more“The order will remove sanctions on Syria while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, Islamic State and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,” said the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing on Monday.The move was widely anticipated after Donald Trump briefly met with Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led forces that overthrew Assad in December. Sharaa has complained that the sanctions against Syria had made it difficult to stabilise his fragile transition government, citing issues with paying civil servant wages and funding reconstruction. Trump pledged in May to lift all sanctions on Syria following Assad’s removal from power.The executive order would “end the country’s isolation from the international financial system, setting the stage for global commerce, and galvanizing investments from its neighbors in the region as well as from the US”, said acting under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Brad Smith in a briefing with reporters.Asked about the Abraham accords, the Trump administration’s negotiations for Arab states to normalise diplomatic ties with Israel, a senior administration official suggested that the White House would not push for the recognition of specific territorial claims between Syria and Israel.“We’re going to come to a mutuality of understanding, and you’re going to get there slowly, and there’s going to be metrics and milestones and objectives, and you’re going to start trusting each other,” the official said. “And over this trust, those lines become illusory.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A US official said Netanyahu would travel to the US on 7 July to meet Donald Trump.The new “evacuation orders”warned of impending assaultsaround densely populated Gaza City and told Palestinians to head south to overcrowded coastal zones, where there are few facilities and limited water. About 80% of Gaza is now covered by such orders or controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).The orders also said that the IDF planned to advance into the centre ofGazaCity to fight Hamas militants based there.On Monday, Israeli tanks and infantry pushed into the Zeitoun neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Gaza City and shelled several areas in the north, while aircraft bombed at least four schools after ordering hundreds of families sheltering inside to leave, residents said.“Explosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes,” said Salah, 60, from Gaza City. “In the news we hear a ceasefire is near; on the ground we see death and we hear explosions.”In the afternoon, an airstrike hit a crowded cafe on the shore in Gaza City, killing at least 22 people, including women, children and a local journalist.The IDF said it struck militant targets in northern Gaza, including command and control centres, after taking steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.Analysts have detected changes in the rhetoric of senior Israeli officials in recent days, which may suggest a new ceasefire is now being considered.Throughout the conflict, Israeli attacks have intensified at significant moments in negotiations. Israeli officials have said one aim of Israel’s latest offensive, which was launched in May after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire in March, was to seize territory that could later be given up during talks as a “bargaining chip”.‘Post-apocalyptic’: medical staff struggle as gangs fight over aid supplies in GazaRead moreOn Friday, Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, said the offensive was close to having achieved its goals. Netanyahu has also reinforced his political position within Israel and so is better placed to ignore threats by rightwing coalition allies to withdraw support in the event of a deal with Hamas.A deal remains difficult though, officials close to the negotiations said, with both Israel and Hamas sticking to previous incompatible positions.Hamas is demanding that Israel agrees to a definitive end to the war and is refusing to disarm. Israel refuses Hamas demands to withdraw entirely from Gaza and says it will end its campaign only when the militant organisation has given up its weapons and its leaders have agreed to leave the territory.Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader, on Monday added his voice to those in Israel calling for an end to the war in Gaza.“There is no longer any benefit for the state of Israel from continuing the war in Gaza. Only damage on the security, political and economic level,” Lapid told a meeting of parliamentarians. “The army has no more objectives in Gaza.”A public opinion poll published the day after Tuesday’s ceasefire with Iran by public broadcaster Kan showed that nearly two-thirds of respondents wanted the Gaza war to end. The result was in line with dozens of similar polls in recent months. Israel’s military has sufferedsignificant casualtiesthis month, which has added to the public pressure for a deal.Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said on Monday it had received the bodies of 11 people who were shot while returning from an aid site associated with the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Fund in southern Gaza, Ten others were killed at a United Nations aid warehouse in northern Gaza, according to the health ministry.The Israeli militaryacknowledged on Mondaythat Palestinian civilians had been harmed as they sought food from distribution centres in Gaza and other locations, saying that instructions had been issued to forces after “lessons learned”.Food, fuel and other basics are scarce in Gaza, with distributions by the GHF coming nowhere close to meeting the needs of 2.3 million people.Israel says Hamas steals aid to finance military and other operations. The group denies that accusation and aid agencies say their monitoring systems are robust.The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza.Israel’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population and reduced much of the territory to rubble.AFP and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His language was more constrained than others in Iran, where the conservative newspaper Kayhan said if Grossi came to the country he should be put on trial and sentenced to death for links to the Israeli spy agency the Mossad.View image in fullscreenThe IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi. France, Germany and the UK condemned Iran’s threats against him.Photograph: Elisabeth Mandl/ReutersA joint statement on Monday from the UK, France and Germany said they condemned threats against Grossi “and reiterate our full support to the agency and [Grossi] in carrying out their mandate”, calling onIranto cooperate with it.“We call on Iranian authorities to refrain from any steps to cease cooperation with the IAEA. We urge Iran to immediately resume full cooperation in line with its legally binding obligations, and to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of IAEA personnel,” it said.Sleeper cells and threat warnings: how the US-Iran conflict is spinning up fearRead moreBut the sense in Iran of western double standards is fuelling a deep feeling of grievance, as well as a refusal to give the IAEA access to make an independent assessment of the damage to Iran’s nuclear sites, leaving such assessments to highly politicised reports emerging from the US.According to the Iranian account of the Sunday evening call, Pezeshkian told the French president: “What guarantee is there that our facilities won’t be attacked again, even if we cooperate?” He also questioned why Israel, which is not a member of the NPT, had been allowed to become a source of evidence for IAEA reports.Despite persistent reports that Iran and the US are using back channels to set up further indirect talks under the mediation of Oman, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said no such dates or times had been agreed.A compromise being floated by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff suggests that Iran be entitled to enrich uranium, a key Iranian demand, but in a consortium on the Iranian island of Kish under severe constraints.Speaking at a seminar hosted by the UK defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, Nicholas Hopton, a former UK ambassador to Iran, said huge damage had been done to the Iranian regime, but questioned whether any of Israel’s key objectives had been met including regime change. He said: “There was little evidence that Iran was rushing to a bomb three weeks ago and apparently now 400 kilos of highly enriched uranium are unaccounted for.“It will be a long time before the IAEA can comment authoritatively on the extent to which Iran’s nuclear programme has even degraded.”Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at St Andrews University, said: “There is a lot of shouting about nationalist solidarity that may subside as the dust settles. The official narrative that Iran has scored a major triumph against Israel is a classic case of when George Orwell talks about nationalism and indifference to reality.”He claimed that in reality serious discussions were going on within the state about what went wrong, its air defences, the lack of civil defence and the shocking and profound levels of infiltration of the security forces. “People are saying the one thing we thought the Islamic Republic can do is defend us and they cannot even do that. The Islamic Republic that went into this conflict will not be the Islamic Republic that comes out,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)IranEmmanuel MacronNuclear weaponsUS foreign policyIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

In the end, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – Iran’s elite military and intelligence branch, wielding a global web of terrorist groups and agents acting on its behalf – didn’t appear to sponsor or carry out any covert operations inside the US, nor has it since.The Department of Homeland Security, however,issued a heightened threat bulletin, because the “ongoing Iran conflict is causing a heightened threat environment”. The FBI followed suit with its ownwarnings of sleeper cells. The same sort of reasoning has been used before: during and after the invasion of Iraq, president George W Bushcontinued to link the fallen Iraqi regimewith “sleeper cells” and sponsoring terrorism against American targets.‘There’s a significant lack of knowledge’: Iranian American legislator on countries’ tangled history amid conflictRead moreIn the past, the IRGC and its proxies have certainly shown they are more than willing to carry out terrorism plots against the US – as was the case of a Brooklyn-based Iranian activist who wasthe target of a foiled assassination attemptin 2023 – but separating Maga talking points from reality prompts the question: how real are these sleeper cells?The US border “czar”, Tom Homan, has been accused of cherrypicking national security threats to fit his mandate. He suggested that the US border was so porous, Iranian operators have already taken advantage of it.“When I was a Fox News contributor,” Homan recentlytold Fox News, calling out Iranian agents as a threat, “I said my biggest concern is the open border causing the biggest national security vulnerability this country has ever seen.”To Trump administration figures like Homan and JD Vance, who have both warned of an almost imminent strike on Americans, Iranians have become useful bogeymen and a cudgel for emphasizing a foreign danger they can use for domesticcrackdowns.Experts say the IRGC threat is both credible and overstated.“While often discussed in sensational language, Iran almost certainly maintains small clandestine cells inside the US and other countries,” said Broderick McDonald, associate fellow atKing’s College London’s XCEPT research programme, who studies conflict in the Middle East. “Both Iran and proxies like [Hezbollah] have repeatedly used small clandestine cells for decades to carry out assassinations, target dissidents and collaborate with criminal networks.”Hezbollah, which has largely been degraded in power since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon last year, has acted hand in glove with the IRGC for years, including offering up its agents to the work of Tehran.US attacks on Iran redraw calculus of use of force for allies and rivals around globeRead moreMcDonald continued: “These so-called sleeper cells are a valuable asset for any country to collect surveillance, conduct targeted assassinations and carry out strategic strikes on military infrastructure during a crisis.”Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine,geopolitical watchershave warned that the conflict heralded a new era of sabotage and covert operations between nation-states. Iran, already experienced at these kinds of clandestine activities and willing to paythe Russian mafiato do its bidding – was expected to up its foreign op tempo, even before the Israel conflict.At the same time, operations such as Ukraine’s drone attack on Russian airfields, codenamed “Spider’s Web”, and Israel’s similar mission in Tehran before its bombing of the city earlier in June, have showcased the growing appetite among spy agencies to carry out acts of violence on the soil of their enemies.But McDonald explained that any attacks on the US homeland – especially with another Trump presidencymore than willingto escalate and carry out unprecedented killings – is a “contingency asset for regimes like Iran”.In other words, initiating a terrorist attack on the US would require a moment of true existential desperation, which is not where Iran currently finds itself.“Iran’s telegraphing of its retaliatory strikes on US bases in Qatar and Iraq suggests it was looking to downshift rather than inflame tensions with the US,” McDonald said. “While some media outlets and online personalities have played on sensational language to describe these so-called sleeper cells and the likelihood they will be mobilised, small clandestine cells do pose serious threats to national security that we are only partially prepared for.”For example, recent “war on terror”-styledreporting from Fox News, an outlet with public affiliations to the White House, blamed the Biden administration for letting more than 700 Iranians into the country, noting it was “unclear” how many of those people were on the terrorism watchlist.Sources confirmed to the Guardian that the FBI was indeed concerned with stateside Iranian infiltration. One threat in particular, the use of suicide first-person-view (FPV) drones on US citizens or major targets, would be almost impossible to defend against and has been popularized by its ease of use in Ukraine.“I am still surprised we haven’t seen more FPV-type attacks, but that’s certainly a strong possibility,” said Colin Clarke, thedirector of research at the Soufan Center, pointing out past Iranian sponsored attacks inArgentina,BulgariaandSaudi Arabia– evidence alone of its willingness to strike at its enemies using asymmetric means. Iran is also well known to have sponsored much of the insurgency against US forces in Iraq, going so far as tomanufacture the roadside bombsthat became a scourge on American soldiers there.But, according to Clarke, while Iran is a formidable and active foe to western countries, its current weakness might also mean it is much less likely to invite the wrath of the US and the Pentagon’s firepower.“I think the threat of sleeper cells in the United States is real, but now that there’s a ceasefire in place, Iran is unlikely to want its fingerprints on any traceable attack planning,” he said in an email. “But in the immediate aftermath of the war kicking off two weeks ago, and even before the US got involved, there were palpable fears of a potential terrorist attack on US soil conducted by Iran’s proxy network.”Clarke noted that the latest US-Israeli strikes on Tehran were likely to “to stoke further anger” in aclimate of political extremism, which has brought about recent killings.“Since the October 7 attacks and the ongoing war in Gaza, western countries have experienced a surge in both antisemitism and Islamophobic attacks, hate crimes and other violent events,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The sandals’ origins go back to the 12th century, to the city of Kolhapur in western Maharashtra state.View image in fullscreenA model wears items from Prada’s spring-summer 2026 menswear collection, including leather sandals, at Milan fashion week on 22 June.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersThe buffalo-hide shoes with their distinctive braided T-strap are worn by everyone from farmers to millennials and business leaders.The sight of models walking the runway last week in the footwear blandly described as “leather flat sandals” triggered a widespread backlash in India and charges of “cultural appropriation”.The row tapped into a broader debate about how global fashion houses frequently repackage traditional craftsmanship as luxury goods without credit or compensation to the original artisans.The sandals, known for their durability, cost about $12 (£8.75) in India, whereas Prada sandals retail for upwards of $800. Indian artisans “lose, while global brands cash in on our culture”, said Harsh Goenka, the chair of the pharmaceuticals-to-IT conglomerate RPG Group.As photos of the show spread online, Indian outrage mounted. “From the dusty lanes of Kolhapur to the glitzy runways of Milan … will the world finally give credit where it’s due?” asked the news outlet DNA on X.Gandhi asked Prada to seek ways for “collaboration or fair compensation that could benefit” Indian craftspeople. Bertelli replied the sandals were still in the “early” design stage, but that Prada was willing to open a “dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans”.“While Indian artisans and small-scale producers excel in craftsmanship, they rarely have access to capital or business acumen” to position their products globally as luxury goods, Dhanendra Kumar, an ex-World Bank executive director, said in India’s Economic Times.“By not calling their new line of sandals ‘Kolhapuris’, Prada is guilty of monetising cultural appropriation,” Kumar said.Still, some believe the row could have an unexpected upside. Sales of the sandals have plateaued in India in recent years, but local designers believe the spotlight could boost interest in the classic design, especially among younger consumers.“Until now, it hadn’t been considered part of the ‘cool’ or aspirational footwear space in India’s luxury market … I truly believe in the ripple effect of what Prada has done,” said Shirin Mann, the founder of Needledust, a label known for its contemporary take on traditional Indian embroidered slip-ons.Mann could be right. Since Prada’s runway show, Google Trends has shown a rise in searches for Kolhapuri sandals, and retailers report interest has surged, according to local media.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPradaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It has benefited from the huge growth in the industry, demanding hefty option fees from renewable energy developers to secure areas of the seabed to build their windfarms.The monarchy receives 12% of crown estate profits to fund its work, as well as the 10-year £369m renovation of Buckingham Palace. This fee was lowered from 25% in 2023 to offset the rise in profits from offshore wind projects.According to the new calculation, King Charles is poised to receive official income of £132m from the estate,at the same level as last year. The grant had remained flat at £86.3m for the four years prior.Dan Labbad, the chief executive of the crown estate, said the increase in profits in the past two years was a “short-term” phenomenon. “We expect this year to be the high point of these returns … before profits normalise,” he said.Michael Stevens, the king’s Keeper of the Privy Purse, said last year the expected significant increase in the sovereign grant would be used to fund the final stages of the renovation of Buckingham Palace. Once this is accomplished, he said “a reduction in the absolute amount of the sovereign grant will be sought as part of the royal trustees review in 2026-27, through primary legislation”, to ensure that the work of the royal family “continues to be funded at an appropriate level”.Overall the crown estate, which also includes a portfolio ofLondonproperties and rural real estate, is now worth £15bn, down from £15.5bn last year. The valuation for the marine part of the business dropped by £1bn this year to £3.4bn.The property assets in London were valued at £7.1bn, compared with £6.9bn the year before. Much of its portfolio in the capital is concentrated around Regent Street and St James’s, and includes Victory House, home to London’s oldest Indian restaurant, Veeraswamy.The crown estate also said it was redeveloping about 93,000 sq metres (1m sq ft) of commercial space in London as part of a £490m pipeline, via a partnership with Westminster city council to transform Regent Street, Haymarket and Piccadilly Circus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several actors portray the title character, which is described as a “time-jumping mosaic” spanning 70 years in the life of an accountant and mother of two in Ohio.It marks a high-profile return to the stage for Sarandon, who made her Broadway debut in 1972 in An Evening with Richard Nixon and … by Gore Vidal before her breakout film role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. By the time she was next on Broadway, in Exit the King in 2009, she was a household name and five-time Oscar nominee (who won for Dead Man Walking). Sarandon said: “I’m so honoured to be asked to be in a play during Matthew Warchus’s final season at the Old Vic,” adding that she was “terrified but excited”.Riseborough, similarly better known as a film star, has not acted on stage for 15 years. Her last major London role was in Ivanov opposite Kenneth Branagh at the Donmar Warehousein 2008. She recently appeared in Warchus’s screen version ofMatilda the Musical. Riseborough said: “It’s an honour to be taking on the role of Mary – amongst others – in Tracy Letts’ poignant play, alongside the extraordinary Susan Sarandon. I’m so very grateful to be working with Matthew again and thrilled to finally work at the Old Vic, a beautiful space.”Warchus called Letts “one of America’s greatest living writers” and said the play would be staged in-the-round – as will all the productions in his final season. Mary Page Marlowe will run from 23 September to 1 November.Letts is best known for his Pulitzer winner August: Osage County, which was directed by Anna D Shapiro in a Chicago Steppenwolf production that playedat London’s National Theatre in 2008. Shapiro directed the premiere of Mary Page Marlowe for the Steppenwolf theatre in 2016. In his review, the New York Times critic Charles Isherwoodwrote: “Some may find the play’s form frustrating; I found it beautiful and affecting, like flipping through a friend’s photo album in no particular order, finding some faces familiar, others unexpected. And then you come upon someone entirely unknown – who obviously meant much to your friend – and you realize, with a pang of sadness, that your knowledge of even those closest to you will always be fragmentary and incomplete.”Susan Sarandon’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreThis will be the play’s UK premiere. Letts said: “From my first experiences as a playwright here 30 years ago, to the run of August: Osage County at the National, London is an integral part of my development as an artist. I’m deeply gratified to have Mary Page Marlowe at the Old Vic, directed by Matthew, featuring these remarkable actresses. A genuine thrill.”Warchus will step down from the Old Vic in September next year, when he will besucceeded by Rupert Goold, who in turn will be replaced in the top job at the Almeida theatreby Dominic Cooke.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSusan SarandonMatthew WarchusAndrea RiseboroughOld Vic TheatreWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

A watershed occurredafter a Metropolitan police officer kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everardin March 2021 and anotherMet officer, David Carrick, was unveiled as a serial sexual offenderafter the force missed repeated chances to identify him as a threat to women.‘We’re here to spot predatory men’: the new force patrolling Dua Lipa’s Wembley showRead moreThe poll found that four out of 10 women do not believe police treat violence and harassment of women seriously, and 16% disagree.Asked about confidence in key institutions – the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts and local councils – to keep them safe confidence in police was 34%, and lower for courts and prosecutors at three out of 10, and lower still for councils.The new police national lead on violence against woman and girls (VAWG), Helen Millichap, said: “We need to keep these issues at the top of the agenda, and the societal outrage we see in response to these crimes needs to remain. We need to challenge misogynistic views that only serve to drive these crimes.“Policing has a role to play, and we are up for the challenge, but we are only one part of a wider system that must play their part.“What I want, is to show the public that progress is happening and for them to be confident that it is happening everywhere.”Four out of 10 told the survey they would report online harassment, almost the same number said they would not, and more than one in 10 said they would not report a rape or assault by a partner.Police believe the extent of violence against women is under-reported and the survey said: “The most common reasons for hesitation [in reporting] are the belief that the police wouldn’t act (31%) or wouldn’t believe them (25%). These concerns outweigh more practical barriers such as the process being too hard or slow (18%). This indicates that hesitation is driven more by distrust in the outcome than by the mechanics of reporting … Restoring trust that reports will be taken seriously and lead to action is essential to encouraging more women to come forward.”As part of the effort to show that police are serious, the Met today unveiled new technology that it said would increase charge rates of men who attack women such as their partners.It enhances pictures of the wounds such as bruises suffered, and is being issued to frontline officers.Police were finding bruises were harder to record on darker skin, and the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, said the new breakthrough was “equalising the service” to female victims.DS Sean Oliver said: “The device makes the image clearer. The definition of the image is better with the device. It can be shown to a jury.”He said in a pilot the device led to an increase in charge rate of more than 10% and, in some cases, allowed prosecutors to bring higher charges carrying more jail time.Rowley told the Guardian that he had protected the Met budget to tackle VAWG, with cuts expected elsewhere because of a funding crisis: “We’re making multiple steps and all of those steps help us improve the outcomes of victims.“VAWG we have to seeas an epidemicthat society has to fix.“I think we can be showing that we’re starting to win on this … bringing more people to justice, growing people’s confidence to come forward and report matters to us.”The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said courts and prosecutors, and not just police, had to improve and catch up: “There have been too many cases in the past where institutions have let down women and girls.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsMetropolitan policePoliceSexual harassmentUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

By Monday evening, the fire service said it was still tackling several wildfire incidents in the area.At 8.40pm on Monday, the fire service urged residents in the vicinity of the fire to “ensure their windows and doors are closed to prevent smoke from entering”.It said: “Our firefighters continue to work tirelessly to tackle several wildfire incidents from Carrbridge in Highland to Dallas, outside Forres in Moray.“A significant number of resources and special resources have been mobilised throughout the area.”A flood alert wasissuedfor some of the affected areas by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which said: “Minor flooding impacts and disruption to travel is possible if the heaviest rain falls in vulnerable areas.”The SGA said that a “round-the-clock effort” from gamekeepers and land managers, working with the fire service, helped prevent two fires from merging into one larger blaze – a move that would have been a “nightmare scenario”.Scottish first minister John Swinney said on X: “The wildfires that are taking place are extremely serious. Please follow all of the advice available. Grateful to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service⁦⁩ and local people for their efforts to get the fires under control.Fergus Ewing, the MSP for Inverness and Nairn constituency, said the wildfires “raging” across the area were “said by many locals to be the worst in our history”.He added that he had already urged the Scottish government to convene its emergency response committee – the Scottish government resilience room, known as SGORR.The SGA called on the Scottish government’s nature advisers at NatureScot to visit the sites of these blazes to see first-hand their impact and the efforts required to tackle them.Speaking about the blazes, an SGA spokesperson said: “This is becoming a danger to human life because firefighters are becoming so stretched dealing with wildfires that they don’t have the resources to attend other fires.”They insisted: “We need to have the Scottish government and their advisers out now to see what is happening, while these fires are ongoing.”One witness, who tried to put the initial fire out,toldBBC Scotland News that the seat of the wildfire was a ring of stones where a camp fire had been lit and camping chairs had been abandoned.Dræyk van der Hørn, a Scottish Greens councillor for Moray, photographed the wildfires from a summit in the Cairngorms earlier on Monday.He said: “Wildfires in Scotland were once a rarity. Not any more.“Hotter, drier springs and summers – driven by the accelerating climate crisis – are turning our landscapes into tinderboxes.“Fires are now more frequent, more intense and more destructive. This is not a distant warning.“Climate change is here, and Moray, andScotlandare on the frontline.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

But her case was rejected by the islands’ courts and her final appeal was dismissed by the privy council.Raznovich said the decision could have implications for ongoing litigation in other British overseas territories, such as Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands.But he was less confident about the impact on cases involving independent Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, which still have colonial era laws that criminalise consensual anal sex and where same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are prohibited.In 2018, ahigh court judgmentrepealed Trinidad and Tobago’s so-called “buggery law”, but in April thecountry’s supreme court upheld a government appealagainst the ruling and recriminalised the act, forcing campaigners to take their case to the privy council.Controversial “savings clauses”, which typically were created when countries gained their independence, and were designed to preserve colonial laws unless they are changed by parliament, complicates the situation in Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean countries.Anglin told the Guardian she would provide a response to the decision on Thursday when she has had the time to fully review the judgment and meet with her legal team.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCayman IslandsLGBTQ+ rightsJudicial committee of the privy councilnewsShareReuse this content"

He also told them to refrain from sharing any details about their discussions in any future notes.Earlier on Monday, Subramanian told jurors that they were the “sole and exclusive judges of the facts” who are to determine a verdict without bias or prejudice to either of the parties involved.He emphasized that prosecutors had the burden of proving Combs is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not proof beyond any possible doubt.Combs, 55, wasarrested in Septemberand faces felony charges: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denied the accusations against him.If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison. He has been held without bail at a federal detention center in Brooklyn since his arrest.Prosecutors allege that for over two decades, Combs led a criminal enterprise, aided by employees and associates, that engaged in, attempted to engage in and worked to cover up crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, drug distribution, arson and bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.The government has sought to prove that Combs used violence, threats, money, drugs, intimidation and power to abuse and coerce two of his former girlfriends into participating in “freak-offs”, which were described as drug-fueled sex marathons with hired male escorts.The defense has insisted throughout the trial thatall sexual encounters were consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. They have argued that no criminal conspiracy exists and that Combs is being wrongly prosecuted for his “private” and “personal sex life”.Throughout the trial, Combs’s lawyers acknowledged past instances of domestic violence, but denied that Combs committed sex trafficking and that any coercion took place.Since the trial began on12 May, the jury has reviewed dozens of text messages, videos and receipts. The government called 34 witnesses to the stand, includingtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, multipleformer employeesand assistants, several male escorts, stylists, hotel workers, law enforcement agents and well-known figures such as therapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richard, among others.Key testimony came from two of Combs’s former girlfriends and alleged victims, the singerCasandra “Cassie” Venturaand awoman identified as “Jane”, both of whom described the alleged “freak-offs” in graphic detail and alleged that they were coerced into participating.They both testified that Combs directed, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed the sexual encounters.The women described times when they said Combs wasviolent with themand they alleged that Combs would threaten torelease explicit videos of themorcut off financial supportif they didn’t meet his demands.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyers sought to cast Ventura and Jane as willing and consenting participants in the “freak-offs”. Combs’s team presented loving and at times explicit text messages exchanged with Combs – some of which showed the women expressing enthusiasm for the encounters. His lawyers also frequently brought up the role that jealousy and drug use played in their relationships.Another woman, a former personal assistant who testified under the pseudonym “Mia”, alleged that Combs physically and sexually assaulted her during her employment.Defense attorneyssuggested that she fabricated the allegations, and highlighted social media posts and messages from after the alleged assaults in which Mia praised Combs, calling him a “mentor” and an “inspiration”.The governmentrested its case last week. Shortly after, Combs confirmed that he would not be testifying. His legal team also rested its case, but opted not to call any witnesses of its own. Instead, his team submitted evidence to the court and relied on its extensive cross-examinations throughout the trial.During closing arguments, the prosecutionspentnearly five hours outlining the government’s case against Combs, revisiting testimony from several witnesses, and broke down each allegation against Combs.The prosecution described him as “the leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to “take no for an answer” and alleged that he was someone who wielded “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.“The defendant was a very powerful man,” she said. “But he became more powerful and more dangerous because of the support of his inner circle and his businesses – the enterprise.”The defense offered its closing argument on Friday, and told the jurors that the government’s case against Combs was “false” and “exaggerated”.Combs’s lawyer urged the jury to reject the prosecution’s case against Combs and pushed back against the government’s accusations, disputed various pieces of witness testimony, and challenged the prosecution’s portrayal of Ventura and Jane as sex-trafficking victims.Combs’s lead lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, cast Ventura, the government’s star witness, as a woman with agency, rather than a victim, who willingly participated in the sexual encounters.The lawyer also pointed to the $20m settlement she received from Combs in 2023 after filing a civil lawsuit accusing him of abuse, which triggered the federal investigation, as well as the $10m Ventura is expected to receive from the owner of a hotel in Los Angeles where she was assaulted by Combs in 2016.“If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it’s hard not to pick Cassie,” Agnifilo said. “This isn’t about a crime, this is about money.”Though he did not take the stand, throughout the entire trial, Combs has been engaged and active in his defense, often seen whispering to his lawyers and reacting visibly to testimony.Earlier this month, the judgewarnedthat Combs could be removed from the courtroom for looking at and “nodding vigorously” at the jury during a cross-examination.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

It appears the man later killed himself, Kootenai county sheriff Bob Norris said.First responders made urgent calls for help on their radios at Canfield Mountain just north of Coeur d’Alene: “Everybody’s shot up here … send law enforcement now,” according to one dispatch.Idaho shooting: two dead after gunman ambushed firefighters responding to blazeRead moreTwo helicopters converged on the area, armed with snipers ready to take out the suspect if needed, while the FBI used his cellphone data to track him and the sheriff ordered residents to shelter in place. They eventually found the suspect dead in the mountains, his firearm beside him.The suspect has been identified as Wess Roley, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press on Monday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation.“We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and it was intentional,” the Kootenai county sheriff, Bob Norris, said at a Sunday night news conference. “These firefighters did not have a chance.”The wounded firefighter was “fighting for his life” after surgery and was in stable condition, Norris said.“When you have an environment where you don’t know where the bullets are coming from because of the trees and the shrubbery and what have you, it is daunting for police officers, let alone firefighters,” Norris said.The outpouring of support was swift in Coeur d’Alene, a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington.View image in fullscreenA procession from Kootenai Health heads to the medical examiner’s office in Spokane, Washington, after firefighters were killed on Sunday.Photograph: Bill Buley/APHours after the ambush, people gathered along Interstate 90 holding American flags to pay their respects as the two fallen firefighters’ bodies were taken to the medical examiner’s office in Spokane, Washington, about 35 miles (56km) from Coeur d’Alene.Governor Brad Little on Monday ordered US and Idaho state flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor the firefighters until the day after their memorial service.“All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” he said in a statement. “This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.”The Idaho house Republican leadership said in a statement: “We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.”Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff’s office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning. The status of the fire was not immediately known on Monday morning.Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the outskirts of Coeur d’Alene, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.Fire is always a concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge on Sunday afternoon, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he was not seeing aircraft. “Because they’re concerned about being shot at,” he said.As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his backdoor and leads directly to the site of the fire.“I just don’t want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody’s out prowling around my place,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIdahoUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Among other issues, it raised concerns that employee decisions around accommodation were being driven by AI processes that – one source claimed – do not necessarily follow ADA rules.One disabled corporate employee who had feared retribution for coming forward about workplace complaints told the Guardian they had been fired without explanation over the course of being interviewed for this story. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity while they were in the process of seeking new employment.View image in fullscreenAndy Jassy, Amazon CEO, in New York on 26 February 2025.Photograph: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images“After the removal of the messages on Slack and my firing, others are now afraid. I talk with them and they are terrified about Amazon doing this,” the person said.The employee who was fired was one of the leaders of a campaign to organize disabled workers. An email the person sent to senior Amazon managers on 6 June, which was seen by the Guardian, accused the company of violating federal labor rules that ensure rights to collective bargaining and disability-related rights to share information with others who have a disability.“My Slack access was removed preventing me from sending updates, coordinating and engaging in [National Labor Relations Act] protected activities,” the person said.The Guardian was also provided screenshots of Slack messages and a petition that appears to have been removed from an Amazon employee Slack channel on disability and accessibility issues.Amazon did not dispute claims that the messages had been removed. The company said the messages were a violation of company policy to use Amazon’s electronic systems for solicitation purposes. Amazon did dispute claims that it had retaliated against employees for seeking to organize on labor issues.A spokesperson said: “Amazon respects employees’ rights to organize and doesn’t interfere with these rights. We don’t discriminate or retaliate against employees for engaging in organizing activities.”In the 33-page letter to Jassy and other senior Amazon executives, the disabled workers said: “The systemic discrimination, retaliation, and policy failures documented here not only violate the ADA but also erode trust, harm individual health, and compromise the company’s integrity. We demand immediate action to reform these policies, foster a truly inclusive workplace, and uphold the rights of all employees.”The letter cited internal polls conducted by the group of Amazon employees, with 93% of respondents with disabilities claiming that current policies had harmed them. Another 71% of respondents claimed that more than half of their job accommodation requests had been denied or were unmet, and 92% reported a lack of an accessible job accommodation process.“Employees requesting accommodations often encounter a lack of meaningful dialogue – requests are ignored, denied without explanation, or dismissed via automated systems,” the letter stated.The workers made apublic petitionto Amazon executives to address their concerns shortly after the email, earlier this month.In response to a request for comment, Amazon said an external survey of what it called a small number of unverified employees was not reflective of the opinions of everyone with a disability and that it was inaccurate to suggest otherwise. The company also said its disability and leave services team ensured that employees had access to accommodations and adjustments and that the decisions were driven by empathy. The process was not automated or semi-automated, Amazon said, and it denied that AI had been used for case processing or decision-making in the accommodation process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity were particularly angry about their claims that efforts to organize on Slack – which they said was a modern-day version of the office water cooler – were being denied and suppressed, including by the company allegedly removing posts that sought out workers’ opinions.Amazon boss tells staff AI means their jobs are at risk in coming yearsRead more“The company is cracking down, and they’re very concerned, and many people are being told not to post here,” claimed one Amazon employee.Another employee who no longer works at Amazon claimed management had dismissed disabled workers’ complaints as being “disruptive and unproductive”, and had undermined the first-ever corporate union collective bargaining group.The National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that is meant to protect federal worker rights, has recently weighed in on employers suppressing workers’ organizing efforts on workplace Slack accounts: in October 2024, the NLRBissueda complaint against Apple, alleging the company was interfering with workers’ rights to collectively advocate for improved working conditions on Slack.In a statement at the time, Apple said it disagreed with the claims.

That is its worst performance over the first six months of any year since 1973, and the worst half-year since the second half of 1991.This sell-off has pulled the dollar index down to its lowest level since March 2022 and lifted the pound to a three-year high of $1.37, up from $1.25 at the start of the year.graph showing US dollar trend from 1973 to 2023Investors have been selling the US currency due to concerns that Trump’s economic policies threaten the safe-haven role of US dollar-denominated assets, with economists predicting that the president’s“big beautiful” budget billwill drive the US national debt even higher.Analysts at Unicredit said: “The US dollar is the most notable loser so far this year as it has lost 10% against other currencies, with investor concerns regarding Trump’s policies having weighed on the greenback. On the other hand, the euro has risen by 5%.”David Morrison,a senior market analyst at the financial services company Trade Nation, said: “Trump’s tariffs, the fact that many investors view his administration as somewhat chaotic, along with concerns over US national debt have seen the dollar fall out of favour.”Rising expectations of US interest rate cuts have also hurt the dollar, as Trump has repeatedly criticised the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering borrowing costs and hinted that Powell’s replacementwould push for rate reductionsand could be named early.Chris Iggo, the chair of the Axa IM Investment Institute, said broader market returns had been strong in the first half of 2025. “Any sell-off in risky assets has been quickly reversed. Even measures of implied volatility have moved lower. Traders are betting more heavily on multiple US interest rate cuts,” he said.Stock markets have had a turbulent 2025 so far – most have posted gains over the last six months but getting there was a bumpy journey.Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING Research, said it had been an “action-packed” first six months of the year, with key developments including “tariffs, market volatility, questions about Fed independence, a US credit downgrade, fiscal stimulus on steroids, rising debt, deportations, visa restrictions for foreign students, the war in Ukraine entering its fourth year, and Germany doing a fiscal U-turn with a likely doubling of defence spending”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Keir Starmersigned off a US-UK trade dealearlier this month at the G7 summit in Canada.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/PAUS and European markets weakened through March as Trump sparred with China, Mexico and Canada over trade deals, before a global sell-off in early April after his announcement of hefty “Liberation Day” tariffs alarmed investors. That tumble – the worst week for the US stock market since 2020 – appeared to alarm the White House, prompting a90-day pause on tariffsand claims of“Taco”– Trump always chickens out.So although the US has only signed a single trade deal so far, with the UK, hopes of further progress – or a further pause on tariffs – triggered a historic rebound that lifted the S&P 500 index of US stocks to a record high by the end of June.According to Bloomberg, it was only the third time in the last 100 years that the S&P 500 has dropped 10% and rebounded to a gain within the same calendar quarter.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said US equities had “fully brushed off” the sell-off led by the trade war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The S&P 500 has only gained 5% during 2025 so far, slower than the pan-European Stoxx 600 (+7%), the UK’s FTSE 100 (up 7.2%), or Germany’s Dax (up 20%).The UK has been one of the best-performing regions globally for investors in the first half of 2025.“Tariffs, downgrades to earnings and economic forecasts and geopolitical conflict were the defining factors for markets in the first half of 2025,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. “They’ve caused considerable uncertainty which has affected asset prices, as well as business and consumer confidence. It’s led to one of the biggest shifts in investor preferences for years, with certain parts of the market coming to life and previous winners losing their crown. We’re now seeing the great big asset allocation reset and the US is no longer top choice for many investor portfolios.”Technology stocks have had a mixed half-year. Shares in Facebook’s owner, Meta, had a strong six months, up 25%, as its artificial intelligence investmentshave driven revenue growth. Apple, though, has lost almost 20% due to fears that tariffs on imports from China will hurt its US operations and that it has fallen behind in the AI race.Dean Turner, an economist at UBS, said it had been an interesting time for investors. “Optimism at the start of the year, driven by solid growth and earnings, was eviscerated as markets digested the ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcements, which triggered the steepest equity correction since the pandemic – the S&P 500 fell 10.5% in two days, volatility spiked, and the dollar weakened. Since then, markets have rebounded quickly as some tariffs were paused and strong AI earnings supported a recovery,” he said.2025 has also been another strong year for gold. Its price has jumped by 25% as investors have sought out safe-haven assets.Explore more on these topicsDollarCurrenciesTariffsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Prime minister Carney andCanadacaved to president [Donald] Trump and the United States of America,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a daily briefing.“The president made his position quite clear to the prime minister and the prime minister called the president last night to let the president know that he would be dropping that tax.”Carney told reporters on Monday his decision to backtrack on a controversial tax was meant to revive trade negotiations with the United States after Trump halted talks on Friday, alleging a Canadian effort to coax payments from American tech heavyweights operating in Canada was a “direct and blatant attack on our country”.On Monday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told Fox News that Canada’s decision “absolutely” meant both sides would resume talks.In an announcement late on Sunday, Carney said key talks with the administration would resume now Canada had repealed the levy, which applied to US tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Uber and Airbnb.Canada’s finance ministry said Carney and Trump would resume trade negotiations in order to agree a deal by 21 July.Trump says he is ending Canada trade talks amid tech tax disputeRead moreThe tax was first announced in 2020 and was designed to remedy the fact that many large American technology companies operating in Canada did not pay tax on revenues generated from Canadians.The tax has long been an irritant for Donald Trump, and he usedthat frustrationFriday to “terminat[e] all discussions on trade” with Canada, calling the digital services tax “a direct and blatant attack on our country”.Canada’s decision to cancel the tax comes as the US and Canada are locked in negotiations over a trade and security deal. Carney wants tariffs imposed by the Trump administration removed as part of an agreement.Currently, Canada faces tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum exported to its largest trading partner and a 25% on tax on cars, as well as blanket tariffs on all other goods exported outside the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.Canada was set to collect a 3% levy on digital services by major tech companies. The first payments were due on Monday and large American companies were expected to pay more than US$2bn to Canada’s federal government – a fee retroactive to 2022. Over a five-year period, the tax was expected to raise more than US$7bn.Hassett said Trump had raised the tax issue with Carney at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta earlier this month.“One of the things that the president asked for was that they would take the … tax off. It’s something that they’ve studied, now they’ve agreed to and, for sure, that means that we can get back to the negotiations.”US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick thanked the Canadian government for dropping the tax as others in the administration rushed to credit Trump for the policy shift.“Thank you Canada for removing your digital services tax, which was intended to stifle American innovation and would have been a deal-breaker for any trade deal with America,” Lutnick posted on social media.The walkback suggests the “Canadian government misreading the tech sector has become a hallmark of its policy”, according to Michael Geist, a law professor at University of Ottawa and the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law.“It is hard to overstate how badly the government managed the [digital services tax] issue over the past five years,”he wrote in a blogpost, adding the move to pursue the tax “alienated allies” and “solidified opposition, and continually downplayed the concerns of successive US presidents and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle”.Geist said moving forward with the tax left Canada in a “no-win situation” and suggested the government had “overplayed its hand”.“Unfortunately, the government has too often viewed tech primarily as a source of revenue for policy projects – the proverbial ‘make web giants pay’ – while overestimating the attractiveness of the Canadian market and underestimating the risks of costly regulation,” he wrote. “Canada desperately needs a tech regulation reset. Perhaps the embarrassment of walking away from $7bn will provide the wake-up call.”Business groups praised the move.“This tax would have fallen on Canadian consumers, businesses and investors in the form of higher costs and hurt our economy at a critical time,” David Pierce, vice-president of government relations at the Canadian chamber of commerce said in a statement, adding the end of the tax “moves us one step closer to a renewed, reliable trade deal” with the United States.Explore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMark CarneyInternational tradeAmericasGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

I really want to see myself in that [list] of champions. I really want to put myself like a champion that always finds a way to win.“I’ve been playing really, really tough matches the last year, the last year in this tournament. Just really proud that I always find a way. Today I did it, even though Fabio was playing great tennis. Just really proud to overcome the problem, to overcome the tough moments.”Grand slam titles cannot be won on the first day of competition, but they can always be lost. So far in his career. Alcaraz has been brilliant at ensuring that he at least gives himself a chance in every tournament. With this victory, Alcaraz maintains his perfect record of 18 wins and no defeats in the first round of grand slam tournaments. He also has 14 wins and only one defeat in five-set matches.At 38, Fognini has been a fixture on the tour for much of the past two decades, with a career‑high ranking of No 9 and several monumental wins. This year, however, marks his final season on the tour and simple victories have been difficult to come by. He has lost all six of his ATP main draw matches this year, losing against multiple players ranked outside the top 350. Across the net, Alcaraz is the most in-form player in the sport after establishing an 18-match winning sequence, including titles at the French Open and Queen’s Club. On paper, this match was not supposed to be close.Despite struggling with his serve early on, Alcaraz appeared to be moving confidently towards victory as he established a 7-5, 4-2 lead. But then, not for the first time, his concentration faltered. He played a dire service game to relinquish the break, and followed up with an error‑strewn start to the third‑set tie‑break. He soon found himself at one-set all and down a break at 2-3 in the third set.View image in fullscreenSpain’s Carlos Alcaraz stretches for a backhand return.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It doesn’t matter that the winning streak that I have right now, that I’ve been playing great on grass, that I have been preparing really well the week before – Wimbledon is different,” Alcaraz said. “I could feel today that I was really nervous at the beginning. Being the first match on Centre Court, it’s a huge privilege for me. Even though I played the first match last year, it feels [like] the first time. I just try to deal with the nerves the best way possible.”Although Fognini has lost much of his speed in his later years, quality shotmaking remains and the lofty occasion inspired the best of his ball‑striking talents. His forehand was precise and lethal, lasering winners from all parts of the court, he continually closed down the net, volleying spectacularly, and he often matched Alcaraz’s supreme variety of shot with his own deft hand skills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the match dragged on, and the pair headed for a decider, the world No 2 cut an increasingly distressed figure, repeatedly unloading his frustration on his player box. In the heat, Alcaraz walked gingerly between points. Early in the final set, play was halted after a fan was struggling with the heat, which prompted Alcaraz to sprint over with a bottle of water. “Obviously playing with such a high heat out there is really difficult to deal with sometimes,” Alcaraz said. “Even tougher when you’re playing long matches, long rallies.”In the middle of some of the most intense months of his young career, which have pushed him to his physical and mental limit, a few efficient, relatively stress-free wins would not hurt Alcaraz.Although such straightforward matches have evaded him, he continues to show his ability to produce his best tennis when most needed. One set away from a catastrophic first-round defeat, he pulled himself together and closed out an important victory that keeps alive his dream of a Wimbledon hat-trick.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazWimbledonTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If City are their opponents, it would be a rematch of the2023 Club World Cup final, which City won 4-0 in Saudi Arabia.The match was played in front of a crowd of just 20,030 in the final game at the 74,867-capacity Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte. Two of the other three games at the stadium have also gone ahead with more than 40,000 empty seats.Fluminense’s 44-year-old goalkeeper Fábio made four saves to seal one of the most famous wins in the Rio de Janeiro club’s history, with the 40-year-old former Chelsea centre-half Thiago Silva also producing a fine performance at the back. The result ensured there will be two Brazilian quarter-finalists in the first edition of this expanded tournament, withPalmeiras already having wonthrough to face Chelsea in the last eight.Fluminense were the better side for the opening hour of another sweltering last-16 encounter, then suffered through increased Inter pressure for the final 20 minutes to keep their third clean sheet of the tournament.Lautaro Martínez came closest to pulling Inter level, forcing Fábio into saves in the 80th and 82nd minute, then striking the upright with another low effort only seconds later.View image in fullscreenThiago Silva celebrates after Hércules scored Fluminense’s second goal as Inter’s Lautaro Martinez looks on.Photograph: Agustín Marcarian/ReutersIn the 93rd minute, Inter’s at times shaky defence was exposed for a second time. Hércules found himself free at the edge of the 18-yard box following a throw-in, and drove a composed, low finish into the bottom right corner, sending most of the crowd into delirium.Cano had put the Brazilians in front in just the third minute during a shaky start from Inter. Jhon Arias’s cross from the right took a deflection that caused defenders and the goalkeeper Yann Sommer to hesitate.

Pittsburgh is sending All-Pro safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and an unspecified late-round draft pick to Miami to complete the blockbuster trade, per ESPN.Ramsey, 30, did not attend Miami’s mandatory minicamp earlier this month while the team attempted to secure a trade partner. The Steelers and Los Angeles Rams were considered the most likely destinations.Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said prior to the 2025NFLdraft that Ramsey didn’t request a trade, but they came to the joint realization that a potential move made sense following several conversations about his contract.Ramsey signed a three-year contract extension in September 2024 and started all 17 games for Miami, posting two interceptions, 11 passes defensed and 60 tackles last season.ESPN reported that the Steelers are giving Ramsey a $1.5m raise in 2025 as part of the agreement, bumping his compensation to $26.6m.Ramsey went to Miami in March 2023 in a trade with the Rams for a third-round pick and tight end Hunter Long. Ramsey missed the first seven games that season with a knee injury, but he still made the Pro Bowl for the seventh time.Ramsey has tallied 24 interceptions, 108 passes defensed and 534 tackles in 135 career games (134 starts) with the Jacksonville Jaguars (2016-19), Rams (2019-22) and Dolphins. The Jaguars drafted him with the No 5 overall pick in the 2016 draft.Ramsey joins a loaded Steelers secondary that includes incumbent starter Joey Porter Jr and offseason signee Darius Slay Jr.Fitzpatrick, 28, is a five-time Pro Bowl and three-time All-Pro selection who launched his career in Miami as a first-round pick (11th overall) in the 2018 NFL draft.Fitzpatrick recorded 96 tackles and one interception in 17 starts last season. He has 20 picks, 54 passes defensed and 608 tackles in 106 career games (101 starts) with the Dolphins (2018-19) and Steelers. Miami traded him to Pittsburgh in September 2019.He signed a four-year, $73.6m deal with the Steelers in June 2022 and is set to earn $15.5m in 2025 and $17.6m in 2026.Smith, 29, was selected in the third round of the 2017 draft by the Tennessee Titans and spent his first four seasons there, followed by two seasons with the New England Patriots and one each with the Atlanta Falcons and Dolphins.In 17 games (six starts) last season, he caught 88 passes for 884 yards with eight touchdowns. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl. In 124 career games (84 starts), he has 307 receptions for 3,307 yards and 28 scores.Explore more on these topicsNFLPittsburgh SteelersMiami DolphinsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.“The demand for women’s basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,” WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. “This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league’s extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women’s professional basketball.”‘How did I get here?’: GB basketball captain Temi Fágbénlé’s journey from shy London teen to WNBARead moreAll three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250m expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.“It’s such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,” said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. “Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.”Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.“This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,” Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. “Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league’s early growth, and we’re proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.”Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock – the names of the previous teams – would be considered but they’d do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.“Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we’re not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,” Barlage said.The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.“We tell the city it’s going to open in 2031. We’re hoping for 2030,” said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. “So we’re trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it’s 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We’ve got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they’ll play there.”Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.“I think there’s some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,” Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. “I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.”Other cities that bid on teams that didn’t get them include St Louis; Kansas City, Missouri; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, North Carolina.“We didn’t know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,” Engelbert said. “Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we’re very careful about, you know, making sure we’re balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.“But one thing I’m very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.”All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.“You’re seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women’s professional sports team,” Barlage said. “The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it’s growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.”Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Her 12 goals in the Women’s Super League played an integral role in the Gunners’ second-place finish and earned her a share of the Golden Boot, alongside Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw. She was also Arsenal’s top scorer in their run to securing the Champions League. Her productivity in front of goal has been the biggest improvement to her game.If Euro 2022 was Russo’s breakout tournament and the 2023 World Cup the one where she came of age, this summer is a chance for the 26-year-old to stamp her authority as one of the best strikers on the continent. Her game is about much more than just her finishing ability, with her strong hold-up play, aerial presence and pressing ability all assets. She sets the tone for England from the front and has become a quiet leader in the squad.Lea Schüller (Germany)The 27-year-old Schüller is an instinctive striker and her form for club and country this season has made her one to watch. She amassed 16 goals in all competitions as Bayern Munich claimed their first domestic double with the striker scoring a hat-trick in the DFB Pokal final against Werder Bremen.Schüller is a constant in the international setup and has been part of the squad at the last four major tournaments. She was Germany’s top scorer when they claimed the bronze medal at last summer’s Olympics and was similarly prolific in their latest Nations League campaign. Her five goals in the group stage played a key role in helping Christian Wück’s team to this autumn’s semi-finals. In a team full of attacking talent, she provides the focal point up front, supported by Klara Bühl, Jule Brand and Laura Freigang.View image in fullscreenLea Schüller scores against Poland in a Euro 2025 qualifier in May last year.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersClàudia Pina (Spain)In a team full of stars, Pina is threatening to shine the brightest. The 23-year-old has taken the headlines this season with some sensational performances.Pina’s potential has never been in doubt, with her natural technical ability and eye for goal clear. At the age of 13 in 2014-15 she scored 100 goals in 20 appearances for Barcelona’s Infantin-Alevín youth side (a season in which her team scored 279 goals in 21 games), and she made her senior debut at 16. Her 24 goals in all competitions this season helped Pere Romeu’s team secure a domestic treble, while she finished top scorer in the Champions League. Her 25-minute cameo in the first leg of the semi-final against Chelsea, in which she registered two goals and one assist, was particularly memorable.She returned to the national setup in 2024 after a two-year absence. She was one of“Las 15”– the group of players who demanded better conditions from the Spanish football federation in 2022 – and subsequently ruled herself out of the 2023 World Cup. Her recent gamechangingdouble against Englandsent Montse Tomé’s side into the Nations League semi-finals.Lineth Beerensteyn (Netherlands)Over the last two seasons, Beerensteyn has started to realise her potential, finding the kind of form many expected from her when she first broke into the Dutch setup. In the absence of Vivianne Miedema, she has stepped up to lead the line. She finished as the Netherlands’ top scorer in Euro 2025 qualifying and in their recent Nations League campaign.Domestically, she has also been prolific, winning the Frauen Bundesliga Golden Boot with Wolfsburg. It was a disappointing domestic campaign for the She-Wolves, who finished second behind Bayern Munich. Beerensteyn’s 16 goals, however, meant she matched Hoffenheim’s Selina Cerci at the top of the scoring charts.The pacy 28-year-old can play anywhere across the front line. An injury towards the end of the season is a slight concern but the Dutch coach, Andries Jonker, seems confident she will be fit for the summer.Esther González (Spain)González’s four goals in her last four games for Spain have put her in the frame to be their first-choice No 9 this summer.The 32-year-old is one of a handful of the Spanish squad to play abroad and has taken the National Women’s Soccer League by storm since joining Gotham FC in August 2023. She scored the goal thatwon them their first NWSL Championshipa few months after joining and has been prolific at club level in the first half of this season.González has been in and out of the national side since making her debut in 2016. She scored against England in theirquarter-final defeat at Euro 2022and captained the side on a couple of occasions at the 2023 World Cup. She has struggled to nail down a consistent starting role but her impressive recent form might change that in Switzerland.View image in fullscreenEsther González lines up a shot in the Nations League game against England.Photograph: Eric Alonso/Getty ImagesMarie-Antoinette Katoto (France)Katoto is one of the most naturally talented forwards in the women’s game. Her domestic career to date has been played solely at Paris Saint-Germain. In the decade after making her senior debut, the 26-year-old racked up 180 goals in 223 appearances. She finished as their leading goalscorer in the 2024-25 season, her 12 Première Ligue goals helping them to a second-place finish in what turned out to be her final season at the club before this summer’s move to Lyon.The tall striker is now looking to make her mark on the international stage. Her Euro 2022 was heartbreaking – sheruptured an anterior cruciate ligamentin the group stage – and she failed to recover in time for the World Cup, so last year’s Olympics was her first major tournament for the national team. She finished as the Golden Boot winner on home soil despite France’s quarter-final exit and will be eager to replicate that form in Switzerland.A special mention should go to Ewa Pajor, who will be captaining Poland in their first major tournament. Being placed in Group C with Germany, Denmark and Sweden is a tough challenge for the newcomers but Pajor’s stats cannot be ignored. She finished her first season at Barcelona with 43 goals in 46 appearances and will looking to continue that form as her nation makes history this summer.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballEngland women's football teamGermany women's football teamSpain women's football teamNetherlands women's football teamFrance women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifpro is calling for extra measures to protect footballers after what it describes as the “wake-up call” of the Club World Cup, which has beenplagued by extreme temperaturesover the past two weeks.Fifa protocols allow for a cooling break lasting for three minutes in each half if temperature thresholds are exceeded. According to Fifpro’s medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, an extended half-time break would provide a necessary additional tool in helping to keep players’ core temperatures within their normal range.Harry Kane sinks Flamengo to set up Bayern Munich’s Club World Cup tie with PSGRead more“A cooling break generally lasts three minutes and they are designed to decrease the [player’s] temperature through the use of ice,” he said. “But we are lacking the evidence in terms of what is the optimal duration for a cooling break. A half-time of 15 minutes might not be enough to decrease the core temperature. So a lot of research is being done into alternative mitigation strategies and it could be that a half-time of 20 minutes is significant. It has been shown [to work] in the laboratory. Together with the national [players’] union in Portugal, we are going to test this kind of mitigation strategy in August.”Complaints from players and coaches at theClub World Cupover temperatures in the US that have breached 40C have been a theme of the tournament. Fifpro’s general secretary, Alex Phillips, said the organisation had been engaging with Fifa over the issue during the past fortnight and that progress had been made.“We are partially happy because Fifa have been quite responsive once the tournament was under way,” Phillips said. “So they have actually modified how they have been dealing with heat during the matches based on Fifpro’s input.“Obviously, it would have been better if that had happened in advance, but it’s better that they have adapted and they’ve put in place various different mitigation measures. There’s additional water around the pitch, towels and so on, and the threshold for the cooling breaks has come down. So there has been a positive reaction from Fifa, which is good.“But going forward, it’s not just Fifa. It’s any competition organiser staging tournaments in this kind of heat. Their protocols [need to] reflect more of the good practice in Australia, US and other countries that deal with this week after week in their national leagues.”In the US, for example, they do not stage MLS games at midday in Florida and in Australia there are thresholds for the delay or postponement of matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it might not just relate to, let’s say, off-season breaks of the players but also to other issues that relate to player welfare or safe attendance by spectators, or the performance on the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025FifaClub World CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For some players, this is a competition too far, played on poor pitches in half-empty stadiums and suffocating heat, something they could do without, but it has been good for Real Madrid’s captain, something to aim at.Now, 270 days later and 4,400 miles away, just as theClub World Cupgets real, he is back to face Juventus in the last 16 in Miami. “And I know what I’m like: if they let me loose, there’ll be no fear,” he says.Bellingham and Vinícius shine as Real Madrid top group at Club World CupRead moreCarvajal has not played since October 2024, when in the final moments of Villarreal’s visit to the Santiago Bernabéu he tore the anterior cruciate ligament, the fibular collateral ligament and the popliteus tendon in his right knee. At 32 years old, a European champion with club and country, fourth in the Ballon d’Or three weeks later, it came at the worst time, or so it seemed. Carvajal, though, believes it came at the best moment, personally and professionally – which, in the end, go together in a long process that has been psychological as well as physical. Now here he is at Madrid’s Palm Beach HQ before training. Just one more session before he is back in the squad.“If it had happened when I was younger, I think I would have gone over and over it much more, it would have eaten at my mind,” Carvajal says. “Until you go through it, you don’t know the impact. But it happened at a mature moment when thanks to my family, my kids, I have a much more structured life, which has alleviated [the process] and helped me recover better. If I had been younger, without my wife, I would have worried more, wondered if I was really going to be come back 100%.”The Club World Cuphelped. “It has been very good for me to have an objective, to be able to say: ‘I want to get there.’ Because if not, I would have reached fitness on the summer [with nothing happening]. Maybe [in terms of performance level] it would have been better for this competition to have fallen next year or the one after, when I could have started on the same level as everyone else, but I will never know that. I have adapted to the circumstances and it has been very good for me to be here, to be back with my teammates, train fully. It’s been two weeks now with them and, thank God, I am ready.”“I have had a very stable recovery, very even. I have been setting very, very short-term objectives and also trying to break the injury-recovery routine when I could, with my family and kids, enjoying being with them. Whether planned or not, you’re not playing, not travelling, and I have been able to create a connection with them that’s been very special, really spectacular. I said to my wife that I have never missed anyone like I have missed them in this trip.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso during training in the US for the Club World Cup.Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters“There are moments when it’s a pain being injured but I woke up every day feeling that I had the energy and happiness to take it on. If I needed to go to the gym, or use a crutch to walk, well, you do it. I have managed it very well. I thought I would be climbing the walls but, far from it: I approached every phase, every challenge, with an enthusiasm.“There has been no complications in the knee. You know it’s practically a year before you’re in perfect physical condition, until you have that sharpness; understanding that is the most important thing, not to rush, not to hurry. It’s been almost nine months.“I took this competition as a challenge, an objective, so that I could have a target but always being realistic, aware of the situation I was in. A month and a half ago, I would have said I can’t see it [returning to the team], because I felt I wasn’t ready but now I see myself as ready to compete. It’s nice, I’ve had lots of sessions, I don’t have any fear, I don’t have any hesitation to go in hard, to put my foot in…”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Xabi Alonso’s structure may open an opportunity as a third centre-back on the right side and if there is one thing that has always defined Carvajal it is a fierce competitiveness. Alexander-Arnold won’t simply be handed his spot, that’s for sure. The knowing smile when Carvajal talks about new signings tells you that.‘Trent’ brings fluency and ‘impeccable’ Spanish to grand Real Madrid unveilingRead more“Trent has adapted phenomenally well, he has got on with everyone fantastically,” he says. “He has been super friendly: when we have had an afternoon off, he has come with everyone to eat, he seems a very, very good lad. He already knew Jude [Bellingham] but it’s with everyone. And, professionally, it’s normal: at every team there are new signings, new players, and I took that as a personal challenge too: I love to compete, I love to have challenges in front of me. I hope that healthy competition can make the team even better.“As for the position: I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it, because if the manager asks me to play on the left wing I play in the left wing. It’s not something that concerns me, far from it. I just want to help. I’ve played centre-back, left-back, right-back … if it’s in goal, I’m available. It’s been nine months but I feel good, I’m ready.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The club werebanned last week from paying transfer feesuntil January 2027 for exceeding “30 days of late payments” to players in the previous 12 months, having also paid salaries late in March and missed payroll seven times in the past four years.The EFL is monitoring the situation closely and is expected to refer Wednesday to an independent commission, with a longer transfer embargo, fine and points deduction among the sanctions open to it. The Professional Footballers’ Association is also involved and providing support to the players.Röhl is also expected to leave and was not at the training ground when most of the players reported back last Thursday for pre-season. All of the German’s coaching staff are out of contract from Tuesday, and he is understood to be negotiating his own severance terms.The club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, is willing to sell Wednesday and has received offers from at least two US consortiums, but neither has met his valuation. The Thai businessman has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on Wednesday over the past decade, but his source of funding has dried up as a result of the declining profitability of his family’s food empire, the Thai Union Group.The EFL and PFA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Then it was time for Giles to do likewise with Bryan Mbeumo, who is the subject of a bid from Manchester United. Brentford value their 20-goal top scorer from last season at about £65m. United are nearly there with it.“We’ve made our point clear,” Giles said. “If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.” With that, Giles glanced at the man to his left – the newBrentfordhead coach, Keith Andrews, presumably the source of said headache if Mbeumo were to leave.Football transfer rumours: Arsenal join Premier League race for Hugo Ekitike?Read moreWhat a summer it has been so far at the west London club. The longstanding manager, Thomas Frank, has gone to Tottenham, together with three key members of staff, including the assistant, Justin Cochrane. Now the team are being picked over. The goalkeeper Mark Flekken has left for Bayer Leverkusen.This is the backdrop to the appointment of Andrews and it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room at the Gtech Community Stadium; the 44‑year‑old has no previous experience as a manager. But here he is, about to succeed an authentic club legend in Frank and cut his teeth in the “toughest league in the world” (Andrews’s own description). Is Giles completely sure about this?The short answer is yes. The longer one, delivered over 45 minutes on Monday afternoon by him and Andrews, illustrated why there are actually no headaches or stresses. It might look like upheaval but internally at the club it is considered as smooth and easy evolution.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank has departed for Tottenham along with other key members of staff.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockAt Brentford every player, every member of staff, has a price. Frank’s was £10m, which Spurs met, albeit the final portion of his release clause is understood to be payable if performance-related targets are reached. Nørgaard and Mbeumo have theirs. If and when they are triggered, there will be no wailing or soul-searching, only pragmatism; the identification and nurturing of their replacements.It is what Brentford have done for a long time, certainly since Matthew Benham bought in as the owner in June 2012 with the club in League One and began to change everything with his data-based approach. Caoimhín Kelleher, who has joined from Liverpool, looks a smart successor to Flekken. Brentford’s faith in their model is unshakable.“If a club comes in for a player or member of staff and you find yourself saying: ‘We cannot sell them under any circumstances,’ you probably have to look at yourself as to why you put yourself in a position where that person is so important that it’s impossible to do anything about that,” Giles said.“Most of the time when the big clubs are coming in for your players, it’s been an opportunity for them. So, yeah, pretty relaxed about the transfer ins and outs. If the players we’ve mentioned stay, then great. If they leave, it will be on our terms.”Like Frank before him, Andrews has been promoted from within, having joined last summer as the set-piece coach. It is an interesting detail that the club’s past five promotion-winning managers, going back to 1991-92, were internal appointments. Frank got Brentford up and out of the Championship in 2020‑21. Before him, the successes were provided by Mark Warburton, Andy Scott, Ron Noades and Phil Holder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for us.”View image in fullscreenKeith Andrews joined Brentford last year as the set-piece coach.Photograph: Tony O Brien/ReutersThe important thing to say about Andrews’s coaching career is that it has been a long time in production. And he is not just about set pieces, however much he impressed in that area last season – offensively and defensively. He started coaching during his playing days at Blackburn, taking the club’s under‑14s at the age of 29.There have been short-lived assistant manager roles at MK Dons in the Championship and Sheffield United in the Premier League, either side of a five-year stint with his native Republic of Ireland, first with the under-21s and then the seniors.Andrews spoke well at his presentation, personable as usual, promising to be himself and draw upon his varied experiences, including those from his 12-club, 16‑season playing career that took in time in all four English divisions and 35 caps for Ireland. It is tempting to say he has seen it all. Except that it is only just beginning.Explore more on these topicsBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mikel Arteta has identified Eze as someone who could add creativity and depth to his squad after they finished asPremier League runners-upfor a third successive season.Arsenal officials met Eze’s agents on Saturday to discuss personal terms and other details, but have yet to open talks with Palace over the England international.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreEze, who was released by Arsenal at the age of 13, is believed to have a release clause of £67.5m in a contract that runs until 2027, and Palace have been adamant they will allow him to depart only if that is met. Tottenham have a longstanding interest in Eze and have discussed whether to make him a statement signing for their new manager, Thomas Frank. A readiness to submit an official offer could depend on whether Palace are willing to accept less than his clause, which at this stage seems unlikely.With Marc Guéhi prepared to see out the final 12 months of his deal if the right move does not materialise, Palace are wary of losing Eze for a discounted fee if he does not leave this summer. In January, they rejected a bid from Spurs worth up to £70m for Guéhi, who is also of interest to Liverpool and Newcastle. Liverpool have been reported to be willing to offer Ben Doak as part of the deal after Palace expressed interest in signing the Scotland forward in January.Eze, who scored the winning goalin the FA Cup finalin May to secure Palace’s first major trophy, celebrated his 27th birthday on Sunday and his age means clubs have been reluctant to meet his release clause. He has been in impressive form for club and country sincescoring his first England goal, against Latvia in March, and is willing to join either north London club if a deal can be agreed.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowArsenalTottenham HotspurCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

All credit for a victory – the hallowed “three points” – must go to your teammates and “the gaffer”, even if you just scored a hat-trick to keep said gaffer in a job. Individual brilliance can be celebrated only in jokey, self-effacing terms. “I never hit them that well in training,” that sort of thing. Then it’s quickly on to “the next one”, all eyes on Bournemouth this Sunday. Shake hands, move on, and never, ever say anything remotely controversial.That may be all about to change with the introduction of live TV interviews with substituted players – part of a range of broadcasting tweaks introduced as part of a new four-year TV deal worth £6.6bn. In exchange for that enormous wad of cash, Sky and TNT’s camera operators will be allowed to encroach on goal celebrations and peek into dressing rooms, while reporters wave their mics at hooked footballers on the touchline.Reports claim a “cool-down” period will be observed, but without any official announcement yet, we can only wonder how this might play out. Would Mohamed Salah, for instance, have been able to iron out a new Liverpool deal if club suits knew what he was really thinking each time he got subbed off? After engagingin a frank exchange of viewswith the Emirates crowd back in 2019, what on earth would Granit Xhaka have had to say to the viewing public? And can we please bring back Mesut Özil and Carlos Tevez, kings of the substitution strop, in time for next season?Back in 1992, Graham Taylor brought Gary Lineker’s England career to a close by hauling him off for Alan Smith in the 2-1 Euros defeat to Sweden. “He probably did me a favour by making me a martyr,” was Lineker’s view some 20 years on. “We were a pretty cr@ppy team.” One can only imagine what colourful language might have spilled on to TV screens had the interview taken place after 20 minutes instead – or how other bad reactors, fromCristiano Ronaldo to Wayne Rooney, might have been affected by Geoff Shreeves unapologetically getting up in their grills.The truth is, of course, that the vast majority of professional footballers don’t like being substituted. Whether being asked to self-diagnose an injury or explain how they missed that open goal, players’ media training will be pushed to new limits. Is it fair on footballers already overstretched by fixture congestion, who know that one word out of turn will be splashed across all the Social Media Disgraces in seconds? No. But are we secretly excited about the potential “content” and its ability to fill a teatimely football newsletter? You’d have to ask the gaffer about that.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray at 8pm (BST) for Copa Gianni updates on Inter 1-2 Fluminense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You sound like jackasseez” – Tom Dowler.Enzo Maresca’s outburst that‘it’s not football’in the wake of Chelsea’s near two-hour weather delay on Saturday in Charlotte brings up some very interesting points. Although he claims that the USA might not be the best place to hold a summer tournament (and he’s probably right), it might be more apt to say that it’s not football as itusedto be played in the old world (meaning the world before ever-accelerating climate change and global warming, rather than Europe as seen in the eyes of Americans). This new reality of storm delays and unpredictable match lengths will add interesting new challenges for coaching staffs: How do you focus the minds of Internet-age players for an indefinite period of time, while they await a restart while cocooned in the bowels of a stadium? Should an assistant coach be ready to have the players start watching and analysing video of the game they are playing in as soon as they are rehydrated and fed appropriately? (Coaches who always look for the smallest advantage would surely demand this information download to players in the midst of a game?) Should cell phone contact with the outside world be banned while the players are in this forced lockdown? (Or is this counter-productive when players’ minds naturally dwell on the safety of watching friends and family inside the stadium?) Should the levels of air-conditioning in the American “locker room” be adjusted to avoid muscles cooling too rapidly before recommencement? (I’ve been in a few, and like most indoor spaces in the US in summer, they’re bloody freezing!)

The all-British clash featured two players – attired similarly in matching outfits and golf visors – who captivated the home crowd.While Raducanu has been a fan favourite since her fairytale 2021 US Open triumph, the grand slam ­debutant Xu, ranked No 300 in the world, has impressed in junior circuits and shown significant promise on the senior tour.Wimbledon 2025 day one: Raducanu eases through, Alcaraz survives huge scare, and more – liveRead more“It was an interesting dynamic today,” Raducanu said. “It is really awkward playing a Brit, especially someone younger. I think the crowd were great both ways and it was nice for [Xu] to receive that sort of welcome and support.”The celebratory mood of two ­Britons facing off led to some fans popping a champagne bottle, with the cork landing on the court in front of the world No 40. “It was a first. Pretty entertaining, though. I am glad [the crowd] were having a good time. It kind of loosened me up a bit. But I couldn’t reach it [to have a sip].”Despite the party atmosphere, reality came crashing down for Xu in her first tour meeting with­Raducanu. The gulf in class was evident from the start. Raducanu’s powerful forehands down the line, blistering serves and astute court craft allowed her to seize control immediately. Xu’s opening service game began with a double fault, foreshadowing a series of errors that led to a break in the first game.View image in fullscreenThe British No 1 was never in trouble during her straight sets victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA stunning ace from the more experienced player left Xu rooted to the spot, followed by a backhand winner that secured the British No 1’s first service game to love, winning eight of the first nine points of the match.For the 17-year-old, this match was a cascade of firsts. The Welsh player, who watched aged 13 as ­Raducanu won the US Open, under­standably struggled early on, ­exhibiting weak serves and even slipping on court twice in the fourth game.Despite an assured hold to get on the scoreboard, Xu’s attempts at tricky drop shots often backfired, allowing her opponent to establish a 4-2 lead. Raducanu secured another break before a strong service game from Xu that included a scorching 116mph serve. Nonetheless, she was consistently playing catchup, battling hard to hold her own serve but ultimately failing to break Raducanu, and conceded the first set 6-3.The second set started as more of the same, with Raducanu asserting her authority. A backhand beyond Xu’s reach and a double fault contributed to the younger Briton ­facing three break points. Xu saved two, including one with a service winner, and clawed her way to deuce. A well-executed smash at the net even prompted a rare moment of frustration from Raducanu.The momentum shifted back when Xu hit a drop shot into the net, forced by an 80mph return from Raducanu. Back at deuce, Xu saved a fourth break point with an ace, but Raducanu responded with two formidable forehands – one down the line, one crosscourt – beyond Xu’s reach, finally converting the break for a 2-0 lead.Raducanu consolidated with three consecutive aces in her subsequent service game with pinpoint accuracy. But against the run of play, and from 40-0 down, Xu remarkably broke back. She forced deuce with a forehand winner, then capitalised on a long lob from Raducanu to snatch the game.View image in fullscreenMimi Xu makes a backhand return.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APRaducanu broke straight back before racing to a 30-0 lead on her serve again, only for Xu to ­capitalise on a weak first serve. Xu’s backhand winner secured another break point before finishing the game on a high with a forehand high and hard across court, well out of her ­opponent’s reach.Yet as much as Xu’s confidence grew in the second set, Raducanu never wavered, breaking back once again with a forehand down the line to make it 4-2 and conclude five breaks of serve in a row between the pair of them.The British No 1 ultimately mana­ged to fend off the late threats and recovered from 30-0 down in the final game to serve out the match.Up next for Raducanu isMarketa Vondrousova, who won her first and only grand slam title at Wimbledon in 2023 and, more recently, was vic­torious on grass at the Berlin Openin late June, beating Madison Keys and the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka en route. “Amazing grass player,” Raducanu said of the Czech. “I am going to need to play really well to get over the line.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Folks could be heading for a stroll in Cannon Hill Park, or their weekly shop at Aldi, only to suddenly find themselves watching Jasprit Bumrah let fly.Steve Smith plots return for second West Indies Test after baseball cage hitoutRead moreSadly, the fences were covered with tarpaulins after some hecklers over the weekend. There was a decent subplot playing out inside as India trained, too, over whether Bumrah will play the sold-out second Test that starts . Having bowled these past few days, the man himself offered a passing “hopefully”.Things are not so straightforward here. The plan has long been that India’s spearhead plays three of the five Tests to manage his lower back, something reaffirmed by Gautam Gambhir, the head coach, after the loss at Headingley. Now trailing 1-0 in the series, and with Bumrah having had a week to recover from that match, one would think this is the time to play the second of those three cards.Yet with the third Test starting a week on Thursday at Lord’s, the ground where every touring cricketer wants to play, it sounds like he may yet be held back.Ryan ten Doeschate, India’s assistant coach, hinted as much, saying Bumrah was “ready to play”, before going on to add that, with possible rain in Birmingham at the weekend, and Edgbaston a typically flat surface, they are still to decide their configuration.“We feel we can go 1-1 or keep the score at 1-0 without Jasprit,” said Ten Doeschate. “That is putting the eggs at the back [of the series]. But we are going to need him at some stage. You have to decide when to play your strongest suit. Whatever team we put out there, we can compete in this Test match.”Thoughts go back to England’s disastrous Ashes tour in 2021-22, when they went 1-0 down and then immediately rested Mark Wood for the second Test in Adelaide. Wood took 17 wickets during that 4-0 defeat but 12 of them came after the urn was lost. Sometimes teams can overthink the future at the expense of the situation staring them in the face, even if England are wary of seeing this as an opportunity.View image in fullscreenMoeen Ali joins England at training in a coaching capacity.Photograph: Jacob King/PA“The worry for us would be to focus too much on [Bumrah],” said Chris Woakes, who will lead the England bowlers on his home ground. “You have to look at their whole attack, and what they bring to the table, and how you can combat the skills they bring. India have got guys that can come in and cause us issues.”Even with possible rain showers, India eyeing a draw against an England team that scores at 4.5 runs per over – something that in turn broadens the canvas for taking 20 wickets – is high risk.Ten Doeschate also hinted at India playing two slow bowlers the options being an attacking wrist-spinner in Kuldeep Yadav or the off-spinning all-rounder Washington Sundar.If the latter, it would probably be with half an eye on scoring the lower-order runs that were missing at Headingley – a potentially negative outlook when taking only 15 of the 20 English wickets was the bigger problem.Better catching would help, with Monday’syesterday’s training session suggesting Yashasvi Jaiswal will be whipped out of the gully position after three costly drops in Leeds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs well as scoring five centuries before their tail folded twice, those missed chances offer India hope of turning this series around.They at least know the XI they will be up against, England confirming an unchanged team two days out from the toss and thus holding backthe recalled Jofra Archeruntil Lord’s at the earliest.“I’m sure he’s champing at the bit to get back out there and show people what he has already done in whites,” said Woakes. “We all know how good he can be, but he’s at an age [30] where his best is probably still ahead of him.”Archer was not on the ground on Monday after a “family emergency” delayed his arrival, England then going on to confirm that none of the unused squad players will be parachuted into the current round of county matches anyway.Given the slog the bowlers are enduring with the Kookaburra ball this week, Archer, Sam Cook and Jamie Overton may be thankful for the reprieve.The only real difference for England this week is Moeen Ali among the backroom staff, having taken up the offer to further his coaching experience. It may not be Moeen’s only encounter with India this year, with South Africa understood to be interested in him joining their coaching staff for a Test tour there in November.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

But what food or drink from back home are you missing?Antony, StaffordshireI always miss a roast dinner, roast chicken. And the milk. The milk is different over there so when you have a cup of tea it’s just not the same because the milk is not the same. It alters the quality of the tea so that’s tough for me.How’s life in America been treating you? Is the infrastructure for women’s football noticeably more developed there? And the million‑dollar question: what happens when your new team face England in the World Cup final in 2027?Tom Stubbs, BrusselsFirst of all, I love being there. The cultural approach to the girls’ and women’s game is more ingrained in the US because they’ve been doing it for longer in terms of providing opportunities. That’s noticeable. The US approach to women’s sport stands out, not just soccer, but with basketball, too. As for that hypothetical for 2027, well, you’re saying we’re in the World Cup final so I’m excited. If you give me that option today, I’ll bite your hand off. I want to be in the World Cup final competing to win a World Cup so, whoever you’re facing, it’s going to be a top, top side, and I don’t get emotional about it – it’s England but I’m repping the USA so my focus is on the USA.View image in fullscreenCould it be a USA v England World Cup final in 2027?Photograph: Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images for USSFWhat sets good coaches apart from great coaches?Amalia, AustraliaNumber one: to be a great leader you have to show great empathy and a great understanding, that helps you connect with people. Yes, natural emotional intelligence levels will help, but you have to develop the skills to be able to bring the best out of people. Number two: have clarity in your vision so everybody can align to that and they know what they’re signing up to. And number three: don’t be afraid to be vulnerable with them. You can’t always be right, so remember they’re partners with you. You go along the journey of coaching teams where, even as the leader, the team’s insights and their guidance should form a part of the narrative, because they play the game, they know it, and their experiences of it are equally as valid as your direction as the leader.What are you most looking forward to about the Women’s Euros?Kevin, BirminghamThe closeness in games. I want to see more games being tougher to win because then coaching comes into it. You get to see more coaching when the matches are tighter.Euro 2025 is sure to showcase just how far women’s football has come | Emma HayesRead moreAs someone who understands the global game and its power to unify, what do you think US Soccer should be doing to help rural communities, like ours in western Montana, grow the game where there are no lights, few coaches and limited infrastructure but a deep hunger to play?Nick Lawyer, MontanaIn the US, so much focus is about “pay to play” and I hope that, with the Soccer Forward legacy programmes of 26 and 31 [the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2031 women’s World Cup] that we’re really started to develop more connections with communities that don’t have the same access to the sport.Do you feel the USWNT players who play in the NWSL are at a competitive disadvantage to those playing in Europe?Rob Coughlin, ChicagoThe NWSL and the European leagues are competitive, but they are different experiences. The Champions League offers something that the NWSL cannot, but that is changing. The parity in the NWSL, week-in, week-out, and the competitiveness of the league, ensures there is always a top fixture every week, so it’s the diversity piece that’s different. In Europe you get the Champions League but the development of the Concacaf W Champions Cup – which Gotham FC recently won – will help to bridge that gap.In your vision to remake women’s soccer in the US, what are the top-three actions you most want and hope to see from NWSL clubs?Luke, PortlandThe first will be to just keep adding to their own staff, so they’re providing the players with all the professional services in and around them in a deeper way. The second is keep attracting the best quality to the NWSL because it helps our own players develop when they’re playing in the best training environments with the best players. And expansion, because it is another step in the right direction, showing that the game is developing.What skills should young American players with nationalteam ambitions be practising in their back yards?Marissa, DenverHit the ball against the wall, practice one-v-ones, do rebound balls – you develop your own technical stuff by practising a lot of your tight-area skills and ball control.View image in fullscreenBarcelona are among a number of clubs who provide online coaching courses for fans looking to enhance their coaching skills.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAWhat can young players do to increase their tactical awareness and knowledge of the game, particularly if they harbour ambitions of being a coachwhen they are older?Chris Wragg, BournemouthThere are a couple of things: watch football and try to watch it through the lens of a coach, not as a fan. Educate yourself, but outside England. Don’t just go to your run-of-the-mill location, go to somewhere like Barcelona’s innovation hub and see if you can do some positional play coach education courses and go to other countries where you can experience different coach education.Thanks for all the wonderful work you did at Chelsea. First, would you like to manage England one day? Second, have you dropped the F-bomb on US live TV yet and, if so, what was the reaction?Peter Collins, LondonI’m always sceptical that people can’t use the F-bomb in the right context, but I’d say I think I’ve refrained from it for now – I’ve been working on that. As for managing England one day, I’ll never say never.If the world’s most expensive footballer cost around £200m – Neymar’s fee when moving to Paris Saint-Germain – how much is the world’s best football manager worth?Rick, LondonA manager, like a player in many regards, is someone “on the team”, but someone who is heading that up. You can see with the fees for managers as they stand, when buying them out of contracts, the transfer fee isn’t at that same amount as players but they certainly are expensive amounts. I don’t think managers’ fees will ever be that of a player because of marketing reasons, which is also why players’ transfer fees are that high. You can sell players’ shirts, but we don’t sell managers’ shirts so I don’t think their fees will ever meet that same level.Do you think Chelsea paying recordtransfer fees season after season is good for the Women’s Super League? You were against WSL introducing fair-spending levels. Was this because it would have stopped Chelsea efforts in winning the Champions League?Ted Harvey, IpswichI know Naomi Girma is worth at least $1m, at least.

Bitter because you probably would have preferred it to be Chelsea who won, but also sweet because you were assistant coach to Vic Akers last time Arsenal won the trophy in 2007. Also, when you and Renée Slegers talked before the final, what advice did you give her?Ingrid, New ZealandIt was far from bittersweet. Arsenal were a massive part of my life since I was 10. I coached there for a long time so I was delighted for them. I brought Renée to England as an academy player in 2006 so I’ve had a strong relationship with her and I’m so impressed with her. She’s incredible, she did an amazing job, and, yes, we did speak in the week leading up to the game, but she doesn’t need my help. She’s got that under control and I’m very happy to see an English team win it.Your coaching career goes back to when there were a lot more independent clubs run without the backing of a pre-existing men’s team. Now only two in the WSL and WSL2 run independently. Do you think this will ever changeor are the majority of successful women’s team going to be operated by men’s clubs?Liam, Newcastle-under-LymeWe’re potentially going to see more independent teams and that’s a good thing. Both can exist, but having strong independent women’s teams with strong ownership can only aid the development of the game.Toone scores twice in England’s easy test against Jamaica ahead of EurosRead moreThomas Tuchel resigns tomorrow – do you want the job?

When those case studies were tried on practising physicians – who had no access to colleagues, textbooks or chatbots – the accuracy rate was two out of 10.Microsoft said it was also a cheaper option than using human doctors because it was more efficient at ordering tests.Despite highlighting the potential cost savings from its research, Microsoft played down the job implications, saying it believed AI would complement doctors’ roles rather than replace them.“Their clinical roles are much broader than simply making a diagnosis. They need to navigate ambiguity and build trust with patients and their families in a way that AI isn’t set up to do,” the company wrote in a blogpost announcing the research, which is being submitted for peer review.However, using the slogan “path to medical superintelligence” raises the prospect of radical change in the healthcare market. While artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to systems that match human cognitive abilities at any given task, superintelligence is an equally theoretical term referring to a system that exceeds human intellectual performance across the board.Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told the Guardian the system would be operating perfectly within the next decade.“It’s pretty clear that we are on a path to these systems getting almost error-free in the next 5-10 years. It will be a massive weight off the shoulders of all health systems around the world,” he said.Explaining the rationale behind the research, Microsoft raised doubt over AI’s ability to score exceptionally well in the United States Medical Licensing Examination, a key test for obtaining a medical licence in the US. It said the multiple-choice tests favoured memorising answers over deep understanding of a subject, which could help “overstate” the competence of an AI model.Microsoft said it was developing a system that, like a real-world clinician, takes step-by-step measures – such as asking specific questions and requesting diagnostic tests – to arrive at a final diagnosis. For instance, a patient with symptoms of a cough and fever may require blood tests and a chest X-ray before the doctor arrives at a diagnosis of pneumonia.The new Microsoft approach uses complex case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).Suleyman’s team transformed more than 300 of these studies into “interactive case challenges” that it used to test its approach. Microsoft’s approach used existing AI models, including those produced by ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Anthropic, Elon Musk’s Grok and Google’s Gemini.Microsoft then used a bespoke, agent-like AI system called a “diagnostic orchestrator” to work with a given model on what tests to order and what the diagnosis might be. The orchestrator in effect imitates a panel of physicians, which then comes up with the diagnosis.Microsoft said that when paired with OpenAI’s advanced o3 model, it “solved” more than eight of 10 NEJM case studies – compared with a two out of 10 success rate for human doctors.Microsoft said its approach was able to wield a “breadth and depth of expertise” that went beyond individual physicians because it could span multiple medical disciplines.It added: “Scaling this level of reasoning – and beyond – has the potential to reshape healthcare. AI could empower patients to self-manage routine aspects of care and equip clinicians with advanced decision support for complex cases.”Microsoft acknowledged its work is not ready for clinical use. Further testing is needed on its “orchestrator” to assess its performance on more common symptoms, for instance.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)MicrosoftHealthDoctorsComputingHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

The figure is up from 16% a year ago.Almost three-quarters (73%) of more than 8,000 business leaders believe that a cybersecurity incident will disrupt their business in the next 12 to 24 months. Rics identified cybersecurity and digital risk as one of the biggest and fastest-growing threats to owners and occupiers of buildings.Marks & Spencer was forced to halt orders on its website for almost seven weeks after a major attack in April, which caused clothing sales to fall by a fifth in the four weeks to 25 May. Itlost ground to rivalssuch as Next, Zara and H&M.As cybercriminals’ techniques become more sophisticated, attacks on critical infrastructure and data breaches are becoming more common, Rics said. This is going to be exacerbated by the rising capability of artificial intelligence and the pace of technological change.Rics warned that some buildings may be using dangerously outdated operating systems. It said a building opened in 2013 could conceivably use Windows 7, an operating system that has not received security updates from Microsoft in more than five years.Paul Bagust, the head of property practice at Rics, said: “Buildings are no longer just bricks and mortar, they have evolved into smart, interconnected digital environments embracing increasingly sophisticated and ever-evolving technologies to enhance occupier experience.“This has led to increasing data being collected and used to inform decision-making; at the property manager, building user, occupier and owner levels. However, while these technologies bring many benefits, from efficiency gains and reduced negative impacts on the planet, they also create multiple risks and vulnerabilities which can be exploited by those looking to cause disruption.”The report identified operational technology such as building management systems, CCTV networks,Internetof Things devices and access control systems as risk areas. This ranges from automated lighting and heating, and ventilation and air conditioning systems, to advanced security protocols and energy management.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been variably successful at this – the messy relationship between shy, photography-obsessed Max and chaotic blue-haired Chloe in 2015’s original Life Is Strange was left somewhat ambiguous, but Alex Chen in Life Is Strange: True Colors was openly bi and pretty laidback about it. My favourite queer moment from the series, though, came in last year’s Double Exposure.Max Caulfield is now a grownup with a photography residency at a small-town college, and has finally figured herself out. She flirts confidently with Vince, the handsome butterribleit-boy on campus. But when it comes to Amanda, the exceedingly cool lesbian behind the bar at the local pub? She is so awkward it’s painful. I loved this because it is my firm personal belief thatallbisexual people are both terrified by and attracted to cool lesbians. If you get to the point when you take Amanda on a date, you are treated to one of the sweetest scenes I’ve ever seen in a game: they go to an imaginary gig. The women riff off each other, conjuring the most chaotic show imaginable with words and laughter. It is, along withNathan Drake and Elena playing Crash Bandicoot togetherin Uncharted 4, the most believable relationship scene in games. (And yes, even after the date goes really well, Max still hesitates over kissing her.)Keza MacDonald, the Guardian’s video games editorEllie and Dina in The Last of Us Part IIView image in fullscreenPeople with flaws … Ellie and Dina in The Last of Us: Part IIPhotograph: Sony/Naughty DogIt has to be the relationship between Ellie and Dina in The Last of Us Part II. I know this one gets a lot of attention, but it’s for good reason. There are so few queer stories in media that don’t revolve around traumatic experiences. Acknowledging the struggles of any marginalised group is vital to sharing that perspective – but so is highlighting the joy. I think it’s incredible that, in a game that deals with such heavy themes and tragic character development, these two were allowed to experience a joyful, supportive relationship. They could be people with flaws who made choices, instead of being defined solely by their queerness. The evolution of the narrative and eventual conflict between them was the result of Ellie’s choices and actions – which made the story that much more impactful to me.Amanda Hufford, producer of (and voice of Ducky in)Date Everything!, out nowGay marriage in FableView image in fullscreenNo cheat codes required … Fable.Photograph: LionheadWhen I was a teenager,I came across this game called Fable.I played through the tutorial.I wanted to spice it up.I used a cheat engine.I made my character really buff.It felt a little … wrong.Not because I cheated.But because I didn’t look like that.Does this character still represent me?Am I allowed to do this?> Don’t know.I got to the first town.I came across a merchant.I bought out everything he had.I regifted everything back to him.I saw a heart begin to form.Can I … really do this?> Guess so.I gave him the wedding ring.We got gay-married.We moved into this house I bought.And then I never touched the game again.–I was a closeted teenager.Everyone around me knew.Everyone but me of course.I was a chubby little kid.Everyone around me knew.And everyone kept reminding me.I can’t help but laugh.Guilty for being swole in-game.But never for being gay-married.Funny how a teenage mind works.Tanat Boozayaangool of Tan Ant Games, developer ofBuilding Relationships, out later this yearBisexual chaos in Thirsty SuitorsView image in fullscreenMischief and honesty … Thirsty Suitors.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveMy love for queer games exists at two ends of a spectrum. At one end is “beautifully done nuance and subtlety” and at the other is “delightful, wilful chaos”. This feels in keeping with being a gender-wobbly bisexual.In the realm of nuance and subtlety, my earliest love was playingGone Home, and the slow discovery of your sister Sam’s queerness, and the catharsis of her getting to live her life authentically after rejection by her parents. Then there wasUnpacking, about making space for a new partner after the nightmare that was trying to fit your things around a boyfriend who wouldn’t budge. Or most recently, there was the (spoiler alert) very natural growth of Henry and Hans’s relationship inKingdom Come: Deliverance II, which has to be one of the most beautifully written romances in games in years.My unexpected Pride icon: the diva women of fighting video games inspired meRead moreOf course, on the other side of the coin is mischief and honesty.Thirsty Suitorscaptures the messiness and interconnectedness of queer dating, and the fallout that can occur when someone is still figuring themselves out. When it comes to my own game, Crescent County, we absolutely come down on the side of chaos. There is often pressure to perform “perfect” queer representation, but that robs characters of their bite and humanity. I completely understand the draw of pure wholesomeness, but we shouldn’t sanitise ourselves for the sake of acceptability!Anna Hollinrake, creative director ofCrescent County, out next yearA wholesome queer family in UnpackingView image in fullscreenA masterpiece of show-don’t-tell … Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamThe thing about a lot of queer moments in the video game era I grew up in – which my child loves to refer to as “the late 1900s” (my bones aredust) – is that it was the villains who were queer coded. Wholesome queer moments were as rare as a writer who can come up with a new and original “as rare as” simile.That’s why I loved Unpacking so much. On the face of it, the game is simply about unpacking your belongings as you move from place to place, but it’s a masterpiece of show-not-tell. You move out of your parents’ house, get room-mates, and eventually move in with your boyfriend, who immediately minimises your space and self expression. At that point I yelled to my wife “SHE’S GAY!” But I often do that with characters I like, so she took no note. However,I was right.As the game progresses she meets a new partner, grows closer to them, and eventually they have a child together and you’re unpacking the baby’s bedroom. It finishes with the most wholesome lesbian representation I’ve ever seen in a video game.NikkiJay, creator ofQuantum Witch, out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesSexualityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the War of the Ring, a palantír falls under the control of Sauron, who uses it to manipulate and deceive.Palantir Technologies bears a striking similarity. It sells an AI-based platform that allows its users – among them, military and law enforcement agencies – to analyze personal data, including social media profiles, personal information and physical characteristics. These are used to identify and surveil individuals.In March, Trump signed an executive order requiring all agencies and departments of the federal government toshare data on Americans. To get the job done, Trump chose Palantir Technologies.Palantir is nowpoised to combinedata gleaned from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. Meanwhile, the administration wants access to citizens’ and others’ bank account numbers and medical claims.Will the Trump regime use an emerging super-database to advance Trump’s political agenda, find and detain immigrants, and punish critics? Will it make it easier for Trump to spy on and target his ever-growing list of enemies and other Americans? We’ll soon find out.Thirteen former Palantir employeessigned a letterthis month urging the corporation to stop its work with Trump.Linda Xia, who was a Palantir engineer until last year, said the problem was not with the company’s technology but with how the Trump administration intended to use it. “Combining all that data, even with the noblest of intentions, significantly increases the risk of misuse,” shetold the New York Times.Even some Republicans are concerned. Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican of Ohio,told Semaforsuch work could be “dangerous”: “When you start combining all those data points on an individual into one database, it really essentially creates a digital ID. And it’s a power that history says will eventually be abused.”Last week, a group of Democratic lawmakerssent a letter to Palantir, asking for answers about huge government contracts the company got. The lawmakers are worried that Palantir is helping make a super-database of Americans’ private information.Behind their worry lie several people who are behind Palantir’s selection for the project, starting with Elon Musk.Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge)was behind Palantir’s selection. At least three Doge members had worked at Palantir, the Times reported, while others had worked at companies funded by Peter Thiel, an investor and a founder of Palantir, who still holds a major stake in it.Thiel has worked closely with Musk, who devoted a quarter of a billion dollars to getting Trump re-elected and then, as head of Doge, helped eviscerate swaths of the government without congressional authority.Thiel also mentored JD Vance, who worked for Thiel at one of his venture funds. Thiel subsequently bankrolled Vance’s 2022 senatorial campaign. Thiel introduced Vance to Trump and laterhelped Vance becomehis vice-presidential pick.Thiel also mentored the billionaire David Sacks, who also worked with Thiel at PayPal. As a student at Stanford University, Sacks wrote for the Stanford Review,the rightwing student newspaper Thiel founded as an undergraduate there in 1987. Sacks is now Trump’s “AI and crypto czar”.The CEO of Palantir is Alex Karp, whosaid on an earnings callearlier this year that the company wants “to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.Hello?If “capitalist democracy” is becoming an oxymoron, it’s not because of public assistance or because women got the right to vote. It’s because billionaire capitalists like Musk and Thiel are intent on killing democracy.Not incidentally, the 1920s marked the last gasp of the Gilded Age, when America’s robber barons ripped off so much of the nation’s wealth that the rest of the US had to go deep into debt both to maintain their standard of living and to maintain overall demand for the goods and services the nation produced.When that debt bubble burst in 1929, we got the Great Depression. Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler then emerged to create the worst threats to freedom and democracy the modern world had ever witnessed.If the US learned anything from the first Gilded Age and the fascism that grew like a cancer in the 1930s, it should have been that gross inequalities of income and wealth fuel abuses of political power – as Trump, Musk, Thiel, Karp and other oligarchs have put on full display – which in turn generate strongmen who destroy both democracy and freedom.The danger inherent in Palantir’s AI-powered super-database on all Americans is connected to the vast wealth and power of those associated with the corporation, and their apparent disdain for democratic institutions.Had you walked to the end of Trump’s military-birthday parade and gazed above the president’s reviewing stand, you’d have seen on a giant video board an advertisement for Palantir – one of the chief sponsors of the event.Tolkien’s palantír fell under the control of Sauron. Thiel’s Palantir is falling under the control of Trump.

In one, a young man with hopeful, progressive politics went up against the decaying gods of the establishment, with their giant funding and networks and endorsements from Democratic scions, and won. In another, in an appalling paroxysm of racism and Islamophobia, a Muslim antisemite has taken over the most important city in the US, with an aim to impose some socialist/Islamist regime. Like effluent, pungent and smearing, anti-Muslim hate spread unchecked and unchallenged after Mamdani’s win. It takes a lot from the US to shock these days, but Mamdani has managed to stir, or expose, an obscene degree of mainstreamed prejudice.Politicians, public figures, members of Donald Trump’s administration and the cesspit of social media clout-chasers all combined to produce what can only be described as a collective self-induced hallucination; an image of a burqaswathed over the Statue of Liberty; the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, stating that Mamdani’s win is what happens when a countryfails to control immigration. Republican congressman Andy Ogles has decided to call Mamdani “little muhammad” and ispetitioningto have him denaturalised and deported. He has beencalleda “Hamas terrorist sympathiser”, and a “jihadist terrorist”.It is a measure of how racist the reaction has been that Donald Trump calling Mamdani a “communist lunatic” seems restrained in comparison. Some of the responses have been so hysterical that I often couldn’t tell what was real and what was parody. Because the idea that Mamdani, whose style is, above anything else, wide-grinned earnestness, was some sinister Islamist sleeper agent is so clearly a joke.But it’s not a joke, and if it is then it’s on me for still, after all these years, underestimating what Muslims in the public sphere do to people’s brains. And how utterly comfortable many are with anti-Muslim hate. And why shouldn’t they be? To date, the most senior figures in Mamdani’s own party, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, havenot called outthis onslaught, and those politicians and public figures who made them will suffer no censure or consequence. Because, fundamentally, anti-Muslim hate, like all racism when it becomes normalised, thrives when there is a systemic blessing of it through not even registering its offensiveness.But the apathy towards assaults against Mamdani is because he is an outsider in more meaningful ways, not just in his religious background. His crime is not one of daring to be Muslim and a politician – he might have “passed” if he was a conventional Democratic apparatchik – but of having strong opinions about economics and politics that mark him out as a challenger of mainstream orthodoxies regarding capitalism andIsrael.Given his leftwing opinions ontaxationand rent control, and objections to the slaughter of Palestinians on the US’s dime, a backlash to Mamdani was always likely. But he has done much to counter it. He has made thoroughexplanationsof his abhorrence of antisemitism, of his pledge to combat all hate crime, and of the fact that his economic agenda is based on making the city, from itsfoodto itschildcare, more affordable.LiveZohran Mamdani: who is New York's Democratic mayoral candidate? – video profileHis offence has been in his unwillingness to water down his principles, not toeing the line on Israel, and not making frankly embarrassing assertions, likethose running against himdid, that Israel would be his first foreign trip. He has refrained from debasing himself through serial condemnations of phrases that have arbitrarily been erected as litmus tests of a Muslim’s acceptability in the public domain.Mamdani’srefusalto reject the phrase “globalise the intifada”, on the grounds that it expresses “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights” has been seized upon as an indication that he supports some kind of violent jihad – a reading that ignores his frequent assertions that Israel has the right to exist and condemnations of any violence against Jews. What are we doing here?There is no degree to which Mamdani could have become acceptably Muslim while holding these opinions – even though they are clearly universal enough for him to receive emphatic support from New Yorkers, including fromJewswho voted for him, and the Jewish candidate Brad Lander, whoendorsed him. He cannot be secular enough, American enough, or elite enough, as the son of a film-maker and a professor, to hold politics that will not be reducible to his inherently suspect identity.Even in demeanour, he has spoken of how he constantly has to measure his tone, lest he be smeared as a “beast”. And in this, he mirrors a broader, exasperating reality – one where Muslims and pro-Palestinians are condemned as threatening, while there is a colossal attack on their rights and safety across the world, simply for opposing an incontrovertible crime being perpetrated in Gaza. From detention and deportation proceedings against activists such as Mahmoud Khalil in the US, to the vilification and securitisation of pro-Palestinian speech and activism in theUKandEurope, the messenger is shot, and then framed as the aggressor.But smears and diversions and outrageous extrapolations will not change the facts on the ground, which are that the Israeli state is occupying the West Bank, starving and killing Palestinians inGaza, and accused of war crimes and genocide, all with the sponsorship of the US and support of western regimes. In that sense, Mamdani’s victoryisa threat, because it reveals how finally, all attempts to maintain an indefensible and intolerable situation have lost their grip on the growing number of people who are thinking for themselves.A roadmap to beat Trump? How rise of Zohran Mamdani is dividing DemocratsRead moreMamdani isn’t even mayor yet, and he will probably face an escalating campaign using his identity as a way of discrediting his beliefs, both economic and political. And here is where the response to his win is both alarming and potentially propulsive, like the clammy buildup to the final breaking of a fever. Mamdani is where he is because he is not alone. Not by a long shot. And in drawing out such naked and explicit anti-Muslim hate, Mamdani has inadvertently revealed the ugliness and weakness not just of his opponents, but of the wider political establishment, as well as their anti-democratic impulses.In drawing them out, Mamdani has shown how prejudice is rarely about individuals, but the fear that marginalised minority views could ever become powerful majority ones. In this mayoral race, from Palestine to local policing, anti-Muslim hate is not just a repellent phenomenon confined to Mamdani, it is a barricade against the desires of the voting public. Once people start making that connection, it really is over.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What this is really about is a government complicit in the Gaza atrocities seeking to silence dissentJuliet Stevenson is an award-winning actorMon 30 Jun 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 15.23 EDTShareStrongly worded emails are not doing it. Appeals to MPs are not doing it. Taking to the streets in our hundreds of thousands with banners and placards is not working. Elected representatives from every party in parliament have stood in the Commons and asked the government to act. Some government ministers themselves have condemned Israel’s starvation of Palestinians in Gaza. Every poll of public opinion shows that the nation demands we stop armingIsrael, and wants to see an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire. But none of these things are working.Keir Starmer and his cabinet remain impervious to all calls for humanitarian intervention, and Israel is still killing children inGazawith the support of the British government.To proscribe as “terrorist”a non-violent direct action group such as Palestine Action threatens the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, and of peaceful protest. Surely the government should only ever apply the Terrorism Act with the utmost restraint and precision. Otherwise it allows the state to repress civil liberties that have been dearly fought for and won, and which represent the bedrock of our democracy.Those civil liberties have already come under real and dangerous threat. The powers given to the police have incrementally increased to an alarming degree, owing in part to the Terrorism Act of 2000 and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act of 2022. These have both led to the right of public protest being seriously eroded, and afforded the police much greater powers and significantly less accountability. We have for some time seen these powers being used to suppress lawful protest and to detain peaceful protesters.In addition, leaving aside its members, the proscription of Palestine Action will directly affect many other activists who are deeply concerned about the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza. Even to be seen to support PA’s non-violent direct action will be to risk being criminalised.The government’s response to embarrassing security breaches at RAF bases by Palestine Action seems disproportionate, and highlights, I think, the influence on them of vested interests. There has long been a campaign by senior rightwing politicians, arms company executives and pro-Israel lobby groups to shut down Palestine Action and have it proscribed.Lockheed Martin UK is a key manufacturer of parts for the F-35 fighter jetsthat have helped Israel flatten the Gaza Strip, kill more than 56,000 people and createmore child amputees per capitathan anywhere else in the world. The government ended direct sales to Israel of some weapons, but created an “F-35 exemption” allowing sales of these parts to continue to reach Israel via the US, where the planes are assembled.The Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems also operates on UK soil, and our government has lucrative bilateral deals with the company. As far back as 2022 the then home secretary, Priti Patel, held a meeting with Martin Fausset, the CEO of Elbit Systems in the UK,to discuss how to deal with Palestine Action.The definition of terrorism as laid out in the Terrorism Act of 2000 is clear, and includes“serious damage to property”. Doesspraying red paint on to metalconstitute serious damage? The condemnation of this spraying of red paint on to planes as expressed by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, does not appear to be matched by any equivalent condemnation by her of red blood sprayed on to the tented walls of Gaza.So yes, crimes concerning damage to property have been committed, but there are already laws in place to deal with them. Labelling these as terrorism only serves to deepen the UK government’s complicity in the war crimes being committed in Palestine.In a further act of desperation, efforts have been made to try to undermine the motives of Palestine Action by makinga tenuous link to Iran, with unnamed Home Office sources telling newspapers it is investigating the group’s finances.Smear campaigns such as this are part of a wider policy by government to intimidate and clamp down on dissent.I have had a small taste of this myself. On 18 January, I attended a rally in Whitehall organised by Stop the War – and noticed immediately that the tactics of the police that day seemed to be markedly different. Present in their thousands, they were already kettling people at the start of the event, and behaving in a manner that seemed aggressive and provocative. The march to the BBC, which had been planned to protest against its coverage of the conflict, had been prohibited by the Met at short notice, and the gathering was confined to Whitehall. I was asked to join a group of about 12 people who would form a symbolic delegation, and request passage through police lines to reach the BBC. There we planned to lay flowers at the door. Reaching the police lines, after some hesitation and resistance, an officer allowed us through. Shortly after that, however, our progress was curtailed by another police line. It was here that I saw at close hand the disproportionate tactics used by police. I witnessed further vanloads of police arriving in the area, kettling peaceful protesters and making numerous arrests –77 in total that day.Three weeks later I was sent a letter from the Met threatening me with charges under section 14 of the Public Order Act. I then faced a three-hour police interview, before being told after several weeks (and several thousand pounds of legal fees) that I would face no further action.Over the past 21 months, I have met many hundreds of people who come out – often travelling long distances – to protest against this genocide. Old people and young, people of every faith, race, generation and ethnic identity. They come in horror at the brutality being inflicted on the population of Gaza. And many of those in our midst are Jewish.But still we are accused by lobby groups of antisemitism. This I disregard; I am married to a Jewish man, whose mother was a refugee from Hitler’s Vienna. She escaped just in time in 1938 as a refugee, and most of her family were subsequently wiped out in the Holocaust. My children define themselves as Jewish, and we have many beloved Jewish friends, all of whom are appalled by the activities of Benjamin Netanyahu, his government and the Israel Defense Forces. These Jewish friends are people driven by compassion, humanity and a sense of right and wrong that will not yield to intimidation. In Gaza, the world is watching the most heinous acts of violence that I have witnessed in my lifetime. It is as if the skin has been ripped off the face of humanity to reveal terrifying depths of sadism and depravity.I am intensely aware of this thought: I do not want to find myself at the end of my life looking back at this time regretting that I could have done something and didn’t – that I was too frightened to speak out, or to act. Palestine Action and its supporters will have no such regrets. Our current British government, however, may well.Juliet Stevenson is an award-winning actorExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionGazaActivismPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaArms tradeIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

After all, we aren’t luddites.The problem with being forced into this defensive mindset is that we misread the challenge at hand, which is not so much about the nature of the technology but the power dynamics driving this change.This is where the luddites and their misunderstood resistances to the last big technological revolution, chronicled in Brian Merchant’s ripping yarnBlood in the Machine, may help us think through our current challenges.Here’s the TLDR:in early 19th-century northern England, textile workers buck up against a new technology that automates their work and replaces well-paid skilled jobs with machines. When factory owners reject demands that the benefits of the new technology be shared, they gravitate around the avatar of young “Ned Ludd” and begin breaking the new machines and burning down said factories. The resistance rages for five years until the British government deploys troops and criminalises their association, leading many of the rebels to be executed or transported down under. Having been crushed by state power, the luddites become a punchline for anyone who can’t find the right wires for their laptop.Maybe it’s the residual bloodlines of some of those transported luddites but, according toresearchby Melbourne Business School and KPMG of 47 nations, Australians are in the bottom cohort when it comes to trusting AI systems. This is a trend picked up by the Guardian Essential report.Which of the following is closest to your view about the introduction of artificial intelligence into workplaces, society and everyday life?What’s interesting is that as more people have begun using large language models including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, their concern about the risks of the technology have actually increased.The Digital Rights Watch founder, Lizzie O’Shea, refers to this dataset as a valuable national resource; it puts the onus on those proposing change to show that the risks have been mitigated.These risks take two distinct forms. The first is the existential risks of a sentient mind controlling the world, fighting wars and playing god. The makers of AI like to keep the focus here because it (a) proves how powerful their machines are; and (b) it pushes the discussion of harms over the time horizon.But the second set of risks is more immediate: that the tools (which are built on stolen information) are being shaped by the same big tech companies that have wreaked their destruction through social media with so little regard for the end user. Only this time it’s not the consumers but workers they have in their sights.Over the past few weeks we have seen the bold prediction from Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, thathalf of all white-collar entry-level jobs are for the chopping block, while a study from MIThas foundthat the use of ChatGPTcan harm critical thinking abilities.Yet our business leaders are sharpening their pencils, claiming that the technology offers such aproductivity bonanzathat the only thing we have to fear about AI is fear itself; while the ascendant tech industry isusing every tool in their arsenalto avoid the “constraint” of regulation.This is where the treasurer’snewfound focus on productivityas a driver of national prosperity could have perverse consequences, particularly if it gets hijacked by tech and business interests that conflate head-cutting with working smarter.Again, the majority of Australians are sceptical about the productivity mantra. When they hear that word they see cost-cutting rather than shared benefit.Which of the following is closest to your view on how AI will mostly be used in the workplace moving forward?These results show that if the government, business and the tech industry want us to embrace their future, they need treat us like the luddites we are.It starts by tapping the thinking of the Nobel prize in economics winnersDaron Acemogluand Simon Johnson, and recognising that productivity comes from giving workers new tools, connections and markets. While the stocking frame and spinning jenny of the Industrial Revolution were crudely extractive, other innovations including the steam engine opened up opportunity and possibility that drove prosperity and innovation for the next 200 years.They also should recognise that where the holders of new technology overreach, resistance will be ongoing. While the luddites may have been defeated, their movement gave way to the first worker guilds that successfully fought for the laws that civilised industrial capital.Finally, they must accept that when power is genuinely shared the benefits accrue in ways that sometimes are not even imagined at the point of connection.The last great productivity surge in Australia was the product of the accord struck between the Hawke-Keating governments and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which helped to globalised the Australian economy while locking in social wage advances including Medicare and universal superannuation.Likewise in this wave of change, the feedback loops between the makers and users of technology will ultimately create the value, so it only stands to reason those loops will be strongest when trust is high and benefits are shared.Prof Nick Davis from the University of Technology Sydney’s Human Technology Institutedescribes the AI challengeas being like physiotherapy after surgery: “It only delivers if you put in the effort, follow the program and work with experts who know which muscles to strengthen and when.”Placing Australian workers at the centre of the AI revolution, with a right to guide the way it is used, the capacity to develop and enforce redlines and guardrails on an ongoing basis is not some gratuitous nod to union power, it is the hard-headed path to national prosperity.Proudly embracing our inner luddite and demanding a seat at the table is the surest way of ensuring that this wave of technology delivers on its hype.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

It hasn’t done us any goodMon 30 Jun 2025 07.13 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 11.50 EDTShareOur lesson today is taken from St Paul’s first letter tothe Corinthians, chapter 14, verse eight:“For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?”In the macho and combative world of Westminster politics, certainty is a highly valued commodity. If you are not decisive then you must be a ditherer. The logic, and the alliteration, are irresistible. Hence the prime minister’s current difficultyover three (count ’em!) recent U-turns: over the winter fuel allowance, a national inquiry into grooming gangs and now on proposed cuts to personal independence payments (Pip).U-turns are good news for reporters and political commentators. They provide an opportunity to confirm how insightful they are, and wise after the event (admittedly some are wise before the event). They also mean that the adjective “screeching” is likely to be used far too often, along with references to the smell of burning tyre rubber. Some words – unlike some policies – just stick. Older readers may remember that under the lastLabourgovernment it was compulsory for an extended time to refer to the transport secretary, Stephen Byers, as “the beleaguered Stephen Byers”.Why are U-turns always regarded as being such a bad thing? Isn’t it a good idea to change direction once you realise you are heading the wrong way? With the holiday season approaching, overheated children and spouses must brace themselves for that tense moment when the driver is told he has picked the wrong route, only for the man behind the wheel to declare grumpily: “No, I’ve decided, we’re sticking with the A591!” A no U-turns policy can make a Daddy Pig out of anyone.But what explains the enduring, emblematic power of the U-turn to make grown men and women in London SW1 tremble? Here we must point to the usual suspect,Margaret Thatcher. In October 1980, the Conservative party was heading to its annual conference in Brighton. The new Tory government was less than a year and a half old, but was already extremely unpopular and under intense political pressure. Unemployment and inflation were both high. Thatcher was seen as an inflexible and insensitive leader. Surely there would be an adjustment, and some acknowledgment of the severe economic pain the country was suffering?But, (in)famously, Mrs T said this in her conference speech: “To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say: you turn if you want to.The lady’s not for turning!”It did not matter that Thatcher may not have fully appreciated the joke which her speechwriter Ronald Millar had provided for her (a pun on the 1948 play The Lady’s Not For Burning by Christopher Fry). The line stuck. And the mythology around Thatcher began to grow: that she was resolute, unflinching, impervious to counter-arguments and determined never to change her mind.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher on the last day of the 1980 Conservative party conference in Brighton.Photograph: Peter Johns/taken from picture libraryBut hang on a minute. What happened only four months after she gave this speech, in February 1981? A government plan to close 23 coalmines was withdrawn in the face of opposition from the National Union of Mineworkers, then led by Joe Gormley. It was a complete and utter … U-turn. The headline on the BBC’s website where the story is featured says: “Thatcher gives in to miners”. People remember the moment when, three years later and with much higher coal stocks, Thatcher battled the miners again when the timing suited her better. This too fed into the “no U-turns” myth. But it was not the whole story.Westminster orthodoxy and the real world are not always in perfect alignment. In SW1-land, you can never go into a general election committed to any kind of tax rise. But if the current government had said that, if elected, it was going to reverse the second of Jeremy Hunt’s employee national insurance cuts how much happier (fiscally and politically) it might be today. The gap between what everybody in Westminster knows and what normal people think might also help explain why some free-wheeling populists like Nigel Farage get away with their bogus yet apparently “authentic”, so-called “common sense”.Starmer says he lost grip on Labour welfare revolt due to focus on foreign affairsRead moreNo one wants to be led by a vacillating or broken “shopping trolley” (the label Dominic Cummings applied to a chaotic Boris Johnson in No 10) that has no consistency or sense of direction. But it is OK to change your mind based on a fresh assessment of the evidence.In theiraward-winning 2006 book, Why Should Anyone Be Led By You?, Rob Goffee and the late Gareth Jones wrote about the power of leaders admitting to doubt and even, on occasion, weakness. “By exposing a measure of vulnerability, they make themselves approachable and show themselves to be human,” they wrote. It is possible that the parliamentary Labour party might agree with that. Until it changes its mind.So, U-turn if you want to. Perhaps you should. It beats going full steam into the rocks.Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre.

No one doubtsthese concessionsare welcome. But the real question is whether they go far enough. For me and many of my Labour colleagues, the answer is clear – they don’t.At best, these concessions make a terrible bill slightly less bad. But the bill still represents a devastating attack on disabled people. It still strips billions in support from those who need it most, still forces huge numbers into poverty, and still undermines the dignity and independence of disabled people. As an example of just how cruel these cuts still are, MPs will be asked to vote on Tuesday for a bill that will take away essential support from disabled people who will need help with basic daily tasks such as cutting up food, washing themselves or using the toilet.If these cuts go ahead, approaching half a million disabled peoplewill lose their personal independence paymentsbetween the end of next year and 2030. On average, theywill lose £4,500 a year– about £100 a week. That’s a life-changing reduction for people who rely on Pip to help with the extra costs of disability, including the one in six Pip recipients who are in work, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.On top of that, there are deep cuts to the universal credit health component for low-income sick and disabled people. Three-quarters of a million new claimants will be forced on to a rate that’s half the current level and be left£3,000 a year worse off. For people already struggling to make ends meet, this is not just a cut – it’s a catastrophe.And how can it be right that someone who would qualify for support today would be denied it simply for becoming disabled after next November? Do we really want a two-tier system where future generations of disabled people receive less support than disabled people today? Especially when already three in four of those using food banks aredisabled themselvesor live with someone who is.All this flies in the face of what should be a key purpose of every Labour government: to lift people out of poverty, not push them further into it. It’s no wonder that disabled people’s organisations, including Labour’s own affiliateDisabilityLabour, remain so firmly opposed to this bill.Of course, ministers have been sent out to claim that these changes are all about helping people. But if you cut billions in essential support to disabled people, you cannot then sincerely claim to be helping them. The truth is these changes are driven by the desire to make savings. Even after the concessions, the majority of the original cuts planned are still in the bill – totalling a staggering £3.5bn.Sadly, the government has made a deliberate choice to balance the books on the backs of disabled people instead of pursuing the much more Labour option of taxing those with the broadest shoulders. So many fairer alternatives exist. As an example of one of them, I will be presentinga petition in parliamenton the eve of the vote, already backed by more than 75,000 people, calling for a wealth tax. Such a tax of just 2% on assets over £10m could raise £24bn a year – over six times more than the government’s so-called savings from these cuts.No 10 climbs down over welfare bill in move to win over Labour rebelsRead moreIt would also be popular, with one recent poll showing that two-thirds of people support tax increases on the super-rich. It’s a policy that would placeLabourfirmly on the right side of public opinion – something the government has struggled with in its first year.As we count down to Tuesday’s vote, there will be increasing pressure on MPs to fall into line, accept the concessions as sufficient and back the bill. But the question MPs need to ask themselves isn’t whether this bill is better than it was before the concessions. It’s whether this bill will leave disabled people worse off than they are now. The answer is obvious.That’s why I will vote against it. And that’s why I am calling on the government to withdraw the bill entirely.The government has treated this as a political problem to be solved before Tuesday’s vote. But it’s an artificial deadline. Why not postpone the vote and then use the next few months to get this right? Working with disabled people, we could design a welfare system that is fair and compassionate, that recognises the barriers disabled people face and provides the support they need to live full, independent lives.As we mark one year of Labour in government, this is about our values – and the kind of country we want to build.Richard Burgon is the MP for Leeds East and secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPsOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionWelfareBenefitsKeir StarmerDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

Yet without us, the system would collapseMon 30 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 04.28 EDTShareIt’s autumn 2024 and I’m talking to an A&E doctor. We’re on the refreshment break at a conference about care. He tells me that he and his colleagues keep their NHS lanyards visible when they take loved ones to medical appointments. It means the doctors listen to them. It’s understandable; they’re peers with shared training and expertise. But it’s also infuriating because I know Mary’s story and many more like it.Mary is 58, and lives in Wales with her husband and their adult son. As a result of epilepsy in infancy, her son has global developmental delay. Practically, this means that he is non-mobile, non-verbal and takes food through a tube to his stomach. I worked with Mary and 15 other unpaid carers last year, supporting them to keep weekly diaries and interviewing them, resulting ina research report.Mary’s son requires medication to prevent excess drooling. He can’t stop himself choking, so it’s essential to minimise his saliva production. But in her diary, she explained that the medication was changed and the new type was less effective – he was having dangerous coughing fits. Mary reported this to his medical team but, in her words: “It was a feeling of, if it wasn’t witnessed by a health professional it didn’t happen.” A few weeks later, she had a meeting in her home with some of his care team. “I was just lucky that he performed,” she told me with a wry, tired smile, by which she meant he had a coughing fit in front of the professionals. His medication was swiftly reverted.I wish Mary’s story was unique. But it’s not. Ada is 80 and also cares for her son. He’s in his 40s, and has autism and several other conditions. She had been warning medical professionals about his escalating panic attacks for months, but nothing had been done. In one incident, he became so panicked that he ran away from his daycare centre and had to be located by police. At other times, when it’s just Ada and him at home, things can turn violent. Still, Ada told me that her concerns were dismissed. She was only believed when, by chance, a psychiatrist happened to witness one of these panic attacks. “He said it was one of the gravest attacks he had seen.”To be an unpaid carer is to be deemed not credible, according to Mary, Ada and several other carers in this study. Mary feels this is especially apparent higher up the professional ladder. The community-based staff listen to her, perhaps because they see what she does for her son on a daily basis. But of consultants and doctors, she said: “I’m lucky if they’ll even look at me.” Yet it is Mary who has been at every medical appointment for her son during his 26 years. It is Mary who spends 15 hours in every 24-hour period providing care for him (alongside her part-time job and the paid care he receives). It is Mary who spots side effects, monitors symptoms and administers medications. It’s not just about feeling respected; for carers such as Mary and Ada, being heard is a matter of life, death and safety. Of that meeting at which her son “performed”, she wrote that there had been too few chairs to seat all the attenders, so she perched on the periphery. “The irony that there was no room for me at the table was not lost.”Family members provide far more than hands-on care at home in the absence of paid workers – their unpaid labour is woven through the entire health and care system and at all times. At the most basic level, they perform a high volume of administrative tasks, made harder by disjointed and complex systems. In fact, the carers in the study spent up to 220 hours over 12 weeks on these sorts of tasks for the people they are caring for. The diaries read like broken records – endless arranging and rearranging of appointments, prescriptions and finances, automated phone services that lead to dead ends, digitised forms that aren’t fit for purpose. “I wish that we did not move in circles,” wrote Philippa, 86, and caring for her 60-year-old son, after a long week trying to sort out his future care.In a cast of changing medical and care professionals, family members also act as essential living repositories of their loved ones’ medical histories. Jared’s wife had an industrial accident in 2011, after which she was in a coma. Jared told me that her medical notes were about 900 pages long. Medical professionals have rarely, if ever, had time to read all of the notes. In this context, Jared becomes indispensable as “the only one who can say, well, this happened in this order”.Beyond project management and medical histories, carers also reported enabling what professionals call “person-centred care”, ensuring that the personality and preferences of their family members are understood. Lisa’s mum is 75, and has diabetes, multiple sclerosis and cognitive decline. She is supported by a live-in paid worker. Lisa settles in the paid workers when they rotate. She does this practically – showing them where things are in the house – but she also communicates “the nuances of Mum … I want to get across to them that they are going to see the worst side of her, but she’s not that.” She tells them about the dinner parties her mother used to throw, her flirtatious and bubbly nature. “She’s such a different person now that you want her care workers to understand who she was.”Throughout the interviews and diaries, carers such as Lisa explain repeatedly how they lubricate the system, enabling it to function when care-receiving loved ones cannot. They are the unseen but essential lifeblood of the health and care system: it’s not about them, but it does not function without them. Since being a carer myself, and subsequentlywriting a bookabout carers’ experiences, I have developed a keen sense for when a policymaker, politician or simply a member of the public has failed to understand the contribution of carers.The Labour party manifestolast year was a case in point. It managed to set out a plan on care yet omit carers, that is, the people who perform the vast majority of care in the UK. Subsequentgovernmental announcementsfall into the same trap, paying carers cursory attention.While we wait for politicians to catch up with reality, perhaps carers need to pirate those NHS identity cards. I’m not serious, of course. But I think, too, of Mary, Ada and all the other carers I’ve met, walking a tightrope of their loved ones’ safety on a daily basis, steeped in loving and practical knowledge. It shouldn’t take a piece of laminated card for them to win legitimacy.Emily Kenway is a social-policy doctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh and author ofWho Cares: the Hidden Crisis of Caregiving and How We Solve ItExplore more on these topicsCarersOpinionHealthDoctorsSocial carecommentShareReuse this content"

The cost was €1,000 a month – a bargain by market standards but still well over double what my downstairs neighbour, Henrika, paid under the lifelong social housing contract she had obtained four decades earlier.In the intervening years, Amsterdam had shifted from a pinnacle of inclusivity and progressive housing politics to one of Europe’s most unaffordable markets. In the last year, Dutch house prices have surged bymore than 10%, homelessnesshas risen by more than 20%, and rents in the private rental sector haveclimbed by more than 7%.Divides in Amsterdam’s rental system have never been starker. Outsiders – primarily young people, newcomers and lower earners – are increasingly forced into an overpriced, insecure rental market to access the city. Meanwhile, insiders – typically older residents who secured affordable homes under better conditions – are assured stability and a place to grow old. But they are not the villains in this story, just a reminder of how quickly housing politics have changed. So, how did this two-tier system come to be?Over the past 40 years, the general direction of Amsterdam’s housing policies has shifted, from prioritising social to private housing. There has been an underinvestment in affordable housing for lower-income groups and a deliberate shift towards market-based housing geared toward the affluent. The bigger political and ideological agenda behind this shift was to gradually transform the capital from a relatively poor workers’ city to a richer city for the middle classes.Encouraging home ownership was one strategy to invite richer residents. And historically low interest rates, easy access to credit and mortgage interest tax deductions offering clear incentives to buy meant home ownership used to be an achievable goal for many Dutch people. However, with the average property prices in Amsterdam rising beyond what even educated professionals could afford, efforts to attract and accommodate the middle classes have shifted from home ownership towards a transformation of the rental sector.Around 70% of the city’s population rents, but the social housing sector, where rents arecapped at €900 a month, has steadily shrunk. Social housing accounted for nearly 60% of the city’s rental housing in the late 1980s, with most new construction intended for this segment. However, decades of sell-offs, demolitions and limits in new construction have reduced social housing supply by a third since this point. Now, many local governments arestruggling to meet the 30% social housing targetin new housing projects, where the majority of new builds are aimed at higher-income residents.Chart showing how rental prices vary in EuropePreviously, social housing in theNetherlandswas available to both low- and middle-income households, driven by social-democratic values of inclusivity and social cohesion. Access has been gradually restricted to lower earners, and even those who qualify face long waiting lists – over a decade in high-demand areas such as Amsterdam. This starkly contrasts with the past. Young Amsterdammers could register for social housing at 18 and expect to secure a permanent home within a few years – a luxury that seems unimaginable to today’s newcomers looking for affordable housing in the city.With both social housing and home ownership out of reach, the Dutch government turned to the market to address shortages. The private rental sector hasmore than tripled in sizein Amsterdam in the last two decades. A key strategy of expansion was loosening regulation: short-term leases replaced lifelong rental contracts, and price ceilings were removed on a growing share of properties. With the sector becoming more attractive to investors, everything from small-scale landlords, real-estate investment trusts and big companies such as Blackstone began to look to Amsterdam’s private rental market as a place to park their cash. Now, a quarter of properties in major Dutch cities are owned by investors. Between 2007 and 2020, an estimated €23bn in rental real-estate transactions by institutional investors took place in Amsterdam. This makes it one of Europe’s hottest institutional investment markets, falling only just short of London.With growing concerns over theever-worsening housing crisis, there have been recent attempts to calm the rental sector and curb investor purchases. Measures such as limiting short-term rental contracts andrestricting rentals in homes under a certain valuehave had some success in prompting some investors to sell up. While this may free up properties for lower-income residents and first-time buyers, it is yet to be seen how far these will go in addressing house prices and continually rising rental costs.Single rooms in shared housesfrequently fetch €1,000 a month, and spending half of an income on rent is not unusual any more. It is unsurprising that stories of young people being unable to move out of the parental home, sharing well into their 30s, orpostponing graduation to keep their student housinghave become commonplace. For thoseunable to find an affordable home, housing policy isn’t just about economics – it shapes their entire lives. It stalls independence, strips away stability, and puts futures on hold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have mobilised the mass dissatisfaction with housing to push racist and anti-migration sentiments. This was seen clearly during therunup to the November 2023 election, which resulted in the first far-right win in recent history.Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-Islam Freedom party, blamed labour migrants, asylum seekers and foreign students for monopolising housing supply and driving up prices.During my six-month sublet, I spent many nights listening to Henrika’s tales of Amsterdam in the past. Her stories left me wondering how people could continue to build a life in the city without wealth or privilege, the way she had done. They left me questioning the city’s future, and whether it would remain a place of creativity, openness and diversity if it continued to transition to a playground for the rich. Mostly, they left me doubting whether the recent wave of housing regulations would be enough to undo a housing crisis decades in the making, or if they’ve come too little, too late.Amber Howard is a researcher in social policy at the University of Bristol.

But first, their co-frontmen,Pete Dohertyand Carl Barât, make a stop by the Astrolabe stage for the last of Guardian Live’s in-conversations at this year’s festival. “They are the greatest British rock band of the last 25 years,” says Guardian critic and today’s host, Miranda Sawyer. And Doherty and Barât are two of the most notorious hell-raisers in indie-rock. But this is a changed band, perhaps, who stop for a photograph with Mr Tumble before they walk onstage.They kick off the talk with fond memories of Glastonbury, a place that has long been “part of the mythology of the band,” says Doherty. For him, it was running into his sister, AmyJo, having not seen her in three years. “I heard this couple fighting in the mud.” But then he realised: “I know that voice. It was AmyJo. She was having a full on barney with her boyfriend at the time. We had a massive, warm embrace and a little cry.”Barât’s Glasto experience was emotional in a different way. “It was a bit of a rite of passage when I was kid – to go over the fence. When I finally got through, the festival opened up before me and it was so exciting. I didn’t have any money, so I got food in the Hare Krishna tent and I slept in a Christian Aid tent. I woke up at four in the morning and I heard this rattling – I was getting sprayed. There was some fella pissing on my blanket.”View image in fullscreenLibertines on the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianSawyer notes the similarities between the spirit of Glastonbury and the thrust of the Libertines’ songs about Albion and “Merrie Old England”. The pair agree. “It’s definitely still medieval,” says Doherty, perhaps thinking of the Stone Circle at 6am. “There’s people with chicken powered bicycles and people who are living in the rhythms of the stars and the planet, or trying to make a stand in this time where it’s probably more difficult than ever. Or trying to be in touch with the land or what’s left of it.”An audience with Pete Doherty andCarl Barâtanswering reader’s questions is what it must be like to be on their tour bus. Or a fly on the wall when they shared a flat together in Camden in the mid-2000s. Their wisecracking banter has a tendency to veer off into the surreal, or the profound, with the occasional lighthearted jibe. Sawyer asks about being in a lineage of songwriting partnerships with a push-pull tension, one they mined their relationship for their songs like Can’t Stand Me Now. At one point, the pair even had security guards to protect them from each other. “But we didn’t really discuss it well,” says Doherty to his bandmate. “You’re always good for the arguments but less good at discussing and understanding the love affair.”Their last album, however, All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, was about a different relationship – with Margate in Kent. “We were running a hotel,” says Barât. “And we got so wrapped up in it. I woke up one day and realised I was like Basil Fawlty. I was so stressed all the time.” They’ve since turned it into a recording studio, where they made the album and give studio time to up-and-coming bands “so they can afford to go and do demos. It’s community building.”It’s time for readers’ questions, which range from the future of the music industry to – one for the heads – Doherty’s favourite cheese. Asked what their favourite support act of the past 20-odd years has been, they chorus “Chas and Dave”, or the time they went on after a Guns N’ Roses tribute act called Guns N’ Noses. “The guitarist was called Slosh,” laughs Barât. Another reader wanted to know if Doherty’s opinion on Oasis had changed since he notoriously appeared on MTV in 1997, saying: “I subscribe to the Umberto Eco view that Noel Gallagaher’s a poet and Liam’s a town crier.” “Yeah, I think that still works in a way,” he replies.Next up, Doherty evangelises about his favourite episode of BBC radio comedy Hancock’s Half Hour broadcast: “The Poetry Society [episode] is my go-to. When we used to share a flat, I used to always put that one on for you,” he says to Barât. “He fancied himself as a bit of a poet and he’s in with all these bohemians that hang around.” That sounds familiar. But the musician is also up on contemporary culture. In response to a reader question about new books, he says: “There’s a novel calledEngland Is Mine about a kid who gets turned to online extremism by a young English writer called Nicolas Padamsee. I ran into him at random yesterday; it’s a beautiful first novel. It inspired me and made me want to get back to myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

A reader asked: what is the one thing you would both change if you had a time machine and could travel back to the early 2000s? “My first thought is to try and get involved in some historical events like, I don’t know, contact the New York police on the morning of 9/11 or something,” says Doherty, fancying himself as a hero. “That’s not funny, is it? But something like that, I don’t know. Or just place some bets on certain horses and cup finals, proper Back to the Future vibes. Nothing really in my own life, because I wouldn’t want to tamper with the ….” He pauses. “There’s a few things, maybe. Yeah, so much.”“No, I wouldn’t change anything,” chimes Barât. “Apart from averting catastrophes.” If the Libertines could have avoided implosion, would they have achieved global rock dominance? “I mean, I don’t think we know what to do with dominance,” says Barât.The talk concludes with what there is to look forward to about the Libertines’ live show on the Pyramid. Do they have anything special up their sleeve for the afternoon Glastonbury crowd? “We’re gonna have the shipping forecast as the intro music, that’s gonna be a lovely moment,” says Doherty. “Other than that, it’s the same old shit.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025The LibertinesPop and rockPete DohertyCarl BarâtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson added: “There is absolutely no place in society for hate.”Pascal Robinson-Foster, of the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan, led chants of “Death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, and spoke of working for a “fucking Zionist” during their show on the West Holts stage on Saturday.Why did BBC decide to stream Bob Vylan’s Glastonbury set and what will happen next?Read moreThe Irish rap trio Kneecap followed the group with an incendiary performance that included leading the crowd in chants of “fuck Keir Starmer”.Earlier on Monday theBBC saidit regretted not cutting the live stream of Bob Vylan’s performance, saying it contained “utterly unacceptable” antisemitic sentiments, while the US announced it was revoking visas for the band.TheBBCinitially acknowledged that some of the comments were “deeply offensive”. It said a warning was issued on screen about the “very strong and discriminatory language” at the time.However, the BBC went furtheron Monday, saying it should not have allowed the comments to be broadcast and would look to update its guidance around live events.“Millions of people tuned in to enjoy Glastonbury this weekend across the BBC’s output but one performance within our livestreams included comments that were deeply offensive,” it said. “The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence. The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves.“The team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.”On Monday night, the BBC reported that Tim Davie, the corporation’s director-general, was at the festival and is understood to have said that Bob Vylan’s performance should be taken off BBC iPlayer, after being told about the incident.The comments came after pressure from Starmer, Ofcom and the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, who questioned Davie over the weekend about what due diligence had been done in advance of the broadcast. The prime minister’s spokesperson said there was “no excuse for this kind of appalling hate speech, and the BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast”.Meanwhile, the band, who had been due to tour America later this year, have had their US visas revoked. “Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” said Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state.Warren Stephens, the US ambassador to the UK, said the chants were a “disgrace”, adding: “There should be no place for this hateful incitement or tolerance of antisemitism in the UK.”The band appear to have been dropped by the talent agency UTA and their page was no longer active on the agency’s website.In an urgent statement in parliament, Nandy said members of the Jewish community at the festival had said they created “their own safe space” because of the imagery on display.She said she was not satisfied with the explanation she had been given by the BBC so far over the broadcast, and she called on the corporation to “quickly and swiftly” answer a list of specific questions from her officials.“Much of this was foreseeable,” she said, saying basic online research would have shown potential issues with the Bob Vylan broadcast.Writing on Instagram on Sunday, Robinson-Foster said his phone had been “buzzing non-stop, inundated with messages of both support and hatred”.He said: “Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place. As we grow older and our fire starts to possibly dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us.”Kneecap, meanwhile,shared a poston social media on Monday night highlighting the situation in Gaza.Bob Vylan’s performance was not broadcast on linear television but could be watched on Saturday via a livestream on iPlayer. The BBC opted not to broadcast the livestream of the Irish rap artists Kneecap, who appeared later on the same West Holts stage as Bob Vylan.Ofcom said the BBC “clearly has questions to answer” after livestreaming the Bob Vylan footage. “We have been speaking to the BBC over the weekend and we are obtaining further information as a matter of urgency, including what procedures were in place to ensure compliance with its own editorial guidelines,” it said.A BBC spokesperson said: “The director general was informed of the incident after the performance and at that point he was clear it should not feature in any other Glastonbury coverage.”Glastonbury festival hadearlier condemnedthe chants started by Bob Vylan, saying organisers were “appalled by the statements” made on stage.Starmer condemned the band’s performance over the weekend, describing it as “appalling hate speech”. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, went further, asking police to “urgently investigate and prosecute the BBC” for broadcasting it.UK Screen Industry, a group of concerned TV and film professionals, said: “We reject the BBC’s statement that Bob Vylan’s words were ‘antisemitic’ and an ‘incitement to violence’. Saying ‘Death to the IDF’ is not a literal threat; it is a call for the dismantling of a brutal military apparatus that is committing war crimes and killing civilians.”Avon and Somerset police said: “We have received a large amount of contact in relation to these events from people across the world and recognise the strength of public feeling. We politely ask the public refrain from continuing to report this matter to us because an investigation is already taking place.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025KneecapBBCGlastonbury festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

Away from the big stages, feminist punks are singing songs about UTIs and Elvis has been reborn as Kurt CobainAmmar KaliaMon 30 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 06.58 EDTShareWith 80 stages hosting more than 3,000 performers, there is a terrifying amount of things to see and do at Glastonbury. While the headline acts dominate the coverage, what of the lesser-known artists listed further down the bill? Is anyone stumbling to their strange shows?From an Elvis-fronted Nirvana tribute act to a feminist punk group singing songs about UTIs, via a taxidermy mouse circus and a singalong performance of school-assembly hymns, we went in search of Glastonbury 2025’s most obscure acts.ElvanaFriday, 1.45pm, the Greenpeace stageView image in fullscreen‘People come from all over the world to seek out oddities.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn the baking afternoon heat of the first proper day, a man dressed in an Elvis bodysuit is making a crowd of about 100 people jump into a lively mosh pit.“I might sound like Nick Cage, sometimes like Matthew McConaughey and perhaps like Kurt Cobain, but most of the time I do not sound like Elvis fucking Presley!” he bellows before launching into a vibrato-laden rendition of Nirvana’s grunge anthem Smells Like Teen Spirit.The Newcastle-based singer Paul Kell is the man responsible for this maelstrom. Kell has played in bands since his teens and was always a fan of Nirvana. In 2015, his hobby became more serious when he was asked to perform at a fancy-dress birthday party. “We decided to do Nirvana songs because we knew our mates would love it and for some reason we dressed as Elvis to add a bit of extra fun,” Kell says after his show. “I started singing the Nirvana songs in an Elvis style and that was it. Everyone stood watching it open-mouthed and Elvana was born.”In 2019, they performed at Glastonbury for the first time and have returned ever since. “It always goes down amazingly here. Even though there’s so much happening at the festival, people like to roam and will always find their way to your show,” he says. “Glastonbury is an amazing marketing tool and trade show because people come from all over the world to seek out oddities and take a chance.”Pizza HotlineFriday, 4pm,the BugView image in fullscreen‘It’s a dream come true.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHarvey Jones has been coming to Glastonbury for as long as he can remember. Over by the West Holts stage, his parents have run a vegetarian food stall, No Bones Jones, for the past 25 years. It’s the place where he met his wife and has since played his first shows as the video-game-themed DJ Pizza Hotline.“During the pandemic, I began digging into old video-game music from the 90s and discovered this amazing, optimistic-sounding strain of jungle and drum’n’bass in the soundtracks,” he says. “It gave me a sense of nostalgia and I decided to start making my own tunes that reference it.”During his Friday afternoon set on the roving Bug sound system, Jones works through frenetic versions of the theme tune from the 1997 video game GoldenEye, while mixing in fast-paced percussion and thunderous basslines. His crowd of a dozen, including his two children, bounce happily along.“This is only the second time I’ve played at Glastonbury and it’s been a dream come true,” he says. “It’s always a family affair and in the wider context of festivals it’s hard to find something this colossal that still maintains its experimental roots. There’s nowhere else quite like it.”Feminist Mouse CircusSaturday, 2pm, GlebelandView image in fullscreen‘We bring a bit of playful subversion.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe roving taxidermy show Feminist Mouse Circus is so obscure that it takes 20 minutes to find it in the scorching Theatre fields on Saturday afternoon. Once you chance upon the portable setup, though, it’s hard to miss: an intricately painted wooden doll’s house perched on bike wheels that houses a range of puppet mice, each named after a notable feminist – Babybell Hooks, Germaine Gruyère and Paris Cheese, to name a few.“We started the circus in 2015 with myself and another artist-activist called Jenny Fernbank,” the performer Miranda La Mutanta says. “We were thinking about how gendered circus can be, with men performing stunts and women only doing aerial acts and looking beautiful, and we wondered if there was a way to challenge that while also educating people about feminism.”Drawing on her previous puppetry experience, La Mutanta settled on taxidermy mice as the conduit for her feminist message – “A friend already had them” – and made her Glastonbury debut in 2018.“This is our first time back since then, but it’s always been such a welcoming and open place,” she says. “It’s a festival that is as much about performing arts as it is about music, and we hope we can bring a bit of playful subversion to it.”Primary School BangersSaturday, 3.45pm, the Summerhouse stageView image in fullscreen‘Feel no shame and belt it out!’Photograph: Sarah Phillips/The GuardianOne of the biggest success stories of Glastonbury 2025 is the primary school music teacher James Partridge’s Primary School Bangers. A singalong session of assembly hymns and other nostalgic fare, Partridge went viral for his 2024 performance at the festival. This year, he took over the entire Summerhouse stage on Thursday night.His Saturday afternoon slot is decidedly more relaxed; he works his way through crowdpleasers such as Give Me Oil in My Lamp and He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands on the piano as a seated crowd joins in passionately. “The assembly hall singalong has died out somewhat for kids today, but these songs have such powerful nostalgia for millennials like me,” the 34-year-old says.With five performances booked for 2025, it feels as if Primary School Bangers could become a Glastonbury staple. “It’s the festival that kicked everything off for me and I think the show is the perfect way to spend part of your day here,” he says. “There’s nothing better than pure joy, nostalgia and singalongs – feel no shame and belt it out!”Los Fuckin Surfer SmokersSunday, 1.30am,the Hive stageView image in fullscreen‘We came all the way from Bogotá to be here.’Photograph: Digby FoxCalifornia surf music andColombian cumbia rhythmsmay not seem the most likely match, but for the psychedelic band Los Fuckin Surfer Smokers it proves to be a potent blend. During their late-night set at the tiny Hive stage, a few dozen revellers bounce around to wailing guitars and twanging melodies, celebrating a debut at the festival that has been a goal since their formation in 2017.“We came all the way from Bogotá to be here and have planned the European tour around it,” says Sergio Arias, the guitarist. “We’ve always admired Glastonbury for being such an open space for people to discover music, and even though it’s tough and expensive for us to get here, it’s a milestone we’ve wanted to do since we began as buskers.”Although the crowd mills and disperses throughout their hour-long slot, a closing mix of spaghetti western music with Beach-Boys-style surf and rockabilly injects energy into the remaining audience members. “There is a lot happening in the world; everyone is so anxious and worried. We just want people to jump into the concert and enjoy themselves,” says Arias. “You can take a bit of that joy with you into the future.”Old Man VegasSunday, 10.30am,the Hive stageView image in fullscreen‘I made a woman cry with a poem.’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAt a tiny stage in the north-east corner of Glastonbury, Old Man Vegas, AKA 53-year-old Jason Butler, can be found on Sunday morning, blending on-the-spot storytelling with bantering crowd work that keeps bleary-eyed passersby engaged.A hip-hop MC turned improv poet, Butler has a knack for conjuring delightful verses on the spot, including a 10-minute-long ditty about an office-working giraffe who becomes a tennis star, concocted from multiple crowd shoutouts.“Glastonbury is where I started doing improv poetry – since it’s such an open-minded crowd, you’re free to experiment,” he says, still breathless after his set. “This is the seventh or eighth festival I’ve played and I always come as a worker, as that way it’s easier to blag slots on the smaller stages.” As well as performing, Butler is manning a service gate.He spends his free time wandering around the fields, chatting to punters and offering to write poems for them. “It’s such a beautiful way to make a real connection,” he says. “I did one yesterday and it made the woman I wrote it for cry. Glastonbury might be a place where people come to let loose for four days, but it’s also an amazing chance to come together and have a meaningful experience.”Lekiddo, Lord of the Lobsters!Sunday, 2.15pm, the Gateway stageView image in fullscreen‘Feel the lobster love!’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“Show me your claws!” Lekkido, Lord of the Lobsters, commands. Immediately, a crowd of at least 50 people in the Theatre field lift their arms in the air to make pincer movements with their hands, snipping at the sky.Over the next half-hour, Lekiddo pumps through crustacean-themed electro-pop songs (and even a Christmas number in 30C/86F heat), encouraging people to look out for each other, leave no trace on the farmland and, of course, show those claws.“I’ve been coming to Glastonbury every year since 2009,” Lekiddo says. “It’s the people that bring me back every time. Everyone’s having fun, they want to get involved and they feel the lobster love I bring.”It’s unclear what Lekkido’s lobster connection is or where it came from. He simply states: “One day the lobsters chose me,” but the backstory matters little since his crowd is fervent, queueing up to meet him and show their pincers once the show is done.“It’s an honour to be here and I’ll keep coming back,” he says. “As long as the lobsters will have me.”Twat UnionSunday, 10.30pm, ScissorsView image in fullscreen‘We’re excited to get silly!’Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThroughout the course of their hour-long Sunday night performance at the queer venue Scissors, the feminist pop punk group Twat Union will go through five costume changes, an entire carton of cranberry juice (downed by saxophonist Beth Hopkins) and bring out props including a vibrator, a drill and a broomstick.“It’s incredible to be performing our theatrical comedy music at one of the biggest festivals in the world, on a stage adorned with a giant pair of open legs,” says Kate Mac, the singer, before their set. “It’s our first Glastonbury, so we don’t quite know what to expect, but we’re excited to get silly with the crowd and make people engage with feminism in the process.”The band will be working through satirical songs from their recently released debut EP that reference UTIs (hence the cranberry juice), red flags in relationships and stereotypical depictions of women in bands, hoping to draw in punters who aren’t already distracted by clashing headline slots from Olivia Rodrigo and the Prodigy. “We’re one member down this weekend, so we’re going to give it our all and can’t wait to hopefully come back,” says Alice Rivers, the keyboardist. “We’ll be full twats at Glastonbury then.”This article was amended on 30 June 2025. The Los Fuckin Surfer Smokers’ guitarist quoted is Sergio Arias, not his bandmate Alejandro Reverend as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rainforest scenes of parrots, anacondas and jaguars that he and his brothers used to sell to riverboat tourists for a dollar apiece have given way to visions of a landscape that is darker, more despoiled and more desperate than it was six decades ago.However, as his first solo internationalexhibition– at the Whitworth in Manchester – will show, the old beauties and mysteries have not faded completely. His work is populated by shape-shifting spirits, mermaids waltzing with pink river dolphins, enormous pipe-smoking lizards and shamans who trap their adversaries in rum bottles, but they exist alongside depictions of the genocidal crimes of the past and the ecocidal crimes of the present. Oil refineries are consumed by fire, rubber trees weep tears of sap, forest spirits are displaced by drought, and memories of a century-old slaughter – replete with torn and branded flesh – echo through the forest and down the generations.Some were thrown into a hole​ 15 metres deep. Others had an ear hacked off“When I was a child, there was a huge abundance of animals and fish in the Amazon,” says the 65-year-old Indigenous Peruvian painter, when we meet in Madrid, ata joint exhibition of work by him and his partner Nereyda López. “There was a lot of land to make into farmsteads and there were a lot of animals to hunt. But people have come and taken land – hectares of land, kilometres of land – and they’ve come for the wood andthe gold, too.”The artist and his family are all too aware of what happens when the Amazon attracts the greedy gaze of the outside world. Today, they are the last 12 members of the White Heron clan of the Uitoto nation still living inPeru. Just over a century ago, Yahuarcani’s grandfather, then 16, was forced from Colombia to Peru during the genocide that was waged against the Indigenous population of the Putumayo region during the rubber boom. The painter was five or six when he learned what had happened at La Chorrera rubber station.View image in fullscreenRiver dance … Untitled.Photograph: CRISIS Gallery/© Santiago Yahuarcani“My grandfather would call us together at night and tell us about the era of rubber,” he says. “He told us how the bosses arrived with rifles and started to force the Indigenous people to collect the sap of trees for rubber. They demanded 50kg of sap from each person every two to three weeks. They gave them the materials they needed to get the sap and they gave them food, but not enough food.”Anyone coming back with less than 50kg was punished. Some were thrown into a hole​ 15 metres deep. Others had an ear hacked off. “There was also a guy, my grandfather told me, who’d make everyone watch​ as he cut off a lump of your fles​h with a knife. They wanted to scare people so they’d get their 50 kilos.”Then came the time when the bosses decided to plant sugar cane, coffee and corn for the women to harvest. “These women worked with their babies on their backs,” says Yahuarcani. “One baby started to cry because of the heat of the sun. The overseers came and took the little boy from his mother’s back and threw him on the fire.​”My grandfather told me the butterflies were the spirits of the victims, of the people who had been burnedWhen the inevitable uprising took place, the response was characteristically barbaric. Men, women and children were burned alive in a large house where they had sought refuge. Those who escaped the flames were shot. “My grandfather told me that, a month after the fire, thousands of butterflies of a kind never before seen in the Amazon began to sprout from the site,” says Yahuacari. “All different kinds of butterflies with all different kinds of colours. My grandfather told me they were the spirits of the victims, of the people who had been burned.”Those atrocities are recounted in one painting – called The Stone-Hearted Man – that shows gangs of pale men in white hats and with pistols in their belts branding, decapitating and burning their way across a stretch of rainforest that has become a hell.All around them are the charred and broken bodies of Indigenous people.A century later, the rainforest is once again besieged. “Today, Indigenous groups are having to fight back,” says Yahuarcani. “We have to fight to protect our vegetation, our trees and to reforest.” But the odds are not in their favour. While more and more outsiders are coming to the Amazon in search of land, timber, gold and oil, many of the region’s young people are abandoning their homes in search of education and employment. Respect for the rainforest is dwindling.View image in fullscreen‘I show our myths, our problems’ … Yahuarcani.Photograph: Julia Moro, courtesy Crisis GalleryWhenever they set out to hunt or fish, the Uitoto make an offering to the guardian of the forest animals: “He’s small and furry like a monkey and has the face of an 80-year-old person.” And, unlike the logging and mining corporations, they never take more than they need. “In the Amazon,” he says, “when we want to eat, we go to our supermarket – it’s in the mountains, in the jungle, where there are fish and fruits. You bring home what you need and you don’t destroy everything. God has said that man should not destroy nature, he should take care of it, because it is his home, too. You can’t destroy your own house.”If the artist’s subject matter has changed over the years, his techniques have not. Yahuarcani has always created his works by applying paint prepared from pigments, seeds, leaves and roots, to large sheets ofllanchama,a cloth made from the bark of theojétree. His works are often inspired by the hallucinations brought on by the ritual ingestion of tobacco, coca, ayahuasca and mushrooms – substances long used by the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon when in search of help, knowledge or revelation.While gettingllanchamarequires the skills he learned from his bark-cutter grandfather, the use of hallucinogens harnesses and honours the cosmology, myths and traditions of Yahuarcani’s people as he strives to draw attention to the threats they and the forest face. Perhaps the greatest of those menaces is indifference. Yahuarcani’s home town of Pebas, which lies on a bend in the river as it meanders from north-east Peru towards Colombia, is as far removed as it could be from the artistic, political and media centres of the coastal capital, Lima. As a result, getting his work and its messages noticed has been a struggle.Yahuarcani is polite but insistent as he reflects on the difficulties that he and other Indigenous artists – not least his son Rember - experience when it comes to visibility and exhibition space. “I use my work to show our myths,” he says. “How our culture used to be, how we came to have the problems we now have. But it’s been very tough because we were from the Amazon and we were Indigenous. We weren’t allowed to exhibit in the museums, or do the interviews, because we were always put to one side.” Artists from Lima “have always had more opportunities and more press”.Part of the problem, he says, lies in Peru’s own view of its culture and history. “When we were in school, we were taught about the Incas. About how the Incas built Machu Picchu, and so on. But there was nothing about us or our history, and that’s been one of our complaints. Our stories aren’t in the textbooks.” Yet he is adamant that this is a history people need – and want – to know about. When he exhibited a picture of the Putumayo atrocities in Lima ​a decade ago, “the newspapers and the magazines were saying, ‘Look at this! Look at this!’ But the authorities were not at all interested.”View image in fullscreenFantastical worlds … an untitled work from 2016.Photograph: CRISIS Gallery/© Santiago YahuarcaniYahuarcani has been buoyed by the enthusiastic reaction to the Madrid show – even if it has meant braving the heat and chaos of the Spanish summer. He hopes the Manchester exhibition will be equally well received. But the recognition has been as hard won as it has been belated. Time is running out and, as one of his recent works plainly shows, the Amazon is changing rapidly and irrevocably. Painted earlier this year, Optic Fibre in the Depths of the Amazon River is a riotous, funny and faintly disturbing picture that shows dolphins, frogs, fish and turtles clutching mobile phones as technology reaches ever farther into the rainforest. One or two of the smarter fish are ringing their friends to let them know where the fishers are gathered so they can avoid them.The current cycle of expansion, encroachment and exploitation appears unstoppable. And if the forest goes then so does a branch of the Uitoto, their way of life, and their half-forgotten history. “I hope Peru will do something about these issues,” says Yahuarcani. “That there will be a book of these stories so young people can learn what happened to their grandparents. Today, we are the only family of the White Heron clan. There are no more.

It’s a tragedyStuart HeritageMon 30 Jun 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 18.12 EDTShareSpoiler warning: before we start, I need to make it clear that I’m about to discuss the ending ofSquid Game. If you haven’t seen it yet, stop reading now. But if you have seen it, my goodness – what the hell just happened?We knew the signs weren’t great going into the final season. Prior to its release, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk – a man who takes his role so seriously that he lost eight teeth during the production due to stress – said that the series wouldn’t have a happy ending, going as far as calling it “bleak”.But it’s only in the final couple of minutes of the final episode that the bleakness revealed itself. Shave those off and you could argue that Squid Game concluded on something vaguely upbeat. True, this is all within the parameters of the programme’s moral universe – very few shows could murder 500 people, let the baddies get away with it and still be considered uplifting – but if you lay all the elements out, then a happy ending is what it was.View image in fullscreenA newborn becomes the unlikely focus of the final round in Squid Game.Photograph: NetflixBecause, in the end, Gi-hun (the player who won in season one and returned to take down the entire system) ended up making the noblest sacrifice possible. The slightly improbable introduction of a newborn baby as a numbered player brought out the worst in almost everyone. Never in television history have so many characters attempted to throw a baby off a cliff for money. So Gi-hun first became her protector and then, by killing himself to let her win the prize money, her benefactor. In his final moments, his actions went some way to making up for being a horrible absentee father to his own daughter.But more than that, it gave him an ideological victory over the Front Man. For the last two seasons, the two had been locked in an argument over the nature of humanity. Gi-hun saw people as good-intentioned and collaborative, while the Front Man wanted to demonstrate that we are all violently self-interested. But Gi-hun’s decision to kill himself so a baby could thrive seemed to unlock something in the Front Man. After the finale, he collected the baby, delivered it to the people he knew would keep her safe, and gave her a life of unimaginable wealth. And when he delivered Gi-hun’s belongings to his estranged daughter in Los Angeles, he seemed to be genuinely grieving the death of his worldview. So in that respect, the good guys won. There is hope for humanity after all. A happy ending.But then came the bleakness. Because as the Front Man was driving away, he saw something he’d only ever seen on the streets of Seoul: a suited figure flinging a cardboard square to the ground, then slapping a stranger across the face. This, as any good Squid Game fan will know, is how players are recruited to the game. Only this time the recruiter was Cate Blanchett.View image in fullscreenYes, that really is Cate Blanchett – and yes, she’s recruiting!Photograph: NetflixThere she was, an Oscar-winning actor, one of the world’s best, coming out of absolutely nowhere, slapping strangers in the face in what has to qualify as the least-expected cameo of all time. Her appearance was so out of the blue that you probably spent the entire length of the credits contemplating its meaning. On one hand, to watch it was to realise that Squid Games happen across the world all the time, and that we are all pawns at the mercy of the callous billionaires who control our lives. On the other hand: yikes, Cate Blanchett must really need the money.‘People like happy endings. Sorry!’ Squid Game’s brutal finale hits new heights of barbarityRead moreBefore the season began, the expectation was always that Hollywood would find a way to encroach on to Squid Game. When I interviewed the actors who playedseason one’s VIPs– the masked westerners who would bet on the outcome of each game – their assumption was that they wouldn’t return for subsequent seasons because the show would be able to hire George Clooney or Brad Pitt. In the end that didn’t come to pass, perhaps because Squid Game preferred the idea of lobbing in one of the world’s most recognisable women for a gratuitously inconsequential hello at the end.Of course, the truth of Blanchett’s appearance is that Netflix isn’t done with the programme yet. At the end of the year, the streamer is going to start making Squid Game: America, an English-language remake of the show written by Dennis Kelly and directed by David Fincher.And that’s the real unhappy ending. Squid Game is a global sensation, the most-watched TV show in Netflix history. And yet that isn’t enough. We live in a world where a property like Squid Game cannot just ride off into the sunset. Instead, it has to be exploited until its back breaks and everyone starts to resent it for outstaying its welcome. That’s why Cate Blanchett showed up at the end. And that’s why it’s the bleakest ending imaginable.Explore more on these topicsSquid GameTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This show is truly vomit-inducingIn this astonishing and gross series, we stand witness as teams battle to clean up blood, guts and body fluids. Viewer discretion is very much advised – there will be maggotsLucy ManganMon 30 Jun 2025 18.05 EDTShareIt has been a while since we had a good, honest point-and-boke documentary, is it not? “Boke”, for those of you unfamiliar with the term, means to be sick. I use it here because the onomatopoeia gives a better sense of the fight that precedes the act, especially if – say – a programme is unspooling in front of you that keeps the nausea building until you are past the point of no return. Viewer discretion – and a plastic bowl – is advised.So, then, to Crime Scene Cleaners, a 10-part documentary – yes, 10! – that does exactly what it says on the tin. It follows teams from British and American companies as they move in after bodies have been removed and evidence bagged and tagged by police to clean up anything left behind. “Anything” can mean blood – spattered, accumulated in the bottom of a bath tub, trailed along a floor, soaked into a carpet, stained into grouting, arterially sprayed along skirting boards. Hepatitis B, we are informed via a dramatic voiceover, can survive for up to seven days in dried blood, hepatitis C for up to six weeks on hard surfaces. Clever pathogens.“Anything” can also mean faeces. “Anything” can mean body fluids – the worst phrase in the English language – that have leaked from “every hole in your body” during “natural decomposition” into a mattress, perhaps, or on to the floor, if your death has gone undiscovered for long enough. They may coalesce around the legs of a bedside table and leave marks when a team shifts the furniture to start returning the house to a saleable condition. “Anything” will almost certainly mean maggots (“they can be quite voracious”), flies and an overwhelming stench. “I can’t describe it,” says Lauren Baker, the hands-on founder of LIT Biohazard & Trauma Cleaning Specialists. “But, once you’ve smelled it, you’re not going to want to smell it again.” Noted. So very noted.We watch Baker and her team deal with the consequences of an unattended death in a bungalow in Kent. They are not told anything about the scene, although viewers are invited to wonder about the possibility of foul play by the attention the programme pays to a smashed window. The information that this was how the police gained access to the home is withheld until the last minute, which adds the necessary touch of manipulation without which no essentially voyeuristic documentary is complete. Baker opens the window to let the departed’s spirit out – an ancient touch in a room now full of modern equipment and chemical cleaning sprays – and they get to work.In the US, life is a little different. Victor Robles, the owner of Bioclean in Los Angeles, reminisces about the time his company had to clean up a mile-long blood trail by morning. It took 60 man-hours, but they got it done. We see them take a call from a landlord to a property in which most of the blood patterns described earlier can be found. We learn that blood cannot simply be sluiced down the plughole of a bath or shower – it must be soaked up, bagged and disposed of safely. They take up the carpets quickly: “You want to avoid saturation below floor level.” We are told that all of this was the result of an accidental injury, which the tenant survived. Americans are either a lot tougher or they come with extra blood.Over in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Larry Douglas – a former detective and now the owner of Xtreme Cleaners– muses on what life has taught him. “In 22 year,” he says, “I’ve never found an intact eyeball, because they’re so fragile.”One of his teams is given a car to decontaminate. They seem to be suiting and booting up to an excessive degree – until we learn that the car was used to transport fentanyl,the synthetic opioidthat is scything through the US and which is so potent that if you breathe in airborne particles of the stuff, you can overdose and die. A simple traffic stop can become fatal for an officer if they disturb the wrong goods in the boot. We see bodycam footage of them being overcome and saved by their colleagues. It is astonishing. But you live and learn, don’t you? And then die, hopefully peacefully and not alone.Crime Scene Cleaners is available on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Jurassic World film series had looked to be pretty much extinct after some increasingly dire dollops of franchise content:Fallen Kingdom in 2018andDominion in 2022. But now, against all odds, these dinosaurs have had a brand refresh: a brighter, breezier, funnier, incomparably better acted and better written film, with unashamed nods to the summer smashes of yesteryear, that makes sense of the dino-spectacle moments that earn their place.Screenwriter David Koepp and director Gareth Edwards have been drafted in to take us back to basics with a new story, all butretconningthe drama with a “17 years previously” flashback at the start that entirely (and thankfully) ignores the tiresome convoluted dullness of what has recently happened. Then we’re in the present day, when the existence of dinosaurs in the wild is accepted but they’ve all pretty much died out – except in and around the lush fictional Île Saint Hubert in the Caribbean.A creepy corporation (is there any other kind?) has discovered that dinosaur blood has the makings of a profitable medicine, so odious big pharma smoothie Martin Krebs, played by Rupert Friend, assembles a crack special forces team to take a blood sample from each of three types of dinosaur – land, sea and air. Zora Bennett, played byScarlett Johansson, is the ex-military type running the show; bespectacled palaeontologist Dr Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) provides the scientific expertise; and Mahershala Ali brings megawatt charm to the role of Duncan Kincaid, the easy-going boat captain. They and the rest of the crew chance across a family at sea. The dad, Reuben Delgado, is played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and this group have a kind of separate, parallel adventure, providing the conventional family-bond narrative beats.We get all the traditional moments, including some classic Jurassic slow turns: a cast member will be doing something, hear a dinosaur behind (which we can see) and then, aghast, will execute a slow swivel, after which we cut to a hilarious closeup on their suitably gobsmacked expression. We also get a classic Jurassic security guy (played by Ed Skrein), like a Star Trek redshirt, whose job is arrogantly shooting at dinosaurs and who meets an obvious comeuppance.There is some terrific romcom chemistry between Johansson and Bailey. Johansson’s Zora seems to have a tendresse for this shy intellectual – a bit like the crush her character Natasha Romanoff had on Mark Ruffalo’s cerebral Dr Bruce Banner in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It’s a very different performance from the one Bailey gave in Wicked, but just as in that film, he comes close to pinching this one with his adorable high-mindedness. His Dr Loomis wants to die in a shallow sea and get covered by silt, apparently, because it’s better for creating fossils. And he has an interesting line about how intelligence as a factor in survival is overrated; the dumb dinosaurs were around for 165m years and smart humans so far only 300,000.This new Jurassic adventure isn’t doing anything so very different from the earlier successful models, perhaps, and I could have done without its outrageous brand synergy product placement for certain brands of chocolate bar. But it feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs. Maybe the series can’t and shouldn’t go on for ever: we need new and original ideas. This one would be great to go out on.Jurassic WorldRebirth is out on 2 July in the US and UK, and on 3 July in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsJurassic WorldScarlett JohanssonMahershala AliJonathan BaileyreviewsShareReuse this content"

When we were trying to get it on the radio, one station said it was too intelligent and they wouldn’t play it’As told toBen CardewMon 30 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 11.32 EDTShareWookie, producerPeople say Battle reminds them of some really good years for Britain as a country. We were entering a new millennium, everyone was running their own business, making money and the underground record industry was thriving. I wanted to do a UK garage version ofSouthern Freeez, by the 80s UK funk band Freeez. Initially, Battle was going to be another instrumental, and then Lain, the singer, came in the room and goes: “Let me put something on this.” I was like: “I’m not sure it’s really a vocal song.” But Lain stacked the vocals, and someone compared it to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, with all the harmonies.At the time, some people believed that I had copied a dubplate by [UK garage figure] DJ EZ. It is similar – his bassline doessomethinglike that. But I know I didn’t copy him, because I didn’t go out that much! So I’d never really heard EZ at that stage.I didn’t know Battle was going to be as big as it was or have the impact it did – it was just another tune. Then it started to float around: a few DJs had it, the A&R people. Ears started to prick up. I think we added a level of sophistication to garage, even though people like MJ Cole and TJ Cases were already doing that. When we were trying to get Battle on the radio, one station said it was too intelligent for their listeners and they wouldn’t play it.Battle eventually reached No 10 in August 2000. Louise Redknapp got the No 9 spot by 2,000 copies. It allowed me to appear on a TV show that I had watched my whole life as I was growing up: Top of the Pops.A lot of people say: “Oh, garage is on the comeback.” But for me, it has been for the last 13 years. I started DJing in 2012 and every year I’m working. It’s been well received by a wider audience ever since, younger and younger.Lain, singerJason Chue, AKA Wookie, was knocking about in jungle, drum’n’bass, trying to siphon off that whole energy and then putting songs to it.I remember him saying about Battle: “I’ve done something strange with the intro.” I was like: “No, just play it.” He was almost apologising for it – but it was like a godsend. That intro had such an urgency. It felt like it was piercing your soul. I said: “Give me a minute.” Then I walked out and I don’t even know if it was half an hour, but I came back and I had written all of the vocal. That’s divine. For the song title we wanted one word. There are a lot of three-word titles, but one word is strong. Whether it’s bringing up three kids on your own, or addiction, everyone’s battling through something, every day.One guy had a Maserati and blew out his speakers playing itPeople call Battle a gospel song. Back then I was doing a lot of regular R&B but I really wanted to do something that involved my faith. When Jazzie B [founder of Soul II Soul and mentor to Wookie] called me about working with Jason, I thought he was going to say: “No, we don’t want that.” But he said: “Just go for it.” We had all these record label bosses trying to sign Battle – one guy had a Maserati and he blew out his speakers playing it. Months later he said: “I didn’t realise I was blowing out my speakers to a gospel tune.”I first realised Battle was going to be big at [seminal UK garage night] Twice As Nice. Jason said: “You should come down to Twice As Nice because I think this tune’sgoing.” I was a bit worried because I don’t really go out. So they played the tune and everyone started going: “Booooo!” OK, that’s not a good sign. But Jason was like, “No, no, no – that means they really like it!”Battle has endured because of what it means to the person who hears it. Back then, we would do PAs and people would say: “That song – my mum was going through cancer and that helped me.” And, 25 years later, someone said: “While I was in prison, that song got me through.” That’s everyone. That’sanyone.I remember Jason sending me a picture of someone who tattooed the middle eight of Battle on her forearm: “I can always rely / On my faith to get by.”Wookie’s new single Back 2 Us (ft Kyno) is out nowExplore more on these topicsDance musicHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The creasing of a paperback in one hand, the weight of a wine glass in the other, the feeling of being alone in a crowd of people all make for a lovely evening. Or at least, I thought so, until recently, when two twentysomethings approached me during this ritual. “Are youreading alone?” one asked. “I could neverrrr,” the other said, and then uttered the universal mean girl slight: “I wish I hadyourconfidence.”Reading in public – not cool. Or at least “performative reading”, as it’s been dubbed on social media, is worthy of ridicule.Not long ago, during the peak years of corny millennial humor, we celebrated @HotDudesReading, an Instagram account-turned-book that showed attractive men toting books on trains and park benches. Now, God forbid anyone (hot dudes included) enjoy a moment of escapism during the capitalist grind, or else they might end up in someone’s mocking post. To quote thecaptionof one popular meme depicting an anonymous train passenger reading a Brit lit classic: “Poser art himbo on the subway barely 10 pages into his performative copy of Frankenstein.”We can’t even indulge in an innocent hobby without it being considered some sort of aesthetic curationIt’s called performative reading not just because someone might be pretending to read, but rather that they want everyone toknowthey read. The presumption is that they’re performing for passersby, signaling they have the taste and attention span to pick up a physical book instead of putting in AirPods. And we’re not talking about Colleen Hoover’s latest or a romantasy title; the books that qualify are capital “L” literature: Faulkner, Nabokov, Franzen. The heavier the better.Of course, it requires a deeply broken brain to be this bothered by a stranger’s summer reading list. Chalk this obsession with performative reading up to a wariness of personal branding. We can’t even indulge in an innocent hobby without it being considered some sort of aesthetic curation.Last month, Hailey Bieber poked fun at her vapid image in aVogue TikTok, in which she pulled out The Portable Nietzsche (“I love this one, probably my fourth or fifth time reading it, so good”) and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason (“been taking a lot of notes from this one”). The hosts of the Run-Through, Vogue’s official podcast, latercalledthe post “satire”. Another win for the books-as-props community.Ten years ago, John Waters’s famous quote about how if you go home with someone and they don’t have books, “don’t fuck ’em” came printed on tote bags. Now, is the prevailing wisdom that anyone who dares read the newborn-sized Infinite Jest during their lunch break an absolute loser? I decided to find out in my own personal mini-odyssey.The performative reading canon spans many titles and genres, and I thought about using Robert Caro’s The Power Broker, Moby-Dick or The Bell Jar in this experiment. Ultimately, I chose Infinite Jest, because it clocks in at over just 1,000 pages, I’ve never met a person who had finished it, and at many times I’ve considered picking it up but reconsidered simply because I did not want to be the dude on the subway reading Infinite Jest. I found a $9 copy at my neighborhood bookstore in Brooklyn and braced myself for what I was sure would be abject humiliation courtesy of the gen Z cashier. Instead, she asked if I needed a bag.“I think so – it’s kind of heavy,” I said, propping it on my hip dramatically as if it were a small child. She nodded for the person behind me in line to step forward with the apathy of someone who’s not being paid enough for this.On the train, I held the behemoth in front of my face, angling so the woman with groceries across from me could not help but notice that I was Better Than Her. As I peeked over the page, I tried to clock any annoyance. But, tragically, she had things to worry about other than my reading list.‘It’s so boring’: gen Z parents don’t like reading to their kids – and educators are worriedRead moreWhen I got to Washington Square Park, the unofficial campus center of New York University and general young person shenanigans hub, I waited to be caught in the act, secretly filmed for a TikTok ridiculing my performance. Again, no one cared – except for a gen X man who sat on the park bench next to me, exactly the type of guy who might consider David Foster Wallace a modern-day saint. He politely asked how I was doing with the book. I told him I was 20 pages in and hadn’t quite hit footnote hell yet. He said to keep going and suggested that I literally cut the book into thirds to make it more manageable. (Apparently this is common knowledge among Wallacesupport groupsthat have popped up through the years.)After I thanked him and went back to reading, a crazy thing happened: I enjoyed myself. One of life’s simplest pleasures is falling into a story and tuning the world out. But to get there, you have to stop worrying about what someone’s going to think of you – or whether you’ll unwittingly end up in a bitchy TikTok. And as far as I know, I didn’t.All the finger-wagging about performative reading raises the question: wherearewe supposed to read the classics? Can it only be done at home, like a secret bad habit? For people who take public transit, especially trains with spotty wifi, commuting can be the only time when we have an hour or so to totally focus on a book (and on not missing our stop). So the next time you see one of us reading at a bar, coffee shop or the park, please leave us alone. This is not for you; we’re just enjoying the vibes.It’s a scary time to be someone who cherishes the written word. The country is in the midst of a literarycrisis. We’retoldby college professors that students can’t read entire books any more, that gen Z parentsdon’t like reading to their kids, that smartphonesruinedour ability to focus on anything longer than 30 seconds, that AI slop will take over publishing. Don’t be a chump. Read everywhere, and read often.And maybe there’s still some steeze that comes from flexing an “important” book. When I posted on Instagram about reading Infinite Jest in public, a friend told me she once went to a “nudist” spa in Portland where she encountered a guy reading the book in a jacuzzi. “He had the biggest penis I’ve ever seen in my life,” she wrote. “It wasn’t a performance, it was promotion.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleClassicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In short, Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson are apparently dead, having been shot out of the sky by a double agent. Vin Diesel seems certain to die, having ended the film at the bottom of a dam that Jason Momoa just exploded. And Gal Gadot is back. And the Rock is back.All these threads need to be resolved urgently. And yet, Fast X was a box-office disappointment. The fourth most expensive film ever made, Fast X was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2023 and still managed to lose $20m. And suddenly the prospects of a sequel looked dimmer and dimmer. Or at least they did, untilVin Dieselstumbled across a foolproof plan to revive the franchise forever: human resurrection.This weekend, Diesel appeared at FuelFest, a car enthusiast event in California. During his speech, Diesel gave an insight into howFast and Furious11 could make people excited about the series again. “The studio said to me, ‘Vin, can we please have the finale of Fast and Furious [in] April 2027?’ I said, ‘Under three conditions.’ First is to bring the franchise back to LA! The second thing was to return to the car culture, to the street racing! The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O’Conner.”Now, within the context of Fast X, none of these things make sense. You cannot make a film where Rome gets nuked and Spain is devastated by a 30bn-gallon dam collapse, and then pretend like none of it happened so you can make a scaled-back little car-racing film in LA. Unless Fast 11 starts with Dominic Toretto waking up in a cold sweat and growling “Woah, I thought I was involved in one of the most egregiously ugly CGI blowouts in all of movie history, but it was just a crazy dream!” then the series cannot simply reset itself like this.More worrying, though, is the promise to reunite Toretto and Brian O’Conner. This is for the simple reason that O’Conner was played byPaul Walker, and Paul Walker died 12 years ago. Needless to say, that didn’t stop them before. When Walker died, he was in the middle of making Furious 7, and production brought in his brothers to act as body doubles before VFX house Weta grafted a digital copy of Walker’s face on top of it. The results were actually fairly convincing, but this is arguably because the job was easier. The bulk of Walker’s performance had already been committed to tape, so they could carefully weave in additional shots without drawing too much attention.But bringing the character back for an entirely new performance is something else entirely. They would have to create a digital Walker from scratch, and then convincingly voice him. You don’t need to be told that it’s tough to do it well. The Star Wars series has tried it repeatedly, with everyone from Peter Cushing to Carrie Fisher, and there is always something creepily plastic about the execution. Not even turning Harold Ramis into a ghost for Ghostbusters: Afterlife could mask how off-putting he looked. And the orgy of digitally created multiverse cameos that ended The Flash was the ugliest thing to be put on screen since, well, Vin Diesel drove down the side of a dam.Surely the Fast and Furious franchise doesn’t need to debase itself by taking a beloved co-star and yanking him around like a puppet. You have to imagine that Diesel’s intention is to cut back on the full-tilt bombast and return to something with real emotional depth, but in reality that means he’ll have to spend a lot of his time emoting at a tennis ball, which doesn’t exactly scream nuance.Plus, as much as I hate to say it, people don’t go and see Fast and Furious films for emotional complexity. They go because they want to see stuff smash into other stuff, ideally when some of it is on fire. If Fast 11 wants to pay tribute to Walker, then doing it in the credits might be the best way to go. After all, it’s hard to pay tribute to a colleague when there’s an exploding dam to outrun.Explore more on these topicsFilmVin DieselAction and adventure filmsPaul WalkerFast and FuriouscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s such a stirring, sinewy antidote to despair that I want to prescribe it to everyone. Solnit stares unflinchingly at the facts of our age – Trump, Gaza, climate catastrophe, the assault on truth – and argues for the power of uncertainty as opposed to foregone conclusions. Yes, the future looks bleak, but that does not mean we are doomed. Only giving up guarantees that. Instead, persevere.The Safekeep, whichwon this year’s Women’s prizefor fiction, is an extraordinarily accomplished first novel from the Dutch author Yael van der Wouden. Set in the Netherlands 16 years after the end of the second world war, it is an exquisite character study, a historical reckoning and a slow-burn forbidden romance.To Exist As I Am, which has just come out, is an account by a young doctor,Grace Spence Green, of being rendered paraplegic while at medical school when a man lands on her after jumping from three floors above. The collision breaks her spine in multiple places, permanently paralysing her from the waist down. To anyone thinking “not another medical memoir”, please know that this immersive, deeply moving book is so much more than a meditation on learning medicine. Spence Green’s physical injuries are severe enough, but she also has to contend with the million microaggressions and forms of systematic exclusion that disabled people face in modern Britain. It’s a beautiful, powerful, indelible read.The Story of a Heart by Rachel Clarkeis published by Abacus (£10.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

As he did inRestless, Boyd makes the spy story fit perfectly with the individual protagonist. The action is well paced and the ending feels as if there could be a sequel … but I’m not sure Boyd would do that. Perfect holiday read!Vincenzo Latronico, authorI’ve just finished translating Tony Tulathimutte’sRejectioninto Italian – so in a way I’ve been reading it constantly for the last couple of months. It’s a book that transforms over successive readings. It is being widely celebrated – and rightfully so – for being so twistedly funny, so precise in depicting the way our digital life can warp or constrict our physical existence, and so formally inventive. But looking more closely, you realise Tulathimutte also tackles a serious question all writers are facing today: how can the novel, a form of storytelling that is linear and slow, depict a way of living that is fragmented and multiplied by technology? What use is a “scene” – things happening at a specific place and time – when, on the phones in our pockets, so many things are happening at once?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Several actors portray the title character, which is described as a “time-jumping mosaic” spanning 70 years in the life of an accountant and mother of two in Ohio.It marks a high-profile return to the stage for Sarandon, who made her Broadway debut in 1972 in An Evening with Richard Nixon and … by Gore Vidal before her breakout film role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. By the time she was next on Broadway, in Exit the King in 2009, she was a household name and five-time Oscar nominee (who won for Dead Man Walking). Sarandon said: “I’m so honoured to be asked to be in a play during Matthew Warchus’s final season at the Old Vic,” adding that she was “terrified but excited”.Riseborough, similarly better known as a film star, has not acted on stage for 15 years. Her last major London role was in Ivanov opposite Kenneth Branagh at the Donmar Warehousein 2008. She recently appeared in Warchus’s screen version ofMatilda the Musical. Riseborough said: “It’s an honour to be taking on the role of Mary – amongst others – in Tracy Letts’ poignant play, alongside the extraordinary Susan Sarandon. I’m so very grateful to be working with Matthew again and thrilled to finally work at the Old Vic, a beautiful space.”Warchus called Letts “one of America’s greatest living writers” and said the play would be staged in-the-round – as will all the productions in his final season. Mary Page Marlowe will run from 23 September to 1 November.Letts is best known for his Pulitzer winner August: Osage County, which was directed by Anna D Shapiro in a Chicago Steppenwolf production that playedat London’s National Theatre in 2008. Shapiro directed the premiere of Mary Page Marlowe for the Steppenwolf theatre in 2016. In his review, the New York Times critic Charles Isherwoodwrote: “Some may find the play’s form frustrating; I found it beautiful and affecting, like flipping through a friend’s photo album in no particular order, finding some faces familiar, others unexpected. And then you come upon someone entirely unknown – who obviously meant much to your friend – and you realize, with a pang of sadness, that your knowledge of even those closest to you will always be fragmentary and incomplete.”Susan Sarandon’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreThis will be the play’s UK premiere. Letts said: “From my first experiences as a playwright here 30 years ago, to the run of August: Osage County at the National, London is an integral part of my development as an artist. I’m deeply gratified to have Mary Page Marlowe at the Old Vic, directed by Matthew, featuring these remarkable actresses. A genuine thrill.”Warchus will step down from the Old Vic in September next year, when he will besucceeded by Rupert Goold, who in turn will be replaced in the top job at the Almeida theatreby Dominic Cooke.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSusan SarandonMatthew WarchusAndrea RiseboroughOld Vic TheatreWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

He also told them to refrain from sharing any details about their discussions in any future notes.Earlier on Monday, Subramanian told jurors that they were the “sole and exclusive judges of the facts” who are to determine a verdict without bias or prejudice to either of the parties involved.He emphasized that prosecutors had the burden of proving Combs is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not proof beyond any possible doubt.Combs, 55, wasarrested in Septemberand faces felony charges: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denied the accusations against him.If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison. He has been held without bail at a federal detention center in Brooklyn since his arrest.Prosecutors allege that for over two decades, Combs led a criminal enterprise, aided by employees and associates, that engaged in, attempted to engage in and worked to cover up crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, drug distribution, arson and bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.The government has sought to prove that Combs used violence, threats, money, drugs, intimidation and power to abuse and coerce two of his former girlfriends into participating in “freak-offs”, which were described as drug-fueled sex marathons with hired male escorts.The defense has insisted throughout the trial thatall sexual encounters were consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. They have argued that no criminal conspiracy exists and that Combs is being wrongly prosecuted for his “private” and “personal sex life”.Throughout the trial, Combs’s lawyers acknowledged past instances of domestic violence, but denied that Combs committed sex trafficking and that any coercion took place.Since the trial began on12 May, the jury has reviewed dozens of text messages, videos and receipts. The government called 34 witnesses to the stand, includingtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, multipleformer employeesand assistants, several male escorts, stylists, hotel workers, law enforcement agents and well-known figures such as therapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richard, among others.Key testimony came from two of Combs’s former girlfriends and alleged victims, the singerCasandra “Cassie” Venturaand awoman identified as “Jane”, both of whom described the alleged “freak-offs” in graphic detail and alleged that they were coerced into participating.They both testified that Combs directed, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed the sexual encounters.The women described times when they said Combs wasviolent with themand they alleged that Combs would threaten torelease explicit videos of themorcut off financial supportif they didn’t meet his demands.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyers sought to cast Ventura and Jane as willing and consenting participants in the “freak-offs”. Combs’s team presented loving and at times explicit text messages exchanged with Combs – some of which showed the women expressing enthusiasm for the encounters. His lawyers also frequently brought up the role that jealousy and drug use played in their relationships.Another woman, a former personal assistant who testified under the pseudonym “Mia”, alleged that Combs physically and sexually assaulted her during her employment.Defense attorneyssuggested that she fabricated the allegations, and highlighted social media posts and messages from after the alleged assaults in which Mia praised Combs, calling him a “mentor” and an “inspiration”.The governmentrested its case last week. Shortly after, Combs confirmed that he would not be testifying. His legal team also rested its case, but opted not to call any witnesses of its own. Instead, his team submitted evidence to the court and relied on its extensive cross-examinations throughout the trial.During closing arguments, the prosecutionspentnearly five hours outlining the government’s case against Combs, revisiting testimony from several witnesses, and broke down each allegation against Combs.The prosecution described him as “the leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to “take no for an answer” and alleged that he was someone who wielded “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.“The defendant was a very powerful man,” she said. “But he became more powerful and more dangerous because of the support of his inner circle and his businesses – the enterprise.”The defense offered its closing argument on Friday, and told the jurors that the government’s case against Combs was “false” and “exaggerated”.Combs’s lawyer urged the jury to reject the prosecution’s case against Combs and pushed back against the government’s accusations, disputed various pieces of witness testimony, and challenged the prosecution’s portrayal of Ventura and Jane as sex-trafficking victims.Combs’s lead lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, cast Ventura, the government’s star witness, as a woman with agency, rather than a victim, who willingly participated in the sexual encounters.The lawyer also pointed to the $20m settlement she received from Combs in 2023 after filing a civil lawsuit accusing him of abuse, which triggered the federal investigation, as well as the $10m Ventura is expected to receive from the owner of a hotel in Los Angeles where she was assaulted by Combs in 2016.“If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it’s hard not to pick Cassie,” Agnifilo said. “This isn’t about a crime, this is about money.”Though he did not take the stand, throughout the entire trial, Combs has been engaged and active in his defense, often seen whispering to his lawyers and reacting visibly to testimony.Earlier this month, the judgewarnedthat Combs could be removed from the courtroom for looking at and “nodding vigorously” at the jury during a cross-examination.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Think peak Chabon and Eugenides; the intellectual gymnastics of Helen DeWitt; the last profane and puckish gasp of Tom Robbins. That brief window – before 9/11, smartphones and the chokehold of autofiction – when the novel felt as playful as it did expansive: bold and baggy as wide-legged jeans. Joyce Carol Oates channelling Marilyn Monroe. Jonathan Franzen snubbing Oprah. You can feel that early-00s energy jostling through a new crop of American novels: Lucas Schaefer’s The Slip, Kaveh Akbar’sMartyr!and Maggie Shipstead’sGreat Circleare top-shelf examples. They’re big in all kinds of wonderful, infuriating ways: antic, overstuffed and richly peopled.While it’s less hyperactive than some of its book-fellows, Susan Choi’s Flashlight still has the wide-legged feel of turn-of-the-century fiction: domestically sprawling, geopolitically bold. Stretching from a strawberry farm in Indiana to the North Korean border, Choi’s sixth novel reckons with the lies that undo families and underpin empires.Flashlight first appeared in the New Yorker as a short story – a standoff in a psychiatrist’s office. The novel opens here too. It is the late 1970s: 10-year-old Louisa has been dragged in for a consultation, and she’s not playing nice. She waits out the clock, evading, deflecting; a tight little knot of fury. “This room is full of tricks to get children to talk, but you’re too smart for them,” the doctor flatters her. “I’m too smart for compliments,” Louisa snaps back.Louisa’s father has drowned, and her mother has turned into a strange new invalid. What the girl feels defies grief or sympathy. This isn’t mourning, it’s mutiny; and it will take more than some avuncular desk jockey to tame her. While the doctor is distracted, she steals an emergency flashlight from his office and smuggles it home – a low-stakes theft with high-voltage meaning. The night Louisa’s father disappeared into the water, he was holding a flashlight.Portentous torches will appear throughout these pages (it’s not the subtlest of metaphors for a novel about absence and secrecy). There’s one at a seance, its battery case loosened to summon some otherworldly flickering. Another at an archaeological dig in Paris. This is a story told in brief illuminations, like a child spinning a torch in a dark bedroom. Slices of light; slices of life.We begin with a flashback to Louisa’s parents, meeting them before they meet each other. Her father, Serk, an ethnic Korean raised in Japan, is a child of postwar limbo. Caught between two nations, and claimed by neither, he trades his borderland life for a blank American slate – or so he thinks (America has other ideas). Louisa’s father will be known by many names over the course of his life – Hiroshi, Seok, the Crab – but none of them will quite belong to him. Louisa will know him as Serk, an anglicised version of his Korean name.Louisa’s mother, Anne, is an obstinate, spiky creature, allergic to expectation. Pregnant at 19, she gives birth to a child she’s not permitted to keep, and her adult life shapes itself around her son’s absence, like a house built around a locked room. Louisa will inherit her mother’s bone-deep stubbornness – twin contrarians.They make an implacable, inscrutable pair, Serk and Anne; secret-keepers to the core, lonely apart and lonelier together (“Anne the odd white woman who had married the foreigner; Serk the odd foreigner who had married a white woman”). When Serk drowns, he leaves behind a silence so complete it swallows the past whole. And so Louisa is left with two absent parents: one right in front of her; the other near mythic. “The sum of things she knew about her father could fit inside the sum of things she’ll never know about him an infinite number of times,” Choi writes. “The things she knows are as meagre as a pair of backgammon dice rattling in their cup.” Flashlight is a study of absence – absence of narrative, of inheritance, of place, of affection. Who are you, it asks, when there’s no story to inherit, no history to claim? How might that void be filled, or inhabited or weaponised?It’s a year for canon building, and as the best-of-the-century (so far) lists are tallied, Choi’s previous novel, 2019’sTrust Exercise, remains firmly on mine. It begins as a high-school drama, libidinous and gossipy, but midway through, Choi triggers a controlled implosion. From the wreckage, another story emerges: one about power, authorship and blame. Truth isn’t fixed, Choi shows us here – it’s framed. I love this novel’s confident chaos, its metafictional brio.Flashlight delivers a comparable jolt – a truth-rattling rupture. We feel it building with a cruel inevitability, and when it arrives, it shifts the novel’s moral (and political) terrain. To spoil the reveal would be churlish. The question is whether the novel can withstand the shock. It can – just. Choi is one of contemporary literature’s great demolition artists, and her emotional foundations hold. She can build as well as she detonates. Choi gives her cast the room they need to live; to be more than vessels for political wrangling. The opening of Flashlight isn’t the only set piece that could stand alone – and tall – as a short story.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Choi confronts a chapter of North Korean history that American fiction has barely touched. But there is something missing. That Y2K brand of irony – glib, evasive, laddish – is gone. Good riddance to it. It’s hard to be flippant when you know which way the arc of the universe really bends.Flashlight by Susan Choi is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

Mustachioed ringleader Stefan Klincewicz, interviewed here, looks exactly like the kind of provincial accountant he originally was, neither a smooth master criminal nor a geeky Moneyball-style statistical genius. Klincewicz merely worked out that the capital needed to buy a ticket for every possible combination of the six numbers in the Lotto game would cost less than IR£1m. That strategy would significantly lower the 1 in 2m odds a punter usually faced, but only if they could manage to buy all the tickets needed.When a rollover weekend came around, making the pot worth the gamble, Klincewicz and his micro army of chancers, including teenage daughters and friends press-ganged into the effort, went to work. But the accordion-playing head of the national lottery at the time tried to foil their scheme by limiting how many tickets individuals could buy at once. The concern was that the public would feel discouraged from playing Lotto if they thought syndicates would usually win.The director, Ross Whitaker, works his way towards the inevitable conclusion, with its mixed success, by deploying lashings of 1990s TV footage, the low-resolution cinematography as endearing as the pre-millennium fashions worn by the interviewees of the time. There are clips from talkshows hosted not just by Irish institution Gay Byrne, but some of the many others, prompting the thought that Ireland must have more daytime talkshows than any other world economy of comparable size. But there is not much going on here in terms of wider contextualisation or deeper themes, just a very meat-and-potatoes, TV-friendly story of a scam played, as nearly everyone says, for “the craic”. And the money, of course.Beat the Lotto is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas, andBertha DocHouse, London, from 4 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIrelandGamblingEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is home to Islam’s first mosque, and the prophet Muhammad’s final resting place. For anyone planning a visit, this documentary about the city’s sacred sites is well worth a watch. Non-Muslims may find themselves reaching for their phones to look up terms and historical events.There is an antiquated, mildly academic feel to the voiceover, like a BBC documentary from the 1970s. It begins with a brief overview of the prophet’s migration from Mecca to Medina in 622AD, marking the start of the Islamic calendar. In the present day, the faces of pilgrims are a window into the significance of this spiritual journey for those with faith – but none are actually interviewed.The main focus of the film is a tour of the city’s landmarks: mostly mosques, but also a gleaming state-of-the-art Qur’an printing facility that produces 8m copies a year. Breathtaking aerial footage shows off the wonders of the sites, including theProphet’s Mosque, which has 250 incredible giant umbrellas that open to create a translucent roof over the courtyard when the temperature goes above 30C.There is an overly informational quality to some of the film, with the narrator listing details about the car-parking facilities of one mosque and opening times of the reading room in another. But some of these facts are admittedly astounding: it takes a staff of 6,000 to keep the Prophet’s Mosque spotless.Madina: The Enlightened City is at Cardiff Odeon on 4 July, then toursExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIslamSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is one gruesome crime-scene photo, but otherwise this could really have been based on something by Ruth Rendell. It is co-written and directed by its star Daniel Auteuil and the original French title is Le Fil (The Thread), after an incriminating thread of material found on the corpse – or perhaps it means the thread of logic behind a legal argument, the loose thread which, if pulled sufficiently, might cause the whole thing to collapse.The action is based on a case recounted byJean-Yves Moyart, a criminal defence lawyer, who blogged under the name “Maître Mô” and who died in 2021. Grégory Gadebois plays Nicolas Milik (“Ahmed” in Moyart’s blog), a devoted, careworn husband to his alcoholic wife Cécile and caring dad to five children. When Milik is accused of murdering his wife, with a local bar owner apparently an accomplice, principled lawyer Maître Monier (Auteuil) takes the case; passionately convinced of his client’s innocence but finding himself in an increasingly tense situation.An Ordinary Case is, mostly, a rather low-key movie whose incidental details of obsession and crime are oddly underplayed; the same goes for Auteuil’s rather detached performance, gliding through scenes in court and at home with his partner and fellow lawyer Maître Annie Debret (Sidse Babett Knudsen). Yet the film snaps into shape after the verdict in the final act and a tense conversation between Monier and Milik has a force that lends a retrospective charge to what has gone before; their final conversation raises the stakes yet further.This is not exactly a drama of ambiguity, like Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall: it is more old-fashioned than that. Perhaps Auteuil needed to give it more energy on both sides of the camera, yet there is a charge in its deferred revelation.An Ordinary Case is on digital platforms from 7 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, it wasn’t a big deal to have a bad gig’The standup on surviving heart failure, gigging on cruise ships and how a Tom Hanks gag saved him from his worst heckleInterview byLiam PapeMon 30 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 30 Jun 2025 03.02 EDTShareWhat’s your new show about?My biggest fear was dying on stage and then I nearly died for real, on stage. Suddenly, it wasn’t a big deal to have a bad gig or tell a joke that doesn’t work. Going through heart failure changed my perspective. We all know we’re going to die, but none of us believe it. That’s why we do stupid stuff like bungee jumping. We take so many risks. But when you’re actually faced with your own mortality and get a second chance, everything suddenly feels like a bonus – all the things I would have missed. This show is a lot more honest than I’ve ever been.What was difficult about turning such a personal experience into comedy?Being able to say it out loud without breaking. Even though this happened five years ago, a lot of what’s in the show has taken me that long to process to the point where I can actually talk about it on stage. It doesn’t necessarily get easier, it just becomes more necessary. When I previewed it, people really connected with certain parts, things hit home.How did you get into comedy?It was through a friend of mine who used to attend the dance class I taught at Pineapple Studios. She was given a comedy course for her birthday and I went to watch her perform at theComedyPub in central London. After a couple of drinks, she convinced me I should go and do an open mic night. From the first joke I told, I thought: “Yeah, this is me.”What’s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?The first time I did Live at the Apollo, because that was the goal. When everyone asked what I wanted to do, I told them: Live at the Apollo, within five years of starting comedy. A lot of people told me I couldn’t do it. I did it in six years, but that’s including the pandemic.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?During lockdown Jason Manford started organising Zoom gigs to help comedians get work. It was one of the first ones; 2,000 people on this Zoom call. I’m nervous anyway, but before I’ve got a chance to overthink it, I hear him say, “And welcome to the stage … Emmanuel Sonubi.” I started my set and everyone’s really laughing. I’m thinking, “Wow, maybe I’m really good at Zoom gigs.” Then my watch started buzzing so much that I needed to glance down. It was Jason: “Turn your mic on, mate.” I’d been going for three or four minutes!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a split second I decided to bring everyone back in the room and make a joke out of it. So I said: “Mate, I look nothing like Tom Hanks.” And the room just exploded.You’ve gigged on cruise ships – what’s the best part?Not travelling everywhere. Even though the ship does obviously travel, I’m not having to sit on the M4! It’s a week’s worth of gigs, where you don’t have to drive up and down the country. You get a real test of whether your material works because one I did recently had an average age of 76, and it was a mixture of American and English people. If you can get it to work there, it works in the clubs.Any pre-show rituals?I go to the toilet about 12 or 15 times. I try to always watch the audience, just to get a sense of who’s in the room because I never actually plan my set until I’m about to walk on stage. I want to keep it as natural as I can.Emmanuel Sonubi: Life After Near Death is atPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 30 July-25 August, andon touruntil 30 NovemberExplore more on these topicsComedyComedy Q&AEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is now marking the 103rd anniversary of the calamity by adding freshly recovered material that takes in the Anglo-Norman conquest and the 1798 rebellion and a genealogical trove from 19th-century censuses.View image in fullscreenNotebooks containing transcriptions made by genealogists and historians of the 19th-century census before it was destroyed by fire in 1922.Photograph: Chris Bellew/Fennell Photography“It’s a very significant scale of data,” said Peter Crooks, a Trinity historian and academic director of the project. “It’s an enormous stretch of time from the 13th century up to the 19th century. The scale of what can be brought in, in terms of reconstruction, continues to amaze me.”Once the envy of scholars around the world, the six-storey Public Record Office at the Four Courts by the River Liffey contained priceless troves dating from medieval times. It wasobliteratedas troops of the fledgling Irish state battled former comrades hunkered in the building.Lost Irish history reclaimed  in immersive 3D experienceRead moreIt was long assumed that all was lost but the project enlisted 75 archives and libraries inIreland, the UK and around the world to source transcripts and duplicates of documents, many of which had lain, forgotten, in storage. The latest troves to be catalogued and digitised bring the total to 350,000 records and 250m words of searchable Irish history.Patrick O’Donovan, the culture minister, said international collaboration underpinned the “riches” that had been rediscovered. “It offers an invaluable historical resource for people of all ages and traditions across the island of Ireland and abroad, and democratises access so that our shared history is more accessible and engaging for everyone.”The project has fused old-fashioned academic investigation, artificial intelligence and support and expertise from institutions that contain Irish records, notably the National Archives of Ireland, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, the UK National Archives at Kew and the Irish Manuscripts Commission. “The circle of collaborators has widened and deepened,” said Crooks.The latest material includes 60,000 names from the lost censuses, creating a data hoard for genealogists and Irish diaspora descendants, among others, to trace family lineage, says Ciarán Wallace, a Trinity historian and co-director of the project. “This is only a fragment of what’s missing but 60,000 is a huge improvement on a blank slate.”View image in fullscreenA notebook preserved in the National Archives of Ireland containing names of two households, transcribed from the 1841 census for Headford, County Galway.Photograph: Chris Bellew/Fennell PhotographyThe project’s“age of conquest” portalcontains parchments in Latin and 5m words of Anglo-Norman Irish history, spanning 1170 to 1500, that have been translated into English.Uploaded state papers, spanning 1660 to 1720, comprise 10m words, including extensive intelligence reports from the Tudor era when English monarchs tightened their grip on England’s first colony.A diary that ended up at the US Library of Congress is now accessible and sheds light on dodgy deals that led to the abolition of the Irish parliament in 1800 and Ireland’s incorporation into the UK. “You find out about some of those underhanded dealings,” said Joel Herman, a research fellow who works on the project. “One member of parliament said he can’t vote for it because of the corrupt methods that have been used to win votes.”Along with the new material, a search tool called theKnowledge Graph Exploreris being introduced that can identify people, places and the links between them.Explore more on these topicsIrelandHeritageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It should suggest character, create intrigue, and kindle desire. Who doesn’t want to explore the Crazy Mountains of Montana, or make a fiery pact with California’s Diablo Range? While studying a map of Spain, my interest was piqued by a patch of grey and green emptiness bearing the enticing words: Sierra de la Demanda.I’ve travelled all overSpainfor work and play in the last two decades, but somehow these “demanding” mountains had eluded me. Located in the remote northern interior, halfway between Madrid and Santander, their isolation (and a dearth of English-language Google results) only added to the mystique. The Sierra de la Demanda covers a vast area across Spain’s least populated regions of Burgos, Soria and La Rioja. An investigation of more detailed maps revealed an almost roadless expanse of limestone peaks, valleys, ravines, rivers, gorges and glacial lakes, with the highest peak, San Lorenzo, towering at 2,271 metres (7,451ft). The calling was real.View image in fullscreenAn abandoned railway station speaks to the depopulation of this region ofEspaña vacía.Photograph: Lois PryceThis is not the Spain of white villages and dusty olive groves. On the Demanda’s north face, where the climate is wetter and cooler, the improvised allotments, stone ruins and makeshift shacks are reminiscent of the forgotten corners of eastern Europe. Climbing higher, above the treeline, the terrain becomes harsh and rocky with sweeping views across plunging, pine-covered valleys. But unlike the dramatic outline of Spain’s more famous mountain ranges, the Demanda appear gradually, almost secretly, their true splendour only emerging once you’re deep in their midst. Every season brings its own charms. Winter is a snowy picture postcard, but in spring the meltwater sends waterfalls thundering down the mountainsides among wildflower meadows. Summer is hot and arid, but by autumn the temperatures hover in the mid-20Cs with (mostly) solid blue skies, and the ground is swathed in pink heather and alpine flowers.The views are stupendous in every direction – fold upon fold of untouched mountain wilderness and nothing human-made in sightThe town of Ezcaray, on the north side, is the closest thing to a tourist hub – a scenic former textile centre on the River Oja that operates as a base for the small ski resort of Valdezcaray, built in the 1970s (thePalacio Azcáratehas doubles from €90, B&B). The sealed road ends abruptly after the ski centre, becoming a rocky trail that makes for a nail-biting drive (especially in a hire car) along a ridge that’s at more than 1,800 metres (6,000ft), before looping back to Ezcaray in a dizzying descent of hairpin bends. The views are stupendous in every direction – fold upon fold of untouched mountain wilderness and, apart from the occasional hiking trail signpost, nothing human-made in sight.Halfway around the loop road, if you’re craving more back-country adventure, a dirt track, appearing as an almost imperceptible black line on the Michelin map and marked with a rusty, hand-painted sign, takes you down into the southern foothills via the Lagunas de Neila, a cluster of glacial lakes, surrounded by cliffs and pine forests. The lakes can only be reached on foot, and at an altitude of 6,000ft make for an invigorating dip. The Laguna Negra is named after its dark waters, but in the late afternoon sun it appears a deep, shimmering blue. The water is, as you would expect, bracing, but it’s the sheer scale of the surroundings, and the solitude, that will take your breath away. The only sound accompanying my swim was a chorus of surprisingly loud frogs, ribbeting from the reeds.View image in fullscreenThe eerie Necrópolis de Cuyacabras, where dozens of adult- and child-sized tombs are carved from a slab of rock in a pine forest.Photograph: AlamyOn their south side, heading downhill from thelagunas, the Demanda feel different. The climate turns drier and warmer, and Spain becomes familiar again, with its oak forests, medievalermitas(chapels) and sleepy villages where old men wave from their chairs outside the taverna.Although there are plenty of well-marked hiking and mountain bike trails here, this is still “España vacía” – empty Spain – and human activity remains a rare sight outside the towns. This phenomenon of the interior’s depopulation is much discussed by Spanish politicians and citizens, and the low density is tangible here – traffic is light and most of the activity is among the animal kingdom. Deer leap through the trees, boar amble across the road, and as the forests give way to open rocky landscapes, griffon vultures perch in their hundreds along the high cliffs before swooping and circling in the late afternoon thermals.The village of Quintanar de la Sierra, in the southern foothills, makes a good base to explore the Demanda, and theHostal Domingooffers affordable rooms (doubles from €55, room-only). Like all the villages in the area, life moves slowly and peacefully. Locals get around on horses and in beat-up 4x4s, the shops shut all afternoon, nobody speaks English, and everyone, young and old, socialises in the town plaza where acafé con lechewill set you back €1.50. Like the ski centre, the hotels and bars are a non-ironic throwback to the 1970s, their only concession to the 21st century being charmingly rudimentary websites and an email address. This is the land that social media forgot, and is better off for it. Although it may appear on the surface that there’s not much in the way of tourist attractions, as you delve deeper into its hidden corners, an intriguing and eclectic landscape of history and culture reveals itself.Just over the hill is one of cinema’s most well-known locations, where The Good, The Bad & The Ugly was filmed in 1966Dinosaurs roamed this part of Spain, and hundreds of their footprints are visible near the town of Salas de los Infantes, which also boasts adinosaur museum. Moving on a few miles, and a few million years, is the eerieNecrópolis de Cuyacabras, dating from the ninth to 11th centuries, where dozens of adult- and child-size tombs are carved from a slab of rock in the depth of a pine forest. Meandering through the villages, Roman bridges, abandoned monasteries and ruins of all eras – from medieval to mid-century – appear at every turn. For lovers of industrial archaeology (AKA clambering around abandoned buildings), an enticing disused railway runs through Salas, its crumbling stations and rusty tracks half hidden beneath tangles of vegetation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twenty miles west, venturing deeper into fantasy land, is theTerritorio Artlanza, which claims to be the largest sculpture in the world. A magical, full-scale reproduction of a medieval Castilian village, created by Félix Yáñez, a local artist, from materials salvaged from rubbish dumps, it includes porticoed squares, a perfectly equipped school, a carpentry shop, bakery, forge, canteen, wine cellars, an alchemist’s pharmacy and even a small chapel.Empty patches on maps that elicit few Google search results are rare in these hyperconnected, overshared times. There is a timelessness to the Sierra de la Demanda that feels like innocence, and while other parts of Spain struggle with the pressures of over-tourism, these mountains are a lungful of fresh air. The charms of the Demanda are simple and unshowy, and ironically, make few demands on the visitor – except to breathe deeply and tread lightly.Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The grated courgette melts into the pasta, and works perfectly with the lemon, trout and a hit of chilli. If you have one of those multi-nut and seed mixes (the M&S 35-plant one is excellent), by all means add a scoop to finish; otherwise, a scattering of toasted pine nuts will add a welcome crunch. An elegant dinner for two.Courgette linguine with trout, lemon and dillPrep10 minCook20 minServes22 trout fillets2½tbsp olive oilSea saltJuice and finely grated zest of ½ lemon,plus 2 lemon slices180g linguine2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated1tsp chilli flakes1 large courgette, trimmed and coarsely grated10g fresh dill, roughly chopped4tbsp pine nuts, or 4 tbsp omega nut and seed mixHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the trout fillets on a small lined baking tray, drizzle with half a tablespoon of olive oil, scatter over a pinch of sea salt and top each fillet with a slice of lemon. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until just cooked through. (If you have an air-fryer, the fish will take eight to 10 minutes.)Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, then cook the linguine according to the packet instructions, until just al dente. While the pasta is boiling, get all the remaining ingredients ready.Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. Return the empty pasta pan to the hob on a low heat, add the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil, then fry the garlic, chilli and lemon zest for just 30 seconds.Add the grated courgette, fry for a minute, until just starting to soften, then add the drained pasta, dill, lemon juice and a teaspoon of salt. Stir well – there should be enough liquid from the courgette to form a clinging sauce; if not, add a tablespoon of the reserved pasta water. Flake the cooked trout in large pieces into the linguine, then stir gently to combine. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Use tongs to divide the pasta and trout evenly between two warmed bowls, top with the pine nuts and serve hot.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkQuick and easyPastaFoodVegetablesFishMain courseStarterrecipesShareReuse this content"
