But did many of his ideas come from Marlow Moss? Our writer celebrates an extraordinary British talent who died in obscurityJoanna MoorheadMon 12 Jan 2026 11.14 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShareIn 1972, the mighty Kunstmuseum in the Hague bought three paintings by a little known British artist called Marlow Moss. The prestigious art gallery was keen to show the enormous influence ofPiet Mondrian– the famous Dutch painter acclaimed for his black grids lit with bold blues and brash yellows – on such lowly also-rans as Moss.Yet, should you visit the Kunstmuseum today, you’ll find the Moss works positioned front and centre, while a similar piece by the great Mondrian, who would later become the toast of New York, is hidden behind a pillar. Why the volte-face? Because it is now widely recognised in the art world that it was as much Moss who influenced Mondrian as the other way round, at least when it came to the double or parallel lines he started using in the 1930s to add tension to his harmonious abstract paintings,one of which hammered last May for $48m.The smart feminist money was on him having stolen from herSeven decades after her death in Cornwall at the age of 69, Moss is enjoying a major revival and reappraisal. As well as the current exhibition of her paintings and sketches in the Kunstmuseum, her sculpture will go on show at the Georg Kolbe Museum in Berlin in April. Last year, meanwhile, her 1944 work White, Black, Blue and Red fetched £609,000 at Sotheby’s in London, double its estimate and a record for her work at auction. Not quite in Mondrian territory, not yet anyway.View image in fullscreen‘She’s now getting attention’ … Marlow Moss.Photograph: Nijhoff/Oosthoek, Literatuurmuseum, Den HaagIt’s an extraordinary turnaround for an artist who was shunned by much of the art world in her lifetime. The Tate wasn’t interested in her. When Moss moved to Cornwall, settling in the beautiful and remote Lamorna Cove near Penzance, she made repeated efforts to contact sculptor Barbara Hepworth and her painter husband Ben Nicholson. They ignored her.“Moss’s time has come,” says Florette Dijkstra, author of The Leap into the Light, a biography recently published in Dutch. “Art history is a strange science. The landscape can totally shift. The buzzwords today are inclusivity and diversity. Women artists are being promoted, as well as queer artists. This explains – partly – why Moss is getting so much attention.”Marjorie Jewel Moss, as she was first named, was born in London in 1889. Drawn initially to dance and music, she went on to study art before moving to Cornwall, where she cut her hair short and changed her name to the gender-neutral Marlow, though was still known as “she”. In the late 1920s, Moss moved to Paris, where she became part of the avant garde scene and a member of the Abstraction-Creation group, which favoured abstraction over figurative work or surrealism.Her entry into the group came via an early admirer, Mondrian, who was a few years her senior and Dutch. Moss had been introduced to him by her partner Netty Nijhoff, a writer from Zeeland. Moss and Nijhoff had met at the Cafe de Flore in Paris. When Nijhoff asked her son to take a note to the lady at the nearby table, the boy asked: “What lady?” Moss was, as usual, in male attire. After they became a couple, both would go about Paris in men’s suits and hats. Nijhoff remained married to her husband, the Dutch poet Martinus Nijhoff, for years to come, though both had other lovers. At times, Moss and Nijhoff had other partners as well.The reaction this unusual pair prompted wasn’t straightforward, says Dijkstra, even in the so-called liberal art community in Paris. “Some accepted them,” she says. “Others didn’t.” Mondrian did up to a point – but he was far more interested in Moss’s art than her love life.View image in fullscreenPrecise … Moss’s Composition Yellow, Blue, Black, Red and White, 1956-1957.Photograph: © The Estate of Marlow Moss“He was impressed,” adds Dijkstra, “by her experimentation with the ingredients of ‘neoplasticism’ – how she used materials other than paint, such as cork and wood, and her use of the ‘double line’, which allowed for more dynamic compositions.” Mondrian has since gone down in history as the father of neoplasticism, which was all about paring art down to basic components, using only lines and shapes with minimal colours.When Mondrian saw Moss was deploying the double line in a new way – not using it to cross other lines – his interest was aroused and he wrote to ask what she meant by it. When she told him she regarded the single-line grid he’d been using for over a decade as “a conclusion and restriction” to a composition, he replied saying he couldn’t quite follow what she meant.Mondrian, however, would go on to become famous for the double line. Clairie Hondtong, the Hague show’s curator, believes its use evolved from exchanges between the two, rather than as something Mondrian created that was then borrowed by Moss, as earlier art historians believed. “For a long time, he was seen as the instigator – but, though it’s unclear who used it first, we now know Mondrian was intrigued by Moss’s use of double lines.”The sands have certainly shifted over the years. Back in 1972, the assumption was that artists such as Moss had been influenced by Mondrian’s use of it. Then came the discovery that Moss had also used it – and the smart feminist money was on him having stolen it. But now, says Hondtong, there’s a new approach. “Many museums put Moss to the front in the originality debate, but we’re moving away from the ‘Who did it first?’ narrative, focusing instead on the interchange of knowledge.”Visitors to the exhibition will be able to admire Moss’s use of the technique in her 1932 work White, Black, Red and Grey. They will also be able to compare it to Mondrian’s, in his 1937 Composition of Lines and Colour.Some LGBTQ+ commentators have suggested that Moss’s use of double lines may have been her response to a world that didn’t make space for a gay woman who dressed in masculine clothes. Since her double lines didn’t cross other lines, she effectively opened up a new space on a canvas – one she may have longed for in the real world. “It might have been an expression of her search for freedom,” says Hondtong. “It could be interpreted as an original response for people outside binary spaces.”How does Moss fit into today’s transgender debate? “If she was alive today,” says Hondtong, “would she identify as trans? We can’t know – and we don’t want to put words into her mouth. It’s certainly great that she was seen as a pioneer and is an inspiration for queer artists today.”In 1940, Mondrian moved to New York. Moss, by then living in the Netherlands with Nijhoff, returned to Cornwall, since her Jewish ancestry made life impossible in now-Nazi occupied territory. Mondrian urged her to follow him, but she did not. He died there in 1944, and the two never met again. In Lamorna, Moss seems to have found acceptance and a place conducive to her work. After the war, she reunited with Nijhoff and the pair continued to be lifelong companions until Moss’s death in 1958. They split their life between Cornwall, Paris and the Netherlands, where they lived sometimes on a houseboat in The Hague.View image in fullscreenIntuitive … Mondrian’s Tableau I, Plate I, 1921.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesNew York, whose grid-like streets echoed Mondrian’s works, helped catapult him to global fame, and he has gone down as a giant of art history, one of the three greatest Dutch painters – along with Van Gogh and Rembrandt – of all time. He is regarded as a central pioneer on the journey from figurative to abstract art, and in the US his work connected with the jazz music and boogie-woogie of the time. In 2022, his Composition No II went for $51m, the record for a Mondrian.Moss, by contrast, became a footnote in art history, a situation compounded by the destruction of much of her work when a house in Normandy where she and Nijhoff had lived was bombed by the Allies in 1944. It’s the discovery of a suitcase full of sketches that has prompted The Hague exhibition. “The case was left in the Netherlands,” says Hondtong. “It was acquired by the Kunstmuseum in 2025.” A lot of the works were undated, but it’s believed some are from the early 1940s. There are rare examples of her sketches, which reveal much about her thought process.“We see her using mathematical calculations to plan her geometric paintings,” says Hondtong, “which is very different from Mondrian. She was very precise and her works were carefully mapped out, whereas Mondrian worked more intuitively.” Also in the suitcase are automatic drawings, revealing another layer of Moss’s oeuvre.Hondtong hopes the contents of the suitcase will spur a new chapter in the artist’s legacy, a focus on her work rather than her life story – an ambition supported by Lucy Howarth, author of the only book in English on Moss, a short eponymous biography. “Moss has a fascinating story. For most people, the way into knowing about her is via the Mondrian link. But she deserves to be explored in her own right. She’s been downplayed by Mondrian scholars for years, but she is one of the few top-tier non-figurative British artists from between the wars, and she was the only Briton and the only female artist who appeared in all five Abstraction-Creation journals.”Howarth, a historian at the University for the Creative Arts in Canterbury, has been researching Moss since the early years of the 21st century, and says much has changed. “In those days, I’d be looking for her work in storerooms and back rooms. Today, Moss’s work is up on the walls and much sought after for exhibitions.” The upcoming Berlin sculpture exhibition is co-curated by Howarth. “Moss worked in metal, stone and wood and we’ll have about 10 pieces,” she says. “But we’ll also have photographs of sculptures that were lost.”View image in fullscreenHe urged her to follow him to New York … Mondrian.Photograph: Granger/ShutterstockUnlike Mondrian, who was a painter, Moss was a constructivist who used a range of materials and methods. The new show, it is hoped, will shift the focus on to that. Nijhoff once described her partner as an artist whose work was all about space, movement and light – and that’s every bit as true of her sculpture, says Howarth.Perhaps most exciting of all is the idea that the current focus on Moss is reframing art history. For centuries, it’s been the story of singular men, geniuses who toiled alone brilliantly to change the direction of the canon. “We’re realising art history is a lot more interesting than that,” says Howarth. “Mondrian was an amazing artist, but he wasn’t the only one practising neoplasticism. It’s so interesting to find lesser-known artists and to examine their impact – and it’s no surprise to find many of them were women and/or queer. Their presence complicates the story. But it also enriches it – for all of us.”Marlow Moss: A Suitcase Full of Sketches is at the Kunstmuseum, The Hague, until 10 May.Creating Space: The Constructivist Marlow Moss is at the Georg Kolbe Museum, Berlin, 2 April to 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingPiet MondrianfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if none of us really wanted himMon 12 Jan 2026 12.48 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 15.47 ESTShareHere’s a thought: try to name a former Conservative MP that Nigel Farage wouldn’t accept as a member of Reform. OK, he might draw the line at Liz Truss on the grounds she is a danger to everyone. Especially herself. And Boris Johnson might be a problem. Not just as a clash of competing egos but becausethe immigration Boriswavemight be a hard sell to Nige’s core supporters.But those two aside, it seems that anyone is welcome. Bring Nige the deadbeats, the shifty and the disgraced and he will offer them shelter. Will make then whole. Help them to reinvent themselves as frontline politicians once more. Or as close as they are ever likely to get. So step forwardNadhim Zahawi, the latest – and certainly the highest-profile – member of the Living Dead Tories to sell his soul for a glimpse of a second chance. To join the ranks of the Immortals, such as Andrea Jenkyns, Jake Berry, Danny Kruger and Lee Anderson.Let’s quickly run through some of Nadhim’s career highlights. A successful businessman turned Tory politician who thought it was just fine toclaim the heating for his stables on parliamentary expenses. Because what MP in his right mind wouldn’t think that was a perfectly reasonable thing to do? The man who was appointed chancellor by Boris after the resignation of Rishi Sunak, only tocall on him to step downless than 48 hours later once he had seen which way the wind was blowing. Loyalty etched deep into his veins.A man of exquisite judgment. A backer of Truss and then Boris again. Only to jump ship to Rishi once he saw his career passing before his eyes.Sacked as chair of the Tory partyfor having forgotten to mention he was being investigated over a £5m unpaid tax bill – the settlement included a 30% fine, which suggests this was not just carelessness – when he was in charge of the Treasury. No conflict of interest or breach of the ministerial code there. The MP who lost his seat in 2024 and, according to Tory sources, hadsought a peerage from Kemi Badenochonly a few weeks ago. For services to sublime self-interest.Not that Farage was bothered by any of this as he unveiled his latest defector at a Monday morning press conference at the Institute of Directors in central London. Nige is never one to turn his nose up at low-hanging fruit. The more disruption and pain he can inflict on the Tories the better. And he can live with accusations that Reform is becoming a convalescent home for former Conservatives whose political careers had reached a dead end. The more Tories he takes, the less his party looks entirely like a one-man band. Nige reckons you can never have too many rats leaving a sinking ship. They provide their own momentum.Is Nadhim Zahawi’s defection to Farage’s Reform a bombshell? No, it’s just naked opportunism | Henry HillRead moreNige was almost protective as he introduced his latest signing. Keen for his man not to get a kicking. For his part, Nadhim seemed blissfully unaware of just how absurd he sounded. Britain was on its last legs, he said. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. What is it with former Tory MPs especially? Their self-delusion is absolute. Zahawi didn’t even register the irony that he had been a key member of the very government responsible for wrecking the economy.You could see the glow in Zahawi. The self-importance. Back in front of the TV cameras for the first time in over 18 months. Suddenly, he could kid himself that he mattered again. That he was doing the country a favour. Top of the world. He was to be our saviour. All we had to do was to show him a little respect. Some gratitude for all he had done. Surely everyone of his immense calibre deserved a peerage. Nige jotted that down in his things-to-do notebook.It had been like this, said Zahawi. In December he had let his Tory membership lapse. Nothing to do with being turned down for a peerage. Definitely not that. So he had picked up the phone to Nige to offer his services. What the country needed now was more Nadhim. In his own mind he had always been the most popular Tory minister to have lived. Now he was going to bless us once more. He was the man with so much more to give. Even if none of us really wanted him.Inevitably many of the questions focused on previous comments that Zahawi had made about Farage. A tweet from 2015 in which he had pointed out that Nige only offered division and that he could never live in a country run by Farage. The observation that under Reform’s current immigration proposals, Zahawi’s family would have been deported on arrival into the country.Nadhim shook his head sadly. He had known Nige for all of 10 minutes and could tell there wasn’t a racist bone in his body. All was forgiven. Farage agreed.The fact that there were now 34 former Dulwich pupils alleging racist abuseonly went to prove he couldn’t possibly be racist. If there had been just one, then maybe there might have been substance to the allegations. But because so many had said the same thing, it automatically meant they were all meaningless. It was hard to keep track of the logic. Only Nadhim did. “Coffee is racist,” he observed gnomically.Was he at all troubled that, as the former minister for vaccinations during the pandemic, Reform had given a platform to a medic who had said the king’s cancer had been caused by the Covid vaccine? Nige thought it best to answer that one. Reform believed in free speech. There was nothing wrong with that. Other parties should try it.Which is why he wasn’t that fussed about Grok AI being available as a premium porn service on X. Live and let live.By the time we got on to his tax affairs, the thin-skinned Nadhim began to get a bit tetchy. It had just been an oversight. Why did people keep bringing up the past? He even picked on a Daily Telegraph – normally considered home team by Reform – journalist for “asking a stupid question”. “I expected better of you,” he snapped. Only the question about vaccines had been perfectly reasonable. Nige put an arm round his man. He had had enough. The peerage was in the post. Just as soon as it was his to give.Explore more on these topicsNadhim ZahawiThe politics sketchNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

As further witnesses came forward, we had excuses: it was “banter”, therewasn’t any maliceinvolved and any such abuse wasnever targeted at an individual.Now Reform’s leader says that much, although seemingly not all, of what is being claimed from the now34 alleged witnesses and victimsabout his behaviour is “fantasy”. The motivation of this large group of fantasists is said to be political. The politician’s response does not sit well with me.I know that Farage targeted his contemporaries at the school with abuse because of their ethnicity and nationality because I was there – and I was one of them. I knew him throughout my time at Dulwich: sometimes we would be on the same train, when he would smoke the thinnest rollups you’ve ever seen in the compartments.I remember it so clearly because Farage was so different to what my friends and I were all about. His presence felt like a constant noise. The persona he had adopted was negative, destructive and intolerant of anything non-British. As he wasn’t really very good at anything – no great orator, not charismatic or engaging – he had clearly worked out that being vitriolic was the only way he’d get noticed.View image in fullscreenRickard Berg at Dulwich College when he was about 15 years old.Photograph: Supplied by Rickard BergYes, he had a few others that thought like him, but he didn’t need them around to repeatedly taunt the targets he had singled out based on their skin colour, nationality or religion, and had targeted because retribution was unlikely – as in essence he was a simple bully.I was picked on because I am Swedish. He had no retort when people like myself who he told to “go home, back to your own country” told him to fuck off.In case he’s forgotten, he said that to me in the classroom overlooking the science block. It was definitely not playground banter – at Dulwich there was no playground apart from in Lower School, years 7 and 8 – the school grounds were massive and we all disappeared to different corners to hang out with our friends during breaks. To repeatedly harass someone took a bit of effort.Why does it matter now? Yesterday, today or tomorrow, it matters. If there is any doubt about the impact he had, please readthe testimony of Peter Ettedgui, the award winning film-maker who counts people murdered in the Holocaust among his family. He described how Farage would hiss “Hitler was right” into his ear, and “gas them”.Farage and his acolytes are today calling me, some of my friends and other ex-Dulwich boys liars. It is bullying those who were hurt by him all over again.My motivation is not political. Farage has chosen a profession where character matters. It’s pathetic of him to pretend he shouldn’t be open to personal scrutiny or that his behaviour at Dulwich wouldn’t resurface: as pathetic aspicking on a wounded BBCto deflect from having to answer questions, but I guess that’s the bully right there. Had he wanted to remain anonymous, he should have stayed in the City rather than choosing a public career.My motivation is that in not acknowledging and explaining that “that was school, this is now”, he is showing that he simply isn’t beinghonest – and insulting us ex-fellow pupils in the process.Farage coming into the classroom in which Peter was sitting to start a rendition of the antisemitic song “Gas ’em all”, about killing Jews and other minority ethnic people, is not something you forget. I could no longer keep to just telling this story to my mates on bike rides through the Surrey Hills.Fudge (Farage’s nickname) is someone I remember as being nothing but a racist, antisemitic, obnoxious bully who would get the early train so he could polish hisCCF bootsbefore first bell; that’s about it. His response to the recent accounts of him at Dulwich doesn’t really make me feel he’s changed that much. To me, he remains a spineless little person incapable of making anything better.Rickard Berg is a musician, music producer and composerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When I suffered a medical emergency, she jumped into actionSimon Steggall, as told to Joe PinnerMon 12 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareThe first time I saw a Flemish giant rabbit was at TruckFest in Peterborough in 2002. Among a sprawling maze of stalls at the East of England showground, I was led into a tent filled with the biggest rabbits I’d ever laid eyes on. I’d never heard of Flemish giants before, but I knew then that I needed one. I couldn’t have predicted in that moment that one of these beautiful creatures might save my life.Dory was a baby when I met her, but even as a bunny she was already bigger than most normal-sized rabbits. We brought her home in a cat carrier, but she soon outgrew it. By the time she was fully grown, she weighed nearly 10kg, and I was walking her on a leash like a dog.She had the appetite to match, too. We gave her heaps of carrots, obviously, but that was never going to be enough. White cabbage, savoy cabbage, hay, dandelions, milk thistle, pellets – she ate the lot. And Dory didn’t stop there. When she wasn’t chomping on vegetables, she was sure to find something else to satisfy her hunger. Since she was a house rabbit, that usually meant chewing through computer cables, bits of furniture, and, on one occasion, the hose of my pressure washer.View image in fullscreen‘She climbed on to my body and went nuts’ … Dory.Photograph: Courtesy of Simon SteggallThe most extraordinary thing about Dory wasn’t her size, or her appetite. It was her brain. One evening in 2004, I was watching TV with my then wife when I began to lose consciousness and slip into a diabetic coma – which can lead to serious brain damage or death if left untreated. My ex-wife simply thought I’d nodded off after a long day’s work and hadn’t noticed anything was wrong, but it was dear old Dory who sensed danger.Normally a docile creature, Dory leapt into action: she climbed up on to my body and went nuts, jumping up and down, thumping furiously on my chest, and licking all over my face. It was only when she started acting so strangely that my ex-wife realised something was seriously wrong and phoned 999.I still can’t be sure how Dory knew. Some people say that pets can sense when their owners are sick, and when they are dying. Perhaps she could smell that my blood sugar was low, or could hear my heartbeat quicken. Either way, without her actions, I know I wouldn’t be here to tell the tale.In the days after my coma, Dory became something of a celebrity. Our local paper, the Hunts Post, featured her on their front page, and various nationals soon followed. There was even the chance to go on morning TV, but when I was told by producers that they couldn’t provide accommodation for a giant house rabbit in London, I politely declined.Dory was rewarded for her efforts by being made the first ever honorary animal member of the Rabbit Welfare Association, and spent the rest of her years enjoying as many carrots – and computer cables – as she could wish for. In her retirement from being a life-saving paramedic, she would often climb up on to my lap and wet herself – but I didn’t mind. I owed her my life, after all.Dory passed suddenly and prematurely, at just two years old. The chunks she’d chewed out of the carpet and the skirting boards served as little reminders of her after she died, but the biggest mark she left was on me. No one can say that Dory didn’t make the most of her short life, and I’ve tried to live the rest of mine in her memory.Explore more on these topicsPetsThe pet I'll never forgetWildlifeAnimal behaviourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A rare Bob Weir-penned lyric details the Dead’s youngest member being busted by the cops “for smiling on a cloudy day” – referencing a real-life incident when Weir pelted police with water balloons as they conducted what he took to be illegal searches outside the group’s Haight-Ashbury hangout. It then connects with the band’s spiritual forebearsthe Merry Prankstersby referencing Neal Cassady, driver of “a bus to never-ever land”. The song later evolved into The Other One, one of the Dead’s most played tunes and a launchpad for their exploratory jams – as inthis languid, brilliant versionat San Francisco’s Winterland in 1974.The Grateful Dead – Truckin’ (1970)“What a long, strange trip it’s been,” reflected Weir on what is arguably the Grateful Dead’s anthem. The group were only half a decade into a remarkable 30-year career when lyricist Robert Hunter penned this picaresque of their touring escapades. It’s heavy on the gnarly details – groupies consumed by “reds, vitamin C and cocaine”, and endless hotel-room drug-busts – but the Dead’s spirited delivery and, in particular, Weir’s jovial growl, located the magic in their peripatetic lifestyle. As with many Dead tunes, Truckin’ was best heard in concert (or on a fan-taped bootleg traded in the car park before a show). The rumble captured at London’s Lyceum on the Europe ’72 live LP is as fine as any you’ll hear.The Grateful Dead – Sugar Magnolia (1971)The Grateful Dead: Sugar Magnolia / Scarlet Begonias / Fire on the Mountain (Winterland 12/31/78) – videoA tribute to Weir’s longtime paramour Frankie Hart – “a summer love in the spring, fall and winter” who could “make happy any man alive” – and a highlight of their 1970 LP American Beauty, Sugar Magnolia showcased the Dead’s embrace of Americana and songcraft. Their second most played song evolved a joyful coda in concert, Sunshine Daydream, and it was often the first song they would play after the clock struck midnight at their New Year’s Eve concerts.The performance at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom on 31 December 1978, marking the closure of the venerated venue, is a true Deadhead favourite.Bob Weir – Playing in the Band (1972)Playing in the Band portrays the Dead’s lifestyle as some quasi-mystical vocation, with the narrator a talk-is-cheap road warrior who has developed his own philosophies along the way: “I don’t trust to nothing / But I know it come out right.” Evolving from a riff coined by David Crosby during a jam in Dead percussionist Mickey Hart’s barn, the track first surfaced on the Dead’s eponymous 1971 live LP, then featured on Weir’s 1972 solo debut Ace, before the group reclaimed it as a vehicle for their most questing, open-ended excursions. The legendary 46-minuteversion from Seattle’s Edmundson Pavilion in 1974is reckoned to be the longest song performance the Dead ever pulled off.Bob Weir – Cassidy (1972)View image in fullscreenBob Weir pictured in 1976.Photograph: Mark SullivanNamed for the young daughter of a Dead roadie, Cassidy doubles as a tribute to beat poet Neal Cassady, whose restless, questing example cast a long shadow for Weir. A lilting, upbeat folk-rocker, it finds Weir offering the infant Cassidy life lessons he has drawn from Cassady’s quixotic lust for freedom, singing on the coda: “Let your life proceed by its own designs … Let the word be yours.” This sentiment, along with the pearlescent, folky tangle of a riff, made Cassidy a song Weir revisited throughout his career,with the Deadand also with RatDog, the group he formed following Garcia’s death in 1995.The Grateful Dead – The Music Never Stopped (1975)Is 1975’s Blues for Allah the funkiest Dead album? The Meters-esque swing of Jerry Garcia’s Franklin’s Tower suggests as much, as does this Weir-penned reverie, steeped in the rhythms of the south. The Music Never Stopped is driven by Weir’s prickly guitar figures, stirring up a groove that wouldn’t have shamed Allen Toussaint, while the sparring harmonies with singerDonna Jean Godchauxgive this playful number a Bourbon Street-worthy earthiness. The down-home imagery, co-written with Weir’s regular collaborator John Perry Barlow, verges on the hokey, but if you aren’t seduced by the “rainbow full of sound … fireworks, calliopes and clowns”, that’s your loss.Kingfish – Lazy Lightning/Supplication (1976)After the Dead temporarily ran aground in the mid-70s, Weir jumped ship to join his pal Matthew Kelly’s group Kingfish, for whom he wrote this luminous two-parter mixing imagery of lust and addiction. The studio version, all pristine harmonies and succinct, FM radio-ready AOR, is charming. But as is always the way with Dead-related music, the song truly came into its own after the group reformed and Weir added it to their setlists. Performances such as this onefrom the Sportatorium in Florida in 1977unlocked the conversational, jazzy potential that is only hinted at on Kingfish’s studio original.The Grateful Dead – Estimated Prophet (1977)The Grateful Dead: Estimated Prophet (Live at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, New York 3/29/90) – video“The Grateful Dead play reggae” may be a hard sell as a concept, but Estimated Prophet is something else. The track possesses a menace that is rare in Dead music, with Weir portraying a darkly charismatic Manson-like figure duelling with the voices in his head and threatening to “call down thunder” and “fill the sky with flame”. The portrait is grimly compelling, the band doubtless having crossed paths with many such drug-damaged characters as the 60s soured. Fans citethe 1990 recording from New York’s Nassau Coliseumas the keeper, with guest musician Branford Marsalis playing lyrical saxophone, but the song’s dark heart is perhaps best represented on the recording oftheir 1979 show at Oakland Auditorium Arena, where Weir’s choppy guitar lends a foreboding undertow to Brent Mydland’s sprawling keyboard solo.The Grateful Dead – Lost Sailor (1980)The Dead seemed mostly unconcerned by whatever trends were moving the mainstream. During their tenure at Clive Davis’s Arista records, however, the storied record mogul teamed them with outside producers, hoping to connect the Dead, however reluctantly, with the zeitgeist. The sleeve of 1980’s Go to Heaven, with the group in white disco suits and flowing tresses as if they’d hired the Bee Gees’ stylists, suggested an uncharacteristic misstep. But the album itself has aged well, in particular this meditative and melancholic number. On Lost Sailor, a disillusioned Weir recognises himself in the figure of a haggard old boatman as dedicated to the sea as the singer and guitarist is to the open road, musing “freedom don’t come easy”.The Grateful Dead – Hell in a Bucket (1987)The Grateful Dead’s only US Top 10 LP, 1987’s In the Dark, is far from beloved among Deadheads. But whilea goofy, skeleton-packed videobriefly sold these boomers to the MTV generation, this cynical kiss-off to a former lover proved the Dead hadn’t sacrificed their dark wit for stardom. The narrator plays like a character from a Steely Dan song, a loser nevertheless focused on having the last laugh, as Weir’s Dylanesque croak depicts his ex as “the reincarnation of the ravenous Catherine the Great” and reasoning, in the irresistible hook, “I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe, but at least I’m enjoyin’ the ride”. It’s a timeless sentiment, even if thegonzo music videofeaturing Weir in a pastel suit straight out of Miami Vice, and his leather-clad ex, has not aged so well – though Bob is clearly having fun throughout.Explore more on these topicsMusicGrateful DeadPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to make sure you eat the right amount, at the right timeJoel SnapeMon 12 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 06.39 ESTShareSugar tastes great for good reason:we evolved to like it,back when honey was a hard-to-get, energy-dense treat and we spent half of our time running around after antelope. Now that it’s much easier to get and we don’t move as much, that sweet tooth is working against us: many of us are consuming far too much of it, and suffering from poor health as a result. But is there anything specifically bad about it beyond it providing too many calories and not enough nutrients?This whole idea of trying to ‘flatline’ your glucose response that you see from some influencers is totally unnecessary“When we taste sugar, the body starts reacting the moment sweetness touches the tongue,” says Dawn Menning, a registered dietitian who works with health app Nutu. “The brain recognises it as a quick source of energy and activates the reward system, releasing the feelgood chemical dopamine that makes it so appealing.” Interestingly, not everyone tastes sugar in exactly the same way – in2015, researchers compareddifferent types of siblings’ perception of sugar and sweeteners, and found that identical twins were more similar to each other in their sweet taste perception than fraternal twins or non-twin siblings. They concluded that genetic factors account for about 30% of the variance in how sensitive people are to sweet tastes – but it’s unclear whether that actually affects how much we eat.Regardless, what happens after your first taste depends on the kind of sugar you’re taking in: glucose, which is what you get from table sugar, most sweet treats and starchy carbohydrates, has slightly different effects from fructose, the type you’ll commonly find in fruits and juices.“Glucose causes the pancreas to release insulin, a hormone which – to put it in simple terms – is involved in removing that glucose from circulation and depositing it where it needs to go,” says Sarah Berry, professor of nutrition at King’s College London and chief scientist at science and nutrition company Zoe. “That might mean that it’s stored in the muscles or liver for energy as glycogen, or converted into fat.” Fructose, meanwhile, doesn’t cause insulin to be released. “It’s delivered directly into the liver, where, again it can be converted to glycogen – or again, if consumed in excess, is converted also into fat.”View image in fullscreenWhen we eat sugar, the brain recognises it as a source of energy and releases the feelgood hormone dopamine.Photograph: Posed by models; Aire Images/Getty ImagesBoth types of sugar, when eaten in excess, can lead to an increase in the type of fat circulating in your blood known as triglycerides: they’re essential for energy, but high levels can increase the risk for heart disease, stroke and pancreatitis. Fructose is more of a concern for people at risk of fatty liver syndrome, but glucose is an issue for people who have trouble regulating insulin. Which one you should be more concerned about, then, really depends on your other lifestyle choices and genetic predispositions.“What we also know is if you have an insulin peak that’s excessive and repeated day in and day out, then it can increase levels of inflammation,” says Berry. “That in itself isn’t inherently bad because inflammation is happening all the time in our bodies – but if it’s repeated and excessive, that’s when we believe it becomes a problem.”The sugar rush, incidentally, is a myth that has somehow persisted for decades: when researchers analysed a meta-analysis of studies on young people eating sugar back in 1995, they concluded that “sugar does not affect the behaviour or cognitive performance of children”, suggesting that “the strong belief of parents may be due to expectancy and common association”. More recently, a2019 meta-analysisfound no mood-boosting effects from carbohydrates (including sugar), and noted that it “was associated with higher levels of fatigue and less alertness compared with [the] placebo within the first hour post-ingestion”. But even if our seemingly sugar-crazed darlings are actually just acting up in response to the placebo effect, or the fact that they’re at a party, the other problem is what happens after the insulin peak goes away and we experience a corresponding dip.View image in fullscreenA 2019 study found no mood-boosting effects from sugar.Photograph: Posed by model; Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images“We know fromresearch that we’ve done with our Zoe Predict cohortthat if people have that dip, they feel more hungry, and they tend to consume 80 calories more at their next meal, and 320 calories more over the day,” says Berry. “So if you have a breakfast that’s just carbohydrate it’s very likely to cause you to have a dip and you’ll end up eating more later.”This means that it’s not just how much sugar you eat: it’s about when you eat it, and how much. “We know blood sugar response is more favourable in the morning because you’re more insulin sensitive compared to the afternoon,” says Berry. “But our bodies are also better able to handle sugars if they’re being delivered as part of an overall balanced meal with heart-healthy fats and healthy proteins. By the way, this whole idea of trying to ‘flatline’ your glucose response that you see from some influencers is totally unnecessary: an increase in blood glucose is a normal physiological response to eating. We just need to make sure that it’s not excessive.”Why do people love spicy food – even when it hurts to eat it?Read moreThe takeaway? As a nation, we definitely eat more sugar than we need or can use. A recent study released by the Oral Health Foundation found that 84% of us eat at least one sugary snack daily, with 79% consuming “up to” three every day. It’s a good idea to eat less, but there’s no need to demonise or cut it out entirely: just enjoy it in moderation, preferably not too late in the day, and ideally alongside some fibre, healthy fat or protein.And if you’re tempted to skip this whole worrisome business by relying on sugar substitutes instead, that might not be the foolproof plan you’re hoping for. It was once thought that artificial sweeteners might cause your insulin to spike on their own or somehow “trick” your hunger hormones into making you famished, but neither of those things seem to be the case: actually, the problem happens in a different place.“There’ssome emerging evidencethat sweeteners like saccharin and sucralose can affect your oral and gut microbiome,” says Berry. “More research needs to be done to understand if there are also subsequent effects on other health outcomes in the long term, such as blood pressure, insulin resistance, and body weight. But it’s not a get out of jail free card.” It’s also possible, according toresearch published recently, that some sweeteners are actually converted to fructose in the body, triggering effects similar to regular sugar.Until the results are in, get some sweetness from sugar instead – that’s what we’ve evolved to do.

Further data shows the amount spent on private ADHD services has more than tripled over three years.Experts have warned that assessments provided by private providers can be unreliable, pointing to cases in which patients have been harmed by poor continuity of care after private diagnoses.Demand for ADHD assessments has reached record levels as awareness of the condition has increased and NHS services have become increasingly stretched, with more than half a million people now waiting for an assessment.Half of people recently arrested by Met police may have undiagnosed ADHD, study findsRead moreLast month the health secretary, Wes Streeting, announced a review into the diagnosis of mental health conditions such as ADHD, amid concern over the numbers of people with such conditions claiming sickness benefits.Research shared with the Guardian shows spending on ADHD services is estimated to reach £314m by April 2026, more than double the year’s budget of £150m set aside for this area of healthcare.The figures, which cover 32 of England’s 42 integrated care boards (ICBs), raise concerns that other services could face cuts to offset the £164m overspend.Nineteen ICBs also provided data on how much of their ADHD budget went on private companies, showing the NHS’s increasing reliance on outsourcing. It showed spending had more than tripled in three years, from £16.3m in 2022-23 to £58m last year. This has prompted concern that companies are making millions from what critics say is an under-regulated market.Due to how the data is collected, it could include some spending for other neurodiversity conditions as well as ADHD.The chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ADHD, Jo Platt, said the findings showed services were “at breaking point” and that NHS costs had “soared while private providers profit from poorly regulated systems, leaving too many patients in limbo without proper oversight”.The researchby theCentre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI) found one company – recently bought by a private equity firm – had reported profit margins of 33% over the past two years, mainly from providing NHS services. Another 14 companies delivered NHS-funded ADHD assessments without being registered with the Care Quality Commission.A further 19 companies that provided £1.9m worth of neurodiversity services over three years had no NHS contract at all, meaning local health bodies cannot properly hold them to account.Many NHS adult ADHD services in England have stopped taking on new patients due to high demand, so some turn to private providers via the right-to-choose pathway. This pathway lets patients pick their provider, including private ones, so they can bypass long local waitlists and get help faster.The CHPI report warns that, for business investors, the right-to-choose system is particularly easy to access. A company needs only one contract to treat patients anywhere in the country, and there is no cap on how much they can earn, because local NHS bodies cannot restrict patient numbers.The Guardian has uncovered cases of serious harm that appear to have been caused by problems with continuity of care after a private diagnosis.In January, a coroner issued a prevention of future deaths report on the death of 27-year-old Sheridan Pickett,who died by suicide after receiving an online ADHDdiagnosis and taking stimulant medication prescribed by a private clinic.When Pickett was later admitted to an NHS hospital after an overdose, doctors warned that the ADHD drugs should not be restarted, but that information was never passed back to the private provider, which continued prescribing.The coroner found there were no formal rules requiring information-sharing between private neurodevelopmental services and NHS teams, warning that without change similar deaths could occur.Separately, experts said the standard of assessments carried out by private companies was not always good enough. One NHS clinician, speaking anonymously, said: “I do some private work myself, but I ensure that everything I produce aligns with NHS and nationally agreed quality standards for ADHD assessments.“Some private providers do deliver good-quality assessments, but I’d estimate that around 70-80% do not, and there are certain ones I simply won’t work with when I see their name on the report.”Andrew Jay founded the neurodiversity support platform Divergence after becoming frustrated with traditional ADHD care models. He said: “In a recent audit of assessments, including those of ‘right to choose’ providers, being sent for transfer to Divergence … 6% met our standards which are based on UK Adult ADHD Network quality assessment standards, the closest we have to a fixed standard for assessment reports.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “No one with ADHD should be left without clear clinical oversight or feeling in limbo about their care. We have launched an independent review to examine how ADHD, mental health and autism services are delivered to help ensure patients can get the right support.“All providers, including those in the independent sector, must meet the same standards for patient safety and quality as the NHS. Where shared care arrangements cannot be agreed, responsibility for prescribing and ongoing oversight remains with the specialist clinician, whether NHS or private.”An NHS spokesperson said: “We know we have a lot to do to improve ADHD services and that patients wait too long for a diagnosis, which is why we commissioned an independent ADHD taskforce to consider how to improve care and service models.“We are carefully considering the recommendations of their recentreport, recognising the need for speedy improvement. Given some of the issues around variation in funding, NHS England has already started a consultation on supporting local systems to agree appropriate reimbursement for services.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandNHSHealthAttention deficit hyperactivity disordernewsShareReuse this content"

In answering questions about my association with Jeffrey Epstein I did not want to be held responsible for his crimes of which I was ignorant, not indifferent, because of the lies he told me and so many others.“I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.“I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the full truth about him after his death.“But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am truly sorry I was amongst those who believed him over them.”Lord Mandelson’s association with Epstein had long been known when Keir Starmer appointed the peer as US ambassador.However, he was removed from his diplomatic post after No 10 said it had been unaware of emails from Mandelson to Epstein suggesting the financier’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a child for prostitution was wrongful and should be challenged.Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 and served time in jail but Mandelson said he had believed his excuses and continued to support him out of “misplaced loyalty” and “a most terrible mistake on my part”.In his interview with BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the peer had sought to distance himself from Epstein, saying he was “at the edge of this man’s life”, despite “toe-curlingly embarrassing” emails showing his support and a birthday message describing him as his “best pal”.The interview was Mandelson’s first broadcast appearance since being sacked from his diplomatic role in Washington in September last year.He said: “I never saw anything in his life when I was with him, when I was in his homes, that would give me any reason to suspect what this evil monster was doing in preying on these young women.”He added: “I think the issue is that because I was a gay man in his circle, I was kept separate from what he was doing in the sexual side of his life.”In one of the emails released in September, Mandelson wrote to Epstein after his conviction saying: “I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened. I can still barely understand it.“It just could not happen in Britain. You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.”It continued: “Everything can be turned into an opportunity and that you will come through it and be stronger for it.”The friendship between the two men came under a renewed spotlight after Democratic members of the US House oversight committee released Epstein’s 50th “birthday book”, in which Mandelson called him “my best pal”in a handwritten note.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

You have to be in the room to tackle the issues working people care about.“The cost-of-living crisis will not be solved by isolationism. You cannot deliver peace in Ukraine without being in the room. And you do not secure trade terms for companies like JLR by putting gesture politics first.”After Starmer kicked off the new year with a charm offensive to win over disgruntled MPs, some in No 10 believe his international role has the potential to bolster his leadership, encouraging MPs intent on removing him to pause during global turmoil.Adopting a more upbeat tone about the country’s future, he listed a series of positive changes already delivered on the NHS, wages, crime and infrastructure.“Britain will see change and renewal this year. Our country is moving in the right direction,” he said.He added: “With each change we make for the better, we show working people something even more important.“That decline can be reversed. Opportunity and pride can be restored. The future can be better for them and their families. And politics can be a force for good.”Starmer, who spent the final months of last year dogged by leadership speculation, has been trying to improve relations with Labour MPs by inviting them to Downing Street and Chequers for events, and spending more time meeting them in parliament.He sought to rally his cabinet last week, telling them to ignore the polls and prepare to take on Reform UK.But the latest YouGov poll put the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since the general election, both of them behind Reform, with Labour on just 17%.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourUK cost of living crisisForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

And we ask that the courts will end the surge of thousands of DHS agents in Minnesota.”“The deployment of thousands of armed DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is in essence a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said during a press conference, noting the shutdown of schools and the closure of local businesses. “This surge has made us less safe.”A motion for a temporary restraining order will be filed today ahead of the lawsuit, said assistant attorney general Brian Carter.Ellison described the federal agents as poorly trained, and contrasted them with the training ofMinneapolispolice, noting that local police have had to respond to 20 instances of ICE agents’ apparent abduction of Minneapolis residents.“They’re making unconstitutional arrests and using excessive force,” Ellison said. “DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas. And when asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they respond, ‘We don’t need one.’ This has to stop. Let’s be clear; this should have never started.”In the press conference, AC Thompson of PBS Frontline asked if the lawsuit aimed at restraining the use of crowd control weapons. “My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said. “Are you aiming to do anything about them?”Ellison encouraged Thompson to file a complaint and “make sure people know what happened to you and your crew … The press is protected by the first amendment and is vitally important in this moment when freedom of the press and every first amendment right is under a threat.”Ellison noted that Minnesota’s noncitizen immigrant population is just 1½ percent, “which is half the national average. Our state’s percentage is lower than Utah, Texas, and Florida’s,” he said, suggesting that theTrump administrationhas targeted Minnesota out of political bias.Ellison also alluded to Minnesota and its Somali immigrant population coming under vitriolic attacks from the White House and rightwing media after a series of social services fraud cases drew conservative attention in recent weeks.“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to like our state very much,” Ellison added.The Twin Cities’ response to a surge of thousands of federal agents has taxed the law enforcement capacity of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, each of which has about 600 police officers, said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis.“We don’t use the word invasion lightly,” he said. “The stated reason of this federal government for bringing in this full invasion of ice and border control is not safety. If it were safety, there would be other mechanisms to achieve safety.“If this were about fraud, then you’d see an invasion perhaps of accountants. But that’s not what you see. What you see is people being indiscriminately taken off our streets.”Kaohly Her, mayor of Saint Paul and a Hmong-American immigrant, also spoke at the conference and said she was now carrying her passport card and ID with her all the time.“Because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained,” she said. “When I’m going to be approached, the fact is that the tactics don’t even at this point really matter right? It’s the fact that we are being attacked as American citizens right now.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaMinneapolisICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I keep thinking it’s just a horrible dream and I’m going to wake up and none of this is real.“Everyone has said he was the gentlest soul. Nobody had a bad word to say against him. He was so hard-working. He did everything for his family. Nothing held him back and he taught himself everything. I’m just so confused; why has this happened to us?”Humayra said she had watched CCTV of the crash against the advice of the police. “The police advised me against it but I had to see it,” she said. “It’s clear who was at fault … it’s clear that my dad wasn’t at fault and didn’t do anything wrong.”Four of Ali’s passengers remain in hospital, including a 29-year-old woman who sustained life-threatening injures, a 28-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man who were seriously injured, and a 29-year-old man who had minor injuries.All but one of those travelling in the Seat died. The only survivor, an 18-year-old man, is being treated in hospital for injuries.DI Andrew Page, of Greater Manchester police, urged anyone who witnessed the crash – or the driving of the Seat beforehand – to contact the force.He said: “We are still in the early stages of our investigation and work is ongoing to establish the full circumstances of this terrible incident.“As an investigation team, we would encourage people to be mindful of sharing footage on social media given the impact this will have on all the families involved in such a tragic incident.”Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Given he was sacked for his dodgy tax affairs, this was never going to happen,” a Tory source said. “His defection tells you everything you need to know about Reform being a repository for disgraced politicians.”The Tories said the politician had got in touch with them, rather than the other way round. They pointed out that he joined Reform just weeks after Badenoch released her latest political honours list, on which he did not feature.“While he wasn’t rudely rebuffed by us, he was never going to be made a peer,” the source added. “His defection came at a time that it was apparent he wasn’t going to get one.”Appearing alongside Farage in London, the former chancellor said he had let his Tory membership lapse in December before deciding to join Reform, which he said he was doing because the UK needed “a glorious revolution”. He had been promised no specific role in Reform and was joining as a “foot soldier”, he added.Zahawi, who stood down as the MP for Stratford-on-Avon at the last election, was sacked in 2023 as Conservative party chair by Rishi Sunak after he was found to have breached the ministerial code by failing to declare an HMRC investigation into his tax affairs.Zahawi cited concerns about what he saw as threats to freedom of speech, the imposition of high taxes and the “big state”. Nick Candy, Reform’s treasurer and a personal friend, acted as a bridge and Farage said the party would be looking to the former MP to help bring in new donations.Zahawi said: “My analysis is that a huge culprit is the over-mighty bureaucratic inertia that now dominates and runs the country, that has taken control of swathes of the economy and, with barely a shrug of the shoulders, restricts the individual liberty of each and every one of us.“We can all see that our beautiful, ancient, kind, magical island story has reached a dark and dangerous chapter.”However, he was repeatedly forced to defend Farage over allegations of racism and antisemitism, saying he would not be sitting beside him if he believed he had a “racist bone in his body”.Thirty-four school contemporaries of Farage have come forwardto claim they saw him behave in a racist or antisemitic manner, leading to questions over the Reform leader’s evolving denials.A now-deleted tweet from 2015 was also brought up, in which Zahawi had written: “I’m not British born mr Nigel_Farage. I am as British as u r. Yr comments r offensive & racist. I wld be frightened 2 live in a country run by U.”When questioned about this tweet on Monday, Zahawi said: “If I thought this man sitting next to me in any way had an issue with people of my colour or my background who have come to this country, who have integrated, assimilated, are proud of this country, worked hard in this country, paid millions of pounds in taxes in this country, invested in the country, I wouldn’t be sitting next to him.”The tweet appeared to have been in response to a broadcast interview in 2015 in which Farage was asked if he was in favour of keeping laws that ban employment discrimination on the grounds of race or colour. Farage answered “no” though later claimed he had been “wilfully misrepresented”.Zahawi alsowrote a piecefor the website ConservativeHome at the time, under the headline: “In Farage’s Britain, it would be legal to discriminate against me on the grounds of race.”The Reform leader said Zahawi’s arrival would help to bolster the party’s credentials as a serious contender for government, adding: “Our weakness is that we lack frontline experience. People like Nadhim have been on the inside. They know how government works or how government does not work.”Zahawi also attempted to brush aside questions about Reform-linked figures who had expressed vaccine-sceptic views, including Aseem Malhotra, a British doctor whorepeated a claim at Reform’s annual conference last Septemberthat Covid vaccines were likely a “factor in the cancers in the royal family”.The former MP, who oversaw the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine when he served in Boris Johnson’s government, described questions about the claims as “stupid”.“I would not be sitting here, nor would Nigel be sitting next to me, if we didn’t agree that we did the right thing for the nation to get the vaccine programme to the success that it achieved,” he added.Anna Turley, the Labour party chair, said of the defection: “This confirms what we already knew: Reform UK has no shame.Nadhim Zahawiis a discredited and disgraced politician who will be for ever tied to the Tories’ shameful record of failure in government.“Zahawi himself has previously repeatedly lambasted his new boss over his divisive and extreme rhetoric – and Farage has said that Zahawi has no principles and is only interested in climbing the greasy pole.”Explore more on these topicsNadhim ZahawiReform UKConservativesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Rowley, theMetropolitan policecommissioner, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, say figures show their policies and plans are working, which are best summed up as tough on crime, tough on the complex causes of crime.Has the Met turned a corner and can Khan shake off claims he presides over a city where crime is out of control?How noteworthy are the homicide figures in London?Accurate homicide data held by the Met goes back to 1997, and the total number of murders in London last year was 97, the second lowest on record.The lowest was in 2014, when 95 homicides were recorded, but claims that last year’s total amounts to a record comes from the fact that the city’s population is estimated to be half a million bigger, at 9.09 million people. That gives a homicide rate of 1.07 per 100,000 people in 2025 versus 1.11 in 2014.Murders of people aged 25 or under were down from 54 in 2019 to 18 last year. For teenagers it was down from 30 in 2021, to eight in 2025. Crime statistics are notorious for telling different stories but the sense of a drop of serious violence in the capital is bolstered by NHS data. Over the past five years the number of people admitted to hospital after being stabbed was down 29%, from 1,350 to 955.In truth, crime figures can go up and down and the reasons usually elude those running the key parts of the criminal justice system.What part have police played?In an interview with the Guardian, the Met’s head of homicide, Commander Paul Brogden, says police had not simply “arrested their way” out of the problem.One key development, says Brogden, is that in the last four years police have become better at exploiting data from mobile phones to know who the “bad people” are and who is associating with whom.The Met would say its intelligence is better and it has become more focused, for instance homing in on drug dealers whose trade inherently relies on violence. More guns and knives have been seized. But policing tactics are enforcement, which are at best suppressive. Brogden is clear that preventive work has been key.What part have others played?The fall in homicides coincides with Khan setting up a violence reduction unit for the capital in 2019,loosely modelled on one established in Glasgow.It worked to understand the causes of violence and repair some of the damaged social fabric that had been lost during austerity, such as youth workers who could talk to those engaged in violence to get them to change their path.Some of the results claimed are staggering. Placing youth workers in police custody centres and talking to people as they faced chargeshad a 90% success ratein diverting them from further offending within 12 months of the intervention.Why do some people claim London is lawless?A longtime attack line against centre-left administrations is that they are soft on crime.Khan won London’s mayoralty for Labour in 2016 and some of the claims are aimed at him. But for the radical right, London is seen as an example of a multicultural Britain, which they sense offers them political capital in attacking by claiming to be plagued by crime. Also more recently, the far right has tried to link ethnicity and immigration to crime to increase its political fortunes. More than than 40% of London’s residents are from minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2021 census.Away from politics, people’s experience of crime is personal. The Met, while consistently solving homicides, does less well with other crimes that more people are likely to experience, such as robbery, burglary and car theft.What do the Met and mayor want?Khan knows Reform UK is hoping to win councils in London in local elections in May with a key message that crime is out of control.As a former human rights lawyer, he will see the homicide figures as a validation for a more thoughtful approach that works with communities rather than inflict coercive tactics such as wide-scale stop and search.For Rowley, his force is only recently out of special measures for poor performance and faces a host of problems. He will hope the homicide figures help cement a sense that the scandal-hit Met is on its way back as a competent force, rather than a source of scandals.But as ever, both are at the mercy of events.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonPoliceMetropolitan policeSadiq KhanLocal electionsLocal politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

He never went to school or university but taught himself, through reading and friendships with artistic, bohemian rural residents, particularly the artists John and Christine Nash. He published more than 40 books in his lifetime, including social history, fiction, poetry, rural nature writing and essays.Helen Melody, the lead curator for contemporary literary and creative archives at theBritish Library, said: “We are delighted to haveacquired Ronald Blythe’s archive, which will be a wonderful resource for Blythe scholars and those interested in the societal and cultural changes that Blythe’s work chronicled.”According to Melody, the archive offers “an amazing insight into the century he lived through because he did a lot of reflecting backwards as well as thinking about contemporary events too”.Blythe’s papers reveal the depths of his research for Akenfield, which tells the vivid and unvarnished story of a Suffolk village through the voices of its inhabitants, young and old. He writes to the Ministry of Agriculture to obtain records of the cows and geese kept in the village of Charsfield, his model for fictionalised Akenfield, while his index cards show he spoke to hundreds of people, seeking out everyone from otter hunters to commuters to create a kaleidoscopic and authentic account of rural life.His notebooks show how his interviews were written up immediately afterwards, almost always from memory, according to Collins.View image in fullscreenBlythe pictured in 1983. He published more than 40 books in his lifetime.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty Images“He listened very, very attentively and he had this incredible memory because he’d been so watchful as a child, and he was very good at catching his interviewees’ voice,” said Collins. “All his books are true but it’s a deeper and broader truth than verbatim. That’s why Akenfield resonates because it’s not just 49 interviews from that period; it’s as though Thomas Hardy was interviewing them. Oral history tells us what people did; Ronnie tells us what people are.”The archive reveals Blythe’s frugality, with the writer reusing index cards, and paper, and cramming as many neat words as possible into each cheap school notebook. Collins said his habits went to the heart of his “genius” as a writer, too. “It’s so neat because he knows that paper is precious, ink is precious and words are precious. Every word has to work so he’s constantly revisiting and honing it down to get the essence of it all. There’s no waste. He hates waste. You’d think that would make him into a puritan but we know from his life he wasn’t that at all – he was a hedonist.”Blythe was a hermetic figure wholived alone on the Essex borderfor most of his life and held a sturdy Anglican faith butCollins’s biographyrevealed his sociability and uninhibited gay sex life, even in rural East Anglia in an era when homosexuality was outlawed.This Blythe is found in the archive’s collection of letters from the American novelist Patricia Highsmith. “Ron” and “Pat” struck up an unlikely friendship andeven slept with each otheron one experimental occasion.The archive includes letters from fans in the US, where Akenfield was a surprise bestseller, and the occasional critical note, such as a missive from the Earl of Stradbroke who criticised Blythe for the honesty of his depictions of the friction, exploitation and misery in neo-feudal relationships between lords, landowners and farm labourers.“Those of us whose families have for generations cared for Suffolk are, I am sure you will understand, jealous that its good name should not be smirched,” wrote Stradbroke.In a characteristically polite but steely reply, Blythe wrote: “Akenfield was never intended to be a public relations exercise for Suffolk but a statement about human nature in the context where I most understood it.”Collins added: “Ronnie was endlessly kind, endlessly gentle and he’s endlessly tough.“It’s an important archive for Britain. He was a humble person but he knew his worth and he always said his papers should go to the British Library. It’s such a rich archive, he is a writers’ writer but also the writer for every person – you can recommend Ronald Blythe to anybody.”Explore more on these topicsBooksBritish LibraryRural affairsSuffolkEssexHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

As unusual as it all felt for the young actor, those who know him say his passion was there from the start.Esther Morgan, who co-foundedthe Drama Mobwith Coronation Street actor Tina O’Brien, taught Cooper and says it was obvious he was a talent from the outset.“You could tell he definitely wanted it,” she says. “He wasn’t messing around when it came to listening, taking direction and learning his lines.”‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreMorgan admits that the school could not prepare him for this level of success but has pushed back at the narrative that Cooper “came from nowhere”.He had had two years with the Drama Mob before the Adolescence casting process, which involved several rounds and initially had more of Morgan’s students in the running. But Cooper left an impression oncasting director Shaheen Baig. “His name just kept coming back,” says Morgan.Co-writer Jack Thorne said that the first time he worked with Cooper was in rehearsals for episode three, the show’s intense interview between the teenager and a psychologist, played byErin Doherty.“He came in word perfect and ready to work, but it was a lot of pressure,” says Thorne. “Slowly but surely – with help from [director] Philip Barantini and Erin – he sort of subsumed himself. By Friday he was Jamie.”Cooper’s former teacher is a passionate advocate for northern actors, who are competing on an increasingly uneven playing field. Anexodus from Hollywoodhas made London a more attractive hub for studios, which is further centralising an industry where more than half of all productions happen in the capital.Morgan says northern actors, including the next Cooper, are being cut out.“More shows need to be made and produced up here,” she says. “We need more casting directors working here because for some of our young people they don’t have the funds to travel up and down to London for castings.”That isn’t the only challenge facing the next Cooper.On stage at the Golden Globes, Cooper said he was the only boy in his class at drama school and it was “embarrassing”. Morgan says there is a “huge drop-off” in boys attending her classes once they go to high school and pursuits such as football and rugby take over. Acting can be seen as a soft, or – to use gen Z terminology – “cringe”.That is backed up statistically too, with 17,000 boys taking GCSE drama in the UK in 2025, compared with 35,700 girls, with a similar ratio at A-level. But Morgan says Cooper’s success is already affecting that dynamic.“Since Owen going on to be so successful, we have had more boys coming to drama,” says Morgan.“I think he’s helped with that [by] having that role model of saying, ‘yeah, I went to drama classes, I gave it a go’. I think that really has helped some of those boys to just kind of go out the comfort zone.”Much has been made of Adolescence being onNetflixand the huge audience it has reached. In the week it launched its initial episode pulled in 6.45 million viewers, while the second recorded 5.9 million – breaking UK records in the process.But at its core the show is a gritty, distinctly northern drama. Most of the principal cast, like Cooper and Stephen Graham, are from the north-west. It was shot on location in Pontefract and Sheffield.Thorne is cautiously optimistic it could usher in a new wave of working-class British dramas that traditionally have not travelled well internationally. “I know from trying to sell stuff I’ve made abroad before that accents and British ‘issues’ were not seen as having an audience abroad,” he says.“But who knows? TV remains quite a conservative industry and they may go back to thinking a man speaking inRPon a horse is a better bet.”Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceDramaNetflixGolden GlobesGolden Globes 2026featuresShareReuse this content"

He had been joking – but the women enthusiastically agreed.In any other room, a comedian asking the audience to fall asleep would have been career ruining. In the world of baby-friendly comedy clubs, however, it was a masterstroke.“We all just had a little nap together,” Page said. Afterwards, the four comics on the bill scribbled jokes on scraps of paper and handed them out “so the mums could memorise them and pretend to their friends they had actually been to a comedy set”.The ruse wasn’t the only success; Page later found the mums had taken it to the next level, posting five-star reviews online, declaring it the best show they had ever been to.View image in fullscreenHatty Ashdown performing with onstage guest.Photograph: suppliedAcross the UK, baby-friendly comedy clubs are springing up, offering daytime shows where parents can bring their infants without fear of judgment or eviction. They run on a simple premise: comedy in daylight hours. Feeding encouraged. The occasional meltdown guaranteed and babies free to stage small revolutions.The clubs are sellout successes. But for performers, it can be a disorientating experience. Bristol’s Aftermirth gigs are regularly sold out but the comedians frequently come off stage uncertain of their success.“I have to explain to performers that new mothers aren’t raucous because they’ve just had nine months of obesity, three days of pain, no sleep for months – and probably still have stitches in their perineum,” said founder Angie Belcher. “I comfort them that the mums are probably smiling on the inside though.”Frankie B founded Milk ClubComedyin Bingley when her baby was just a month old. Her first four shows sold out and she had to move to a bigger venue.Despite the club’s success, she said, performers could find the room hard to read: “New mothers can be harder to gauge than your usual audience because they’re bringing complex baggage with them.”The mother-and-baby club Screaming With Laughter was started by comedians with young babies who refused to give up performing. Hatty Ashdown took it over when her own baby was six months old. She too has watched headline acts come unstuck.“It’s interesting to see big comics failing to capture the attention of distracted mothers,” she said. “New parents aren’t looking for clever, enigmatic jokes with long pauses. To get them, you’ve got to be totally funny bones and high energy.”View image in fullscreenComedian Julie Jepson onstage with child.Photograph: Colin MoodyHarriet Beveridge said she loves performing at mum-and-baby gigs. For her, the experience strips comedy back to its essence. “You have to give up the arrogance and egocentric nature of being a comedian, where you want all the attention all the time because you absolutely are going to be upstaged,” she said.“I had a joke that always went down brilliantly about a baby snack that looked like a Tampax. I was doing it one gig when a toddler rushed on stage, grabbed the snack out of my hand and ate it. And there you are: best joke. Upstaged by a toddler.”But she relishes such unpredictability. “I have a Rolodex of jokes for every occasion but it’s stretched to the limit when there’s a poo explosion in the front row,” she said. “How do you bring a parent with you who’s dealing with that?”Angela Garwood, co-host of London’s Every Other Mother, doesn’t even mind when babies pelt her with Lego. “The chaos is completely welcome,” she said. “How boring if all the children sat there perfectly.”For Julie Jepson, the gigs are the highlight of her schedule. “Last time, a little girl wandered into my spotlight, took my microphone and licked it like an ice-cream. She stole the show but I forgave her because she was so sweet.”Sally McIlhone left a senior corporate job to co-found Every Other Mother after having a baby. “The comedians who go down best are those who’ve come out of the other side of the baby trench,” she said. “They can give new mothers hope that their toddler will stop melting down. On the other hand, they’ll then become teenagers who give you lip.”For Page, however, the gigs aren’t so different from others he has done. “These are gigs where people will cry, scream, probably won’t care you’re there, might shit themselves and will probably get a tit out,” he said. “It’s like doing a gig in Portsmouth in the old days.”Explore more on these topicsComedyParents and parentingChildrenWomenFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s cold, it’s dark, everyone’s broke and our collective serotonin is running low. Which is why, this year, we’re proposing two equally valid paths – and suggesting we stop pretending we have to choose just one.In one camp are the “new year, new routine” fanatics, the people you’ll find smashing a 6am workout, clutching a protein shake (theclear, pea isolate onesthat are almost like a protein squash have been brilliant for me) and claiming, with suspicious enthusiasm, that theylovethe feeling of their lungs burning in winter air. And honestly? Good for them. A reset can feel energising, and the right fitness tech, supplements and morning rituals can make this commitment easier and more appealing. If you’re craving structure, momentum or the promise of a fresh start,we’ve got the kit for you.Relax and restoreHowever, equally persuasive – and, I’d argue, just as productive – is the counter-movement: the cosy, analogue, sofa enthusiasts. The people treating winter as nature intended: a time to hibernate and recalibrate. This isn’t laziness, it’s strategic restoration. The kind your nervous system actually needs after a year that felt like collective whiplash.Think silk pillowcases, weighted blankets and chai that feels like a hug in a mug.Maybe what 2026 demands is more balance, as the once-rigid line between self-improvement and self-preservation begins to blur. Maybe the mornings are about necking a post-run smoothie on the go, but by evening, you’re slipping intoa hoodie so soft it feels prescribed, before lighting a candle, grabbing a journal and sinking underthat weighted blanket.Both approaches count as self-care; both recognise that wellness isn’t a single lane but a negotiation between energy and rest. So, whether January finds yousprinting into a new routineorburrowing into the cosiest version of yourself, consider this your permission to commit fully, oscillate wildly or hover comfortably in the middle.This week’s picksThe best exercise bikes for home workouts, spin and getting sweaty, tested‘A sign to change your technique’: how to make your toothbrush last longer – and keep it out of landfillI tried 75 low- and no-alcohol drinks: here are my favourite beers, wines and spiritsHow to dress in cold weather: 10 stylish and cosy updates for winterThe big freeze: 21 winter essentials to get you through the cold snap‘A classic citric-forward twang and complex flavour’: the best supermarket marmalade, tasted and ratedEditor’s pickView image in fullscreenThe Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150 is now our favourite sunrise alarm clockWhether you’re going to the gym or not aiming any further than the kettle, getting out of bed can be a struggle at this time of year.

But we soon made up – and wrote this about the process’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 12 Jan 2026 10.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.15 ESTShareTom Bailey, singer, songwriter, bass, guitar, keyboardsThompson Twins were a seven-piece, rag-bag, guitar-based band living in a squat when I met Alannah Currie, who was also squatting in London. She was in an anarchic improv band, the Unfuckables, who were clearly not destined for Top of the Pops, but there was something very exciting about her. When I invited her to come on at the end of a Thompson Twins gig, she stole the show.We slimmed down to a three-piece with Alannah, Joe Leeway [keyboards, percussion, vocals] and myself. Suddenly we were a recognisable trio who could all fit in one car. After I bought a synthesiser, our trackIn the Name of Lovebecame a dance/club sensation, which opened doors in America. Until then, we’d always vaguely hoped our music would do well, but after that we thought: “Why don’t we actually design it to do well?”We'd fill eggs with black paint and throw them at sexist advertsHold Me Now came about after we’d gone off to write songs in some house somewhere and had a creative disagreement that spilled over into personal insults. But behind that was real affection and a relationship we’d kept secret from the press. We soon made up and immediately wrote Hold Me Now about that process. The song came very easily. It felt more mature than the clubby stuff. It was slower, heartfelt, more emotional, and being about real stuff gave it authenticity.I was keen to record it as soon as possible but Alex Sadkin, our regular producer, wasn’t available, so I went into RAK Studios and recorded most of it myself, something I’d never done before. Alex came in at the end and wanted to redo some of the vocals. Joe and I shared the falsetto bits. We knew we were on to something because everyone who heard it said it was going to be a big hit, including the BBC.We released it in November 1983 because in those days everyone wanted a Christmas No 1. We were away recording at Compass Point in the Bahamas when Hold Me Now came out and had very little contact with the outside world. We came out of those sessions to find it racing up the charts, then it just became this monster hit.Alannah Currie, singer, songwriter, percussionI remember a van pulling up outside with all this gear and the whole band moving into a really bad squat opposite mine. When Tom gave me a lift to the tube, we hit it off straight away. In those days, loads of bands came from the squat scene: you had free housing, you’d bunk the tube and have the run of London.The Unfuckables only did one gig but we were wild feminists who’d fill eggs with black paint and throw them at sexist adverts. We were fearless. Once I joined the Twins, we only had each other so really went for it. I was a woman musician at a time when there weren’t many and Joe was Black, so we got a hard time.Everybody focused on Tom, who’d had classical training – while we were dirty punks. But we always tried to find the common ground between the three of us. I remember us all sitting in my squat deciding we wanted to be a new type of band – synthesisers and drum machines brought incredible freedom. After being broke for so long, suddenly we could do what we wanted: try to make amazing records.Hold Me Now is basically a letter from me to Tom, and him to me, with interjections from Joe. I never had “a picture, pinned to my wall”, but that lyric was inspired by a photo-booth picture of me and Tom snogging, which I kept inside my writing book. I scrawled most of the lyrics down like a love letter, one of those frenzied things you do to find out what you’re really thinking. Then we tailored the words as if they were coming from Tom, because he’d be singing it.Everything was done so quickly it was absolutely from the heart. Then the song just seemed to take on a life of its own. It was such a huge, bombastic, painful but madly great time in our lives. Tom and I have two children together but while we’re no longer a couple, or a band, but all three of us are like family and stay in touch. Occasionally, I’ll hear Hold Me Now playing somewhere and my heart just goes: “Ohh.”Industry & Seduction: A Thompson Twins Collection is out now on three CD deluxe set, coloured vinyl two LP set and CD.Tom Bailey tours the UK in SeptemberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

People with “unc status”.Oh no, this is some new slang I need to learn, isn’t it? I’m still struggling withsix-seven.Maybe join the other uncs and Google it? According to the language-learning platformPreply, “the word ‘unc’ now pulls in5.9 million monthly searches” and searches for “unc meaning” are up 74%.I don’t need to search “unc meaning”, I’ve got you. So whatdoesit mean?Older, basically –gen Alpha are using it to address anyone older than them. “Unc” got amplified after a viral TikTok last July in which the content creatorRiley Hardwicksaid he “just found out I’m chopped, and also unc”, after chaperoning kids at a school prom.Chopped?Ugly. But don’t get distracted – the point is unc.Right. Unc. Tell me more.Well, the A-list are getting in on the act. Last month, Sabrina Carpenter referred to the producer Jack Antonoff as unc (plus heart emoji). Then babyfaced Hollywood superstar Timothée Chalamet called himself “unc” in one of his excitable all-caps Instagram posts to mark his 30thbirthday. “TIMMYTIM IS OFFICIALLY UNC”.I have just consulted youngChalamet’s Instagram and it’s exhaustingly high energy. How can he be ‘OFFICIALLY UNC’?Remember, 30 is ancient for gen Alpha. On Instagram,one teacherasked his teen students how old you needed to be for unc status and one of them said20.Also, “Anyone … can be called ‘unc’ if they carry a certain older-sibling or uncle-like energy,” according to Preply.I see. And what are the signs you have “uncle-like energy”?Watching Friends.Knowing the Black Eyed Peas’ I Gotta Feeling.Being baffled by six-seven.Rude. So is unc the new “OK, boomer”?AReddit threadpondered exactly this recently, but there’s a difference in tone. As a Preply spokesperson explained, using kinship language is a form of “linguistic softening”. Calling someone unc is “more playful than confrontational. It can signal respect, familiarity or gentle teasing rather than dismissal.”That’s sweet. Hang on, though, don’t lots of cultures use “auntie” and “uncle” to address older adults who aren’t blood relatives respectfully?Very much so – inAsia and Africa particularly. “Unc” has also been around for a long time inAfrican American Vernacular English(thoughopinions differon how respectful or derogatory it can be). Some content creators have pulled kids up for using it wrongly. “I think y’all have the wrong definition,”one creator, @kaymcfly, says. “You’re calling people unc and they’re not even over 30.”Sogen Alpha might have culturally appropriated unc?Arguably, yes.I’m shook.No one says that any more, unc.Do say:“If you need to ask what ‘unc’ means, you are one.”Don’t say: “That’s Mr Uncle to you, show some respect.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesSocial mediaTikTokDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

She says Greenland is not a big deal (a “second-order issue” is how she described it to the BBC) – itisa big deal. She says net zero is too expensive – the opposite is true: net-anything-but-zero is a cost we can’t afford.But her promise to ban under-16s from using social media, echoing Australia’s recent move, is hard to write off completely; people across the spectrum, including Andy Burnham, agree with it. Nobody who has ever met a teenager, or read the news, will be completely at ease with the role of social media in young lives. There are horrific effects, which have been well documented and inadequately addressed ever since thedeath of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.Many platforms, even those that seem anodyne, are purpose-built to spur anxiety, self-doubt, self-harm, anything that delivers attention. We have this completely contradictory environment in which a nine-year-old can’t walk to school alone without turning into grist for a radio phone-in about parental neglect, and yet tech companies with a record of generating emotional distress for profit are allowed access to children’s bedrooms. Grok can generate sexualised images of children on demand, and the UK government calls it a matter for Ofcom.The asymmetry of acceptable risk between the real world and the virtual, even while we can see that online harms show up soon enough in lived experience, is inexplicable. It must be more baffling still if you happen to be under 16, working on the assumption that the adults telling you what to do must know what they’re talking about.Even at the milder end, a lot of social media apps seem designed to mess with a young mind. Take the problems created by location services, whereby kids are able to see one another’s whereabouts 24/7, so discovering in real time what they haven’t been invited to and what their ex-best friend is up to; or the intolerable body-image pressure of a life lived in selfies; or the stress of the streak (a chain of back-and-forth messages or pictures), friendships torched by a slow reply.To anybody still using X: sexual abuse content is the final straw, it’s time to leave | Marie Le ConteRead moreIn short, not everything is wrong with Badenoch’s idea; only two things. First, if there’s one thing more ridiculous than taking a corporate failure and throwing it to the individual to solve, by self-discipline reinforced by legislation, it is doing so to under-16s. If a corporation is selling radical misogyny and methods for self-harm – because what else are they going to do, disappoint shareholders? – that is not for a 12-year-old to fix by turning off their phone and taking up crochet. It’s not for a parent to fix, either, by instituting a load of screen limits and parental blocks; even if you enjoy that side of things, it shouldn’t be up to you to fill late-capitalism’s moral void. You could make the case for government intervention, but only if it had time on its hands after tackling the problem at source.Second, while young people are unarguably the target of so much manipulative content, to discuss online risks without mentioning older people is frankly perverse. An X user recently asked Grok to identifymisinformation super-spreaderson the site from the UK, and probably the youngest among them were Tommy Robinson, 43, and Darren Grimes, 32.. This was data crunched from Amnesty, Global Witness and the BBC, among others, and helpfully built a list of accounts most likely to promulgate untruth or conspiracy, with the caveat it was “subjective and depends on sources”: Nigel Farage, Laurence Fox, Julia Hartley-Brewer, George Galloway, Katie Hopkins, David Icke. None are of a tender age. Between Gen X miscreants and hyper-credulous boomers, there are generations that pose a greater risk to, and are themselves at risk from, the informational ecosystem. Any thinking politician needs to work out how to deal with them.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionSocial mediaYoung peopleMental healthSnapchatXGrok AIcommentShareReuse this content"

No, it’s just naked opportunismHenry HillThe former chancellor’s criticism of the Tory government is indisputable – but so is his role in its dire recordMon 12 Jan 2026 10.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 11.47 ESTShareDefections always pose a messaging dilemma for political parties. Heap too much ordure on the turncoat, and you invite the question of why you were happy to share a tent with them in the first place; praise them too highly, and you exacerbate whatever damage the defection is doing to you.In the Conservatives’ case, this problem is compounded for journalists by the hyperinflation in key posts. A “former chancellor of the exchequer” sounds like a big deal, and historically it would have been. But in the five years of the last parliament there were no fewer than five chancellors (Margaret Thatcher, across her entire 11-year premiership, had three).So how do we assess this one? Nadhim Zahawi held several cabinet-level positions under the previous government, but none of them for very long. The most sustained stint was education secretary (September 2021 to July 2022), and the most memorable event of that year was thedramatic scrapping of a schools billthat, it turned out, to the apparent surprise of ministers, would have rolled back much of the Tories’ education reform agenda.Perhaps that experience explainsZahawi’s emphasis, at Reform UK’s press conference today, on the need “to take back control from the rich powers of the unelected bureaucracy”. But it doesn’t obviously commend him as the man to do so.At a basic level, all but the most unusual defection is bad for the party being left. Beyond the obvious optical problems it creates, even the departure of the most shameless opportunist says something about the direction in which they think opportunity lies.Moreover, the effect of these things compounds over time: the more people leave, the greater the overall impression of people leaving and the more people who start to think about leaving. So we should be clear that, whatever caveats may apply, this and most other defections from the Tory party are bad for the Tory party.Howbad is a different, more difficult and much more interesting question. One of the problems with covering defections as a journalist is that there is often either great temptation or great pressure (sometimes both) to slot a defection neatly into a grand narrative: “What does this mean for the Tories/Labour?”But at the personal level – and there are few things more personal than changing teams – politics is rarely a question purely, or even mainly, decided by big-picture ideological criteria. All manner of other factors – an individual’s ambitions but also their actual personal relationships on either side of whatever line they are crossing – make a big difference.Only Zahawi truly knows the balance of these factors behind this decision (Tory sources claim it was hisrepeated failure to secure a peeragefrom Kemi Badenoch’s office,which Zahawi denies).But what we outside observers can note is that nothing in his defection speech highlighted any great ideological schism; you will not find Badenoch (or Robert Jenrick, for that matter) offering paeans to the administrative state. His choice of Reform UK is framed therefore as a question of who is best placed to deliver on this (as yet largely unwritten) agenda.On this, Zahawi was not persuasive. That the Conservatives’ record on managing the state was dire, especially between 2019 and 2024, is difficult to dispute. But that does not mean that Farage, whose various parties have contrived to wreak a great deal of change without ever having to actually run anything, is going to do any better. Too many Reform enthusiasts talk as if proving the case against the Conservatives necessarily proves a case for their own party, when it is sadly but obviously true that both are quite capable of disappointing us at the same time.This defection also highlights a difficulty for Reform. A party whose stated objective is to bury the Tories needs to appeal to voters who turfed the Tories out in 2024, and89 of the 98 seats in which it finished secondat the last election are held by Labour. It needs to be quite careful about the extent to which it allows itself to be populated by former Tories.Because Zahawi’s argument today – that the Conservatives can’t be trusted to fix the state because they didn’t manage it last time – doesn’t stop applying to him just because he’s swapped his rosette. A change of heart by a politician can be extremely powerful if accompanied by a sincere mea culpa (as was Keith Joseph’sduring the Tories’ last revolution). But there was no sign of any of that on stage today.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The chair ofthe US Federal Reserveresponded tonews of a subpoena from the US Department of Justicewith a statement that was extraordinary, necessary and stark.A criminal investigation into the Fed, and him personally, over the renovation of the central bank’s headquarters is an attempt to bully officials into setting policy according to the president’s whims,said Powell.“This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said.Justice department opens investigation into Jerome Powell as Trump ramps up campaign against Federal ReserveRead moreIt definitely needed to be spelled out. It is one thing forDonald Trumpto whine and hurl insults – Powell has previously been called a “stubborn mule” for not cutting interest rates faster – or even fantasise in public about firing him. But it is a different order of seriousness if the DoJ is involved, even if Trump denied knowledge of its investigation.On day one, financial markets took a ho-hum view of a scene that could come from a banana republic. The dollar weakened, but only slightly, and US treasuries suffered modest selling pressure.The sanguine reaction probably flows from a few factors. First, this affair could fizzle out. An overspend on the refurbishment of a public building hardly seems like the stuff of criminal charges.Second, Powell’s term ends in May. Third, a whole Fed committee sets rates so, if Powell’s current colleagues prize their independence as he does, Trump can’t impose his will overnight even if he picks a tame poodle as the next chair.Fourth, the Fed is in cutting mode on rates currently anyway, so the policy quarrel is about pace rather than a more fundamental “up or down” question.Yet Powell is plainly right to sound the alarm because it is not hard to imagine how tensions could escalate, especially if the next debate on rates is more basic. This is a perilous moment for the US to mess with the principle that rate-setters under an independent system should be free of political pressure – and be seen to be so.1:59US Federal Reserve chair says DOJ has threatened criminal indictment – videoThe US is running an enormous fiscal deficit, and the data on unemployment and prices is giving mixed signals. While the headline growth numbers are still decent, momentum is slowing.One can also question how much work is being done by the boom in spending on AI, which is vulnerable (possibly) if returns on capital don’t match the promoters’ hype. Complicating matters further, the medium-term effect on inflation of Trump’s tariff policies will only start to become clearer this year.Owners of US assets and US bonds, you can be sure, would want the country’s central bank to anchor inflation expectations firmly. “A combination of hot inflation and more bets on the Fed’s loss of independence would feed real rate concerns that could cause major dollar depreciation,” say ING’s currency analysts.You bet. The dollar fell last year on a trade-weighted basis. Any flight from US assets would only increase, via the bond markets, long-term borrowing costs for US businesses and consumers.Therein lies the self-defeating aspect of wrecking confidence in US monetary policymaking, as wiser heads in the Republican party understood on Monday.Does Trump himself recognise how undermining the Fed would backfire on him, and the US? For now, markets seem to cling to the idea that he does – and that he will push things only so far.That assumption, though, remains untested and smacks of complacency given that the administration’s war on the Fed has been running for a year. A pre-emptive revolt in US bond markets would be useful at this point.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveNils Pratley on financeJerome PowellDonald TrumpStock marketsBondsUS economyInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

It can be hard to come to terms with this fact when you’re still on the battlefield, but if somehow you manage to step out for a moment, then the truth will become obvious. You have lost, the people on your side have lost, the villains have won and, if anything, you should have run away a long time ago.My own sad epiphany about Twitter, now known asX, came in the immediate aftermath of the US election in 2024. I’d spent a lot of that year lying to myself, ignoring the increasing volume of abuse I’d been receiving and the fact that no one ever read my linked pieces any more, but that week I realised I had to stop. I had to leave X for good.Government ministers cannot be making policy announcements in a space that hosts AI-generated, near-naked pictures of young girlsMuch of the British political sphere chose to stay put, both that November and in the year that followed. Everyone had their reasons: some felt their reach would be curtailed without it, others wanted to be on all available possible platforms. Some said they relished the intensity of the debates, others didn’t believe other platforms could ever be quite as thrilling or all encompassing.Most of those justifications were, of course, nonsense. Humans are creatures of habit and ego. If there is an app you have used every day for years, it will be tough for you to quit it, especially if it provided you with both adrenaline and dopamine. If you have a number of followers on that app, and that makes you feel important, it will be hard for you to willingly leave.I say this not to judge, but in recognition of my own behaviour. There were months and months when I kept lying to myself, pithily saying: “We’re not stuck in here withElon Musk– he’s stuck in here with us!” when I knew I was just shuffling my feet. Being in Washington DC when Donald Trump won the election was such a shock to the system that I had no choice but to do something drastic. Would I have stayed if I hadn’t been in the thick of it on that one awful night? Maybe. It’s hard to say.I did leave then, however, and since then I have watched, perpetually slack jawed, as Musk has kept poisoning the well further, and people I know, love and respect keep merrily drinking from it. Some of them left when Muskpublicly endorsed Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist, but many did not. Some of them realised they had to go when they saw neo-Nazi after neo-Nazi use and abuse the new monetised blue-tick system, but a lot of them stayed put.Most recently, we Bluesky users have seen some arrivals to our little oasis, after Grok, X’s own AI assistant, was used to producesexual abuse imageryof women and children. Still, many of them witnessed thousands and thousands of men requesting pictures of children in small bikinis, covered in “donut glaze”, and they didn’t move.Ofcom investigating Elon Musk’s X after outcry over sexualised AI imagesRead moreSome of them argued that people ought to stay and fight, and couldn’t just retreat to their own comfort zones – but they had it wrong. You may or may not choose to use Bluesky instead of X: as with everywhere else, it’s an app with upsides and downsides. You may head to Instagram instead, or give Threads an honest go, or start writing down your thoughts on smooth rocks then throwing them at various windows across your neighbourhood. It doesn’t matter.What does matter is that X is drifting towards irrelevance, becoming a containment pen for jumped-up fascists. Government ministers cannot be making policy announcements in a space that hosts AI-generated, near-naked pictures of young girls. Journalists cannot share their work in a place that systematically promotes white supremacy. Regular people cannot be getting their brains slowly but surely warped by Maga propaganda.We all love to think that we have power and agency, and that if we try hard enough we can manage to turn the tide – but X is long dead. The only winning move now is to step away from the chess board, and make our peace with it once and for all.Marie Le Conte is a French journalist living in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the evidence is clear: we’re making our streets saferMon 12 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 04.49 ESTShareLast year, something extraordinary happened inLondon. As the conversation about crime got even louder, London quietly reached the lowest per capita homicide rate in its recorded history. Even London’s harshest critics have to accept this is impressive progress.For too many, it will no doubt come as a surprise. In recent years, politicians and commentators have sought to spam our social media feeds with an endless stream of distortions and untruths – painting a dystopian picture of a lawless place where criminals run rampant.Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump has inexplicably veered between describing London as a citymoving towardssharia law, and a place with hospitalslike “warzones”and areas where police don’t want to go. Here in Britain, Nigel Farage is dancing to his tune. Reform UK’s leaderclaimed last weekthat London was “in the grip of a crime wave”. Meanwhile, the party’s new candidate for mayor of London claimed that people pitied Londoners for living in a city that was “no longer safe”.This latest startling statistic shows that those who talk down the capital at every opportunity couldn’t be more wrong: in London, the evidence is clear, we’re winning the battle against violent crime.This hasn’t happened by chance. It’s the outcome of a strategy we’ve pursued since the start of my first term as mayor: to be tough on violent crime, and tough on the complex causes of violent crime.We’vemore than doubledinvestment from City Hall in the Met, funding extra officers and giving them access to the cutting-edge technology they need to target our city’s most dangerous offenders. This is paying dividends. Police in the capital have arrested an extra 1,000 criminals every month, removed 3,750 guns and knives from our streets, and disrupted serious and organised crime groups more than 21,000 times. By closing almost 1,500 county lines operations, they’ve dismantled the violent gangs exploiting the most vulnerable Londoners and causing untold suffering.Enforcement will always be a key part of the solution, but we know we will never be able to simply arrest our way out of the problem – especially when it comes to tackling violence affecting young people. The causes of violent crime are extremely complex, involving deep-seated issues such as poverty, inequality and a lack of life chances for young people.That’s why I’ve invested millions in providing positive opportunities for young Londoners over the past decade, and it’s why I set up London’s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) – the first of its kind in England. Working closely with schools, charities, local councils and communities, the VRU has pioneered an approach rooted in prevention, providing more than 550,000 targeted interventions and opportunities to stop young people from getting caught up in violence and exploitation.The results of our two-pronged approach have been astonishing. London’s homicide rate is lower than rates in New York, Berlin, Brussels, Milan, Toronto and Paris, five times lower than the rate in LA, and almost 12 times lower than the rate in Chicago. Last year, the capital recorded the fewest number of homicides of victims aged under 25 this century. Our homicide rate for under-25s is now three times lower than it was when I set the VRU up in 2019, and hospital admissions of young people for knife assault have fallen by 43% in the same period.The success of our crackdown on violent crime means Londoners are safer in their homes and on our streets. For young people in the capital, the consequences are particularly profound. Every Londoner will remember the tragic story ofDamilola Taylor.A 10-year-old child full of hope for the future, Damilola was killed in 2000 by two schoolboysjust a little olderthan him. I remember being a new father at the time, unable to imagine how it would feel to lose a child so young – nor what could lead two boys to commit such a senseless act of violence.Last week, I visited the Damilola Taylor Centre in Peckham. It’s now home to a youth clubbacked by MyEnds, a City Hall-funded programme supporting young Londoners living in the capital’s most deprived neighbourhoods. In the gym, young people were boxing and playing football. In the common room upstairs, they were playing esports. Whether they were scoring goals on the pitch, learning self-defence in the ring or jostling for first place on the virtual podium, they’d all found a safe space where – with support from a brilliant team of mentors – they were free to be themselves. They were optimistic about the future, and ambitious about all the amazing things they hoped to achieve.Of course, there is still much more to do. As far as I’m concerned, one homicide in the capital will always be one too many. As long as there are Londoners left mourning loved ones whose lives have been stolen by violent crime, we must guard against complacency. But today’s news confirms that we’re on the right path. Our collapsing homicide rate shows that the real London story is not the one spread by loudmouths and alarmists intent on sowing fear and division – it’s the one I saw in Peckham.No one embodies that story better than Damilola Taylor’s parents. Having witnessed how alienation and apathy could drive teenagers towards violence, Richard and Gloria set up the Damilola Taylor Trust to give young Londoners the self-belief to dream of a better future – and the skills to make that dream a reality. Sadly, they are no longer with us. But we must keep on working to build the city they believed in – a safer London for everyone, and a place where no parent is forced to go through what they did.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

From Venezuela to Greenland, the world is unmistakably moving away from the relative stability of the post-cold war era – not least also because of Russia’s war against Ukraine.This erosion of long-established norms has severe implications forEurope, a continent whose core political philosophy is built on limiting (national) power. A rules-based order, international law and negotiated solutions lie at the core of Europe’s self-image. Yet in today’s world, Europe can uphold this vision only if it evolves into a more muscular geopolitical actor itself – and nowhere is this more evident than in the Arctic.Once regarded as a zone of peace, the Arctic has moved to the centre of geopolitical competition amid an expanding US footprint, Russia’s longstanding presence and China’s emergence as a global power. For Europe, this should not come as a surprise. The region is hardly a new frontier; the EU alreadyhas a presence therethrough its three Nordic member states: the Kingdom of Denmark (without Greenland), Finland, and Sweden. Indeed, the European Arctic’s vast resource wealth – from hydrocarbons to critical minerals and marine proteins – already forms part of Europe’s economic backbone and could further shape the continent’s strategic autonomy in the future.Yet despite anevolving EU Arctic policy since 2008, and similar policy efforts by the bigger EU governments, the broader circumpolar north has remained largely absent from European strategic security debates. Its very peace and stability offered few reasons for deeper European engagement.US will have Greenland ‘one way or the other’, says Trump – Europe liveRead moreTrump’s renewed interest in Greenland may change this picture, as illustrated by thejoint statementissued on 6 January by France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK and Denmark, followed by a similar declaration byNordic foreign ministers. Unsurprisingly, however, EU leaders and institutions have largely responded with silence or restraint, with representatives either unable or unwilling toaddress questions on Greenland, or resorting toempty statements on social media. Tellingly, in her annualstate of the union addressin September last year, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, made no reference to the Arctic – or to Greenland – an omission that underscoresthe internal challengesthe “Arctic” has long faced within the EU’s institutional framework.At the same time, as the European Commission and the European External Action Servicebegin updating the EU’s Arctic policy, the moment calls for a more fundamental question: what does northern Europe actually mean for the EU? Following the termination of theNorthern Dimension(a cooperation format that involved the EU, Norway, Iceland and Russia) and amid renewed transatlantic turbulence, Europe needs a new strategic vision – one that redefines its role in a wider European north. This vision should build on the 25-year legacy ofthe Northern Dimensionand nearly two decades of EU Arctic policymaking, while responding to today’s geopolitical upheavals and clearly articulating an EU strategic counterproposal for the region.Here, the EU’s strength lies not in domination but in convening: bringing EU and non-EU actors together on an equal footing to shape a shared regional agenda rather than ceding influence to the nearest strongmen. For decades, north Atlantic countries have relied onaccess to the EU’s internal marketas a guarantor of rules-based trade and economic stability. With the USstepping back from free trade leadership, the EU remains the central anchor of economic order in the region.Such a counterproposal must go beyond existing jurisdictionand assert a stronger political claim to the European north, including non-EU partners such as Norway, Iceland,Greenland, the UK and potentially Canada. As this broader region shifts from zones of peace to spaces shaped by tension, Europe must translate its normative influence into operational capacity.And this is where Greenland comes in. As debates increasingly revolve around acquiring – or even occupying – the island, Europe’s lack of a counterproposal is striking. This should be the moment to explicitly offer EU membership to Greenland, and by extension to the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway – an idearecently raisedin the European parliament. Greenland withdrew from the then European Communities in 1985 after gaining home rule from Denmark in 1979, but in an entirely altered world, attitudes have changed and Europe should respond accordingly. A proposal to Greenland could be pragmatic and phased: EU membership by 2026 or 2027; early agreement on key issues such as fisheries, with renegotiation after five to 10 years; a substantial investment package targeting infrastructure and sustainable extraction of critical raw materials; and a clear commitment to preserving Inuit culture, language and local decision-making.This would constitute a concrete offer by a continent that must increasingly step beyond its comfort zone into the realm ofmachtpolitik(power politics). Even as the US asserts hegemonic influence, Europe’s role as convener could ensure that Greenland – and the broader Arctic – remains a space for multilateral coordination rather than unilateral domination. Trump’s politics are, in many ways, straightforward and should not come as a surprise; what has changed is Europe’s position – from ally to something closer to a strategic frenemy. It is time for European leaders to respond accordingly – and the Arctic may be the place to begin.Robert Habeck served as German vice-chancellor and minister for economy and climate action from 2021 to 2025, and is now working at the Danish Institute for International Studies.Andreas Raspotnik is the director of the High North Center for Business and Governance at Nord University and a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo, NorwayExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkNatoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Monday’s announcement that X is being investigated was Ofcom’s most combative move since key provisions in theOnline Safety Actcame into force. None of the other businesses it has challenged or fined have anything like the global reach or political clout of Elon Musk’s social media giant. Whatever happens next, this is a defining moment. What is being defined is the extent to which some of the wealthiest companies on the planet are under democratic control.But the announcement is only a first step. Ofcom has given no indication of how longits investigationwill take. On Friday Downing Street described as insulting the decision to limit the use of the image‑making Grok AI chatbot to X’s paying subscribers.The governmentsaid that this amounted to turning the creation of abusive deepfakes into a “premium service”.Such robust language was welcome. So was the announcement by the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, that a promised ban on the creation of non‑consensual intimate images will come into force this week, and nudification apps will be outlawed quickly. At the weekendDavid Lammyclaimed that JD Vance shares the UK government’s objection to tools that enable users to undress children in photographs. Clearly, ministers do not want a fight with Donald Trump and would prefer US politicians to get on board with a challenge to big tech over image-based abuse. But Mr Musk’s aggressive opposition to regulation may make a public battle inevitable. He wants Grok to be competitive with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And sex sells.The UK is not alone in taking a stand.IndonesiaandMalaysiahave both restricted access to Grok in response to proliferating intimate deepfakes. Germany’s media minister, Wolfram Weimer, has called on the European Commission to act against the “industrialisation of sexual harassment”. But with OpenAI expected to enable the creation of erotic material using ChatGPT soon, the fear is that the floodgates of deepfake pornography are about to open. Grave concerns about this are not limited to the need for age verification to protect children. Most UK 18-year-olds are still at school. They and older adults are also entitled to protection from the harm caused by intimate deepfakes. The risks from violent online pornography could also be amplified by AI, if this makes such material more easily accessible.Tech businesses should never have been allowed to dictate the pace of change to the extent that they have, releasing new tools before their impact has been discussed or independently assessed. The UK’s online safety laws are among the world’s most advanced. But thecraze for bikini shotshas revealed a gap in a law that is more restrictive of images of people in underwear than in swimwear – even when the level of coverage is the same.While children’s access to social media apps is a separate issue from the design of AI tools, it is no surprise that the issue ofage limits has been raisedby senior politicians of right and left in recent days. Ministers must get on the front foot, and decide what they think about children using AI. But the immediate priority is Grok. Ofcom has barked, and must show that it can bite as well.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Wednesday Brussels is due to outline the terms of the €90bn loan it has promised to Ukraine, amid internal tensions over whether Kyiv can use the money to buy US as well as EU weapons. On the same day, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is due tomeetministers from Denmark and Greenland, as Donald Trump continues toinsistthat the US will take ownership of the latter “one way or another”. And as the body count of protesters rises in Iran, the EU is under mounting pressure to do more than merely “monitor” the situation, as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, somewhat feebly put it over the weekend.Beyond the crisis management, a deeper reckoning is overdue after a tumultuous beginning to 2026. It has long been atruismthat there is a profound mismatch between the EU’s economic heft and its geopolitical clout. But only a year into Mr Trump’s second term, the disjunction looks unsustainable in the “America first” era.As the US president has thrown his weight around across the globe, EU leaders have trailed in the slipstream of events, seeking to mollify and appease Mr Trump in order to preserve what is left of the transatlantic alliance. Given the pivotal importance of the US in guaranteeing Ukraine’s future security, this has perhaps been an understandable strategy of mitigation. But if the EU is to properly assert and protect itself, and project its values in a menacing multipolar world, it needs to start acting with the self-confidence and clarity that should come naturally to an economicsuperpowerwhose GDP dwarfs that of Russia.Some of the problems are structural. The time has surely come, for example, to address the decision-making processes of a union comprising 27 member states, in which the veto mechanism frequently allows small minorities to block decisive action. But the challenge is also one of changing a political mindset that has been both too timid and too complacent regarding internal and external threats.There is already general agreement over the need to accelerate investment in the kind ofhard powerthat the EU previously relied on the US to provide. Europe is playing a belated game of military catch-up that leaves it vulnerable to bullying in the meantime. But instead of raising the money by cutting public spending in other areas, the bolstering of a distinctive social model should become a twin priority. The rise of national populism across the continent – which Mr Trump and his Maga acolytes hope will eventually tear the EU apart – is intimatelylinkedto disillusionment associated with rising inequality and post-crash austerity. Strengthening social solidarity, as well as armies, is key to Europe’s future.The Covid pandemic demonstrated that, when confronted with a health emergency, the EU couldmobiliseits vast collective resources creatively, ambitiously and successfully. Its leaders should show the same flexibility and determination now, leveraging the power of a union comprising 450 million people to stand up for liberal democratic principles that the White House and Vladimir Putin hold in contempt. That may ultimately mean “more Europe”, in the sense of greater integration in relation to security and the economy. The unpalatable alternative is a dangerously weak one in predatory times.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I obey the law, work, pay taxes and do not claim any benefits. For people in my position, stripping Ms Begum of her British citizenship set a dangerous precedent.Nigel Farage and Reform UK continue to blur the distinctions between “asylum seeker”, “illegal immigrant” and “foreign-born national” (a category that includes naturalised citizens like me) and have even threatened mass deportations for those with indefinite leave to remain. This “fudge”, borrowed from the playbooks of would-be authoritarians throughout history, is deliberate.The Labour government and our hapless Tory opposition are sleepwalking our country into a future far-right takeover of British politics. They have normalised much of this rhetoric as the “legitimate concerns” of “ordinary” people. While racist attacks have spiked against migrant communities, they instead propose policies that seek to placate Reform voters, which only further entrenches extremist opinion in the political mainstream.It was Nazi Germany and its fascist allies throughout Europe that stripped Jewish and other minorities of their rights as citizens during the 1930s. As unsympathetic as many may feel towards Ms Begum’s plight, her case matters for millions of law-abiding British citizens who were born overseas. If she can be rendered stateless despite being born and raised here and having never faced a criminal trial in the UK, none of our rights as naturalised citizens under a future Reform government are safe.Dr Alexander SmithAssociate professor of sociology, University of WarwickExplore more on these topicsShamima BegumEuropean court of human rightsImmigration and asylumFar rightHuman rightsBritish identity and societylettersShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromProf Douglas RobinsonMon 12 Jan 2026 12.22 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.36 ESTShareAs a comprehensive-school-educated alumnus of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, I was dismayed to read your recent article on the college’s new admissions approach (Cambridge college to target elite private schools for student recruitment, 7 January).I chose Trinity Hall precisely because of its inclusive, anti-elitist ethos. I arrived in Cambridge from the Midlands (an underrepresented geographic region) with a good state education, a passion for languages, but little understanding of the educational privilege enjoyed by many of my peers.I had never knowingly met anyone educated in one of our elite public schools and was keenly aware that others arrived better prepared, although not more able. Despite this, Trinity Hall saw my potential and I closed the gap, graduating with a double first.As a former teacher with experience in the state sector, I am acutely aware of the limits on how far even the most gifted pupils can be pushed in large, mixed-ability classrooms – although there are many counter-benefits to being educated in the diverse secondary school community I enjoyed. To suggest that students from the most privileged backgrounds are uniquely “ready” to engage critically and independently at Cambridge confuses opportunity with ability.This framing raises an uncomfortable question: would students like the 17-year-old version of me now be admitted? I did not benefit from mock interviews run in supervision-style formats by Oxbridge-educated teachers, nor from the cultural familiarity that risks being mistaken for intellectual capability.Trinity Hall has historically championed students who have the potential to grow into Cambridge. If that principle is being abandoned, the college risks returning to an admissions culture that rewards advantage rather than potential.Joseph OakleyAshford Carbonell, ShropshireI’m a recent state-educated graduate of Cambridge University, having read education. Currently studying for my master’s, I secured no funding, so I am working multiple part-time jobs (and postgraduate study still wouldn’t be possible without the financial help of my parents). For my privately educated peers staying on, in the most part, they have received funding from their colleges or departments.This is the reality for state-educated students. Being at Cambridge is like being allowed into a party where everyone is dancing to a routine, being told you should be grateful for watching, and never being taught the steps. The university continues to serve the elite it was created for; Trinity Hall is just proving this.“I am angry but not surprised” was the message I sent my dad when he asked for my opinion. And yet, behind this anger, there is a deep sadness. Because, contradicting the statement I have just made about dancing Cambridge elites, I have truly loved my time here. I’ve had access to opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of my 16-year-old self. More importantly, I have been stretched academically, asked to engage with challenging theories and concepts, and been supervised world‑class professors.I can only be disappointed by the regressive ideals that govern admissions policies like that of Trinity Hall, because I know there are excellent state-school applicants who will miss out on a transformative educational experience. So, to the state-school student scared by the headlines, let me be clear: you belong at Cambridge University. Please do not give up the fight.Daisy ShawCambridgeI read with shock and sadness of the shift in admissions policy at Trinity Hall towards targeting privately educated students. I attended the college from 1978 to 1981, and believe I benefited considerably from two admission policy decisions taken shortly before – namely to admit women and to admit on academic merit regardless of school background.To learn that the college (with a 26% admission rate from private schools against the 6%-7% of pupils privately educated nationally) has decided to favour the private system in some subjects is an extraordinary step away from equality of opportunity in the direction of class and economic privilege. To say that these students “arrive at Cambridge with expertise and interests that align well with the intellectual demands” abrogates what I see as a large part of the role of a Cambridge education in instilling such expertise and interests and suggests that the college undervalues state-educated students and wishes to become a finishing school for the rich. Does the college have no insight into the image this projects?I wholeheartedly disagree with this shameful policy. Even if, as the college’s master wrote to me, it only applies to a few subjects, it is inexcusable. I urge the college to rectify this situation. Meanwhile, I would encourage fellow alumni to vote with their wallets and reconsider any donations or bequests they have planned.Prof Douglas RobinsonDos Torres, Córdoba, SpainHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is rooted in class, region, race, prejudice, discrimination and socioeconomic status, a consequence of which is what DanielLaurison and Sam Friedman’s research shows as a “class ceiling” in action. This concept privileges those from higher socioeconomic groups when graduates are seeking employment. A good job is central to increasing social mobility. If access to this is barred by prejudice and discrimination, social capital reduces, and this strangles social mobility.Kapur, the vice-chancellor of King’s College London, has a narrow view of a UK graduate; the introduction of degree apprenticeships across a broad range of disciplines has diversified the higher education population considerably. Apprentices leave with sound academic qualifications and robust employment skills.Kapur’s visa and passport concept is interesting, but I have a different take. It is widely recognised that a degree (visa) is necessary but insufficient on its own. It will get you an interview, but demonstration of employability skills that employers seek is the “passport” to success in securing the job. Hence, universities’ increased focus on developing all students’ employability skills.The issue facing the UK is not an excess of graduates. It is a shortage of political ambition, a weak industrial strategy, and lack of investment in an economy that employs the talent it already has.Kapur is correct in that the labour market has changed. The graduate premium has narrowed, but graduates continue to earn significantly more than non-graduates, competition is fierce, and the promise of automatic mobility has declined. This is not a result of too many graduates. It is a failure of government and employers. The UK’s challenge is not too many graduates. It is that this country, unlike many European contemporaries, has failed to build an economy able to utilise its highly educated workforce.This is striking in Stem subjects (science technology engineering and mathematics), a consequence of which is an increasing loss of world-class scientists from the UK.Prof Patrick CallaghanLondon South Bank UniversityIt was demoralising to read Professor Shitij Kapur’s comments about the value, purpose and challenges of contemporary higher education. It is bizarre to describe a degree as a passport (or visa) for employment or social mobility without referencing the vital role of education, learning and personal growth in shaping student outcomes.For a UK vice-chancellor to describe any graduate as “surplus” – as though student success can only be measured in terms of contribution to GDP – is deeply concerning. There is much that we can and should debate about tuition fees, student debt, employability and the cost of education. However, claiming that there could ever be a surfeit of critical thinking, literacy or imagination when democratic values around the world are in decline seems a very slippery slope.Dr Campbell EdinboroughAssociate professor in creative practice, University of LeedsBy stating that UK universities no longer offer “a passport to social mobility”, Prof Shitij Kapur’s is simply reiterating what many in the top universities have long felt about the 50% target in higher education. Despite progress in widening participation, many disadvantaged students still face significant barriers in applying to universities like King’s College London and getting good jobs after graduation.What would really help students from poorer backgrounds improve their life chances is if social mobility was a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, like age, race, sex, and disability. The Trades Union Congress, the Social Mobility Commission and the Co-operative Group have all campaigned for this change. However, to date universities have remained strangely quiet on the subject.Nicholas MiltonStratford upon Avon, WarwickshireExplore more on these topicsStudentsHigher educationUniversitiesGraduate careersInternational studentsWork & careerslettersShareReuse this content"

Madridwon the semi-finalof the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia against Atlético Madrid having been outplayed but then lost the final.The former midfielder’s arrival at the Santiago Bernabéu was announced in May on a contract until 2028. He replaced Carlo Ancelotti and was regarded as a modern, systems manager after his success at Bayer Leverkusen, where he won the Bundesliga, the German cup and reached the final of the Europa League.He had requested a series of signings, including Martín Zubimendi, who ended up joining Arsenal. He took charge of the team in July ready for the Club World Cup, although he had been reluctant to do so, preferring to begin preparation before the league season.The early rounds of the competition had offered glimpses of his ideas but Madrid were thentaken apart by Paris Saint-Germainin a 4-0 semi-final defeat and there has been little sign of progress.The season began with six wins from six in La Liga and, in October, there was animpressiveclásicovictory. But that game apart, the performances rarely convinced and that evening, when he took off Vinícius Júnior, the Brazilian stormed off the pitch and straight down the tunnel. An apology from Vinícius was directed at players, staff and president – but, pointedly, not at his coach.View image in fullscreenAlonso shouts instructions during Real Madrid’s fateful 1-0 defeat to Liverpool in November.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesNor did the club do anything to reinforce Alonso’s authority and, although there had been conversations to improve relationships internally, the Brazilian embracing Alonso after being taken off in a 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, that only momentarily brought calm.Madrid then lost to Celta and Manchester City, leaving Alonso at risk. Five largely unimpressive successive wins since were only a temporary reprieve, defeat on Sunday finally bringing his spell to a close.

Barnsley made Arne Slot’s side battle for the right to host Brighton in round four while their head coach, Conor Hourihane, accused Dominik Szoboszlai of disrespect for gifting his team a goal while showboating. Slot appeared inclined to agree.Liverpool were grateful for a late Florian Wirtz-inspired flourish for an ultimately comfortable margin of victory and banishing any anxieties. But this had been another slog against a low defensive block until the expensive substitute swept home a fine third goal and created a stoppage‑time fourth for Hugo Ekitiké. There was no more relieved man inside Anfield than Szoboszlai.Liverpool v Barnsley: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreThe Hungary captain punctured an enterprising start byBarnsleywith a brilliant 30-yard strike only to let them back into the tie with a ridiculous error. The former Liverpool academy player Adam Phillips profited in front of the Kop to reduce the arrears to 2-1 and reward Barnsley’s disciplined and occasionally dangerous display. The visitors had other moments, not least when the impressive winger Reyes Cleary went down in the Liverpool penalty area under a Szoboszlai challenge, before Wirtz’s class ultimately told.“It is such an amazing feeling for Adam scoring in front of the Kop,” Hourihane said. “Liverpool fan, coming through the academy; it’s something he can look back on for the rest of his life and say he did that. Not many people can. But it was a little bit disrespectful from their player, to be honest. I don’t think he does that against Chelsea or Arsenal or in a Champions League game. Delighted for Adam, but disrespectful from their player’s point of view.”There was no danger to the Liverpool goal when Szoboszlai intercepted Corey O’Keeffe’s pass towards Phillips and set off across his own penalty area. Once he reached the goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, however, the midfielder, showboating after his superb opener, took the tricks too far. Szoboszlai attempted to backheel the ball to his keeper but scuffed the attempt and left Mamardashvili stranded. Phillips, continuing his own run into the box, duly converted into a gaping Kop goal.View image in fullscreenAdam Phillips scores for Barnsley after a mistake from Dominik Szoboszlai.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAn unhappy Slot said: “I don’t think you should do that in anFA Cupgame or League Cup, a friendly game or even a training session. It’s a weird choice and I also have my opinion about it but I prefer to keep that to myself and speak about that with Dom.”The Liverpool head coach added: “It is not the first time – I’m talking generally – we are 2-0 up, there are no problems in the game and we concede a sloppy or an easy goal but this stands out, even for us. It is definitely not helpful.”Barnsley had started the tie superbly. With only 29 seconds on the clock the striker Davis Keillor-Dunn beat Joe Gomez to a Phillips cross from the right and headed against a post. Nathanael Ogbeta also went close with an angled attempt that sailed just over the Liverpool crossbar.There were no mid-season mini-breaks for Liverpool’s senior players this year. Slot, as promised, named a strong starting lineup and bench for the third-round tie having learned a painful lesson when doing otherwiseat Plymouth last season. Szoboszlai got on the right side of his boss when collecting a ball in space on the left and giving the Barnsley goalkeeper Murphy Cooper no chance with a brilliant drive into the top corner.Liverpool dominated the next 30 minutes. Szoboszlai struck another clean effort from distance that rebounded out for a corner off the head of the defender Jack Shepherd. Jeremie Frimpong supplied the comfort of a two-goal advantage with another fine strike. Receiving Alexis Mac Allister’s pass on the right, the Netherlands international cut across Ogbeta into the penalty area and unleashed a thunderous shot into the roof of Cooper’s net.View image in fullscreenJeremie Frimpong doubles Liverpool’s lead with a fine strike.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesFrimpong’s first Anfield goal should have been the platform for Liverpool to ease into the fourth round. Szoboszlai’s error ensured otherwise. Cooper produced a superb save to tip a Virgil van Dijk volley on to his crossbar before Barnsley raged over Farai Hallam’s decision to dismiss their penalty appeals when Cleary went down in front of Szoboszlai. The midfielder pulled the winger’s shirt but also played the ball and, with no video assistant referee to dissect that one, play continued.The introduction of Wirtz and Ekitiké on the hour eventually paid dividends for Slot. Wirtz missed a glorious opportunity to extend Liverpool’s lead when putting a Szoboszlai cross over the bar from close range. But the Germany international made amends when Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ekitiké combined to prise open the Barnsley lines. Collecting Ekitiké’s flick on the edge of the area, Wirtz curled a lovely finish into the top corner to banish any late Liverpool nerves. He also teed up Ekitiké with an inch-perfect cross in stoppage time. The France forward made no mistake from close range.Explore more on these topicsFA CupLiverpoolBarnsleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In his only No 1 role Carrick oversaw 136 matches, winning 63 and losing 49.Carrick, whopulled ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjærduring the interview process, will lead United for the first time on Wednesday when the players return to training after two days off.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

The Portuguese would cost about £20m and should his acquisition become viable there are funds available for his purchase or for any other player on the club’s transfer wishlist.Carrick had a three-game caretaker spell at United in November and December 2021 after the sacking as the manager of Solskjær, for whom he was a first-team coach.Carrick was unbeaten, overseeing a 2-0 Champions League group game win at Villarreal, a 1-1 draw at Chelsea in the Premier League and a 3-2 league victory against Arsenal at Old Trafford. Carrick departed when Ralf Rangnick became the interim manager until the end of the season.As a midfielder at United, from 2006 to 2018, Carrick was part of a glittering period, winning 10 major honours, so he can expect comprehensive backing from the fanbase.His immediate task will be to lift the mood of the players and the wider club after their2-1 FA Cup third‑round defeat against Brightonat Old Trafford on Sunday. That meant United were eliminated from that competition and the League Cup at the first opportunity for a first time since 1981-82, and so will play only 40 games this season – their lowest number in a complete campaign since 1914-15.Carrick’s first match is the lunchtime visit of Manchester City for the derby on Saturday, after which comes a trip to Arsenal. Carrick will have 17 league games as the interim, and will target taking United to Champions League qualification.

The veteran may be rumoured to be considering a move to the US Tennis Association, but for now he remains focused on his sport’s summer dominance.“Our objective is we want to own January,” he says.

It expanded to 15 days in 2024 by bringing forward the start of the main draw by 24 hours. NowTennisAustralia wants to make the most of “Opening Week”, which has traditionally been the domain of the fading prospects and veterans still dreaming of a great grand slam run by going through qualifying.Until 2024, it was free to attend these qualifying matches. Now, ground passes are A$20 (£10) a day, a price that is slowly closing the gap to the A$65 (£32) it costs to attend during the main draw.Aided by a “kids go free” promotion, the tournament drew a first-day record crowd of 29,261 on Monday – almost four times last year’s number – even though the leading name on the schedule was Bernard Tomic. The sun was shining and, inside, vendors were busy, even if drinks and food are not cheap (A$6.50 for 600ml soft drink, A$15.60 for 425ml of Balter XPA; A$18.90 for a small pizza, A$14 for chicken tenders).“It doesn’t feel like it’s the first day of qualifiers, it feels in many ways like it’s the first day of the event,” Tiley says. “But this is the first day of 21 days of activity, entertainment, sport.”View image in fullscreenThousands attend the first day of Opening Week.Photograph: Jack Snape/The GuardianView image in fullscreenBernard Tomic won his first qualifier against Hugo Dellien of Bolivia on Monday.Photograph: Graham Denholm/Getty ImagesThe week is now supercharged by charity exhibitions with top players, music concerts – a show by dance veterans Hot Chip on Tuesday night is sold out andThe Presets are playing on Friday – and promotions like the One Point Slam and Saturday’s new opening ceremony, featuring Roger Federer.Venus Williams, 45, gets wild card to play first Australian Open in five yearsRead moreLast year Tennis Australia’s annual revenue jumped byA$102m to A$693m(£50.7m to £345m). Tiley is adamant his philosophy is not growth for growth’s sake. “We are an event about getting people to pick up a racket and play, and we’re always going to be about promoting the game and providing opportunities for players,” he says. “There’s more things we can do, we have live music for the whole time, everything is open, more food, more gaming, a partnership with Mecca on beauty and wellness.”The efforts appear to be working. In 2024, opening week attracted almost 90,000 fans. More than 116,000 came last year. Tiley expects that number to double or triple this year, and wants to see it quickly rise to half a million. The ace up his sleeve is the One Point Slam, a promotion that pits top professionals against celebrities and amateurs who have won through regional qualifiers. It was trialled last year but this summer a A$1m (£500,000) prize has been added.View image in fullscreenThe cost of food and drink does not appear to have deterred tennis fans.Photograph: Jack Snape/The Guardian“We’ve had quite a few international organisations approach us about how we’re approaching it, because they see it as a great opportunity as connecting community tennis to professional tennis,” Tiley says.Wednesday night’s event will feature Carlos Alcaraz and Nick Kyrgios as well as the former cricketer Steve Waugh, the TV presenter Karl Stefanovic and the comedian Andy Lee – and is now a A$29 (£14) ticketed event.Alan Preston was at Melbourne Park on Monday with his family who hail from Cobh in Ireland.

Melbourne Park this year includes larger shaded areas, and amenities remain a focus. “The objective is to bring the players and the fans closer together,” he says, highlighting how outside courts now have two-level grandstands.“We’re connecting that second level to other second levels, and the future plan we have with that side of the precinct is to sink the courts into the ground even further and raise the stands on the side and be able to walk around the top.”That would be an expensive upgrade for Melbourne Park five years after it completed a A$1bn (£497m) redevelopment, and it would need support from the Victorian government andthe trust that controls the precinct.“The priority is to keep growing the event,” Tiley says. “The sink courts idea I gave, that’s just an idea, but generally when we throw out ideas out there, they sort of become reality, we want people to think about them that way.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tel was added in December in place of the injured striker Dominic Solanke.It is understood there is no suggestion he would like to leave permanently and that he will keep working hard to earn a place in the side. However, having departed Bayern in search of more first-team action, he would like an opportunity to build some momentum in his career.Spurs, who are poised to complete a £13m deal with Santos for the 19-year-old left-back Souza, are in the market for attacking reinforcements, with Mohammed Kudus due to be out until April with a thigh injury. They have been linked with RB Leipzig’s Yan Diomande and Juventus’s Kenan Yildiz.Tottenham’s co-sporting director, Fabio Paratici, is in line to complete a move to Fiorentina once the January window has closed.

That meant the field was reduced to under 21 athletes and fewer qualifying points were on offer due to the lack of competition. Uhlaender believes the Canadian team did so to prevent American athletes from catching them in the standings for Olympic qualifying.Uhlaender claims Joe Cecchini, the head coach of Canada’s skeleton team, told her he had come up with the scheme.“I cried when I found out he went through with this plan,”Uhlaender told DW. “I didn’t know if it hurt more that my friend of 20 years just nailed my coffin, my Olympic dream is over. Or, that my best friend of 20 years is doing something so horrible that hurts so many people.”Uhlaender says that Cecchini told her on Friday that it was not his job to “uplift” athletes from other countries and that his aim was to “eliminate any possibilities” that Canada’s Jane Channell would miss this year’s Olympics.Uhlaender won the event at Lake Placid but the reduced points on offer means the 41-year-old will miss the Olympics. Although she won gold at the 2012 skeleton world championships, the closest she has come to an Olympic medal was when she finished fourth at the 2014 Games in Sochi.Coaches from the US, Denmark, Israel and Malta, whose athletes were all affected by the Canadian withdrawals, have written to the IOC expressing “serious concerns” about the qualification process.In a statement, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton defended the withdrawals, saying some of the athletes who were pulled from competition had already raced several times last week. It said the decision was “appropriate, transparent and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport.”Uhlaender disagrees. “[Cecchini] did not have to do that. He did it because he could. And it wasn’t to protect his athletes; it was to manipulate the system,” she told DW. “He waited until after everyone was registered and gave the illusion that the Canadians were going to be competing. He wanted to make sure that we could not get full points.”The flare-up comes after a number of heated sporting clashes between Canada and the US at a time when Donald Trump has threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and has raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Duringlast year’s 4 Nations Face-off, Canadian ice hockey fans booed the US national anthem and former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” Last season’s World Series saw the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Toronto Blue Jays in athrilling seven-game series, although most of the tension was due to the action on the field.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamCanadaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Barring an unexpected development, therefore, it will host the 2038 Games.On Monday organisers confirmed that Crans-Montana would stage events as part of its plan to host competitions across the country in 12 years’ time in order to avoid taxpayer spending on construction.The decision does not come as a complete surprise given Crans-Montana will host the world championships in alpine skiing next year, as well as World Cup races in three weeks’ time before the Milan-Cortina Olympics.The bar’s owner and his wife are facing a number of potential charges, including “manslaughter by negligence”, from the fire, which is alleged to have started in the basement when sparklers came into contact with soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling.Last week the Swiss skierCamille Rast dedicated her World Cupgiant slalom victory to the victims of the fire. Rast tapped the black mourning band on her left upper arm twice after her win and said: “This week, in my home town, there was a tragic accident and I think about those families. We race for them.”View image in fullscreenSwitzerland’s Camille Rast, wearing a black mourning band, on her way to World Cup slalom victory.Photograph: Christophe Pallot/Agence Zoom/Getty ImagesThe bobsleigh in 2038 is expected to be staged at St Moritz, while ski jumping will be in Engelberg and biathlon at Lenzerheide. Ice hockey would be played at stadiums in Zurich and Zug, with some games going to Lugano to include the country’s Italian-speaking region.Meanwhile Lausanne, the IOC’s home city, will host the opening ceremony, figure skating and short-track skating for what will be the first Winter Games in Switzerland since the 1948 St Moritz Olympics. The capital, Bern, is slated for the closing ceremony.Elsewhere Geneva will stage speed skating and curling – using the Palexpo complex that has staged Davis Cup tennis and an annual equestrian jumping meeting – and be the base for international broadcasters.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsSwitzerlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Fed independence mattersCallum Jonesin New YorkMon 12 Jan 2026 12.21 ESTFirst published on Mon 12 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareEvery living former head of the Federal Reserve condemned an “unprecedented” attempt by theTrump administrationto weaken the US central bank’s independence, after the Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell.Ex-Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen warned similar prosecutorial attacks in other countries had led to “highly negative consequences” for the cost of living – and argued they had “no place” in the US.Late on Sunday, it emerged that the justice department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on Friday, threatening a criminal indictment related to Powell’s testimony before the Senate banking committee in June last year, regarding renovations to the Fed’s historic office buildings in Washington DC.Justice department opens investigation into Jerome Powell as Trump ramps up campaign against Federal ReserveRead moreIn response, Powell argued he had been threatened with criminal charges because the Fed had set interest rates “based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.The move amounts to a significant escalation in Donald Trump’s extraordinary attack on the Fed’s independence. The US president has repeatedly blasted Powell and the central bank for declining to bow to his demands for rapid interest rate cuts, and launched an aggressive campaign to and exert greater control over its decisions.Trump has moved to distance himself from the investigation, claiming he was unaware of it. “I don’t know anything about it,” hetoldNBC News. The justice department did not respond to a request for comment.Several Republicanscriticizedthe department’s pursuit of Powell on Monday.Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a member of the Senate banking committee that oversees Fed appointments, said he would oppose any nominee for the central bank “until this legal matter is fully resolved”. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, another committee member, also called for a swift end to the investigation.Fed up: inside Trump’s unprecedented bid to exert control over the US central bankRead moreEx-Fed officials and policymakers also sounded the alarm, warning that this action could damage the US economy. “The reported criminal inquiry intoFederal ReserveChair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,” a blunt statement signed by 13 former senior officials,including Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen, said. “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.“It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.”Economists also cautioned that Trump’s attempts to influence the Fedrisk plunging the US into a period of 1970s-style inflation, and triggering a global backlash in financial markets.A string of analysts drew parallels to when price growth soared after the then president, Richard Nixon, put pressure on the Fed chair, Arthur Burns, to ease monetary policy to help smooth his 1972 election campaign.On Monday, however, Wall Street was calm. The benchmark S&P 500 was flat at lunchtime in New York, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%Allies of Trump spent months last yearaccusing the Fedof mishandling the multibillion-dollar renovations. Trump had repeatedly threatened legal action.In his response on Sunday, Powell insisted the legal threat was “not about” his testimony last summer, or congressional oversight of the Fed. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said.Powell, initially appointed by Trump, and reappointed by Biden, has chaired the Fed since 2018. His term as chair is due to expire in May – at which time Trump’s chosen successor can take his place – although Powell can remain on the Fed’s board of governors until 2028.Kevin Hassett, a senior White official and director of the National Economic Council, is seen as the favorite to succeed Powell as Fed chair. Trump said last week he had made a decision, and whenaskedby the New York Times about Hassett, Trump described him as “certainly one of the people that I like”.Asked about the justice department’s investigation on Monday, Hassett claimed that he respected the independence of the Fed. “I guess the question is, if you think the building cost $20bn, or $10bn, do you think at some point that it’s appropriate for the federal government to investigate? And seems like the justice department has decided that they want to see what’s going on over there.“And if I were Fed chair, I would want them to do that,” he added. “I think that it’s really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS economyFederal ReserveTrump administrationJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

That is an absolute outrage.”Reed added: “They will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children.”He did not name the colleague but sources close to Egan have confirmed to the Guardian that Reed was talking about the Bristol MP’s planned visit in September. It is understood there is still hope the visit may eventually go ahead.After the visit was called off, Bristol Palestine Solidarity Campaign wrote on Facebook: “The planned school visit by Damien Egan, MP for Bristol North East, has been cancelled after concerns were raised by the NEU [National Education Union] staff group, parents and local constituents.“This is a clear message: politicians who openly support Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza are not welcome in our schools. Egan is vice-chair of Labour Friends ofIsraeland has visited Israel since the current onslaught on Gaza began, demonstrating his support.”On its Facebook page, Bristol NEU wrote: “We celebrate this cancellation as a win for safeguarding, solidarity, and for the power of the NEU trade union staff group, parents, and campaigners standing together.”Civil society groups condemn ‘dangerous’ plans for more anti-protest powersRead moreReed said at the conference the UK government had been slow to respond to some examples of anti-Israel extremism, and promised Labour had “reassessed” this approach.Since winning his seat at the last election, Egan has been targeted by anti-Israel activists. He has an Israeli husband, the software developer Yossi Felberbaum.The investigative newsroom the Bristol Cablereported the cancellation in Novemberwhen an NEU member at another Bristol school described a “flurry of organising” including a plan for people to wear keffiyehs for the day of the visit.Egan has not commented.Bristol Brunel academy said the visit was postponed after it heard of plans for a protest to take place.A spokesperson said: “Mr Egan was due to discuss democracy and the role of an MP, while helping to raise aspirations among students who may have an interest in pursuing similar career paths.“On the evening before Mr Egan’s scheduled visit, we were made aware of plans for a public protest outside the school. We opted to postpone Mr Egan’s visit to ensure everyone would continue to feel safe when entering and exiting school and to prevent any disruption to our students’ learning.“We have remained in contact with Mr Egan, and an alternative date for his visit was arranged some time ago. We have also been in contact with the police and followed their advice.”Egan is a former student of Cabot Learning Federation, the multi-academy trust of which Bristol Brunel is part.Explore more on these topicsBristolLabourIsraelJudaismSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, ordered the policing inspectorate to investigate the affair.The first part of the inquiry by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has examined West Midlands police’s (WMP) handling of that intelligence. The findings are due this week and sources from senior policing, Whitehall and Birmingham’s local government expect them to be critical.Central to the WMP case is what they were told by Dutch police as they planned for the game. The force says this intelligence led them to believe Maccabi fans had been perpetrators of violence during a match against Ajax in Amsterdam in November 2024.But HMIC spoke to Dutch police, who told its inquiry that several key claims relied on by WMP clashed with its experience of policing Maccabi fans during that game, which was marred by violence.The Guardian understands that Dutch police said claims such as one that Maccabi fans had thrown Muslims into an Amsterdam river were incorrect. Indeed Dutch police said the only incident remotely like that involved a Maccabi fan being found in the water.HMIC were also told that the presence of Maccabi fans and the trouble that followed required 1,200 Dutch officers, not 5,000 as WMP had claimed.Furthermore, the inquiry was told that Maccabi fans did not specifically target Muslim communities in Amsterdam. While there were clashes, and Maccabi hooligans did strike locals, the Israeli fans did not go hunting for people to attack, multiple sources have said.Dutch police told HMIC that the trouble was confined to central Amsterdam, with the city’s Muslim communities living outside that area.The Dutch police view, as told to HMIC during the meeting in December, was that the cause of trouble before the Amsterdam game was much more mixed, with Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian supporters provoking each other. But after the game it was Maccabi fans who were attacked, with anti-Israeli sentiment in the Dutch city running high because of the Gaza war.HMIC’s findings are expected to be sent to Mahmood imminently and published this week. It will add to pressure on WMP and its chief constable, Craig Guildford, who is facing calls to resign. The home secretary does not have the legal power to directly sack a chief constable.Ultimately the only person who can oust the chief constable is Simon Foster, who is the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands. Foster is said to be waiting for the HMIC report and to have not made up his mind. He has publicly praised Guildford for boosting the force’s crime fighting.Guildford, the chief constable since 2022, took office with the Birmingham-based force solving 3% of crimes. That figure now stands at 15%. Violent crime is down, and times to answer emergency calls, which were among the worst in the country, are now among the best.WMP said they based the majority of their case for excluding Maccabi fans on the behaviour of Israeli fans at the game in Amsterdam in 2024. They added that before they were briefed by three Dutch police officers on 1 October they were planning to host Maccabi’s fans’ attendance at the game in Birmingham. However, they were so alarmed by what they were told they raised their assessment about the dangers posed.The report from HMIC will also be studied by the Independent Office forPoliceConduct, which will consider if any officers may have committed misconduct under the police discipline codes.Furthermore, the home affairs committee will produce its own report, which is expected to be critical of the police. It will also consider claims that the WMP decision was caving to “Islamists” and whether the force made a political decision to ban the Israeli fans – allegations it rejects.The ban on Maccabi fans was made by Birmingham’s safety advisory group. News of its decision emerged shortly after a terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue left two dead and as concerns about antisemitism were running high.Keir Starmer criticised the ban, and a second HMIC inquiry will examine how safety advisory groups work. The game was played with Maccabi fans absent after the Tel Aviv club decided to decline its ticket allocation.WMP and Dutch police have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillanewsShareReuse this content"

The incriminating claims, implicating the president and first lady in a cash for access network, were made in a video uploaded on X.Breaking his silence four days after the video went viral, Christodoulides, who has faced mounting pressure from coalition partners, put on a brave face as he protested his innocence.“In such moments of crisis, any leader, when his hands are clean, must be calm,” he told reporters on Monday. “I am here. I am publicly taking a position. I have nothing to fear.”It was, he said, important that “foreign states and theEuropean Union, itself” had weighed in with help to source the origins of the 8.5-minute video. The island’s intelligence services and cybersecurity experts are also investigating.“I call on all the responsible state authorities to use all the tools they have at their disposal to fully investigate this affair,” Christodoulides said.The video – posted on the user account of a self-described independent researcher named Emily Thompson – caused uproar when it began circulating barely 24 hours afterCypruslaunched the opening ceremony of its EU presidency on 7 January.It starts with its female narrator saying: “He burst on to the presidential scene in 2023 promising to root out corruption after the last government. Two years later, the worst fears of Cypriot citizens have now been confirmed. He hasn’t thrown out the old corrupt methods. They’ve simply evolved.”Within hours government sources were describing the footage as “malicious and clearly edited”, with officials speaking of a hybrid attack that bore all the hallmarks of an enemy state such as Russia.In a montage, most of which appears to be secretly filmed, the video depicts aides and allies of Christodoulides, including Giorgos Lakkotrypis, the former energy minister and Charalambos Charalambous, his chief of staff, in conversation with unidentified investors.Both men are heard saying that access to the president is possible in exchange for cash donations that could be funnelled to a charitable fund assisting children in need headed by the first lady.In one snippet, Lakkotrypis told his interlocutors over wine that because Christodoulides ran as an independent without the backing of a political party, “sometimes they have to depend on cash” to bypass the €1m (£870,000) cap on campaign funding.“For someone like Nikos who doesn’t have a party behind them, it is not easy for them to find the money,” he said.In another, the former minister explains how he has enabled a Russian oligarch, with links to a pharmaceutical company on the island, to escape EU sanctions by speaking to the leader. A €75,000 donation, made by the company, “got the attention of the president”, he tells them.Charalambous, who is the president’s brother-in-law and oversaw his campaign finances, is similarly heard saying that investors could have access to the president if they made a proposal and offer of money.Both men have denied the allegations, saying the comments have been taken out of context and distorted.After Charalambous announced his resignation on Monday, the president described it as “an act of self confidence” and “not of pressure or guilt”.The first lady, Philippa Karsera, said she would be stepping down from her position as head of the charity citing the “unrelenting attack” she and her children had been subjected to on social media.But with Cyprus’s image believed to be tarnished at a time of its greatest visibility on the world stage and with parliamentary elections set for May, opposition parties called the resignations too little, too late.Cypriot society, they said, now wanted answers that would disprove the corruption charges and assure them a cover-up was not under way.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

After years of sanctions, Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is decrepit and crumbling. But in the week since US special forces kidnapped Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and rendered him to New York, Donald Trump has urged oil companies to invest $100bn (£74bn) to get Venezuela’s wells flowing.“We’re going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,” the US presidenttold oil executives on Friday.An analysis for the Guardian by ClimatePartner, a carbon accounting firm, modelled the carbon impact of the growth of Venezuela’s oil production by +0.5m barrels per day by 2028, ramping up to +1.58m barrels per day from 2035 to 2050.Such a scenario – which would still fall far short of the 3.5m barrels a day produced during Venezuela’s last oil boom in the 1990s – would by itself consume 13% of the total remaining carbon budget to keep global heating within 1.5C.US attack on Venezuela will decide direction of South America’s vast mineral wealthRead moreThe oil extracted from Venezuela’s vast reserves is, according to industry estimates, the filthiest in the world.Classed as a heavy, sour grade, Venezuela’s crude has a dense, tar-like consistency and a high sulphur content. These fluids do not flow like conventional oil; compared with the light, sweet crude of a country like Saudi Arabia, they require energy intensive processes to extract from the ground.It is for these reasons that a study by S&P Global Platts Analytics found Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt deposits to have by far the highest carbon intensity of any major oil region.For example, it was almost 1,000 times higher than crude produced from Norway’sJohan Sverdrup field, which has a carbon intensity of 1.6kg of carbon dioxide per barrel of oil equivalent – compared with 1,460kgCO2e/boe for Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. The report found that Venezuela’s “extreme” carbon intensity shows that this crude stream would “face challenges in a world with tight carbon budgets”.Hollie Parry, senior analyst at ClimatePartner, said: “The decision to ramp up production of one of the world’s most carbon intensive crude oils to historic levels would consume an estimated 13% of the remaining global carbon budget – the equivalent to nearly a decade of emissions from the entire EU, from a single oil expansion. In a rapidly warming world, such a move would lock in decades of high emissions at precisely the moment when science demands a swift transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and low-carbon solutions.”Environmental campaignershave slammed the US’s claim on Venezuelan oil, a move “both reckless and dangerous”, according to Mads Christensen, executive director of Greenpeace International.He said: “The only safe path forward is a just transition away from fossil fuels, one that protects health, safeguards ecosystems, and supports communities rather than sacrificing them for short-term profit.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOilVenezuelaTrump administrationEnergyFossil fuelsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In Newfoundland, up to 40cm of snow fell on Sunday, along with wind gusts of about 74mph, creating blizzard-like conditions.The storm began late on Sunday and is forecast to persist until Tuesday morning. Freezing rain warnings are in place across Nova Scotia, including Annapolis and Kings counties, while parts of New Brunswick could get up to 25cm of snow on Monday.Power outages, falling branches, and hazardous road conditions are expected. The severe weather is driven by two low-pressure systems merging over the region.Freezing rain occurs when precipitation falls as rain through a layer of warm air aloft before passing into a shallow layer of sub-zero air near the ground. The raindrops become supercooled as they pass through this layer, and freeze instantly on contact with roads, trees and power lines, rapidly forming a smooth, often invisible layer of ice.In Australia, Tropical Cyclone Koji formed in the Coral Sea off Queensland’s north coast over the weekend, making landfall as a category 1 system between Ayr and Bowen on Sunday.The storm brought heavy rain and damaging winds, with gusts above 70mph recorded at Hamilton Island. Koji has since weakened to a tropical low but continues to produce severe weather, including winds of up to 59mph and widespread heavy rain.About 200mm fell in 24 hours in some areas, with much higher totals near Mackay, including 362mm in the Clarke Range, and 370mm at Cattle Creek. Ex-tropical cyclone Koji has caused flooding, road closures, and power outages affecting about 22,000 people, and is forecast to move south-south-westwards through Queensland, bringing further heavy rain reaching in excess of 150mm in places, and an increased risk of flash flooding.Southern Australia experienced one of its most intense heatwaves on record late last week, peaking on Saturday. New South Wales recorded its hottest conditions in years as strong north-westerly winds drove hot air from the outback towards the east coast. Temperatures in parts of Syndey reached 43C, surpassing the previous record of 42.5C set in 2018.Extreme heat extended across much of the state, with several regions exceeding 40C, pushing fire danger to critical levels amid low humidity and strong winds.The heat broke abruptly as cooler southerly winds arrived, with temperatures in Melbourne dropping by about 13C in 40 minutes on Friday, before the cooler winds spread farther north by the end of the weekend.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerAustralia weatherCanadaanalysisShareReuse this content"

I can’t sleep without replaying our flood plan in my head for weaknesses.”Ridley’s house in Folkestone floods at least twice a year. His garden far more often. Most of the floods happen at night or in the early hours of the morning. “The floods come so quickly that it’s unbelievable. We often wake up to find our garden a metre deep,” he says.And it is not clean water. “It’s raw sewage; a raging torrent that crashes in with more force than you could believe,” he says. “My elderly neighbour got knocked over by a heavy timber board swept along by the flood waters. He thought he was going to drown in sewage.”View image in fullscreenFlood rescue in Maidstone, Kent in 2019.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesFlooding is one of the most pressing emergencies facing the UK today. More than 6m properties in England alone are already at risk from rivers, the sea, sewage or surface water. That number could rise to 8m – roughly one in four – by mid-century, as the climate breaks down.Flooding throws lives into chaos. Ridley’s family lives with lasting trauma: he has PTSD and his family are, as he put it, “flood-scarred”.“My children grew up in sewage,” he says. “I can’t exaggerate how disgusting and distressing it is. I’ve had condoms and sanitary towels hanging off my apple trees. The garden becomes infested with insects and slugs, feeding on the filth.”After each flood,Kentcounty council sends a team to drain the liquid – and another team to remove the debris. “But the second team just takes one look at the condensed sewage, turns around and leaves, saying that’s not their job,” says Ridley. ”We have to put on our protective gear and clear it ourselves.”View image in fullscreenFlooding in Witney, Oxfordshire.For 26 years, Ridley has been begging the council and Southern Water to replace the failing sewer infrastructure. But, as he said, his is a small voice. “There are only three to four properties up here,” he says. “We’re easy to ignore.”It is stories like Ridley’s that led, at the start of this year, to the formation of the not-for-profit organisationFlooded People UK. Its raison d’etre is to enable flood victims to help each other – and to build a collective voice big enough to lobby for change.By placing flooded people at the centre of flood‑policy discussion rather than leaving it to engineers or regulators, FPUK is challenging conventional power dynamics. Its presence, it hopes, will force policymakers, local authorities and the public to consider not only infrastructure but also the human, social and mental health impact of flooding. Its growing visibility also helps humanise otherwise dry statistics about “properties at risk”.View image in fullscreenRescue workers on the road to Heather Shepherd’s home in north Shropshire after the River Severn burst its banks.Photograph: SuppliedHeather Shepherd lives in north Shropshire on the English border with Wales. The co-founder of FPUK and architect of the UK’sflood action groupinfrastructure, she has been flooded six times in the past three years.“Between October to March, we get a flood alert about once a month,” says Shepherd, who has spent more than £70,000 on flood-resistant adaptations. “That puts us on the alert for a two-hour warning that the waters are coming.“And when it comes, it’s an onslaught,” she says. “The bottom of my drive floods up to neck-level. For up to a week, we live in the middle of a vast, unbroken lake – nothing but water as far as the eye can see.”Shepherd has lost much of her most treasured belongings to floods. “I don’t do anything to stop the water coming in any more,” she says. “There’s no point; nothing works. Water is relentless.”View image in fullscreenA room in Heather Shepherd’s home.The trauma is intense. “For at least six months of the year, I’m trapped in this revolving, repeating nightmare,” she says.Newresearchfrom the National Emergencies Trust (NET) and Lancaster University shows how limited the financial and wellbeing support is for flood victims.Almost half the survivors surveyed received no professional support at all. Many were pushed into debt or forced to drain their savings because of bureaucratic barriers preventing them accessing grants or insurance payouts.Mhairi Sharp, the chief executive of NET, says: “Flood survivors describe sleepless nights, hypervigilance during rain and children struggling at school. The psychological scars persist long after the water recedes.”View image in fullscreenWilliam Wareing’s home in Witney, Oxforshire.Like Ridley, William Wareing believes FPUK is the only way to get his plight heard by those who could make a difference.The chair of the Witney flood group in WestOxfordshire, he has been flooded three times since 2007.“We work relentlessly to get our voice heard, and we’ve been relatively successful locally: we’ve had river sensors installed, formed a flood warden group and engaged in public engagement,” he says. “But just like all the other local groups around the country, we’re just little pockets of protest who are generally ignored.“Flooded People UK is bringing us all together, so that we can have one voice and change government policy.”View image in fullscreenWitney’s then MP, David Cameron, during floods in his constituency in 2007.Photograph: Barry Batchelor/PAWhat needs to be recognised, Wareing says, is that flooding is a nationwide problem.“Because it’s hard to do anything about climate change in the short term, we need to address the other three causes – development, lack of defences and poor maintenance – as a matter of urgency.”View image in fullscreenFlooding in Witney.Photograph: HandoutOfficial assessments show flood risk is changing fast. It is no longer something that only affects those living near rivers and coasts: about 4.6m homes and businesses in towns and suburbs across England are threatened by surface-water flooding, caused by heavy rain and overwhelmed drains.That, says Shepherd, makes surface water the largest single contributor to flood risk, surpassing traditional river and coastal flooding.“The urgency could not be greater,” she says. “Without stronger planning reforms, investment in infrastructure and a meaningful national strategy to deal with sewage and drainage failures, more families risk being left living in constant fear of the next deluge – and paying with their homes, their health and their peace of mind.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingShropshireKentOxfordshireExtreme weatherClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It marks the first time any country has ever moved to exit the agreement.Outrage as Trump withdraws from key UN climate treaty along with dozens of international organisationsRead moreThe UN climate body requires one year’s notice for withdrawal, so the United States will not cease being a party for a year. Trump’s memo did not specify whether or not his administration will submit a formal notice of termination to the UN.Reached for comment, a state department spokesperson noted that Trump’s memo said the agency will take all necessary “steps to effectuate the withdrawal of the United States from the organizations as soon as possible”. The person also referred the Guardian to secretary of state Marco Rubio’s Wednesday statement, where he said theTrump administrationis exiting institutions and treaties which it believes to be “redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity”.Because the country entered the UNFCCC with the consultation and approval of the Senate in 1992, “there is an open question” about whether or not the president can unilaterally exit the agreement, Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University, wrote in an email.The UNFCCC and the Paris climate agreement – the landmark 2015 climate pact underpinned by the UNFCCC, from which Trump pulled the US last January – both say that parties may withdraw with one year’s written notice. But unlike the UNFCCC, the Paris agreement was never ratified by the US Senate, Gerrard noted.“President Obama took the position that since the Paris agreement did not impose binding legal obligations on the US, it was not a treaty that required Senate ratification,” he said. “In contrast, President George HW Bush submitted the UNFCCC to the Senate, which unanimously ratified it in 1992, and he then signed it.”Some scholars argue that the president has the ability to unilaterally end treaties – if notlegally, thenpractically, because Congress has previously acquiesced to the executive branch.“In practice, presidents have long asserted the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties and other international agreements without seeking the approval of either the Senate or Congress,” said Curtis Bradley, a University of Chicago law school professor and former counselor of international law at the state department.But in Koh’s view, congressional silence should not be interpreted as consent to exit the treaty. A “mirror principle” should dictate that the same amount of congressional input needed to enter into a treaty should be required to withdraw from it, said Koh, now an international legal expert at Yale University.“If I had an agreement that I made by myself, it would make sense that I could leave by myself,” he said. “But if my wife and I made an agreement that both of us had to sign, could I withdraw from it by myself? I believe we would both have to withdraw.” He said he expects groups to sue the administration over its memo.Rhode Island senator and climate hawk Sheldon Whitehouse also said Trump’s withdrawal is “not just corrupt, it’s illegal”.“This polluter-driven stoogery shows the full extent of creepy polluters’ control over the Trump administration. Trump’s corrupt fossil-fuel interests threaten the wellbeing of millions around the world on the frontlines of climate disaster, defy the will of the American people, and damage US economic competitiveness,” he said in a statement, adding that he believes “once the Senate has ratified a treaty, only the Senate can withdraw from the treaty”.The US constitution does not explicitly spell out such a mirror principle, only stating that the president “shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur”.The supreme court has also never ruled on the topic: though it took up the issue of treaty exit in 1979 when then president Jimmy Carter withdrew from a treaty establishing diplomatic relations with China, the justices “splintered and didn’t come to a single rationale” on which US governmental branch can exit treaties, and under what circumstances, said Koh.Jean Galbraith, an international law expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey law school, said the issue of unilateral withdrawal is “hard” and “complex”. Even when the Senate recommends entry into treaties, she said, the president has the discretion not to take their advice.“When you think about withdrawal, you can think about, what exactly is the president doing? Are they just ratcheting back that last step of ratification,” she asked. “Maybe the president would say, ‘I’m just pulling back the instrument of ratification.’ Maybe the president would say, ‘I have the power to do this withdrawal unilaterally, at least as far as I don’t have anything from the Senate or Congress telling me explicitly that I don’t have that power.’”Experts also disagree on what it would take for the US to re-enter the UNFCCC. Some experts believe that Trump’s exit nullifies the 1992 Senate vote in support of joining.“My own view is that a president would need to obtain a new approval,” said Bradley. “The US constitution requires senatorial approval for joining treaties but does not clearly require senatorial approval for leaving treaties.”That would mean the process of reentry would require a future president to secure the support of two-thirds of the Senate to agree to re-enter the treaty, which would be difficult to obtain in the contemporary political climate.Galbraith, however, believes the two-thirds Senate vote from 1992 remains in effect.Others, including Galbraith, believe that if Trump can unilaterally exit a treaty, a future president could rejoin it without a new two-thirds Senate vote.“You still have that on the books,” she said.Sue Biniaz, former principal deputy special envoy for climate at the state department, shares that perspective.“Climate action won’t stop because of the latest US treaty withdrawal, either in the US or globally. And the federal retreat is, hopefully, a temporary one. There are multiple future pathways to rejoining the key climate agreements,” she said, adding that she specifically agrees that the US could “rather seamlessly rejoin the UNFCCC based on the Senate’s approval in 1992”.Trump’s exit from the UNFCCC indicates to the rest of the world that the US is “an unreliable partner for long term commitments”, said Galbraith.“It’s a further signal of real antipathy to fixing what is a real and increasingly dire problem,” she said.The withdrawal from the agreement came on the one-year anniversary of devastating fires in Los Angeles, and days after the shocking capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, after which the president outlined a vision of the US boosting fossil fuel extraction from the South American country.“Trump’s contempt for international efforts to build peace and solidarity continues to shred the nation’s international credibility and will cause irreparable damage to current and future generations both at home and abroad,” said Melinda St Louis, director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch. “As climate harms escalate, choosing withdrawal is a shortsighted, profoundly irresponsible retreat from international leadership when it is needed more than ever.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceDonald TrumpUnited NationsUS politicsClimate crisisLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Repair works were continuing, the company said, adding that it had restored supplies to more than half of those affected.Andrew George, the Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives, has called on the government to provide more support. In aFacebook post on Sunday, he said: “If this happened in London or the home counties it would have been headline national news for days and the government would declare a national emergency.”He added that his call for a national emergency led to a “hastily put-together meeting of the emergency ministerial strategic response group chaired by Defra minister Mary Creagh MP” on Sunday.Creagh said she had met water bosses. “I remain very concerned that people in several areas in thesouth-east and south-west are experiencing water supply issues following both cold weather and Storm Goretti,” she told the BBC.On Monday, George hit out at the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for failing to grant the Lib Dem MP the right to call for a national emergency response despite granting one to East Grinstead in Sussex,which he said“has been suffering a water outage across 16,500 homes”.“I have every sympathy for the beleaguered people of East Grinstead and would never seek to diminish the terrible impact this has had and is having on them. But I’m certain the impact of the devastating storm experienced in Cornwall and on Scilly would dwarf that of the poor folk affected in the south-east. Over 50,000 homes have experienced water and/or electricity outages here,” he said in a post on Facebook.​George said the impact on the south-west’s most vulnerable people had been significant. He cited one incident in which some nursing home residents had to be evacuated after the building’s roof was ripped off in the storm and the home lost power and water supply.In response to the two major outages seen across Kent and Sussex in two months, MPs said the chief executive of SWW, David Hinton, was “not up to the job” and should be “moved on” during an urgent question in the Commons on Monday.Customers in Canterbury, East Grinstead, Maidstone, Tunbridge Wells, Whitstable and surrounding towns were left without water on Monday, with South East Water blaming Storm Goretti and the cold weather. Tunbridge Wells also suffered supply issues in December.Janine Williams, the landlord of the Blue Anchor pub in Helston, told the BBC: “It’s been a bit of a mess. We’ve had a lot of people coming in trying to charge their phones.“We’ve been quite lucky. The electric stayed on and we’ve got well water, so we’ve managed to keep our doors open. We’ve had our fires on and heating on, so people have had a warm place to sit.“Last night, our mains water got cut off again after being put back on.”On Friday, a man was found dead after a tree fell on to a caravan. Devon andCornwallpolice said emergency services were called at about 7.35pm on Thursday to the Mawgan area of Helston where work took place on Friday to remove the tree. A man in his 50s was found dead in the caravan. His death is not being treated as suspicious and his next of kin have been informed, police said.Explore more on these topicsCornwallDevonEnglandExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Generally going back to the Leveson proposals is where we would probably end up. And that would include having two lay magistrates sit with judges for trials.”Why does MoJ want to curtail jury trials in England and Wales?Read moreAnother person aware of the discussions within government said: “Ministers are confident they can get the package through the Commons, even with the opposition of some high-profile Labour MPs. The real battle lies in the Lords.”Under Lammy’s proposals, which would be the biggest shake-up of the English court system in a generation, defendants who are likely to receive asentence of three years or lesswould no longer get a jury trial.A new judge-only swift court would be set up to hear cases without juries, and magistrates would be allowed to sentence people to a maximum of 18 months, up from the 12 months they can hand down now.Ministers have said the move is necessary to halve the number of jury trials from 15,000 a year and to tackle the backlog of court cases that built up over the Covid pandemic.Lammytold the Guardianthis weekend the measures would allow the government to clear the backlog of 80,000 cases in a decade.Speaking while on a trip to Canada, where a single judge can give sentences of up to three years, Lammy said: “It has been happening in Canada for decades. It is very normal.”However, the justice secretary is facing a significant backlash from the legal profession, dozens of Labour MPs and peers from across the upper chamber.The Labour MP and former shadow attorney general Karl Turner has said he could stand down, thustriggering a byelection, unless the government scraps its plans.However, officials are understood to be more concerned about the reception in the Lords, where many recent pieces of government legislation have struggled.Sources say that if they do have to back down, they are likely to retreat to a position closer to that originally suggested by Leveson, whose proposals were strengthened in several significant areas.Probably the most contested proposal was to change Leveson’s recommendation of a new criminal court with a judge sitting with two magistrates to one that has a judge sitting alone, thereby removing lay participation.Ministers also recommended expanding the threshold for cases to be heard in the new court from those with a maximum sentence of two years, as Leveson recommended, to crimes with a maximum three-year sentence.This will impact on “either way” offences, where the defendant can decide whether they will be tried by a jury or magistrates.Additionally ministers intend to boost magistrates’ maximum sentencing powers – which has in the past proved unpopular with lawyers – to 18 months or even two years if needed. The current maximum in magistrates courts is 12 months, which was only increased from six months in 2024.The overall effect is that fewer offences – and so defendants – will meet the threshold for a jury trial and when they do not meet the threshold, unlike in Leveson’s proposals, there will be no non-professionals involved.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Only reform, combined with investment, will deliver swift and fair justice for victims. That’s why we are creating new swift courts, without magistrates and within the crown court, as well as investing millions in legal aid, the courts and increasing sitting days.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesBrian LevesonPrisons and probationShareReuse this content"

The US has dropped that accusation and he is not linked to the 9/11 attacks.MI5 andMI6passed on questions to the CIA to ask Zubaydah until 2006, even though MI6 was warned he was being subjected to harsh mistreatment in 2002, which lawyers argued made the British spy agencies complicit.It was considered that “98% of US Special Forces would have been broken if subject to the same conditions”, according to a report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee published in 2018.On Sunday the BBC reported that Zubaydah had received “substantial” compensation from the UK – a figure that lawyers not directly involved in the case estimated could amount to a six-figure sum.But there was no explanation from the UK government beyond a simple statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. It said it did not comment on intelligence matters, andit is not thought to have admitted liabilityin making the payment. Intelligence sources also declined to comment.Dominic Grieve, a former UK attorney general, who chaired the2018 parliamentary inquiryinto the UK spy agencies involvement in US torture and rendition during the “war on terror”, called for more clarity.“Somebody ought to ask a parliamentary question – and the government ought to make a ministerial statement,” Grieve said. In our inquiry “we could see what had happened, but not why it happened”, he added.The former government chief legal officer said it was “almost inevitable” that the UK would have to pay compensation and that Zubaydah was “undoubtedly a direct victim of UK negligence”.Dan Dolan, the interim deputy executive director of Reprieve, a human rights campaign group, said the UK should clearly express regret: “If the UK government was complicit in Abu Zubaydah’s horrendous torture, they owe him a public apology, not just a cash sum.”Dolan said that there remained a “gap in accountability” on the use of intelligence by the UK obtained from prisoners held abroad in situations were there was a real risk of torture, a practice still permitted in exceptional circumstances.At an earlier stage of the proceedings, Zubaydah was represented by Richard Hermer, who is now the attorney general, as part of a legal battle to demonstrate that English and Welsh law applied to his case. Ultimately, the UK supreme court accepted that argument in December 2023.A public inquiry into cases like Zubaydah’s was promised by David Cameron when he became prime minister, but was halted and replaced by a narrower investigation by parliament’s intelligence and security committee, which was not allowed to question more junior members of the agencies.Nevertheless, in Zubaydah’s case it concluded: “The agencies [MI5 and MI6] continued to send theCIAquestions to be used in interrogations without seeking any assurances regarding Zubaydah’s treatment in detention, until at least 2006.”Court disclosures in another case, brought by Dan Jarvis, now the security minister, and Conservative MP David Davis, indicated there could be a total of 15 other cases where the spy agencies were accused of being involved.Lawyers acting for Zubaydah, who is described as a “forever prisoner”, are engaged in a legal campaign in several countries aimed at obtaining compensation and securing his release after more than two decades in US custody.Explore more on these topicsGuantánamo BayCIAMI6PalestineUS militaryMI5Al-QaidanewsShareReuse this content"

She’s just sitting on her bones, basically.“She’s dying. She said it: ‘I’m dying.’ Her body’s shutting down. I know mentally she’ll remain strong right to the last moment, but she is dying. The government, by putting her in prison and denying her all her rights, they’re not just letting her die, they’re actively killing her.”Muraisi has said she is suffering from chest pains and “twitches on the side of her chest”, raising fears that she may be at risk of heart failure. Fellow hunger striker Kamran Ahmed, 28, who is on day 64, has been told by doctors that he is suffering from heart muscle shrinkage, with his heart rate dropping to 40 beats a minute, and is at risk of sudden cardiac arrest, his sister has said.Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who has type 1 diabetes, is fasting every other day for 44 days. On Saturday, Umar Khalid, 22, one of five prisoners to have previously paused participation in the hunger strike, restarted.Their key demands are a fair trial, immediate bail (all will have spent more than 18 months in prison before trial relating to Palestine Action-related activities),deproscription of Palestine Action, closing down the UK sites of the Israeli arms company Elbit Systems and ending censorship of the prisoners’ communications.Other demands include that Muraisi is moved back to HMP Bronzefield, as HMP New Hall, where she was transferred to last year, is hundreds of miles away from her family and support system.Nadin said that when she was on remand forinvolvement in a Palestine Action protestshe spent time in the same cell Muraisi now inhabits, and that supporters of the hunger strikers “wake up every day full of dread, full of pain and sadness”.On Monday, the authors Naomi Klein, Angela Davis, Judith Butler, Sally Rooney, Kamila Shamsie and China Miéville joined global scholars in astatement of solidarity for the hunger strikers. In an echo of the slogan that was on the placard Greta Thunberg was carryingwhen she was arrestedon 23 December, it simply says: “We oppose genocide, we support the Palestine Action prisoners.”Prof Peter Hallward, of Kingston University, one of dozens of academic signatories of the statement, said: “The UK is now perilously close to full descent into authoritarian rule. Ministers won’t even meet with hunger strikers who are now at death’s door. [They] seem perfectly ready to let this country’s most committed and courageous opponents of an ongoing genocide waste away and die.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service has assured us all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in line with longstanding policy with daily access to prison and healthcare staff. Prisoners are being supported to end their food refusal at any time.“Before Christmas, we offered to facilitate a meeting between the prisoners’ solicitors and healthcare officials. This offer was accepted on 8 January, and a meeting took place on 9 January.“Ministers will not meet with these prisoners or their solicitors. They face serious charges, and no government could agree to their demands, many of which relate to ongoing legal proceedings, including immediate bail, which is a matter for independent judges.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

No congregants or firefighters were injured in the blaze. Security camera footage released on Monday by the synagogue showed a masked and hooded person using a gas can to pour a liquid on the floor and a couch in the building’s lobby.Pittman’s father later allegedly became suspicious of burn marks on his son’s ankles, hands and face. He reportedly contacted the FBI and said that his son had confessed to setting the building on fire.Pittman had texted his father a photo of the rear of the synagogue before the fire, with the message, “There’s a furnace in the back.” His father had pleaded with his son to return home, but “Pittman replied back by saying he was due for a homerun and ‘I did my research,’” the affidavit said.During an interview with investigators, Pittman said he stopped at a gas station on his way to the synagogue to purchase the gas used in the fire. He also took the license plate off his vehicle at the gas station. He used an ax to break a window of the synagogue, poured gas inside and used a torch lighter to start the fire, the FBI affidavit said.The FBI later recovered a burned cellphone believed to be Pittman’s and took possession of a hand torch that a congregant had found.Local and national officials, religious figures and activists condemned the fire at the 160-year-old synagogue, the largest inMississippiand the only one in Jackson, the state’s capital.Arson suspect arrested after blaze at historic Mississippi synagogueRead moreIt was the site of aKu Klux Klan bombing in 1967– a response to the congregation’s role in civil rights activities, according to the Institute of Southern Jewish Life, which also houses its office in the building. The home of the synagogue’s rabbi, an outspoken critic of racial segregation, was also bombed two months later by the same group.“That history reminds us that attacks on houses of worship, whatever their cause, strike at the heart of our shared moral life,” said CJ Rhodes, a prominent Black Baptist pastor in Jackson, in a Facebookpost.The arson underscored the importance of interfaith solidarity in standing up to hate and bigotry, said Jim Berk, the chief executive officer of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Los Angeles-based organization focused on combating antisemitism.“It was an assault on the heart of Jewish life in the [US] South, and on a legacy shaped in partnership with the Black community through the long, unfinished struggle for civil rights,” Berk said in a statement. “This attack is not only an act of antisemitism – it is an assault on that legacy, testing whether the lessons of that era still hold.”“That it has been attacked again, amid a surge of antisemitic incidents across the US, is a stark reminder: antisemitic violence is escalating, and it demands total condemnation and swift action from everyone,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, in a statement.Beth Israel Congregation was assessing damage but planned to continue its regular worship programs and services for Shabbat, the weekly Jewish Sabbath, likely at one of the local churches that reached out, said Michele Schipper, CEO of the Institute of Southern Jewish Life and a past president of the congregation.“We are a resilient people,” said Zach Shemper, the Beth Israel Congregation president. “With support from our community, we will rebuild.”One Torah that survived the Holocaust was behind glass and was not damaged in the fire, Schipper said. Five Torahs inside the sanctuary are being assessed for smoke damage. Two Torahs inside the library, where the most severe damage was done, were destroyed, according to a synagogue representative.The floors, walls and ceiling of the sanctuary were covered in soot, and the synagogue will have to replace upholstery and carpeting.Explore more on these topicsMississippiUS crimeFBIJudaismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Ørsted has also sued on behalf of its Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York.Monday’s hearing was the first of three preliminary injunction hearings that will be held this week in lawsuits seeking to block the offshore wind pause.

Her story has been memorialized in the Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s latest film,The Voice of Hind Rajab, which has been shortlisted for an Academy Award.“Hind Rajab did not die because help was impossible, but because it was denied,” Ben Hania said in a statement to the Guardian.

The Israeli organization B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights are among the human rights groups that signed the letter, whichwill be presented to UK and EU leaders in parliamentary meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.The letter calls for the “immediate, unconditional, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access into Palestine”, including the entry of medical and humanitarian personnel.Israel recentlybanneddozens of aid agencies from work in Gaza and the West Bank, including Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), on the grounds that they would not fulfill onerous registration requirements that the groups say would put their staff at risk.

Many medical items, includingwheelchairs and walkers, have been barred entry.A panel of UN experts determined that Israel’s attacks on the sector and its workers amounted to “medicide” – the systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare system and a component of Israel’s larger campaign against Palestinians that legal experts have called genocide.The Israeli military said in a statement that “the claims that IDF forces are deliberately preventing medical teams from treating wounded civilians is completely baseless, both in the Gaza Strip and in the Judea and Samaria region,” using the term for the West Bank preferred by the Israeli government. “The IDF recognizes the importance of the special protections given to medical teams under international humanitarian law and takes action to prevent harm to them,” the statement continued.The letter asks world leaders to take “immediate action” to restore and enable medical access for patients in Gaza and the West Bank, where increasing restrictions on movement have affected access to medical care.More than 18,500Palestinians awaitmedical evacuation from Gaza, (MSF)estimatedin December. The humanitarian agency said that at least 1,000 people have died awaiting care.Dr Thaer Gazawneh, a Chicago-based emergency physician who signed Monday’s letter, believes that Israel’s restrictions are designed to push Palestinians out of Gaza.“[They] are making the living conditions in Gaza so unbearable that people will be forced to be displaced again.”Gazawneh volunteers in the West Bank where he said it had become nearly impossible to dispatch emergency responders due to Israeli checkpoints and the threat of arbitrary arrests.At least 384 medical workers have been unlawfully detained by Israel’s military, according to theNGO Healthcare Workers Watch.“This call for medical access is urgent because medicine and care is the bare minimum of humanity, and when even that’s blocked, it puts every person on the planet at risk of being treated the same way: subhuman,” Glazer told the Guardian. Glazer, a New York-based Jewish comedian and actor first famed for her television series Broad City, has been a sharp critic of Israel’s war in Gaza, and previously signed aletteralongside 150 Jewish creatives calling for a ceasefire and the safe return of hostages.Hind’s mother told the Guardian that the issue of medical access felt particularly personal because her daughter had dreamed of becoming a doctor.“Hind never bought any ordinary toys or dolls like other children. She always chose doctor’s toys: a stethoscope, a plastic syringe, a small first-aid kit. She would treat her dolls, pat them, and promise them that everything would be all right,” Hamada said.“Hind’s dream is no longer to become a doctor, but for the children of Gaza to find a doctor, a hospital, medicine, and safety.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Its bid has beenbackstopped by a personal $40bn guaranteeby Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle.Netflix and Paramount deals are both wrong for Warner Bros Discovery – and democracy | Courtney C RadschRead moreUnder the Netflix deal, the streaming company is poised to take control of WBD’s prize assets such as Warner Bros, the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Superman and Batman, as well asHBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.Paramount also said on Monday that it had filed a lawsuit seeking disclosure of “basic information” – including how WBD has valued the global networks operation, which includes CNN, the Cartoon Network and the Discovery Channel, whichNetflixis not buying – so that WBD shareholders can “make an informed decision”.In the letter, David Ellison, the chief executive of Paramount, said: “We are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting.”Paramount said the “slate of directors” it intended to nominate would then engage with the company to assess the merits of its takeover bid.Paramount also said it intended to propose an amendment to WBD’s bylaws to require shareholder approval for the proposed spin-off of the global networks business.“If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval,” David Ellison said. “These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.”The Netflix deal offers $23.25 a share in cash as well as stock in the streaming company and equity in the global networks spin-off that Paramount values at zero.“We do not undertake any of these actions lightly,” David Ellison said. “Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD’s board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.”Paramount argues that its $30-a-share cash offer, which includes buying global networks, is a better deal for WBD shareholders.WBD’s board hastwice told shareholders to reject the “inadequate” $108.4bnhostile takeover bid.​​WBD called the bid the “largest LBO [leveraged buyout] in history”, a structure it said posed risks to the offer.Under the terms of its deal with Netflix, WBD would have to pay a $2.8bn breakup fee if it walked away from the agreement.Paramount Skydance’s revised offer also involved increasing its termination fee to $5.8bn, matching Netflix.However, WBD said if it were to accept the deal with Paramount it would incur $4.7bn in costs, including the breakup fee to Netflix, additional interest on debt and a $1.5bn fee for failing to complete a debt exchange.Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsWarner BrosNetflixParamount PicturesTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They are then rated accordingly, and explain what they will do to improve.Thomas’s bill, a longstanding campaigning aim of the Co-operative party, of which 41 Labour MPs are members, would establish similar reporting requirements for the UK.Banks would have to “measure and disclose their performance in reducing financial exclusion, including exclusion from affordable credit, and in improving access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses”, and regulators would “establish a system for rating banks according to that performance”.The legislation would also oblige the banks to back credit unions and community development finance institutions (CDFIs) that specialise in small-scale, face-to-face banking in underserved communities.In the US, many banks fulfil their requirements under the CRA by collaborating with CDFIs.Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “I’m pleased my colleague Gareth is drawing attention to this issue. All too often, improving financial inclusion is treated as an abstract box-ticking exercise rather than a core responsibility of a modern, progressive society.“My committee has launched an inquiry into the Treasury’s proposals to improve financial inclusion. We will be looking at whether the government has the plan and resources to genuinely tackle the real barriers people face. If this is not done properly, we all lose out.”Michelle Ovens, the founder of campaign group Small Business Britain, said: “Many small businesses and individuals continue to face barriers to accessing fair and affordable banking. This bill would be an important step towards tackling financial exclusion by increasing transparency and accountability across the banking sector.”The bill has little chance of proceeding, but many Labour backbenchers are keen to float alternative economic approaches, given widespread dissatisfaction with the party leadership’s approach.Thomas was a junior minister in the Department for Business and Trade untilthe September reshufflecaused by Angela Rayner’s resignation.Reeves made the latest of a string of policy retreats last week, with the government promisingadditional support for pubsfacing sharp increases in their business rates bill. It was the second U-turn in a matter of weeks, following the decision to significantlyraise the threshold at which inheritance tax will be paidon farmland, after a year-long backlash.A Treasury source stressed that existing laws and regulations, including the consumer duty, overseen by the City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, already place responsibilities on banks in respect of financial inclusion, and suggested Thomas’s bill risked duplicating these.Explore more on these topicsBankingSmall businessPersonal loansLabourBorrowing & debtUK cost of living crisisBanks and building societiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The platforms can then offer specific product suggestions, after scraping the internet and inbuilt datasets for relevant information. Some sources are given more trusted status than others.SeveralUK retailers have told the Guardianthat they are working on generative engine optimisation, the latest incarnation of search engine optimisation, to help push their company to the top of results from AI chatbots.Tactics include making sure they appear in Reddit forums, as well as responding to reviews on Google or Trustpilot, and ensuring AI models can access the correct product data.It represents a new challenge for retailers competing for business online, as well as undermining Google’s dominance in traditional search traffic for shopping.Google has been developing its own AI features, and on Sunday announced that it had teamed up with several leading US retailers, including Walmart, to enable shopping within its Gemini AI chatbot. Sundar Pichai, the Google chief executive, said customers would “soon be able to experience everything they love about Walmart directly in the Gemini app”.More consumers are also usingAI agents– autonomous digital secretaries – to help with theironline shopping. Last year, OpenAI, Perplexity, Google and Microsoft launched AI features that allow users to search for products through their chatbots, with agents that can complete orders on behalf of consumers.JD will report on its fourth-quarter trading after the crucial Christmas period on 21 January.

In her debut show Laid, a maternal-anxiety antic that won her best newcomer at the Edinburgh comedy awards, she gave birth to eggs then broke them on stage. In her second, Nate, she cross-dressed asa beer-chugging douchebagto workshop sexual assault and consent with her astonished audience. Who foresaw that this loose cannon would soon be Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s clown coach, in the series Gutsy? Who then saw an extended New York City run beckoning, thronged with celebrity attendees?“Drew Barrymore came, Kevin Bacon came,” says Palamides, on a video call from her native California. “Sabrina Carpenter came: that was nuts. Dua Lipa, Nathan Fielder, Neil Patrick Harris.” The show was Weer, and the run (until shortly before Christmas) was at “the birthplace of Off-Broadway”, the Cherry Lane theatre,recently relaunched by hip movie studio A24. When we speak, Palamides, 36, is laid low with flu, her body’s revenge for that marathon three-month run. “I thought a month would be the longest I’d ever do it,” she croaks. “It takes a lot of physical endurance to make it through the show.”Premiering in Edinburgh in 2024,Weerbuilt on the gender-bending Nate, and stars Palamides as both halves of a romantic comedy couple. And when I say “halves”, I mean it: one half of her face and body plays Mark (plaid shirt; facial hair), the other, Christina (fluffy pink top; flowing locks). This hot mess of a show flashes back from a car accident to stage the three-year span of their relationship, as Palamides now flirts and makes out with herself, now bickers with and abuses herself. It’s a virtuosic performance stunt, all in the name of outrageous entertainment and a warped celebration of the 90s romcom.View image in fullscreen‘It takes a lot of physical endurance to make it through the show’ … Natalie Palamides in Nate.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianEven getting into makeup and costume each night takes several hours, she reports, never mind the exhausting solo turn. “I made sure to take good care of myself,” she says. “I do biotherapy and red light therapy every day.” Convalescent in LA, she’d love a break – but the show’s UK return beckons, another chance for London audiences (and maybe celebs too) to see what the Off-Broadway fuss is about.What chord does Palamides think Weer has struck with audiences? “I hope it’s the rollercoaster ride element that makes them feel so taken by the show,” she says. “Being able to get big laughs and joy then also feel those tender, vulnerable moments.”“When I was making it, I went to seeThe Notebook on Broadway. Not to dog anybody, but that’s one of the most successful romantic films of all time. And it’s such a letdown how they did it on stage. In the film, when they kiss in the rain, it’s so cathartic, they’re finally back together. But on stage, you didn’t get to relish that feeling, they didn’t build any tension with them being apart and wanting each other.” Weer would be different. “I was determined that all those feelings you feel watching those movies would be there in my show.”Mission accomplished – and more. Weer is no mere homage to romcoms, it’s also a critique, burrowing (like most of Palamides’ work) under the skin of gender assumptions and conventions. “I wanted to explore how in most romantic comedies we’re fed in our culture, the relationships are toxic, but you still root for them to be together. Was it possible to show the audience a relationship much more intense and toxic, and see if the audience still wanted them to be together?”View image in fullscreenOutrageous entertainment … Natalie Palamides in Weer.Photograph: A24It’s an inquiry that’s consolidated Palamides’ position, next to her old mentorPhil “Dr Brown” Burgers, at the spearhead of the current clown boom. Alongside her own shows, and a starring voiceover role in animated sitcom The Powerpuff Girls, she has directed Bill O’Neill’s slapstick smashThe Amazing Banana Brothers, is developing a clown-conjuring cabaret Lady Magic (previewed at last year’s Edinburgh fringe) for a Las Vegas residency – and was invited by the Clintons to tutor them in physical comedy fortheir TV series. She’s also now plotting a screen version of Weer.“I have no idea how it’s happened,” says Palamides of her status as comedy’s hippest goon. “I just keep persevering and trying to make good art.” Though she’d love some downtime, Palamides is premiering a new solo project at the Netflix Is a Joke festival this May – and if you were expecting a cash-in on her recent success, you’ll be disappointed. This next idea, she says, “is not palatable. It’s very off-putting. It’s based on a character I’ve done a couple times [on stage] who says she’s pregnant with the second coming, and she births a raw steak and beats it until it’s stopped crying, then she eats it.”“I’m fearful to do this, because I was raised Catholic. I was super-scared of Satan and demons when I was growing up. It feels so taboo to delve into this area.” But taboos are Palamides’ currency: this is a clown who trades less in red noses, more in red flags. Whether she’s flying them in Weer or in the carnival of sacrilege set to follow, good luck taking your eyes off her.Weer is atSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, 14-24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsComedyClownsTheatreSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Granted, the first time I watched the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, I was the impressionable age of 11 and “Look people in the eyes when they’re talking to you” was on constant rotation in my household. So my green eyes met Ferris’s brown ones and I took it all in.‘I find it all a bit comforting’: why Zodiac is my feelgood movieRead moreCentred around Matthew Broderick’s playful turn as Ferris Bueller, a high school senior faking illness to skip school, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is certainly a celebration of the carefree, though the story is by no means languid. Made frantic by doing the thing you’re not supposed to do with the aid of a red Ferrari, the day speeds by in comparison to the fictional days of other American teen films, such as American Graffiti and Dazed & Confused – which, to be fair, features a decent amount of marijuana.The pace owes itself to the constant change in location. Once Ferris’s doting parents fall for a clammy-hands stunt (“lick your palms”), his day is well and truly off. With charm and, yes, a bit of verbal manipulation, he wrangles his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), out of the North Shore suburbs of Chicago to tour the city’s many offerings, all while escaping the clutches of a jealous sister and a wrathful dean of students.These antagonists are mere personifications of the status quo – a signature of the film’s writer-director,John Hughes, who devoted much of his career to coming-of-age narratives. Through jokes, monologues and the occasional devastating remark about growing up, Hughes’s scripts expressed his contempt for adults masking capitalist values with maturity – just do what you’re told and smile. To Hughes, young people saw the world with a clarity deserving of attention.A belief he underlines with a shot of Ferris, Sloane and Cameron, standing on railings while pressing their heads to the glass windows of the then-tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower (now named Willis Tower). Peering down, Sloane notes, “The city looks so peaceful from up here.” “Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet,” Ferris muses. To wield perception is a strength, one honed by this titular character.Known as the final line, the movie’s defining quote also makes an appearance at the very beginning as Ferris prepares for his day off: “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” A lesson I’m still attempting to grasp in adulthood – one I know I’m not alone in. Most of us aren’t making out in front of stained glass windows nearly enough.Ferris Buller breaking the fourth wall, the line is delivered to the audience, to me age 11, 15, 21, 28 – its meaning more significant with each passing year. Upon that first watch, I was captivated by the concept that one could be extraordinary because they reveled in life’s ordinary activities: visiting a local landmark, attending a baseball game, meandering around a museum; there was no need for superhuman strength, a high level of intellect nor even loving the right person. With charisma and the inherent knowledge that singing on a parade float is something one should do if given the opportunity then naturally the adoration of “the sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads” will follow.Admittedly, Cameron is the more relatable character, weighted heavily by unfeeling parents and Ferris’s schemes. Many viewers cite Ferris as a “psychopath” in regards to his insensitive approach to get Cameron out of bed. Perhaps we’re so entrenched in therapy-speak nowadays, but we don’t have friends to tell us we’re perfect, we have them to remind us what’s out there. Challenge us when we claim we’ve seen “nothing good”, as Cameron does. Living is friction made palatable when it’s not a lone endeavour. Ferris should have taken some blame for the crunched Ferrari, though; he’s no hero, not even to me.Lip-syncing Danke Schoen doesn’t cure my anxiety-riddled brain nor does channeling Ferris make me impenetrable to unlikability – one-dimensionality is best left to characters on a screen. But the film does give me the tools to feel. Help me make sense of my path. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is there for me when I need to be reminded to stand still. Watching to stop every once in a while, so I don’t miss it.Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is available on Paramount+ in the US, Paramount+ and Now in the UK and Paramount+ and Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFerris Bueller's Day OffMy feelgood movieMatthew BroderickJohn HughesComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was never recognised and finallyconfessed his true selfon his hospital deathbed in 2024, having being diagnosed with terminal cancer.Rairu Sugita plays the young Satoshi, a long-haired, bespectacled radical whose grinning face on his police mugshot made him a national icon, and the older Satoshi is played by Kanji Furutachi. The movie, in its stylised way, gives us the moment of youth transformed to age by having young Satoshi accidentally bump into older, wizened Satoshi on a gloomy country walk and glumly cede his identity to him.What can have been going through Satoshi’s mind all those years? The film imagines him to have embraced, with monkish asceticism, the idea of “escape” as a noble Zen vocation of inactivity. This is not simply a matter of mutely taunting authority and not betraying one’s comrades: it is an existential state of defiance, perhaps even ascending, mysteriously, to something higher than that. But what exactly? And shouldn’t Satoshi have tried to flee the country and promote the cause abroad, just as the director did?It could be that Adachi intendsthe audience to remember Hiroo Onoda, the Japanese soldier who held out in the Philippine jungle from 1945 until 1974, refusing to believe the war was over. But that was a kind of quixotic, tragicomic heroism which Satoshi doesn’t quite have; his life seems more to have been a quasi-accidental embrace of stasis, as he toiled pointlessly away on construction sites. Or perhaps, in a rather pathetic way, his transcendentally inactive revolutionary existence was how he transformed the idea of contrition for those innocent lives lost in the bombings caused by his comrades.Escape is at the ICA, London from 16 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJapanPeriod and historical filmsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

His negative judgment has been shared by many in the near 90 years since Freud’s death. A reputational high-water mark in the postwar period was followed by a collapse, at least in scientific circles, but there are signs of newfound respectability for his ideas, including among those who once rejected him outright. Mark Solms’s latest book,a wide-ranging and engrossing defence of Freud as a scientist and a healer, is a striking contribution to the re-evaluation of a thinker whom WH Auden described as “no more a person now but a whole climate of opinion”.It would be difficult to improve on Solms’s credentials for the task he sets himself. He is a neuroscientist, expert in the neuropsychology of dreams, the author of severalbooks on the relationship between brain and consciousness, a practising psychoanalyst and the editor of the 24-volume revised standard edition ofFreud’s complete works. He is also a wonderfully witty and lucid writer.I read The Only Cure through the lens of its bold – perhaps too bold – title.It contains two claims. First, that psychoanalysis is a cure in the sense that its benefits are lasting and may continue after treatment has been completed. Second, it is the only cure since rival treatments – notably drugs – may lose their effect when they are discontinued because they do not address underlying causes. Solms cites overviews of clinical trials that he believes support these claims. The story he tells seems extremely encouraging – unless, like me, you are obsessional enough to read the papers to which he refers.Solms opens his defence by citing a review that lumps together psychological, educational and behavioural treatments. It is not clear how this makes the case for the specific benefits of psychoanalysis. Moreover, a response to this review from an equally impressive source deems the various therapiesno more effective than a placebo.When Solms homes in on the evidence for what he calls “good old-fashioned psychoanalysis”, he cites the positive findings of an authoritativesystematic overview, but omits reference to the final lines of the paper, which warns against drawing hasty conclusions and calls for “larger studies of higher quality”. A more recent systematic review published in the Lancet Psychiatrywas similarly cautious. Admittedly, the treatment schedule was brief. More relevant, perhaps, is an examination of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapy (at least 50 sessions over a year). This seems to show clear benefit, but again the authors counsel caution “given the low quality of available evidence”.In fairness, researchers in this area face daunting problems. Gold-standard clinical trials are double-blind (meaning neither the patient nor the doctor knows what treatment the patient is receiving until the end of the study); incorporate an appropriate alternative against which to measure the effect of the treatment being tested; require a well-defined, even homogeneous, patient population; have objective, quantifiable measures of outcome, and control for other relevant variables. These criteria cannot be met for psychotherapies.The jury is still out, therefore, as to whether psychoanalysis is a cure, never mind the only cure. At best one can conclude it is as effective as other psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which are, however, less labour intensive.‘We don’t need to rehabilitate every thought Freud had,’ Solms writesNear the end of his life, Freud reflected that better therapies than psychoanalysis might be discovered when we understood more about how the brain worked. Has this hope been fulfilled? Here we might look to drugs such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. Solms accepts that these can complement or supplement psychotherapies, but argues that, since they do not address the fundamental causes of mental health conditions, they are palliative, not curative. He compares prescribing drugs to employing painkillers rather than surgery to treat angina due to a blocked coronary artery.That said, Solms does not dismiss neuroscientific understanding of mental illnesses. This would anyway conflict with his fascinating and laudatory account of the early Freud as a serious contributor to neuroscience, and Freud’s belief that there would ultimately be a convergence between functional models of the mind and physiological ones. In highlighting Freud-the-neuroscientist, Solms distances him from the image of a quack whose theoretical claims were unscientific, not least because, as Karl Popper argued, they were unfalsifiable. This charge underlies the much-quoted joke about the patient who protested to Freud that his dreams were often horrible, disproving the psychoanalytic dogma that dreams are wish fulfilment. To this, Freud responded that horrible dreams fulfil a patient’s wish to upset his therapist.Solms rejects much Freudian orthodoxy, loosening some of the connections between the more notorious and vulnerable theoretical underpinnings of psychoanalysis and its clinical application. “We don’t need to rehabilitate every thought Freud had,” he writes. Articles of faith such as the sexual basis of all pleasures, the death drive, penis envy and the id are discarded. He also deals sceptically with the carnival of characters – among them shrink from hell Jacques Lacan – who developed their own eccentric versions of psychoanalysis.Nevertheless, Freud’s central insight is retained: the longstanding and profound effects of early-life experiences. These are more powerful for being buried. In modern society, an individual’s emotional needs may go unmet for long periods of time, meaning “we can spend our lives under the intoxicating influence of contextually inappropriate emotions”. Solms illustrates this with deeply moving case histories of patients who have been prisoners of unresolved issues from their past, as well as an account of his own psychoanalysis. These cases show that at the heart of psychoanalytic practice is an empathy that enables patients to detoxify their experiences by being allowed to speak about them to a sympathetic and intelligent listener. His description of psychoanalysis as “a re-parenting process” captures its humanity.One particularly compelling story opens and closes the book. Teddy P is a doctor whose professional and personal life disintegrate after his mother’s sudden death. Overwhelming depression, memory loss, sleep disturbance, episodic unconsciousness, headaches, muscle pains and so on attract various diagnoses, which prompt a range of ineffective treatments whose side effects add to his woes. Over four years of therapy, Solms helps Teddy P to exhume his loveless early life and the subsequent inward deflection of aggressive impulses originally felt towards his emotionally unavailable mother. We learn of his ultimate recovery, leading to a happy marriage and work life.The extrapolation from successful cases to a defence of the psychoanalytic approach reminded me of the aphorism “data is not the plural of anecdote”. And Solms’s claim to be able to synthesise “the best of modern neuroscience” with “the core insights of psychoanalysis” remains a promissory note.Notwithstanding lingering doubts about the evidence for the unique clinical efficacy of his cure,Solms has nudged the attitude of this sceptic towards Freudian (or Freudian-inspired) psychoanalysis from scorn to agnosticism. I am prepared to recognise its clinical role, though further research would be welcome. What it delivers in practice will, of course, depend on the personal qualities – above all the acumen and integrity – of the therapist.Professor Raymond Tallis is a clinical neuroscientist and philosopher.The Only Cure: Freud and the Neuroscience of Mental Healing by Mark Solms is published by W&N (£25).

It has a music that lifts it immediately from the page, and, although it questions anticipated regularities of scansion, rhyme scheme and form, these minor instabilities in fact contribute to its effectiveness.The first line, for instance, has various rhythmic possibilities: it works well if scanned as two doubledactyls(“Ifthere weredreamsto sell”), but also fits the bill asiambic trimeter(“Ifthereweredreamstosell”), or, perhaps most appealingly, a combination: “Ifthere weredreamstosell”. Awareness of that flexibility benefits the reading of the subsequent first lines – the first line of the second stanza, for example, which is rather more effective with the slower movement of three iambs: “A cottageloneandstill.”There’s a further shift, in that the poem seems to begin as a personal, rather whimsical question to the reader (“If there were dreams to sell / What would you buy?”: that suggestion of intimacy certainly helps engage us. But in the second stanza, the speaker answers his own question, and we begin to feel the inwards-turning of his thoughts, sustained until the final stanza, where the “you” and the speaker’s “I” again become separate, or apparently so.Regarding the rhyme scheme and stanza-form, the first stanza is distinctive in having 10 lines, with lines one and two repeated unchanged, and a little group of triplets that picks up the “A” rhyme: “sell / tell / bell”. That triplet pattern is dropped in the subsequent nine-lined stanzas. Repetition remains important, though: it’s audible throughout, in the three times recurring “crown / down” rhymes, for instance, and the bigger pattern of question-and-answer.Argument begins to predominate: there had been “dreams to sell” but, the speaker tells himself in stanza three, “ill didst thou buy”. The most urgent question concerns the issue of “ghosts to raise” – a concern born of Beddoes’ practice both in poetry and medicine. His fascination with the gothic in the poems and dramatic writing, Death’s Jest Book in particular, comes from his medical studies, and the serious investigation into post-death spiritual survival. His conclusion that no evidence existed didn’t preclude the poetic argument with mortality.Beddoes’ search for “a dream to prize” centres on the question of which ghost he would “raise”. He refers to those “buried well”, the adverb hinting that there may be a psychological depth desirable for effective burial. A newly rumoured possibility appears: if “life is a dream”, to die may be to wake to a different level of reality.The dreamed-of ghost in stanza iv, ”the loved long-lost boy”, is thought to be the Russian medical student, Benjamin Bernhard Reich, with whom Beddoes lived for a year when he himself was studying medicine at Göttingen. The complexity of the poet’s sense of alienation has gained a new dimension from an increasing recognition of his homosexuality. It was integral to the spectrum of his creative and political rebellion, and to his way of life. In continental Europe, he was mostly a wanderer, essentially homeless. In the poem, the earlier dream of the settled dwelling that would “best heal my ill” has particular pathos.Dream-Pedlary, as it deftly negotiates technical and imaginative integration, shows Beddoes finding his place as a kind of late-Romantic poet: see also his earlytribute to Shelley. At the same time, there’s a self-parodic, almost camp consciousness at work: Romantic tropes beget wry questions, delicate metaphors gain fleshly weight. The first-stanza dream (lines five and six) which costs only “a light sigh” rather than the funeral bell, is revised in the fifth stanza, where the “rose-leaf” and “Life’s fresh crown” reappear, differently balanced. The rose-leaf falls less lightly: the certainty larger than the “crown” is the fact of death, and optimistic inferences can only be paradoxical, perhaps made in pure jest: “Thus are the ghosts to woo; / Thus are all dreams made true, / Ever to last!”The text (sadly, without the indentations) is copied from Edmund Gosse’s 1890 edition of the Poems,which can be read here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We first encounter the novel’s thoroughly anonymised first-person narrator in Oslo in the summer of 2007, where he or she or they are employed as a research assistant to a renowned Icelandic philosopher named Alda Jónsdóttir. Jónsdóttir is described as “eminent, tall, strong and terrifying”, and likes to host dinner parties for her histrionic institutional peers. The hapless narrator’s job is to help facilitate her work in “box philosophy”: “the study of categories, the ways we organise reality into groups and sets […] the ways we end up thinking inside the box, even when we are trying to think outside the box”.The action truly begins when Jónsdóttir sends the narrator off to the Greek island of Hydra to meet Theódoros Apostolakis, a dentist/poet/mystic and devotee of Seven, an (entirely fictitious) board game once “played across the ancient world from Greece to Asia Minor”, for which the narrator happens to share a particular passion. Apostolakis is also the keeper of the Fanouropiton, or “Catalogue of Lost Things” – “like a steampunk Book of Kells”, in which an index of lost items are recorded on “carefully illuminated” pages.What follows is a peripatetic romp through a range of scenic locations across Europe, under parabolic skies and over silvery seas, in which our narrator encounters a madcap cast of thinkers, gamers, artists and some extremely hateful “incoherent rich people”, all of whom demonstrate, in their own way, our adorably human desire to define, categorise and “box” reality even as it slips from our intellectual grasp. Along the way we cover the mythical King Minos and his labyrinth, Alexander the Great and the Gordion knot, the tender lyricism of musician Steve Harley and the Nazi occupation of Crete. If that precis left you feeling a little overwhelmed, then this dense and abstruse novel may not be for you. Nevertheless, I – kind of a dummy, quite honestly – found an awful lot to enjoy about it.Once I stopped trying so desperately to understand it all, Seven became a very pleasing readIt helps that Kavenna’s philosophical rigour is leavened throughout by a generous sense of humour. Her characters are pleasingly outrageous and her jokes consistently good as the circumstances through which our hapless narrator moves grow increasingly absurd. (To wit: “He comes to ruin art, wearing a cravat! It’s too much!” cries Apostolakis, while attending an auction of paintings for the purposes of sabotaging the plan of some overprivileged wannabe artist-iconoclasts to draw a cock on a Goya sketch of a horse. “It’s reassuring when people maintain high levels of consistency through time,” the narrator observes, at one point. “You don’t want vampiric or Dorian Gray levels,” they concede, “but other levels up to that are reassuring.”)When the novel presents the theories of the 20th-century Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga, that our aptitude for play and a sense of “positive ludicrousness” demonstrate that human lives necessarily exceed “the rational, logical order of things”, this could perhaps be read as an indication of Kavenna’s artistic intent. Seven is not so much a novel about philosophy as it is a novel about philosophy’s limits – its structure is episodic, and across its length a recurrent contrast develops between the over-refined abstraction of the discourses our narrator is subjected to and the cosmic sublimity of the natural world that they move through and experience. As a highly symbolic controversy involving an AI platform unfolds in the world of professional Seven play, the narrator awakes on an idyllic island in the Sea of Marmara in Turkey, “to the scent of mimosa trees and the sound of waves, pigeons cooing on the veranda”. “It was so peaceful, as if the cybertangle wasn’t even real. If you closed the laptop, it was unimaginable …” Seven’s knottiness therefore often feels, in the end, like a bit of a red herring, or so much imposture.I’m sure there will be plenty of readers with whom Kavenna’s elliptical style will disagree, and for whom the rewards of this weird little book won’t be worth the wade through the weeds. But personally, once I stopped trying so desperately to understand it all, Seven became a very pleasing read: an invitation to enjoy the formless delights of a universe “hanging out with itself”, where galaxies spiral in on themselves, and everything – “games, boxes, words, symbols, even the stars” – exists in a state of constant flux.Seven by Joanna Kavenna is published by Faber (£16.99).

With thinly disguised autobiographical accounts of family strife undergoing a sustained boom across the continent, it can increasingly lead to family reunions in courtrooms.Such was the case with the French historian Cécile Desprairies, who on Wednesday was sued for defamation by her brother and a cousin over the depiction of her late mother and her great-uncle in her 2024 novel La Propagandiste.“The author’s resentment toward the targeted individuals permeates the entire work, which is conceived as a genuine act of family vengeance,” the plaintiffs said in their legal complaint. They claimed there was an “absence of evidence” for the novel’s central plot, a woman’s collaboration with the Nazis, and asked for the book to be withdrawn from the market and pulped.View image in fullscreenThe first book in Knausgård’s My Struggle series.Photograph: PenguinIn the novel, which was longlisted for the Prix Goncourt in 2023 and, in Natasha Lehrer’s English translation, praised as a“clever and vivid book”in the Guardian, the narrator, Coline, tells the story of her morphine-addicted mother, Lucie, betrothed in her first marriage to a “convinced pro-Nazi” and designer of propaganda posters during the Vichy occupation.While the author has rejected the book’s classification as a roman à clef – a novel in which real people may be thinly disguised as fictional – she has made no secret of being inspired by her own childhood. “Most of the protagonists I was able to draw inspiration from were dead, so there’s a liberation of speech,” she told French television in 2023.Desprairies’ book can be grouped in the genre of life writing that the French author and literary critic Serge Doubrovsky in 1977 christened autofiction, a hybrid of autobiography and experimental fiction that has made inroads on the bestseller lists over the last decade via the Italian writer Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend and the Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle.Autofiction often focuses on painful or traumatic childhood experiences. From a legal point of view, “the trouble is that it’s very difficult to write about your own experience without touching on the experience of others”, said Larissa Muraveva, a researcher at Grenoble Alpes University.Knausgård, whose six-volume My Struggle series frequently thematises his difficult relationship with his alcoholic father, was threatened with a defamation lawsuit by his uncle before publication of the first volume. In 2018, Bergen’s National theatre was threatened with libel over a stage adaptation of an autofiction novel by Vigdis Hjorth, by Hjorth’s own mother.These threats never materialised into court action and in Norway families portrayed in autofiction have tended to find satisfactory retribution via creative means rather than legal channels. Knausgård’s former spouse Linda Boström Knausgård has published a novel that appears to dispute her ex’s fictionalised account of their breakup, while Hjorth’s sister Helga and a rumoured former lover, Arild Linneberg, a literary critic, have written their own “counter-novels”.View image in fullscreenSerge Doubrovsky, the literary critic who coined the term autofiction.Photograph: Serge Doubrovsky (2014) © JF Paga / GrassetMelissa Schuh, a lecturer in English literature at Kiel University in Germany, said: “The suspicion that some critics have harboured against writers of autofiction is that it allows you to have it both ways. In the context of fiction writing, it frees you from limitations of established genre conventions and lends your writing a possible air of authenticity. From the perspective of nonfiction writing, autofiction allows you to creatively use literary devices of fictionality but also to a degree inoculates you against potential legal action.”InFrance, however, novelisation has been less successful at shielding seemingly autobiographical accounts against court action, which may have emboldened Desprairies’ relatives.In 2013, the prominent autofiction writer Christine Angot and her publisher, Flammarion, were ordered to jointly pay €40,000 in damages for invasion of privacy against her lover’s ex-partner in her novel Les Petits. Another author, Camille Laurens, was taken to court by her husband in 2003 over the use of their daughter’s name in the novel L’Amour, Roman, though she won the case.View image in fullscreenChristine Angot, author of Les Petits.Photograph: Juan Naharro Giménez/Getty ImagesNatalie Edwards, a professor of French and head of modern languages at the University of Bristol, said: “It’s striking that there has also been a huge memoir boom meeting a very litigious culture in the US, but we haven’t seen as many legal disputes as in France. In France, a very vague law around privacy has met a very vague writing style.”In Desprairies’ case, the situation is different in that her relatives are suing her not for invasion of privacy but for “public defamation of the memory of the dead”. Mark Stephens, an English solicitor who specialises in media law, intellectual property and freedom of expression, believes they should not get their hopes up.“The law on the freedom of the press of 29 July 1881, the law that defines defamation in France, only protects the privacy rights of living people,” he said. “Descendants cannot sue for a blot on a family’s honour unless they can convince a court that their own reputation has been denigrated.”In her plea, Desprairies’ lawyer argued that linking the story of the book to the author’s living relatives would require “an extreme knowledge of genealogy or a power of divination, which readers do not have”.Stephens said: “As it stands, their claim looks pretty weak, if not to say impossible. French courts will be slow to muzzle a novelist exposing uncomfortable truths. Family pride makes poor law, and even worse literature.”A verdict in the case is expected on 17 March.Explore more on these topicsFranceDefamation lawEuropeMedia lawFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?Keza MacDonaldMon 12 Jan 2026 06.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 13.09 ESTShareLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, buteverythingwas painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.I’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.Traditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.In August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit startedmock-ritually-sacrificingeach other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. AndI love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.Silksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.The journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.Except Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.Hornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.Hampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games areverystressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.Unexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.You can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.Indeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.Giving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one buttwoprecious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.Difficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. Youcanalways win. You just have to try hard enough.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.I did not know that Icoulddo things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.After four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksonghashelped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

Noi and his dad share a cosy home with colourful bunting, sands on the doorstep and views of a stripy lighthouse. The Storm Whale, an adaptation ofthe 2013 picture book by Benji Daviesand its sequel, opens with a romantic ode to the briny air. These gulls swoop majestically, rather than cause a nuisance.Lydia Denno’s designs are idyllic but Davies’s story foregrounds how forlorn Noi (Emily Essery) feels while his dad (Richard Lounds) is away fishing each day. When a little whale is washed up, Noi gratefully befriends the animal before accepting he must set it free. Director Matt Aston’s adaptation, for children aged four to eight, sensitively explores how solitude need not mean loneliness. It’s a lesson passed on to Noi by the mother he has lost, as Aston sketches in a fuller backstory for the family.The script is touching and evocative but its earnest messages also grow repetitive and the dialogue can be wearyingly solemn – you miss the raucous fun of this theatre’sThe Singing Mermaid. Noi’s story is retrospectively framed by his friend Flo (Géhane Strehler), whose references to a midlife crisis will mean little to young audiences. Far better are flights of fancy such as the imagined strawberries-and-cream taste if you licked that lighthouse.View image in fullscreenEvocative … Géhane Strehler as Flo.Photograph: Ferdy EmmetIt’s a shame only one of Noi’s six cats is a fully realised puppet but they are cutely named after coastal towns and, in a sweet touch, the marmalade one is Sandwich. The whale puppet, made by Keith Frederick, is a squishy delight, with quivering tail and glinting eyes. Its sense of wonder is gradually realised through Sue Dacre’s puppet direction.The tempest that washes up the whale is beautifully rendered in Hayley Del Harrison’s choreography to composer Julian Butler’s jig. There are stirring sea shanties, too, and an array of light sources are creatively used in Jason Salvin’s lighting design.While affectionately illustrated, Davies’ original tale is not particularly playful, the language a bit flat. Aside from Noi wrestling the whale into his cart and hiding it in his tub, this unusual partnership lacks the offbeat humour of Oliver Jeffers’ boy-and-penguin double act inLost and Found. There are two set pieces – when Noi returns the whale to the water and, in a less focused second half based onThe Storm Whale in Winter, Noi’s father is rescued at sea. Both scenes are too brief. With wilder humour and a more adventurous spirit, the show would go down a storm.AtLittle Angel Studios, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatrePuppetryLittle Angel theatreChildren's books: 7 and underPicture booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

On 14 February 1779 the global explorer James Cook was clubbed and stabbed to death at Hawaii’s Kealakekua Bay in a dispute over a boat: it was a tragedy of cultural misunderstanding that still has anthropologists arguing over its meaning. Cook had previously visited Hawaii and apparently been identified as the god Lono, but didn’t know this. Marshall Sahlins argued that Cook was killed because by coming twice he transgressed the Lono myth, while another anthropologist, Gananath Obeyesekere, attacked him for imposing colonialist assumptions of “native” irrationality on the Hawaiians.It’s a fascinating, contentious debate. But the aftermath of Cook’s death is less well known – and the British Museum’s telling of it, in collaboration with indigenous Hawaii curators, community leaders and artists, reveals a surprisingly complex if doomed encounter between different cultures.Cook isn’t mentioned in the wall texts or portrayed in the show, but his ghost is everywhere in the objects he and his men brought back to Britain. And what marvels they are. Before Cook’s voyages the peoples of the Pacific, connected with each other by epic canoe crossings that linked the Polynesians from Hawaii and Easter Island to Tahiti and New Zealand, created cultural forms that we now call art. Giant pink feathered faces of gods with mother-of-pearl eyes grimace and gurn while a club embedded with tiger shark teeth combines beauty and menace. Bowls carried by naked figures on their backs embody how Hawaiian chiefs and monarchs were feasted and respected.View image in fullscreenKiʻi (image) of the god Kū, a Hawaiian god whose realm includes warfare and governance.Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumMonarchy is at the heart of this show, a common language shared by the otherwise chalk and cheese Hawaiians and Britons. After the death of Cook, which was heartily regretted on both sides, Hawaii learned, as it were, to speak British and assert its equality with a “modern” state. It worked, for a while. In 1810 King Kamehameha I sent a magnificent, feathered cloak to George III, with a yellow diamond pattern on red – on loan here from the Royal Collection which still owns it. The king apologised that he was too far away to support Britain in the Napoleonic Wars but expressed friendship – and could Britain help if Hawaii was attacked by France? The Hawaiian cloak is wittily juxtaposed here with a glittering jewelled costume worn by George IV at his coronation: idiosyncratic customs existed on both sides of the world.Forget Cook, the show suggests: remember King Liholiho. In 1824 he and his Queen Kamamulu set out on a journey that reversed all those British “discoveries”. They set sail for Britain laden with gifts, hitching a lift on a whaling ship (the story would be even better if they’d gone by outrigger canoe). George IV seems to have been touched by the greetings from across two oceans because he received the Hawaiians in 1824 with diplomatic honours. They were seen in the royal box at the theatre and portrayed by artists. Typically cartoonists were less generous – Cruikshank portrays the depraved George IV with his arms around a tattooed Polynesian. They also visited the British Museum where they could not have missed three of its most stunning exhibits, the feathered faces of gods brought back by Cook’s team from Hawaii which are known to have been on display at that time.View image in fullscreenIn 1810, Kamehameha I – the first king of unified Hawaii – sent this ʻahu ʻula (feathered cloak) along with a letter to George III of the United Kingdom.Photograph: © Royal Collection Enterprises Limited 2025 | Royal Collection TrustThe Hawaiian treasures retrieved from the British Museum’s stores are remarkable – they should have a permanent gallery to themselves. You can’t stereotype them: the fierce gaze of a martial-looking god with a chunky wooden body seems modernist, which is no coincidence because Pacific sculptures helped inspire modernism. I mistook one of the feathered godheads with its almost caricatural eye for a contemporary artwork. It was collected by Cook.These wonders are not reliquaries of a dead culture. There’s a perfectly preserved 18th-century dance rattle, or ‘uli’uli, brought back from Cook’s third voyage, a gourd from which purple, red and white feathers sprout and radiate. A video shows Hawaiian dancers using a modern recreation of the same instrument. To Hawaiians the artistic masterpieces their ancestors made are bearers of memory, instruments of identity.View image in fullscreenʻUmeke kiʻi (bowl with figure).Photograph: © The Trustees of the British MuseumThis exhibition is a celebration of Hawaii and a defence of museums with global collections. The almost miraculous preservation of delicate, fragile artworks made with feathers, teeth, wood and bark for almost 250 years is surely to the British Museum’s credit, as is this way of seeing them as embodiments of living culture.How does the story end? The king and queen of Hawaii gave their lives for cultural diplomacy: they both died of measles in London in 1824. George IV honoured them by sending their bodies home on a Royal Navy ship. Hawaii successfully persuaded Britain and Europe it was a nation state, with a monarchical government they could do business with – so Britain kept its greedy hands off this one place. In the end it would be the US that seized Hawaii, colonised it and eventually made it the 50th state. The objects here are weapons in a continuing cultural resistance.

He was one of twin boys born to Adichie and Ivara Esege, a doctor, in 2024 by surrogacy, eight years after the birth of their first child, a girl.In a WhatsApp chat to family and friends that was leaked on social media, Adichie wrote: “It is like living your worst nightmare.” Adichie’s team confirmed the authenticity of the messages.The TV channel Arise News reported that solicitors acting for the couple served Euracare hospital, a private medical facility, with a legal notice dated 10 January which asked for CCTV footage, electronic monitoring data and the toddler’s medical records within seven days. The notice alleged there were lapses during the child’s admission and lack of basic resuscitation equipment at the facility amounting to medical negligence.Nkanu died a day before he was due for medical evacuation to the Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, not far from the couple’s US home. He had been referred from another Lagos hospital to Euracare for a series of diagnostic procedures that included an echocardiogram and a brain MRI.In the WhatsApp chat, Adichie accused Euracare of negligence, saying a doctor had directly told her that the resident anaesthesiologist had administered an overdose of propofol, a sedative. Despite resuscitation and being put on a ventilator, Nkanu suffered a cardiac arrest that led to his death.Adichie said in the message that the anaesthesiologist had been “fatally casual and careless”.In response to the WhatsApp leak, Euracare said it was inaccurate to suggest medical negligence was the cause of death and that its staff had “provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards” to the “critically ill” toddler upon admission. The hospital has not yet replied to the legal notice.There has been an outpouring of condolence messages to Adichie and Esege, including from Bola Tinubu, the president ofNigeria. On Sunday, the Lagos state government lamented the “profound tragedy” and ordered investigations into the matter.Adichie’s first novel, Purple Hibiscus, was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2004, a year after its publication. She has since published seven other books, including 2025’sDream Count.Nigeria has an abysmally low doctor-to-patient ratio of1:9,083. Less than 5% of the total annual budget is usually allocated to the health sector. Botched procedures are common and emergency response services are sparse nationwide; in December, there was outrage after the boxer Anthony Joshua, who survived a car crash that killed two of his close friends just outside Lagos, was lifted by pedestrians into a police truck, rather than an ambulance.Medical tourism has become popular among wealthier Nigerians, including Tinubu and his predecessorMuhammadu Buhari, whose104-day absence abroad on medical grounds in 2017spurred conspiracy theories that he had died and been replaced by a body double.The former World Bank vice-president and Nigerian presidential aspirant Oby Ezekwesili said the country needed “deep reforms” for the sake of Nkanu and other Nigerians “who have needlessly died from the effects of governance failures that plague the health system”.Explore more on these topicsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieNigeriaChildren's healthAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Charlie, a widowed cabbie, arrived in the fictional Albert Square in 2000 with four of his five daughters, Lynne, Kat, Little Mo (Maureen) and Zoe, and his mother-in-law, Mo Harris.The role was in sharp contrast to the tough guys played by Martin earlier in his television career. But the usually mild-mannered Charlie’s devotion to his daughters could lead him to explode in anger, as he did on discovering that Kat (played by Jessie Wallace) was Zoe’s biological mother, having become pregnant after being raped by her uncle, Charlie’s brother Harry (Michael Elphick), when she was 13 – a secret known only by Kat and her late mother, Viv. When Charlie found out, he headed straight to the Queen Vic pub and attacked Harry, with locals having to restrain him. He also twice snapped in defence of Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth), and this led to a three-month prison sentence for Charlie.Like his screen alter ego, Martin, a London East Ender, who was twice married and divorced, was known as a big softie who could just occasionally snap. “We’re both easygoing family men,” said Martin in a 2001 interview with the Sun newspaper. “But if anyone upsets me or mine I could be your worst nightmare.”In EastEnders, Charlie went through several brief relationships – including one with Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) – and tried to be a guiding influence on his family. In 2010, Kat, by then running the Queen Vic with her husband, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), employed him as a potman. Martin was written out the following year when Kat blamed her father for leaving her newborn son, Tommy, alone in order to go out drinking. He returned for several brief stints, ending in 2016 when Charlie suffered a fatal heart attack.He had previously been considered by the EastEnders producers for the roles of Den Watts, which went toLeslie Grantham, and Frank Butcher, which was taken byMike Reidafter Martin committed instead to filming the drama King & Castle (1986-88).View image in fullscreenDerek Martin, left, with Nigel Planer, centre, and Anthony Chinn in the ITV crime drama King & Castle, 1988.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockHe was born in Bow, east London, to Christina (nee Jarvis) and Bill Rapp, a docker. James Cagney and George Raft, archetypal film gangsters, were his childhood heroes, and he was never far away from violence.On leaving school, he was an apprentice surveyor, then went through a string of jobs. During that time, he had his nose bent after being hit with a snooker cue, fended off a 20-strong gang by charging at them wielding an axe and was stabbed in the leg while working as a club bouncer. He also temporarily “looked after” guns for the Kray twins’ elder brother, Charlie.Following national service as a corporal in the RAF police (1951-53), he joined the Port of London Authority police, then became a meat porter at Smithfield market (1954-62). Being acquitted at the Old Bailey of stealing meat changed the course of his life. “When I got away with that, I realised I could act, and turned my back on crime,” he said. Bluffing to an agent that he had experience in repertory theatre, he took Martin as his professional name and landed a job as an extra on Z Cars.He did the same in series such as No Hiding Place (in 1965) and Softly Softly (from 1966 to 1969), often playing villains, and from 1966 also worked as a stunt performer until he broke his collarbone while filming Elizabeth R in 1971, which led him to concentrate on acting parts.View image in fullscreenDerek Martin and his EastEnders co-stars Elaine Lordan and Jessie Wallace at the National Television Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London, 2000.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockHis breakthrough came with the starring role of a corrupt police officer, Detective Inspector Fred Pyall, in Law and Order (1978), GF Newman’s four-part drama questioning the British legal system. “I’ve known a few coppers and villains over the years, and the dividing line is very fine,” Martin told TV Times in 1986.He played one of Cagney’s sidekicks when the Hollywood actor shot scenes for the 1981 film Ragtime in Britain, then co-starred on TV in The Chinese Detective (1981-82) as Detective Chief Inspector Berwick, the boss often seen reprimanding the East End officer played by David Yip for his unorthodox approach. In King & Castle, Martin starred as Ronald King, a bent ex-copper running the Manor debt-collecting agency, with Nigel Planer as his assistant, David Castle.In the shortlived BBC Spanish-based soap Eldorado in 1993, he played Alex Morris, a golf-playing mob boss on the Costa del Sol. Then, in the prison drama The Governor (1995-96), he was Gary Marshall, deputy to Janet McTeer’s title character.His autobiography, An East End Life: My Story, was published in 2010.Martin married Gloria Mitchell in 1961 and Christine Rigg in 1971, and is survived by David and Jonathan, the twins from his second marriage.Derek Martin (Derek William Rapp), actor, born 11 April 1933; 10 January 2026Explore more on these topicsEastEndersTelevisionSoap operaobituariesShareReuse this content"

So why are so many of us isolated and glued to our phones?Mon 12 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 07.46 ESTShare‘Ihate it.” I’ve asked the neuroscientist Ben Rein how he feels about the online sea of junk neuroscience we swim in – the “dopamine fasts”, “serotonin boosts” and people “regulating” their “nervous system” – and this is his kneejerk response. He was up early with his newborn daughter at his home in Buffalo, New York, but he’s fresh-faced and full of beans on a video call, swiftly qualifying that heartfelt statement. “Let me clarify my position: I don’t hate it when it’s accurate, but it’s rarely accurate.”He draws my attention to a reel he saw recently on social media of a man explaining that reframing pain as “neurofeedback, not punishment” activates the anterior cingulate cortex (a part of the brain involved in registering pain). “That’s genuinely never been studied; you are just making this up,” he says. He posted apithy responseon Instagram, pleading with content creators to “leave neuroscience out of it”. “That’s why I think it’s especially important for real scientists to be on the internet,” he says. “We need to show the public what it looks like to speak responsibly and accurately about science.”View image in fullscreen‘Connection is good for us, like vitamin D or getting enough sleep.’Photograph: Olga Pankova/Getty ImagesRein has carved a niche doing just that. He’s very much a “real scientist”, who has published in peer-reviewed journals, and did a post-doctoral fellowship at Stanford, where he still teaches. But he’s also a communicator, explaining the complex, imperfectly understood science of the brain in simple but compelling terms. He has 755,000followers on TikTokand is a regular podcast guest, discussing audience-friendly, often-controversial topics: the causes of autism, empathy, recreational drug use and now, the subject of his first book,Why Brains Need Friends: The Neuroscience of Social Connection.Could there be a timelier theme? We’re waking up, belatedly, to the fact that we’re living in what Rein himself calls a “post-interaction world”. Anyone wondering what all the recent fetishisation of Jomo (the joy of missing out) and the Covid-fuelled push towards introversion means for our health will find stark answers in Rein’s book. The evidence that isolation is bad for us is presented relentlessly. Reading it, I feel as if I should arrange an emergency gathering with all my friends and acquaintances.There is much research to illustrate the dramatic impact isolation has on our health and wellbeing. “The thing that always shocks me isthe study of strokes in mice,” Rein says, describing how researchers induced identical strokes in mice and found those that lived alone fared significantly worse. “They had more brain damage, they were less likely to recover, more likely to die.” I recallanother studyreferenced in his book, which found that out of just over 300,000 people, those with weaker social relationships were 50% more likely to die over a seven and a half year period. “It’s horrifying,” he agrees. “But it’s also like, why? How is that even possible? I like to use the mouse study to explain that a bit.”This is Rein’s speciality and one of the reasons he wrote the book: to “pop the hood”, as he puts it, of our social brains by getting granular about what makes us tick at a biochemical level. The book makes a pledge to use “no big words” because, he says: “I’ve noticed people who don’t understand science like to use big words to make it sound like they understand science.” So why is isolation so bad for mice, and what does it mean for people? “When we are isolated, it triggers a stress response,” Rein says. This happens to mice andhumans; it’s evolutionary. “The body’s alarm is going off and saying: ‘Hey, why are you on your own? This is dangerous. Find your community.’”View image in fullscreen‘We need to show the public what it looks like to speak responsibly and accurately about science’ … Ben Rein.Photograph: Brandon Watson/The GuardianThat stress response, he says, causes us to release cortisol. “Your body is preparing for a challenge and one of the things that happens is cortisol suppresses inflammation, because inflammation is not helpful when you’re trying to run away from a sabre-toothed tiger.” The problem is that unlike sabre-toothed tigers, isolation sticks around: the stress is sustained and cortisol loses its ability to suppress inflammation effectively. “When you have this long-term, chronic stress response, it can lead to a buildup of inflammation.”Inflammation is one of the body’s defence mechanisms against injury, illness and other stressors. It can become a problem if it is too prolonged or arises in the wrong contexts. Rein hates talking about it, he says, because it’s one of those buzzwords that gets used indiscriminately and inaccurately online. “Every time I say it, I think: ‘Oh, now the audience is judging me as being this bogus guy.’ But it’s real in this scenario. It’s one of the serious consequences of chronic stress, and it makes our organs less healthy.” Inflammation was shown to be the culprit in the mouse study: lonely mice no longer sufferedworse strokes than their socialised companionswhen researchers suppressed the inflammation their loneliness caused.Something similar happens to lonely humans. “People who are isolated have thischronic inflammation buildupthat is likely taxing their organs and preventing the healing process,” says Rein. Inone study, patients who reported high levels of “emotional support” after their first stroke showed “dramatic improvement” in their functional capacity. Another found that people suffering heart attacks who live alone aretwice as likely to diein the three years after than those who live with others.The converse is also true: when we’re around others, our brains release oxytocin (“the MVP” – most valuable player – of social bonding,” Rein writes in the book). Oxytocin is anti-inflammatory, suppresses stress and promotes wound healing. Married people, who have higher oxytocin rates, havebetter survival rates for cancer, according to a study in 2013.That communing with other people feels good has an evolutionary advantage. “Our brains have been shaped to make us want to be around others, because that’s good for our survival,” Rein says. When we release oxytocin in interactions with others, it “triggers this downstream effect, which is stimulating two very powerful neurotransmitters at the same time, serotonin and dopamine”. Dopamine, he explains, “is the brain’s way of saying what you’re doing right now is good for you and you should keep doing it again; serotonin is linked to mood”. The two together are “incredibly powerful at making us feel good”, he says.View image in fullscreen‘Our brains have been shaped to make us want to be around others’ … Ben Rein.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesIf connecting feels so good, why aren’t we doing it more? Our brain, so helpful in some ways, holds us back in others. “Humans are extremely poor at estimating what’s going to happen when we socialise, and how we’re going to feel,” Rein says. Psychology research has shown we thinkwe’ll enjoy interactions less than we actually do, weunderrate our own social skillsand underestimate how much other people like us (a phenomenon known as the “liking gap”). Rein attributes this inbuilt social anxiety again to our prehistory. “In an ancient world, connection was such a delicate thing – you needed to have intense connection with your group and intense wariness of the other group. All of this caution around our social lives is meant to force us to tread carefully, so that we don’t alienate ourselves from our own group.”Compounding that is the very modern problem of the internet. Online socialising – from WhatsApp groups to video calls – might have become vastly more popular since the pandemic, but it’s a pale imitation of the real thing for our brain’s social reward systems. “When you see facial expressions, you hear vocal tone, you see body language, you smell social smells, you experience eye contact, all of these things feed into the brain and say you’re interacting with someone.”Social media users “are more anxious, more depressed and more lonely, which is the exact opposite of what we see in people who socialise more,” says Rein. He has a hypothesis around “virtual disengagement”. “Social cues like facial expressions and body language are the signals our brains use to understand the emotions of others, so in an interaction where there are no social cues, how can your brain understand what someone else is feeling?” This, he believes, is a major cause of online hostility and division. One way to mitigate this, he says, is to use more emojis. “There’s evidencethat emojis produce similar brain responses to real human faces.”So how can you get the best out of real-life interactions? Despite its reputation as a social lubricant, booze might not be as good for socialising as it feels. When people say alcohol is a “depressant”, Rein explains, what they mean is that it depresses nervous system activity, making your neurons “better at shutting one another up” so you’re less thoughtful. Booze also dampens fear and anxiety responses, affecting our empathy and ability to process and react to social cues – not necessarily a recipe for successful socialising.Illegal drugs, such as psilocybin mushrooms and MDMA (or ecstasy), do the opposite. In lab studies on theimpact of MDMA on mice, he found that “MDMA seems to enable a totally unprecedented level of empathy by driving serotonin levels to newfound heights”.Rein is not suggesting humans take illegal drugs. He does say, however, that getting a dog has similar effects: when dogs and their owners look at each other, they have “a significant rise in oxytocin levels” and humans with dogs havelower cortisol levelsandcardiovascular risks. Rein’s simplest tip, though, is, wherever possible, to “upgrade” your interactions. Choose those that offer more social reward: if you are going to text, call; if you are going to call, video call instead, or better still, meet up in person.View image in fullscreenHumans with dogs have lower cortisol levels and cardiovascular risks.Photograph: Flashpop/Getty ImagesWhile Rein freely admits he’s “definitely an extrovert”, he is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all prescription for socialising, and extroverts and introverts have differing social needs. Everyone, though, benefits from some amount of socialising and suffers from its absence. That can become a vicious circle:research indicatesisolated people don’t feel neurochemical social rewards as strongly as those who are well integrated.There’s a fascinating interplay of selfish and selfless in the neuroscience of connection: we’re individually incentivised by neurochemical rewards to act socially or even altruistically. Seeing someone in pain (including social pain, such as embarrassment or exclusion) activates our own brain areas linked to pain, which could motivate us to intervene. Rein discusses anastonishing studywhich found that when rats are given benzodiazepines, which inhibit the ability to feel anxiety and unease, their readiness to free a trapped friend is sharply reduced.There’s something of this interplay mirrored in Rein’s book. His arguments for why we should be social can feel pragmatic, functional, even self-interested: connection is good for us like vitamin D or getting enough sleep; socialising is presented as the kind of longevity hack loved by podcast bros. Rein compares it with exercise: “You have such a clear incentive where you can look in the mirror and say, I look pretty fit and I want that to continue, so I’m going to do it. With socialising, people don’t have that visible incentive.”By explaining the health benefits, Rein hopes to provide that individual incentive to look outward. But his ambition is actually far more idealistic. “I worry about the way our societies are fracturing. If this book can convince people that talking to a stranger, giving a compliment, connecting positively with people in your life is good for you, then it gives them an incentive to do something that’s good for humanity. When you sleep well, when you go to the gym, it doesn’t make the world a better place. But when you’re nice to people in your community, it actually does make a difference.”Why Brains Need Friends: The Neuroscience of Social Connectionis out now, published by Quercus.

A tracking update later informed me that it “may be lost” and I could request a refund. I pressed the refund option and was directed to customer service, which insisted I wait a week to claim.A week later I was told I needed to file anincident reportfrom the email address associated with my account. When I complied, the report was rejected as coming from an address that “didn’t meet certain security standards”.I am now in the paradoxical situation thatif I use the address associated with my account, it doesn’t meet their standards, but if I use a different address, it is not the one associated with my account.Now, when I check the order page, itsays I requestedtoreturnthe item(I didn’t), and that it will issue a refund once I do so (I can’t, as I never received it).Amazon has taken the first two monthly instalments of £108, while I remain phone-less.SH,LondonThe company’s apparent contortions to avoid a pricey payout are, in my opinion, shameless, and it is by no means to its credit that it stumped up instantly when exposure loomed.It issued a refund within four hours of my getting in touch, and gave you a £50 voucher as “an additional gesture of goodwill”.It says: “We are sorry for the inconvenience our mistake has caused.” .Others left empty-handed and hundreds of pounds out of pocket can, when all else fails, make achargebackclaim for the sum from their debit card issuer or, if they paid by credit card, ask for reimbursement under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

I know I still have a few to get through, but, other than that, my fridge and cupboards are looking pretty bare. Beans on toast has always been my go-to meal in times such as these, and when I need comfort, familiarity and ease. What used to involve opening a tin and reheating the contents, however, has now become something slightly more elaborate. But only slightly: these beans are incredibly simple and quick to make, with store-bought antipasti adding real depth.Antipasti beans on toastI like to use about one third pitted olives to a mix of sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes, but use whichever ratio and vegetables you have to hand. And absolutely use the olive oil from the antipasti jars – it is liquid gold.Prep10 minCook35 minServes4Olive oil, or the oil from the antipasti jars4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced2 shallots,peeled and finely sliced250g vegetable antipasti of your choice, chopped (see recipe introduction)1 tsp dried oregano½ tsp sweet smoked paprika1 heapedtbsptomato puree350g passata700g jar cannellini beans, or 2 400g tinsSea salt andblack pepper4 slicesciabatta½ bunch of basil, leaves pickedLeftover cheese, if you likePut a large, ovenproof frying pan or wide, shallow casserole on a medium-low heat, add three tablespoons of olive oil, the garlic and shallots, and fry for five minutes, until they’re starting to soften. Stir in the chopped antipasti, dried oregano and paprika, fry for another five minutes, then stir in the tomato puree followed by the passata, and cannellini beans, including the liquid from the jar. Season well, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a rapid simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 20 minutes, until reduced slightly and rich.When the beans are ready, heat the grill to high. Toast the ciabatta and divide between four plates. Tear most of the basil into the beans, then pop the pan under the hot grill for three to five minutes, until a lovely crust forms on top. Drizzle a little olive oil over each slice of toasted ciabatta, then pile on the beans. Finish with the remaining basil leaves and any leftover cheese you have, and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodBeans, pulses and legumesBreadSnacksMain courseTomatoesVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’ve long enjoyed innovating fusions between west African and other cuisines, and today’s marriage of a deeply flavourful Senegalese chicken yassa-inspired filling in buttery, flaky puff pastry is one of my all-time favourites. But, first, my take on hearty Nigerian stewed beans –ewa riro– using tinned beans for added convenience. Typically paired with ripe plantain, I use the rich beans to fillcanoas(plantain boats) in a playful, Latin American-inspired twist.Plantain boats stuffed with stewed black-eyed beans (pictured top)Dried prawns and west African red palm oil, which areintegral to our cooking (and the latter isnot to be confused with those industrial palm oils that are driving mass deforestation),give this dish its signature umami and uniquely earthy and subtly sweet flavour.Prep25 minCook1 hr 15 minMakes6For the base2400g tins plum tomatoes4 long red sweet peppers, deseeded and cut into chunks1 scotch bonnet, deseeded5 garlic cloves, peeled½ onion, cut into chunks2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled3 tbsp tomato pureeFor the stew180ml red palm oil– you can find this in the world food aisle of larger supermarkets and in African stores2 onions, peeled and sliced1 tbspstock powder1½ tbsp ground smoked prawns– look for them in Asian and African supermarkets6 ripe plantainswith large black patches, peeled3 tbsp melted butter, or ghee, or olive/vegetable oil1 pinch salt1 tsp dried thyme1 tsp white pepper2400g tins black-eyed beans, drained and rinsed700ml water2125g tins skinless and boneless mackerelin oil or brine, drainedFresh herbs(coriander, thyme, parsley), to garnish (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a blender, blitz all the ingredients for the stew base until smooth. In a large, deep pan, melt the palm oil on a medium-high heat until it’s hot enough that a piece of onion sizzles immediately.Fry half the sliced onion with the stock powder and a tablespoon of ground prawns, until softened. Stir in the blended stew base, then cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes, until bubbling, slightly reduced and thickened.Meanwhile, line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and put a rack on top. Coat each peeled plantain with a half-tablespoon of melted butter (or ghee or oil) and transfer to the rack. Sprinkle the plantains with salt and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.During this time, stir the thyme and white pepper into the stew mix and turn down the heat to low-medium. In a medium pot with a lid, cook the beans and the remaining sliced onion in 700ml water on a medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, until very soft. Drain, discard the onion, then set the beans aside.Flip the plantains and bake them for another 15-20 minutes, until cooked through and golden brown all over. Meanwhile, bring the stew to a simmer; it should be reduced and crusting at the edges, with the oil separating. Add the mackerel in chunks, then stir in the cooked beans, mashing them into the stew (you don’t want a paste). Sprinkle in the remaining half-tablespoon of ground prawns.Carefully split open each plantain, cutting into them about 1cm deep. Carefully lengthen and widen the pocket as needed, then stuff with the stewed beans a tablespoon at a time. Garnish with herbs, if you like, and serve.Chicken yassa-inspired pot pieView image in fullscreenToyo Odetunde’s chicken yassa-inspired pot pie.Treacly, caramelised onions, tart mustard and citrus, and briny olives harmoniously elevate the nostalgic comfort of chicken in pastry.Prep15 minMarinate2hr+Cook2 hrServes4-6For the marinade5 garlic cloves,peeled2½cm piecefresh ginger, peeled¼ medium-large onion½scotch bonnet, deseeded1 tspstock powder½ tsp white pepper½ tsp black pepper1 tsp paprika½ tsp rock salt2 tbsp lemon juice2 tbsp dijonmustardFor the pie2320g sheets ready-made puff pastry500gboneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks5 tbspvegetable oil3 large onions, peeled and sliced (about 580g)2 tspbrown sugar1 tsp allspice100ml stock50gpitted green olives1 eggIn a blender or food processor, blitz the garlic, ginger, onion and chilli, adding a little water if needed to make a paste. Tip this into a bowl, add the chicken and the remaining marinade ingredients, toss to coat, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least two hours.Put three tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a deep pan on a medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken, cover with the lid and leave to cook for 15 minutes, until cooked through. Remove the chicken and set aside.Heat the remaining two tablespoons of vegetable oil in the same pot, stir in the sliced onion, cover and cook on a low-medium heat for 15 minutes, until soft.Take off the lid, add the brown sugar and allspice, and turn up the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring regularly, for about 30 minutes, until the mix is deep brown and caramelised; if need be, add splashes of water to stop it burning.Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and olives, simmer on low-medium for five to 10 minutes, then take off the heat.Grease a 22cm shallow pie dish. Fold one pastry sheet in half and gently stretch or roll it to line the base and sides of the pie dish. Spoon the chicken filling into the base and spread it out evenly. Fold the second pastry sheet in half and gently stretch or roll it to top the pie dish. Seal the edges, then trim off any excess pastry. Beat the egg with two tablespoons of water, then brush a thin layer of egg wash all over the top of the pie.Bake at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for an hour, until a deep golden brown. After 45 minutes, cover the pie with baking paper to stop it browning too much.Toyo Odetundeis a food writer and supper club hostExplore more on these topicsFoodWest African food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesChickenPieMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Two key factors are not having the range of motion required or not being strong enough to control that motion. “You might go for a run and lift your knees higher than your hamstrings can manage,” he says. Or you might lack the muscle strength needed to handle moving a limb at speed.When people talk about stretching, they usually mean static stretching: holding a pose for six seconds or longer to elastically deform the muscle. “Static stretching can increase your range of motion, but it also decreases the force a muscle can apply by about 5%,” Dinsdale says. Dynamic stretching (moving through a stretch, by doing exercises such as bodyweight squats or walking lunges) has more balanced benefits. “It doesn’t increase range of motion as much, but it can increase the muscle’s capacity to produce force.”For most of us, the best pre-exercise routine is a warm-up involving light movements similar to the workout ahead, such as a fast walk before jogging. “Increasing the temperature of your muscles helps them produce force more effectively, and you gain a bit more range, too,” says Dinsdale. After that, a few dynamic stretches can guide your body through the motions you’re about to perform. To finish, he recommends powerful movements to prime the neuromuscular system – “a few jumps, or a short, sharp sprint”.Is it true that … wearing heels changes the shape of your feet?Read moreWhat matters more than warm-ups is what he calls “assistance training”: dedicated strength training and static stretching sessions, at an alternative time to your chosen exercise, to build strength and flexibility in the muscles you rely on for your activity.Explore more on these topicsFitnessIs it true that …featuresShareReuse this content"

As he arrived in good time on theGolden Globesred carpet, the star of Marty Supreme put pay to speculation as to whether the chromatic marketing of the film’s ping pong balls would have him wearing orange. Instead, he wore a black T-shirt; vest, jacket and Timberland boots with silver buttons by Chrome Hearts, souped up with a five-figure Cartier necklace. Kylie Jenner, his partner and sartorial foil, was nowhere to be seen.Styled by Taylor McNeill, who was also responsible for Chalamet’s wildly amusing if chaotic red carpet campaign for the film, the look was bad boy Bond. It also set the tone for an evening of subdued tones. If we thought the penguin suit had gone extinct, we were wrong. The performative male is over – welcome to the return of the staid suit.View image in fullscreenBlack is the new orange: Timothée Chalamet on the red carpet.Photograph: Sthanlee Mirador/PAThe Globes are about the movies and winners, but its red carpet is a dry run for the Oscars, and traditionally an opportunity for celebrities and their all powerful stylists to choreograph something inventive.There were exceptions, but they were not among the men. Bella Ramsey wore a Prada suit tied with a pink bow that was positively shocking. At her very first Golden Globes, Chalamet’s co-star Odessa A’zion went for a monochromatic trouser suit of sorts with a froufrou vintage Dolce & Gabbana jacket and satin gloves. A nice bit of era-dressing came from Sinners star Miles Caton’s chestnut pinstripe suit by Amiri. Still, the usual flies in the ointment – Jacob Elordi, Colman Domingo and Jeremy Allen White – towed the line in contemporary twists on ye olde tux by Bottega Veneta, Valentino and Louis Vuitton respectively. Between them, Globes newbie Dwayne Johnson and red carpet veteran Leonardo DiCaprio did little to temper the black tie stuffiness.View image in fullscreenThe KPop Demon Hunters team with their two Golden Globe awards.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesPerhaps colour was the problem as black reigned supreme among women, too. Aimee Lou Wood in demure Vivienne Westwood looked straight from the Gilded Age. Best supporting actor winner Teyana Taylor opted for a cut out Schiaparelli dress flashing numerous body parts, albeit in inky black. Ayo Edebiri’s gorgeous black velvet panelled off-the-shoulder gown by new Chanel under Matthieu Blazy pushed classicism forward, but still felt alarmingly safe. Even the KPop Demon Hunters team, who won a for a song called Golden, wore all black.To that end, moments of colour – when they happened – were all the more precious. There was a welcome flash of metallic from Elle Fanning, whose sparkly, embroidered Gucci gown looked very silver screen glamourpuss. Emily Blunt wore a perkily white asymmetric, one sleeve gown by Louis Vuitton, while Amanda Seyfried was a modern day Venus de Milo in white Versace.The standout look was perhaps Wunmi Mosaku, the British Nigerian star ofSinners, one of two stars to reveal her pregnancy on the red carpet (the other being her Sinners co-star Hailee Steinfeld). The canary yellow of her bespoke gown and sheer veil by Matthew Reisman was a colour steeped in meaning. “In Yoruba, we sayIya ni Wúràwhich means ‘mother is golden’,” she wrotein Vogue.View image in fullscreenMother is golden: Wunmi Mosaku on the red carpet.Photograph: Corine Solberg/PAHistorically, the red carpet is as much a venue for self expression as it is for showcasing the great fashion-celebrity industrial complex. But it’s also a peek at the trends of tomorrow. To that end, newly minted designers. Jessie Buckley trialled Jonathan Anderson’s Dior in an ice blue asymmetric gown; Tessa Thompson wore a custom sequined column from Balenciaga by Pierpaolo Piccioli and Rose Byrne wore emerald green Chanel by Matthieu Blazy.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley strikes a pose.Photograph: Christopher Polk/2026GG/Penske Media/Getty ImagesThe reaction to Chalamet’s look was generous, and broadly uncritical. If the peanut gallery were disappointed by the lack of peacocking, the insiders were not. Esquire UK’s style director Zak Maoui told the Guardian: “I believe the industry has made a slight shift back to nice regular clothing for men on red carpets. Men are starting to see power again in a well-executed and expertly-cut suit.“It might reflect a wider sentiment in menswear, whereby the catwalks aren’t as flash or hype-y, and brands are presenting more subdued, wearable clothing.”View image in fullscreenMark Ruffalo’s ‘BE GOOD’ pin.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APThe devil – and the brand deals – were as ever in the details. Several “ICE OUT” and “BE GOOD” pins were worn by attendees, including Mark Ruffalo. In a world in which wearing a watch as part of your deal has become a foregone conclusion, it was a moment of political reprieve from a largely staid sartorial circus.This article was amended on 12 January 2026. An earlier version suggested Bella Ramsey identified as a woman; they are non-binary. This has been corrected, and details of Timothée Chalamet’s stylist, Taylor McNeill, have also been added.Explore more on these topicsGolden Globes 2026Golden GlobesAwards and prizesShareReuse this content"

The walled garden reopens in spring and hosts a tulip festival in early May. Ancestral seat of the earls of Antrim, Glenarm is home to the 15th earl and family. Their butler, George Lynn, who originally took the job for a couple of weeks and is still here 25 years later, runs perfectly pitched, book-ahead tours of the castle.Exploring Glenarm village, there’s a red sandstone arch with an arrow marked Forest. Following it, I soon reach ferny riverside woods, where little waterfalls pour down through mossy banks and ivy-covered pines, while a red squirrel leaps through the leafless canopy. Heading back as a storm hits the coast at high tide, waves break right on to the bus windscreen. I decide to spend what’s left of the day inside, exploring Ballygally Castle. Through an inscribed stone doorway and up a spiral staircase, the highest room in the tallest tower is said to be haunted by Lady Isabella Shaw, imprisoned here after failing to produce a male heir.Next day, I take the train to Portrush (via Belfast), spotting herons from the window as the train passes Ballycarry station. It’s a 20-minute walk from Ballycarry station to the exhilaratingGobbins cliff path, due to reopen early in 2026 as a newly upgraded circular route. A rainbow arcs over the fields as the Derry railway heads for the north coast.I walk five blustery miles of coast path, catching a late lilac sunrise over Portrush harbour. Huge gannets plunge into the foaming white waves at 60mphFrom Northern Ireland’s oldest hotel, I’m now in one of the newest reopenings. ThePortrush Adelphi hotelfinished a fancy refurb in April last year. Rooms (from £152 a night) come with hexagonal juniper-laden gin miniatures from theBasalt distilleryin homage to the nearby Giant’s Causeway. I stroll round town, have homemade soup and sea views atBabushka, and hop on a bus toCarrick-a-Rede rope bridge(£7.50/£15 for children/adults). The twice-hourlybus 402connects Portrush with a series of attractions, including theGiant’s Causewayand theworld’s oldest licensed whiskey distilleryat Bushmills. Spectacular views of clifftop castles and long sandy beaches roll past the windows.View image in fullscreenThe Giant’s Causeway.Photograph: Walter Bibikow/Getty ImagesSalmon fishers first strung the rope bridge between cliffs, 100 feet above a roiling ocean, near Ballintoy in the mid-18th century. Strong winds mean the bridge itself is closed today and I stroll the mile-long scenic path to the viewpoint feeling secretly relieved. There’s virtually no other company on this wintry afternoon but sheep on the hillside and bright stonechats perched on the brambles.On my last day, I walk five blustery, dramatic miles of coast path to neighbouring Portstewart, catching a late lilac sunrise over Portrush harbour. Flocks of coral-legged turnstones swirl and scamper; huge gannets plunge into the foaming white waves at 60mph. FromHarry’s ShackonPortstewart Strand, it’s a 20-minute bus ride toLouise McLean’s whitewashed cottage, firelit studio and welcoming workshop in a repurposed primary-school portable building.Louise has been making baskets for 25 years and grows 15 types of willow in her wildlife-rich garden, inspired by the coast with its “undulating curves, waves, and weaves”. A sudden downpour thunders on the metal roof as we twist brown willow strands in the cosy, candle-dotted room and Louise tells me about her new residential workshops. They’re onRathlin, Northern Ireland’s only year-round inhabited offshore islandand one of many reasons to come back. Heading off on the first bus of the journey home, my head is full of wild weather and warm welcomes.This trip was partly provided byTourism Irelandwith accommodation provided byBallygally Castle(doubles from £88room-only; Sea Dips package from £155).

This picture tells another story – and is a testament to our sunny dispositionsZoe WilliamsMon 12 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareMy mother, Gwen, liked to describe things in broad brush strokes. Me and my sister’s teenage years, mid-80s to early 90s, she’d cover with: “Zoe was delinquent, couldn’t get a word of sense out of her.” Or: “1986? That was the year Stacey wasawful.” Going through photo albums to make a montage for her funeral, all her pictures from that era were testament to our ill-behaviour: me, sniffing a geranium, sarcastically; Stace, outside a cafe in an indeterminable European city where you can almost lip-read her stroppy “piss off” to camera in the still moment.Gwen was politically engaged – you’d come downstairs on a Wednesday morning to find a handwritten letter starting, “Dear Pérez de Cuéllar, I cannot deplore enough your silence on the matter of the Western Sahara” – and heavily involved in progressive politics: our kitchen was full of posters that would have to catch on fire before they’d ever get taken down. There was one fighting pit closures, for example, right next to one about having no planet B, and mum went heavy on the spoof public information campaigns. Instead of the government’s “protect and survive” leaflets, telling you how to survive a nuclear war bytaking a door off its hinges and propping it against a wall, there was a “protest and survive” poster; a rip-off of the “Don’t Die of Ignorance” HIV campaign, which said something like “Don’t Die of Tories”, and “Heroin isn’t the only thing that damages your mind”, featuring a man reading (I think?) The Sun.Her constant refrain, throughout, was how amazing it was that me and Stace weren’t more bothered about the demise of the Greater London Council (GLC) or the impending nuclear holocaust, even though, more often than not, we were right there with her at the protest. There was never any photographic proof of this, it being considered frivolous to treat a march like a sightseeing event, so the only times, in retrospect, something definitely happened, it was because it got covered in the Wandsworth Borough News. “Do you know, when the Iraq war broke out, these girls didn’t even notice?” Gwen would say. Or: “Heaven help constitutional reform when the next generation won’t even stop drinking cider in their bedrooms to go to a Charter 88 meeting.”But when we were going through photos for her funeral, a lot of them, especially the ones her friends sent, tell a completely different story, one in which my sister and I both have pretty sunny dispositions. This particularly stood out in the photobooth shot, given that here we all are in an extremely tight space, smiling. Sure, maybe she’d bribed us, though she wasn’t a very bribey person. But we’re plainly not, as her legend had it, allergic to her.And OK, none of our family photos look like the Gilmore Girls – glamorous, fun-loving single mother, plus sweet-natured teenage honeys on the brink of selfhood – a show our mum would have absolutely despised as sentimental trash. But nor do they look the way she told it, the later years of our childhood sounding like a cross between Tenko (her, battling unimaginable adversity) and Rosemary’s Baby (us, possessed by the devil). I’m pretty sure we did notice the outbreak of the Iraq war, too.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingMy favourite family photoFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then a radio programme about a shortage of Guide Dogs gave her an ideaPaula CocozzaMon 12 Jan 2026 01.45 ESTShareHelen Smith was cleaning her bathroom and listening to the radio, some time after the pandemic, when a story came on about a shortage of guide dogs. The pandemic had made it hard to breed puppies. One vision-impaired owner faced a two-year wait for a new dog. Knowing the importance of her own relationship with dogs, Smith was overcome with sadness for him. Right then, she thought, “Well, what am I going to do with the rest of my life?”She was living in the south of Hesse,in Germany, having moved in 1998 from Shropshire for her husband’s work. Their daughters were nine and three. The family settled. They got a dog. Smith found tutoring work and started a businessteaching English.But in 2011,her husband, Paul, died. “It was a great shock. Some sort of virus that affected his heart. He was 52,” she says.“I thought, what do I do? Come back to England? Or stay in Germany and work really hard to support us?”Smith decided to stay; her daughters were at critical points in their education. “Luckily we had the dog” – a bernese mountain dog. Soon after, they got a briard. “Dogs are so wonderful, because you don’t need to talk to them. They just understand.”Dogs had been part of Smith’s family life since she was born. “My mum had type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage, and lost her first child. My dad bought her a wire hair fox terrier puppy, called Nimby, to try to get her over this.”After Smith came along, there were no further children, and Nimby was like a sibling. “I had a little tricycle and Dad made a pull-along trailer. There are pictures of Nimby sitting in there, me cycling up and down …”Then, after Smith married, Paul brought home a puppy from a local builder – they called her Lotus. In time, Lotus helped their youngest daughter learn to walk. “She would hold on to the dog’s collar and walk beside her.” We are talking on a video call, and Smith glances down at the dog at her feet – Blossom, a labrador.View image in fullscreenHelen and Blossom.Photograph: Guide Dogs“When you come up to a certain age, you think, am I continuing on this path or am I going to do something a bit different?” Smith says.She had been feeling “increasingly isolated. My children had left home before Covid … I was devastated by Brexit.” She also began to question her language skills. “Every time an official letter came through the letterbox, I had this fear arising in me.“I thought there must be more to life than working in my garden, working on my business, and seeing my family occasionally.”By June 2022, she knew she wanted to return to the UK. “I had this idea that I would look after a ‘guide dog mum’” – a dog that will provide puppies to be trained. “But my confidence was low. I thought, ‘You live by yourself. They won’t want you … I’m too old.’”Smith had grown up in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, a short drive from the Guide Dogs National Centre (formerly known as the National Breeding Centre). “It was something we all knew about.”She whittled the contents of her house down to a truckload. “I was letting go of 25 years of being in Germany.” She returned to Warwickshire and the day after she moved into her new house, she applied to look after a guide dog mum. Within a month, Blossom was brought to meet her.“And when she ran into the room, it was, Oh my goodness, she’s so big! Oh my goodness, she’s so lively. The first week, I got up at six. I was so excited to go downstairs and see her.”It sounds like love. “It is,” Smith says.Guide Dogs pays for Blossom’s vet bills, insurance and food. When the time comes, the puppies will be born at Smith’s home, with support from a vet at the end of the phone. She will look after them for seven weeks, before they start their guide dog training.Blossom has brought Smith new friends, and a community. Now, fellow villagers drop off newspapers for when the puppies come, and Smith has joined Guide Dogs fundraising groups.Blossom’s lanyard – it says “Guide Dog Mum” – starts conversations. “I go out and have dinner at the cafe, and she’s lying at my feet. If I hadn’t got her, I would never go to a cafe by myself. Blossom has given me confidence to do all sorts of things.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60DogsPetsBlindness and visual impairmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was one of twin boys born to Adichie and Ivara Esege, a doctor, in 2024 by surrogacy, eight years after the birth of their first child, a girl.In a WhatsApp chat to family and friends that was leaked on social media, Adichie wrote: “It is like living your worst nightmare.” Adichie’s team confirmed the authenticity of the messages.The TV channel Arise News reported that solicitors acting for the couple served Euracare hospital, a private medical facility, with a legal notice dated 10 January which asked for CCTV footage, electronic monitoring data and the toddler’s medical records within seven days. The notice alleged there were lapses during the child’s admission and lack of basic resuscitation equipment at the facility amounting to medical negligence.Nkanu died a day before he was due for medical evacuation to the Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, not far from the couple’s US home. He had been referred from another Lagos hospital to Euracare for a series of diagnostic procedures that included an echocardiogram and a brain MRI.In the WhatsApp chat, Adichie accused Euracare of negligence, saying a doctor had directly told her that the resident anaesthesiologist had administered an overdose of propofol, a sedative. Despite resuscitation and being put on a ventilator, Nkanu suffered a cardiac arrest that led to his death.Adichie said in the message that the anaesthesiologist had been “fatally casual and careless”.In response to the WhatsApp leak, Euracare said it was inaccurate to suggest medical negligence was the cause of death and that its staff had “provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards” to the “critically ill” toddler upon admission. The hospital has not yet replied to the legal notice.There has been an outpouring of condolence messages to Adichie and Esege, including from Bola Tinubu, the president ofNigeria. On Sunday, the Lagos state government lamented the “profound tragedy” and ordered investigations into the matter.Adichie’s first novel, Purple Hibiscus, was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2004, a year after its publication. She has since published seven other books, including 2025’sDream Count.Nigeria has an abysmally low doctor-to-patient ratio of1:9,083. Less than 5% of the total annual budget is usually allocated to the health sector. Botched procedures are common and emergency response services are sparse nationwide; in December, there was outrage after the boxer Anthony Joshua, who survived a car crash that killed two of his close friends just outside Lagos, was lifted by pedestrians into a police truck, rather than an ambulance.Medical tourism has become popular among wealthier Nigerians, including Tinubu and his predecessorMuhammadu Buhari, whose104-day absence abroad on medical grounds in 2017spurred conspiracy theories that he had died and been replaced by a body double.The former World Bank vice-president and Nigerian presidential aspirant Oby Ezekwesili said the country needed “deep reforms” for the sake of Nkanu and other Nigerians “who have needlessly died from the effects of governance failures that plague the health system”.Explore more on these topicsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieNigeriaChildren's healthAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

After years of sanctions, Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is decrepit and crumbling. But in the week since US special forces kidnapped Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and rendered him to New York, Donald Trump has urged oil companies to invest $100bn (£74bn) to get Venezuela’s wells flowing.“We’re going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,” the US presidenttold oil executives on Friday.An analysis for the Guardian by ClimatePartner, a carbon accounting firm, modelled the carbon impact of the growth of Venezuela’s oil production by +0.5m barrels per day by 2028, ramping up to +1.58m barrels per day from 2035 to 2050.Such a scenario – which would still fall far short of the 3.5m barrels a day produced during Venezuela’s last oil boom in the 1990s – would by itself consume 13% of the total remaining carbon budget to keep global heating within 1.5C.US attack on Venezuela will decide direction of South America’s vast mineral wealthRead moreThe oil extracted from Venezuela’s vast reserves is, according to industry estimates, the filthiest in the world.Classed as a heavy, sour grade, Venezuela’s crude has a dense, tar-like consistency and a high sulphur content. These fluids do not flow like conventional oil; compared with the light, sweet crude of a country like Saudi Arabia, they require energy intensive processes to extract from the ground.It is for these reasons that a study by S&P Global Platts Analytics found Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt deposits to have by far the highest carbon intensity of any major oil region.For example, it was almost 1,000 times higher than crude produced from Norway’sJohan Sverdrup field, which has a carbon intensity of 1.6kg of carbon dioxide per barrel of oil equivalent – compared with 1,460kgCO2e/boe for Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. The report found that Venezuela’s “extreme” carbon intensity shows that this crude stream would “face challenges in a world with tight carbon budgets”.Hollie Parry, senior analyst at ClimatePartner, said: “The decision to ramp up production of one of the world’s most carbon intensive crude oils to historic levels would consume an estimated 13% of the remaining global carbon budget – the equivalent to nearly a decade of emissions from the entire EU, from a single oil expansion. In a rapidly warming world, such a move would lock in decades of high emissions at precisely the moment when science demands a swift transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and low-carbon solutions.”Environmental campaignershave slammed the US’s claim on Venezuelan oil, a move “both reckless and dangerous”, according to Mads Christensen, executive director of Greenpeace International.He said: “The only safe path forward is a just transition away from fossil fuels, one that protects health, safeguards ecosystems, and supports communities rather than sacrificing them for short-term profit.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOilVenezuelaTrump administrationEnergyFossil fuelsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The US president accuses the leader of personally flooding American streets with illegal drugs and imposes sanctions against him and his wife. Threats of military action are followed by a phone conversation between the two leaders.One might imagine that this is a description of the buildup of tensions that led to the 3 January special forces raid on Caracas to capture the Venezuelan leader,Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, to face several criminal charges in New York.But a similar script has been playing out inColombiafor the past year, leading to a volley of insults and threats between Trump and the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, the country’s first ever leftwing leader.Sandra Borda, a political analyst with the University of the Andes, said: “Trump has been doing to Petro the same thing that he did with Maduro, which is to link him directly as a person with drug trafficking.”Despite the parallels, Colombia is not Venezuela, and Petro is no Maduro. While Maduro is widely believed to have stolen last year’s election from the opposition,Petro’s electoral win in 2022has never been questioned. Maduro was indicted in a US federal court; Petro has no such charges against him. The deep institutional ties between Colombia and the US military and police forces are unrivalled in Latin America.Even so, tensions between Colombia and the US reached their peak this week when Trump threatened military action against Colombia similar to the operation in Caracas and claimed Petro was a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”. In response, Petro, a former guerrilla, said: “I swore not to touch a weapon again … but for the homeland I will.”He called on his supporters to rally across the country on Wednesday, but just as he prepared to address the crowds he was patched through to Trump, with whom he spoke for an hour. The call, which the Colombian foreign ministry characterised as a “good meeting”, seemed to defuse the escalation. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that it had been an “honour” to speak to Petro and that he had invited the Colombian president to the White House.Cynthia Arnson, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on Colombia-US relations, said: “It’s taken herculean efforts by diplomats on the Colombian and the US side to keep the relationship from imploding.”But profound differences remain between the two leaders and the animus goes back to the first days of the secondTrump administration.Days after Trump took office in January 2025, Petro said his government would refuse to accept US military planes transporting deported Colombian citizens, demanding they be treated with “dignity and respect”. Trump shot back, imposing a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods and revoking the US visas of some government officials. After reaching an agreement on the flights, the US backed down on the tariffs.In September, the US “decertified” Colombia for not doing enough to combat illegal drug production and trafficking, citing a sharp rise in cocaine production and blaming “the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle”. Despite the decertification, a waiver allowed US aid to continue to flow to Colombia.A week later, during the UN general assembly, Petro stood on a New York street, megaphone in hand, addressing a pro-Palestine rally and called on American soldiers to disobey any illegal orders from their commanders. In response, the United Statesrevoked his US visa.In October, it placed financial sanctions on Petro, his wife, his son and the interior minister, Armando Benedetti, for what the treasury department claimed was “their involvement in the global illicit drug trade”.While Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, there is no evidence that Petro, who was elected in 2022, is in any way involved in the business. Colombia’s narcotics trade is largely controlled by illegal armed groups such as the Gulf Clan, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) guerrilla group, the majority of whose members demobilised after a 2016 peace deal.Petro’s government has seized unprecedented amounts of cocaine – 836.8 tonnes between January and October 2025 – but these successes have been eclipsed by growing coca cultivation and potential for cocaine production, which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reportedly estimated at 3,000 tonnes in 2024, although the official numbers have not yet been made public.When the US began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Petro accused US government officials of having “committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters”.Drug trafficking was reportedly one of the principal issues discussed on the Petro-Trump call, with the Colombian president asking for US cooperation in combatting fighters of the ELN who often cross intoVenezuelawhen attacked in Colombia, according to Benedetti.View image in fullscreenPeople wave Colombian flags during the March for Sovereignty and Democracy against Donald Trump’s threats to Gustavo Petro.Photograph: Jaime Saldarriaga/AFP/Getty ImagesUntil the call between the presidents, Petro’s brash demeanour had made him a lightning rod for Trump and members of his administration. The Colombian president seems to thrive on conflict, as he enjoys posting long rants on social media and giving lengthy, often rambling speeches. “The more I am attacked, the more support I get,” he once told a reporter.Though many of Latin America’s left-leaning leaders, including Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, have clashed with Trump, Petro is “in his own category”, said Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, an NGO. “This is a leader who is every day saying what he thinks about Trump and using very strong language,” he said.Petro’s rebellious nature began when he joined the M-19 urban guerrilla group at the age of 17. He ascended swiftly into the political wing of the organisation. When he was chosen to serve as his home town’s ombudsman in 1981, he was already an active but covert M-19 member. He was detained by the army in 1985 for possessing weapons – which he said were planted – and subjected to four days of torture by the army. Petro claimed he had never engaged in combat.The M-19 was of the first guerrilla groups to demobilise in 1990 and seek a role in traditional politics after peace talks. After helping draft a new constitution, Petro won a seat in congress, starting a long legislative career in which he won the most votes of any representative in 2002.From his congressional seat, Petro presented evidence of collusion between politicians and rightwing paramilitary leaders that implicated allies of the then president, Álvaro Uribe. Many of those Petro accused were eventually convicted. Petro was elected mayor of the Colombian capital, Bogotá, in 2011 for a tumultuous four-year term during which he was briefly removed from office by the country’s inspector general. After several failed bids for the presidency, he was elected to the nation’s top post in 2022.Borda said the Colombian president’s assertiveness could backfire. “If Petro insists on provoking Trump, it will become more costly politically in terms of the domestic political process,” she said.Colombia will hold legislative elections in March and the first round of a presidential vote in May. Petro, whose term ends on 7 August, is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term.Isacson said a belligerent US stance toward Colombia could boost the leftwing candidate, Iván Cepeda. “This sort of new aggressive United States – that is a perfect issue for the left,” he said.Reacting to the US threats of military action in the country, the rightwing candidate Paloma Valencia, of the Democratic Centre party, said on X: “Our legal and political reality is different from Venezuela’s. We will beat [Petro] and his heirs with votes at the ballot boxes … without intervention from anyone.”The animosity between Petro and Trump will probably not have disappeared with one telephone call, and Maduro spoke with Trump less than two months before his capture. But Borda said the conversation and the announced meeting in Washington was “a step in the right direction”.Explore more on these topicsColombiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroVenezuelaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump’s Venezuelan dream could make it worseDebbie CarlsonPicture is as murky as a barrel of oil, with US companies in 2026 expecting their first production drop in four yearsMon 12 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.48 ESTShareUS shale-oil producers were already contending withoilprices at four-year lows. News that they may soon face a significant competitor in their back yard probably wasn’t how frackers wanted to greet 2026.The US capture of Venezuela’s PresidentNicolaá Maduroand his wife, Cilia Flores, hit the share prices of independent shale-oil producers, such as Diamondback Energy and Devon Energy, last week.Over the last 20 years, the US fracking industry has built itself into the main driver of domestic oil production: it accounted for64% of totalUS crude oil production in 2023. With average production levels of 13.6m barrels a day (BPD), the US is the world’s largest crude-oil producer.Trump says US companies will invest billions in Venezuelan oil production. Experts aren’t so sureRead moreIt will take years for Venezuela’s production to ramp up, limiting the near-term impact on US suppliers, but Donald Trump has made clear he wants firms to move quickly.The development comes at a difficult time for the industry, which is pressured by aglobal glut of oil. Higher supplies come from an unwinding of 2023 voluntary production cuts by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and growth in non-Opec countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China and Guyana.Oil prices have been trending down since passing $100 in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. With supply overwhelming demand, nearby Nymex West Texas Intermediate crude-oil futures prices – agreed rates for assets to be bought at a later date – are trading at about $56 a barrel. Longer-dated futures contracts for the US oil benchmark forecast prices range between $56 and $57 a barrel until June 2028.Price of oil per barrel over the last five yearsUS fracking is expensive, so the industry will not welcome more price pressures. Potentially, this is a threat to Republicans who have championed fracking in swing states like Pennsylvania, where the shale revolution has been an economic boon.For now, the picture is as murky as a barrel of oil.Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, says any impact Venezuela has on US producers is a matter of timing. The US oil market is currently “acting like a reasonably supplied market with expectations that supply continues to increase, which keeps dampening those oil prices”, he said.Whether Venezuelan productionresumes as projectedis debatable, but one saving grace for US producers is thatVenezuelan oil is heavy, and requires more processing than the light oil the US pumps. That makes Venezuelan petroleum less of a competitive threat to the US, since refiners globally can use light oil, says Peter McNally, global head of sector analysts at Third Bridge. Still, Venezuela’s potential output adds to the growing global glut.The economics of US oil production, when oil is about $57 a barrel, are troublesome in the longer term. TheFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimatesthat break-even prices for existing wells, in both shale and non-shale production, are between $26 and $45 a barrel, but that break-even rises to between $61 and $70 for any newly drilled wells.Despite sluggish returns, the shale-oil industry is in better shape than in 2020. Producers’ balance sheets were already laden with debt when prices briefly turned negative during the Covid lockdown, says Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.Many smaller producers went bankrupt. Those that survived started to focus on generating cashflow and return on invested capital, rather than hiking production. That capital discipline means companies are in better fiscal shape to weather lower oil prices, and are likely to keep a close eye on the bottom line, Thummel says. “What that means is they’re going to cut back on spending and [rein in] production.”The difficult times in 2020 ushered in consolidation, and the industry became dominated by oil majors like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rather than the independent producers that started up during the initial hydraulic fracturing oil boom in the early aughts. Sustained lower prices could spell problems for the numerous small, private drillers, especially if Venezuela’s oil comes online, says Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial.“The overall long-term implication is it’s definitely negative for the … run-of-the-mill frackers, because you’re going to see more supply, and that supply is clearly going to put pressure on the fracking industry,” he says.Companies are likely to keep output flat in 2026. TheEnergy Information Administration, the US Department of Energy’s statistical arm, estimates 2026 production to average 13.5m BPD, down slightly from 2025’s 13.6m-barrel record output – the first production drop in four years.Stewart Glickman, director of fundamental research at CFRA Research, says he’s slightly concerned oil production in the US mainland, referred to as the Lower 48, may be peaking. Capital expenditures are down about 40% from 2014’s peak, as companies relied on technological improvements to increase output. Since shale-oil production declines quicker than traditional drilling, Glickman says the US might be closer to start seeing overall production falling.“Instead of, 13.5 [million BPD] becoming 14, becoming 14.5, maybe we start to get a little bit of cresting and slight decline, because the lack of reinvestment is eventually going to catch up with you,” he says. “There’s a lot of moving parts, and now you add Venezuela on top it, and the longer-term risk.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsOilEconomicsVenezuelaFrackingShale oilCommoditiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

He pointed to its attempts to meddle in elections and its recent efforts to disrupt Canada’s Arctic claims.When Carney’s government plane touches down in Beijing this week, it will be the first time a Canadian prime minister has been welcomed in nearly a decade. The trip, undertaken amid therupturing of global economic and political alliances, reflects a desire by Ottawa to mend a broken relationship with a global superpower that uses its vast and lucrative market to both woo and punish countries.Canada says Russia and China are ramping up spy efforts in Arctic regionRead moreBut Carney’s state visit, the result of methodical diplomatic calculations, also speaks to the pain of a trade war with the US and an urgent need to expand Canada’s exports in order to offset mounting economic punishment inflicted by its neighbour and largest trading partner.“There is a risk thatChinaviews Canada as weak, struggling and abused by President Donald Trump’s administration – and it sees an opportunity to present itself as the reasonable and stable adult in the room,” says Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and senior Asia adviser for the thinktank International Crisis Group. “The Communist party has given up persuading people that they’re benevolent. Instead, they offer competence and predictability. But it also gives Mark Carney leverage to say: if you think our relationship with the United States is getting worse, what are you willing to give us?”View image in fullscreenMark Carney has framed the Beijing visit as an attempt to create a ‘stable’ relationship with Xi Jinping’s China.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/ReutersDespite the diplomatic cordiality on display, those briefing Carney “don’t have any illusions about the kind of leader they’re dealing with”, says Kovrig. “This is a fraught relationship.”Kovrig himself reflects the perils of the relationship. In 2018,Chinese officials ordered the detention of Kovrigand fellow Canadian Michael Spavor, jailing the pair for more than 1,000 days in protest against “a political frame-up” and“persecution” against the telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou. The arrests and subsequent diplomatic standoff quashed any hope of Canada negotiating a long-sought free trade agreement. For years, Ottawa has looked to China as a key market for its heavy oil, metallurgical coal, timber and agricultural products.Carney has framed the visit to Beijing as an attempt to create a “stable” relationship with China, despiteallegations of Chinese meddling in Canada’s electoral systemin recent years, though none of its efforts are believed to have swayed the results of the past two elections.China has also shown a willingness to take punitive steps against key Canadian industries. After Canada joined the US inputting a tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in 2024, Beijing placed 100% duties on Canadian canola oil and meal and months later, added an additional 75.8% anti-dumping tariff, shutting Canadian producers out of their second-largest market.“In a normal circumstance would you do any business with someone who is involved in blackmail, hostage taking and mass human rights violations and, quite possibly, crimes against humanity?” says Kovrig. “Of course not. But China is the outlier case because it’s so large that you can’t just shun it. And you have to carve out a space for diplomacy and economic opportunities because if Canada wants to defend its sovereignty and remain a prosperous country in the world, then it needs to find ways of attracting foreign investment.”View image in fullscreenMark Carney with Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC in October.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesShifting from ‘America First’Since becoming prime minister, Carney has signalled he wants to reset the relationship between the two countries, pushing a “reliance to resilience” plan to diversify trade away from the US which, until recently, bought 76% of Canada’s exports. But the “America First” economic policy pursued by the White House has forced Carney to rethink the foundational structure of his country’s economy.While Canada’s federal government has looked to its new Indo-Pacific strategy to forge new partnerships, Canada also wants to grow its presence in China, which makes up only 4% of exports.Following a string of meetings between Canadian senior ministers and their counterparts, in September, Carney met Chinese premier Li Qiang and a month later, Carney spoke to PresidentXi Jinpingon the sidelines of the global summit in South Korea, telling reporters the relationship between the two countries had reached a “turning point”.The January state visit reflects a “very deliberate and incremental diplomatic dance” between the two parties, said Roland Paris, the director of theGraduate School of Public and International Affairsat the University of Ottawa.Paris, who also served as a foreign affairs adviser to the former prime minister Justin Trudeau, says Beijing and Ottawa have a number of overlapping interests, noting the talks are expected to centre on energy, agriculture, international security and trade between the two countries. But hopes that the meetings lead to a removal of retaliatory tariffs on Canadian industries requires careful diplomatic manoeuvring.“The logic for [the last two Canadian governments] was that it’s possible to have trade with China while also trying to work on points of difference between the two countries,” he said. “You can walk and chew gum at the same time.”Canada has long seen its liberal valuesas a core component of laws and institutionsand by extension, its foreign policy – something that has frustrated Chinese officials. Among the frictions for Canada are a swath of human rights abuses by China, sustained allegations of electoral interference and Chinese actions in the Arctic.“It’s important to remember that China is not our friend,” says Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. “This is not a country that follows reasoned arguments and wants to have friendly relations. The geopolitical and transnational repression risks that have long concerned Canada have not changed.”She points to China’sdecision to execute four Canadian citizens,despite protests from Canadian officials, Ottawa’s concerns about theconviction of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Laiand China’s increased presence in the Arctic, including placing monitoring buoys in waters Canada considers its own.“It’s understandable that the prime minister is looking for other markets. We do need to diversify – that’s very clear,” McCuaig-Johnston says, adding that Chinese investment in Canada’s oil and gas industry was “safe” but worries about Beijing encroaching into the clean energy sector. Her research has profiled numerous instances of joint-ventures that end with Canadian companies leaving “out of frustration and in despair” and their Chinese counterparts keeping the Canadian intellectual property, the technology and the equipment.“The reality is: we should stay miles and miles away from any discussion of aerospace technology, artificial intelligence and critical minerals,” she says. “This is a very challenging diplomatic trip and I hope we can make some safe deals on trade, but we must be careful about not opening up other sectors and putting them at risk.”Analysts say a successful visit by Carney is likely to lead to a flurry of near-term agreements that serve the interests of both sides. But Kovrig hopes that behind closed doors, Carney will use the summit to also press Xi on longstanding issues of political detainees and rights violations, cautioning that Beijing officials are likely to use Carney’s reputation to “burnish” China’s own credentials.“There is a belief that because China is big, it must offer vast commercial opportunities. But few foreign firms reliably make profits there that they can repatriate. Most of what Canada sells China is energy and commodities,” says Kovrig. “Beijing’s power depends on fear, and its legitimacy rests on myths. We can push back against all of that. We can and we must.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaChinaMark CarneyXi JinpingAsia PacificAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

I didn’t like their response. They’re playing too cute.”Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Exxon, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – the three largest US oil producers – were for decades the most prominent partners of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA.The government of late president Hugo Chávez nationalised the industry between 2004 and 2007, and while Chevron negotiated deals to partner with PDVSA, ConocoPhillips and Exxon left the country and filed for prominent arbitration cases shortly after.Venezuela now owes over $13bn collectively to ConocoPhillips and Exxon for the expropriations, according to court rulings.Woods told Trump on Friday: “We’ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we’ve historically seen here.”Exxon’s CEO said the company neededdurable investment protectionsintroduced and that the country’s hydrocarbons law also needed to be reformed.“If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it’s uninvestable,” he said.ConocoPhillips’ CEO, Ryan Lance, told Trump that his company was the largest non-sovereign credit holder in Venezuela, and called for a restructuring of the debt and the country’s entire energy system, including PDVSA.Trump said ConocoPhillips would get a lot of its money back, but the US would start with a clean slate. “We’re not going to look at what people lost in the past because that was their fault,” he said.Trump said on Friday that his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate in the South American country.“You’re dealing with us directly. You’re not dealing with Venezuela at all,” he said. “We don’t want you to deal with Venezuela.”On Saturday, Trump signed an executive order to block courts or creditors from seizing revenue tied to the sale of Venezuelan oil held in US Treasury accounts.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationExxonMobilVenezuelaDonald TrumpOilNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Such users have provided personal details to the company and can be identified if the function is misused.The move has done little to quell anger about Grok, however. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) said on Sunday it would restrict access to Grok over the AI tool’s ability “to generate obscene, sexually explicit, indecent, grossly offensive, and nonconsensual manipulated images, including content involving women and minors”.Grok also functions through a separate website and app. It was unclear whether the Malaysian and Indonesian bans applied to Grok onX, the Grok site and app, or both. The Guardian received reports from Indonesia that people were still able to use Grok via the app and via X, although one reported the app was very slow.MCMC said it had issued notices to X and xAI this month to demand the implementation of effective technical and moderation safeguards. However, the responses it received relied mostly on user-initiated reporting mechanisms and failed to address the inherent risks posed by Grok, the MCMC said, adding that it considered this insufficient to prevent harm or ensure legal compliance.On Saturday, Indonesia also temporarily blocked the chatbot, with the country’s communications and digital minister, Meutya Hafid, saying the government viewed “the practice of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space”.The UK has also raised the possibility of a banif action is not taken, while on Saturday, Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, condemned the use of generative AI to exploit or sexualise people without their consent as “abhorrent”.Across Europe, regulators and politicians have also issued warnings over recent weeks.Germany’s culture and media minister, Wolfram Weimer, called on the European Commission to take legal steps, warning of the “industrialisation of sexual harassment”.Italy’s data protection authority said that using AI tools to create explicit images of people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations and, in some cases, criminal offences.In France, government ministers said this month they had referred sexually explicit Grok-generated content circulating on X to prosecutors and alerted the French media regulator Arcom.India’s IT and electronics ministry sent a formal notice to X on 2 January in relation to explicit images allegedly created through Grok, demanding the content be taken down and requiring a report on the actions being taken within 72 hours.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIMalaysiaAI (artificial intelligence)Asia PacificXElon MuskInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The incriminating claims, implicating the president and first lady in a cash for access network, were made in a video uploaded on X.Breaking his silence four days after the video went viral, Christodoulides, who has faced mounting pressure from coalition partners, put on a brave face as he protested his innocence.“In such moments of crisis, any leader, when his hands are clean, must be calm,” he told reporters on Monday. “I am here. I am publicly taking a position. I have nothing to fear.”It was, he said, important that “foreign states and theEuropean Union, itself” had weighed in with help to source the origins of the 8.5-minute video. The island’s intelligence services and cybersecurity experts are also investigating.“I call on all the responsible state authorities to use all the tools they have at their disposal to fully investigate this affair,” Christodoulides said.The video – posted on the user account of a self-described independent researcher named Emily Thompson – caused uproar when it began circulating barely 24 hours afterCypruslaunched the opening ceremony of its EU presidency on 7 January.It starts with its female narrator saying: “He burst on to the presidential scene in 2023 promising to root out corruption after the last government. Two years later, the worst fears of Cypriot citizens have now been confirmed. He hasn’t thrown out the old corrupt methods. They’ve simply evolved.”Within hours government sources were describing the footage as “malicious and clearly edited”, with officials speaking of a hybrid attack that bore all the hallmarks of an enemy state such as Russia.In a montage, most of which appears to be secretly filmed, the video depicts aides and allies of Christodoulides, including Giorgos Lakkotrypis, the former energy minister and Charalambos Charalambous, his chief of staff, in conversation with unidentified investors.Both men are heard saying that access to the president is possible in exchange for cash donations that could be funnelled to a charitable fund assisting children in need headed by the first lady.In one snippet, Lakkotrypis told his interlocutors over wine that because Christodoulides ran as an independent without the backing of a political party, “sometimes they have to depend on cash” to bypass the €1m (£870,000) cap on campaign funding.“For someone like Nikos who doesn’t have a party behind them, it is not easy for them to find the money,” he said.In another, the former minister explains how he has enabled a Russian oligarch, with links to a pharmaceutical company on the island, to escape EU sanctions by speaking to the leader. A €75,000 donation, made by the company, “got the attention of the president”, he tells them.Charalambous, who is the president’s brother-in-law and oversaw his campaign finances, is similarly heard saying that investors could have access to the president if they made a proposal and offer of money.Both men have denied the allegations, saying the comments have been taken out of context and distorted.After Charalambous announced his resignation on Monday, the president described it as “an act of self confidence” and “not of pressure or guilt”.The first lady, Philippa Karsera, said she would be stepping down from her position as head of the charity citing the “unrelenting attack” she and her children had been subjected to on social media.But with Cyprus’s image believed to be tarnished at a time of its greatest visibility on the world stage and with parliamentary elections set for May, opposition parties called the resignations too little, too late.Cypriot society, they said, now wanted answers that would disprove the corruption charges and assure them a cover-up was not under way.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Nato would have an obligation to defendGreenland,” the Connecticut senator and member of the chamber’s foreign relations committee said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. Murphy added that it would mean “clearly … we would be at war with Europe, with England, with France”.Murphy’s comments came as Trump ramped up his fixation with the Arctic territory, with the US president telling reporters on Air Force One on Sunday that “one way or the other, we are going to have Greenland”.Trump had ordered a plan to be drawn up for an invasion of Greenland, theMail on Sunday reported, adding that “it is being resisted” by military leaders on grounds of illegality.Murphy’s assertion that a forceful US acquisition would be the end of Nato is shared by political leaders in Europe, notably Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister ofDenmark.Greenland is a former colony of Denmark and remains an autonomous part of the Danish kingdom, with its foreign and security policy under the control of Copenhagen.On Sunday, Frederiksen accused the US of “turning its back on Nato” – and said this Wednesday’s meeting in Washington DC between the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, and US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would be crucial.“We are at a crossroads, and this is a fateful moment,” Frederiksen said at a political rally.View image in fullscreenA member of the French armed forces during a military drill as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian home guard units together with Danish, German and French troops take part in joint military drills in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, on 17 September 2025.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersA bipartisan group of US senators, including the Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, is planning to visit Copenhagen to meet politicians from the Danish parliament’s Greenland committee, it was announced on Sunday.The pessimistic comments of Murphy and Frederiksen were echoed on Monday by Andrius Kubilius, defense commissioner of the European Union, who noted that an EU treaty “obligated” member states to come to Denmark’s aid if faced with military action by Trump.“I agree with the Danish prime minister that it will be the end ofNato, but also among people it will be also very, very negative,” he told Reuters at a security conference in Sweden.“It will depend very much on Denmark, how they will react, what will be their position, but definitely there is such an obligation of member states to come for mutual assistance if another member state is facing military aggression.”Murphy, meanwhile, accused Trump of trying to distract the American people over Greenland and other actions, including the capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, a promise that US companies would control Venezuela’s oil, and the construction of a ballroom at the White House.“Let’s also talk about what’s at stake here,” Murphy said. “The president is spending every single day thinking about invading Greenland, managing the Venezuelan economy, building a ballroom.“He is not thinking about the American people at all. This month, health insurance premiums on 22 million Americans are going up, doubling in some cases. Kids aren’t able to eat three meals because the Trump administration has slashed food assistance.“And so every single day, the president is thinking about Greenland, his ballroom, Venezuela. He is spending no time thinking about the actual crises that are being visited on American families. That is the underlying reality of a White House that has become out of control.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGreenlandDenmarkEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

Thirteen people were arrested and the ship, which had run out of fuel, was towed to port in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.Video footage of the operation shows officers using shovels to dig the wrapped bales out of a vast amount of salt in the hold.Spanish police dig bales of smuggled cocaine out from a pile of saltThe operation, nicknamed White Tide, was carried out in collaboration with Brazilian federal police, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the UK’s National Crime Agency, alongside French and Portuguese authorities.The police statement said: “Thanks to this joint effort, Policía Nacional officers recovered 9,994kg of cocaine packed into 294 bundles that had been hidden among the tonnes of salt the ship was transporting, as well as a firearm that the gang was using to protect the shipment.“This represents a decisive blow to international criminal networks involved in maritime cocaine trafficking, demonstrating the effectiveness of international police cooperation in the fight against global drug trafficking – and highlighting, once again, the ability of the Policía Nacional to act successfully against criminal organisations with a global reach.”View image in fullscreenThe haul ‘represents a decisive blow to international criminal networks involved in maritime cocaine trafficking’, Policía Nacional said.Photograph: Spanish National Police/AFP/Getty ImagesThe previous record for the largest amount of cocaine seized by the force at sea was the 7.5 tonnes recovered from a trawler in July 1999.In 2024, Spanish police and customs officers intercepted thelargest known consignment of cocaine to reach the country, seizing more than 13 tonnes of the drug, which had been hidden in a cargo of bananas shipped by container from Ecuador.Spanish authorities seized a total of 123 tonnes of cocaine in 2024, up from 118 tonnes in 2023 and 58 tonnes in 2022.Explore more on these topicsSpainDrugsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He declined to give names.Marcin Romanowski, who was Poland’s deputy justice minister underZiobro, claimed asylum in Hungary in late 2024 after he was identified as a suspect in a related case.The Polish government’s spokesperson, Adam Szłapka, said Ziobro’s asylum claim showed “the sheriff proved to be nothing but a coward”.In November, the Polish parliament waived Ziobro’s parliamentary immunity. Prosecutors have requested his temporary arrest and the motion is expected to be heard this week. In December, his passports were invalidated in an attempt to stop him leaving the country.Explore more on these topicsPolandHungaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a quick recap of today’s key developments:At least 648 demonstrators have so far been killed in the ongoing crackdown by Iranian security forces against the most significant anti-government demonstrations in Iran in years, according to the latestcountfrom the rights groups tracking the death toll. The true number, of course, could be far higher, given the difficulties arising from the days-long nationwide internet blackout. Here is a visualguideto the protest movement.Donald Trump said the United States was considering “very strong options” to intervene in Iran, having previously threatened to intervene militarily if the regime continued to kill protesters.Diplomatic channels between Washington and Tehran remainopen, andthe White House said today that Iran is sending“quite different” messages to the United Statesprivately than what it is saying publicly,and the US has “an interest in exploring those messages”.While diplomacy remains the “first option”, Trump is “unafraid” to respond to the killing of protesters with military force “if and when he deems that necessary”, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. She also said that the US president’s special envoy Steve Witkoff is and “will continue” to be a key player in diplomatic discussions with Iran.Iran’s supreme leader in turnaccusedthe US of “deceit” and relying on “treacherous mercenaries”,whilepraisingstate-organised pro-governmentralliesin Tehran. You can read more about the staged rallieshere.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchiwarnedthat Iran was not seeking war but was “fully prepared” for war with the US.“If Washington wants to test the military option it has tested before, we are ready for it”, Araghchi told Al Jazeera Arabic, referring to last summer’s bombings of three nuclear sites in Iran. “We have a large and extensive military preparedness compared to what we had during the last war. We are prepared for all options and hope Washington chooses the wise option.” He went on: “We are also ready for negotiations but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect.”The UK’s foreign secretary Yvette CoopertoldAraghchi that the Iranian government must immediately end its “horrific” violence against protesters.In response, Araghchiwarnedthe UK “to avoid interfering in Iran’s internal affairs”. He also threatened to evacuate the Iranian embassy in London.Lastly, if it is safe for you to do so, we would like to speak to people inIran.

There, they listened to a speech by the speaker of the parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who railed against western intervention.Ghalibaf said Iran was fighting a four-front war: an “economic war, psychological warfare, military war against the US and Israel, and today a war against terrorism”.Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teachDonald Trump“an unforgettable lesson” if Iran were attacked.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the demonstration was a “warning” to American politiciansfollowing threats from the US president, Donald Trump, to intervene militarily in Iran.“These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to Iranian state TV.The show of support by regime supporters came as the Iranian government tried to project an air of normality, despite being rocked by the country’s largest protest movement since 2009.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Cars and buildings on fire as protests continue Iran’s capital – videoThe US president has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Tehran killed protesters. The White House on Monday said Trump was not afraid to use military force, but wanted diplomacy.Iran’s foreign minister claimed the situation in the country had “come under total control” on Monday in an address to foreign diplomats.The few messages and videos to have emerged from Iran overnight showed that protests were continuing, but an ongoinginternet blackoutmade it difficult to judge whether the authorities’ use of violence had been effective in blunting the movement’s momentum.The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 648 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, and thousands more injuries, but warned the death toll was probably much higher – “according to some estimates more than 6,000”, it said.Videos on social media showed protests continuing into Monday, in contrast to officials’ comments, but demonstrations thus far have been concentrated at night.mapThe protests, now in their 16th day, started when traders in Tehran took to the streets to protest over a sudden depreciation in the national currency. They have expanded into nationwide demonstrations with protesters calling for the fall of the Iranian regime – triggering a heavy-handed response by authorities.Iran has beat back previous rounds of mass unrest through the use of force, notably in 2009 and 2019. The coming few days are being seen as a bellwether for the staying power of the current protest movement in the face of an increasingly lethal response.The foreign minister claimed that western powers had turned peaceful protests “violent and bloody to give an excuse” for military intervention. Iranian officials have accused Israel and the US of backing protests and using them to try to destabilise the country, despite the apparent vast popular participation of everyday Iranians in the protest movement.The government crackdown has drawn a wave of condemnation from the international community, with Germany and Canada calling on authorities to halt their repression of Iranians on Monday.Unpredictable Trump weighs up Iranian pleas for help against calls for restraintRead more0:46Bodies line the streets outside morgue in Tehran as deadly protests continue – videoWhat little information made its way out of Iran amid its internet blackout – now in its fourth day – showed continued use of force against protesters and a soaring death toll.“After some time, in the darkness, gunfire began and people were hit by bullets. There were no security forces present in the streets. Based on what we observed, we suspect the shots were fired either from drones in the sky or directly from rooftops,” said a protester in the Punak neighbourhood of Tehran.Tehran mapThey added that authorities seemed to cut off electricity before firing at protesters, so that the crowds were plunged into darkness before bullets started flying.Avideocirculating over the weekend showed dozens of bodies in a warehouse in the Kahrizak area of Tehran. The Hengaw human rights group said the warehouse was being used as an overflow facility for a morgue that was too overcrowded.Footage showed families huddled around a widescreen television where faces of the dead at the morgue would appear, hoping to learn the fate of their loved ones who went out to protest but did not return.Iranian student killed during protests was shot in head ‘from close range’Read moreIranian authorities have sought to clamp down on protests with a very public show of force inside Iran, handing out harsh sentences to those they deem to be involved in demonstrations.At least 96 cases of forced confessions had been broadcast by state media, evidence that was often used later to carry out death sentences, rights groups warned.One protester, 26-year-old Irfan Soltani, had been sentenced to death, with his execution slated for Wednesday, the Hengaw human rights group said, citing his family. Soltani would be the first protester executed by authorities since the protest movement began.View image in fullscreenIranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran last week.Photograph: Khoshiran/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesReza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, on Sunday urged Iranian security forces and government employees to join the swelling protest movement. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Pahlavi posted on social media.Protesters have increasingly rallied around Pahlavi as an opposition figure to the regime, with demonstrators chanting support for his family dynasty. He has claimed that thousands of members of Iran’s security forces have signalled their intent to defect through an online platform he has created, and that he will give further instructions when the time is right.Thousands of Iranians rallied around the world over the weekend in support of protesters inside the country.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

MSF says it supports one in five of Gaza’s hospital beds and one in three mothers during childbirth.View image in fullscreenAn injured Palestinian boy is seen by a member of staff at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic in the al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City, on 31 December 2025.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesTheUN Human Rights Officeestimates that 94% of Gaza’s hospitals have been damaged or destroyed since Israel’s assault on Gaza began in 2023.At least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed by the Israeli military over two years of war, thegroup said. Many medical items, includingwheelchairs and walkers, have been barred entry.A panel of UN experts determined that Israel’s attacks on the sector and its workers amounted to “medicide” – the systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare system and a component of Israel’s larger campaign against Palestinians that legal experts have called genocide.The Israeli military said in a statement that “the claims that IDF forces are deliberately preventing medical teams from treating wounded civilians is completely baseless, both in the Gaza Strip and in the Judea and Samaria region,” using the term for the West Bank preferred by the Israeli government. “The IDF recognizes the importance of the special protections given to medical teams under international humanitarian law and takes action to prevent harm to them,” the statement continued.The letter asks world leaders to take “immediate action” to restore and enable medical access for patients in Gaza and the West Bank, where increasing restrictions on movement have affected access to medical care.More than 18,500Palestinians awaitmedical evacuation from Gaza, (MSF)estimatedin December. The humanitarian agency said that at least 1,000 people have died awaiting care.Dr Thaer Gazawneh, a Chicago-based emergency physician who signed Monday’s letter, believes that Israel’s restrictions are designed to push Palestinians out of Gaza.“[They] are making the living conditions in Gaza so unbearable that people will be forced to be displaced again.”Gazawneh volunteers in the West Bank where he said it had become nearly impossible to dispatch emergency responders due to Israeli checkpoints and the threat of arbitrary arrests.At least 384 medical workers have been unlawfully detained by Israel’s military, according to theNGO Healthcare Workers Watch.“This call for medical access is urgent because medicine and care is the bare minimum of humanity, and when even that’s blocked, it puts every person on the planet at risk of being treated the same way: subhuman,” Glazer told the Guardian. Glazer, a New York-based Jewish comedian and actor first famed for her television series Broad City, has been a sharp critic of Israel’s war in Gaza, and previously signed aletteralongside 150 Jewish creatives calling for a ceasefire and the safe return of hostages.Hind’s mother told the Guardian that the issue of medical access felt particularly personal because her daughter had dreamed of becoming a doctor.“Hind never bought any ordinary toys or dolls like other children. She always chose doctor’s toys: a stethoscope, a plastic syringe, a small first-aid kit. She would treat her dolls, pat them, and promise them that everything would be all right,” Hamada said.“Hind’s dream is no longer to become a doctor, but for the children of Gaza to find a doctor, a hospital, medicine, and safety.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has claimed that Iran reached out and proposed negotiations, as he considers“very strong” military actionagainst the regime.“The meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what’s happening before the meeting. But a meeting is being set up.Irancalled, they want to negotiate,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday night.It follows direct contact between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Araghchi was seeking to ward off a potential US attack on Iran, but the status of Iran’s nuclear programme was also discussed.Iranian student killed during protests was shot in head ‘from close range’Read moreIran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said communication lines with the US remained open but that the messages from the US were “often contradictory”.Araghchi, briefing foreign diplomats in Tehran with his first remarks after Trump’s comments, did not depart from the official line since the US and Israel bombed its nuclear installations last June that Iran could only hold talks on the basis of respect.He also claimed the situation in Iran had “come under total control” as authorities carry out a brutal crackdown against nationwide anti-regime protests, now in their 16th day.Map showing protests in Iran.Trump suggested in his comments on Air Force One that Iran was seeking talks because “I think they’re tired of being beat up by the United States. Iran wants to negotiate.”But asked whether Iran’s leaders had crossed a red line with the crackdown on protests, he replied: “It looks like it. There seems to be some people killed who weren’t supposed to be killed.” Estimates of the death toll vary from 300 to 3,000, an estimate provided by the National Council for Resistance in Iran.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Crowds march on streets of Iran calling for overthrow of supreme leader – videoPressed about his plans to intervene militarily, Trump said: “We’re looking at it very seriously, the military’s looking at it. And there’s a couple options.” An administration strategy meeting on Iran will consider the options in the next 24 hours.Trump also said he planned to speak with Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran – where authorities have blacked out services for four days – using his Starlink service.Trump’s claims of discussions about talks – if true – would suggest a strong private debate inside the Iranian government about the essential need to lift US sanctions through a nuclear deal.It is widely accepted inside the reformist-led government that without US sanctions being lifted, the country’s economic problems, the spark for the protests, will continue.View image in fullscreenIranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran last week.Photograph: Khoshiran/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesBut there has been no sign that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or the hardliner-dominated parliament are prepared to endorse such talks, and the often fantastical explanations for the protests, or denial of their existence, relieves Khamenei of a need for a policy response.But in a regime show of strength, mobilising its core base through mass demonstrations on Monday, it was significant that the reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, did not address the crowds, but instead that fell to the hardline speaker of the parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who called Trump delusional.Ellie Geranmayeh, Middle East expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the Iranian government could have hit a ceiling in terms of what it could offer the protesters.Araghchi described Trump’s support for the protest movement that has roiled the country since late December as “interference in the internal affairs of countries […] No government has the right to threaten military intervention under the pretext of protests or human rights”. The regime showed no compunction about showing the body bags of protesters, describing them as terrorists.On Saturday, Araghchi met the key external mediator on Iran’s nuclear programme, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi, Oman’s minister of foreign affairs.However, if messages about negotiations had been sent to Trump, his comments may make it less likely negotiations will occur since there will be a political backlash about talking to a man that Iran believes duplicitously held five rounds of talks with it before bombing its nuclear sites days before the sixth round.The reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, often accused of weakness, initially acknowledged the legitimacy of the protests and the need for economic reforms to weed out corruption and control the exchange rate, and thereby inflation. A man driven by the need for consensus, he is unlikely to change the thinking of the supreme leader or the security services.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Indian embassy declined to comment.Singh Pamma is a figure in theKhalistan movement, a campaign for an independent Sikh state that is outlawed in India. Indian government officials describe the movement as terrorist and a threat to national security.According to MI5, foreign governments are increasingly targeting dissidents on UK soil, and the number of investigations into state threats has grown by 48% since 2022. In its2024-25 reporton transnational repression, the joint committee on human rights listed India as a country of concern alongside China and Russia.Singh Pamma’s claims come as the UK pursues a closer relationship with Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government, seeing it as akey partnerto balance China’s growing power. Last May, after three years of negotiations, the UKagreed a trade dealwith India, long touted as one of the biggest prizes of Brexit.Singh Pamma is one two Sikh nationalists based in the UK to have told the Guardian they have been advised to increase their security.“The repression we are going through has been relentless, it is crossing borders and reaching into our families now. This is terror, basically, by the Indian government,” said Singh Pamma, who has been forced to live separately from his family after threats.Singh Pamma said he regularly reported threats to the police but they only began to take his complaints seriously after the 2023killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh activist, in Canada, which the country’s then prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said intelligence agencies had linked to Indian government agents.In the same year,US prosecutors accusedan agent of the Indian government of directing the attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen, on US soil.Singh Pamma said he was now regularly visited by local and counter-terrorism police and was last visited by local officers as recently as October.“I’m really very angry with the government that they did not take action when we were asking them to take action,” said Singh Pamma, who asked for his location not to be disclosed.A Home Office spokesperson said they did not comment on individual cases or intelligence matters. “We are proud of our diverse communities, and British Sikhs make an immense contribution to the strength of our society. Their safety, like that of everyone in the United Kingdom, remains our highest priority,” the spokesperson said.The Indian government has long been concerned about the Sikh nationalist movement, which is largely diaspora-led, and campaigns for a Sikh homeland known as Khalistan to be created in the Punjab, in north-west India.In 1985, Khalistani militants smuggled a bomb on to Air India flight 182, which exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people onboard – the worst act of aviation terrorism before the 9/11 attacks.Singh Pamma is reported in Indian media to have previously been a fundraiser for Babbar Khalsa International, which investigators believe was responsible for the bombing. He called the allegations “fake propaganda”, condemned the act of terrorism and welcomed “any inquiry in any case” against him.Singh Pamma, whose family lived in Delhi before moving to Punjab, said his elder brother was killed by Indian police for his activism in 1991. He claimed he was picked up multiple times and tortured by police before leaving India and being given political asylum in the UK in 2000.Singh Pamma was arrested in 2010 after authorities in Punjab said they suspected him of involvement in a murder, but UK counter-terrorism police could find no evidence against him. In 2015 he was detained while on holiday in Portugal but a judge threw out India’s attempt to make him stand trial on terrorism charges.He claims to have regularly been a victim of threats and intimidation since moving to the UK, including receiving threatening phone calls. In one incident, visitors came to his home with guns in broad daylight. Singh Pamma was out and the men told his neighbours he had to stop his activism or he would be killed.In a second incident, several people visited his family home while he was out. The windows of his wife’s car were broken and Singh Pamma’s children watched from the upstairs window as group of men shouted his name. Police questioned one individual but Singh Pamma was told they lacked evidence to charge him and they did not recover any weapons.A member of the Sikh community told Singh Pamma he was offered £300,000 by someone else in the community to kill him. The local police force that advises Singh Pamma said they would not comment on an individual’s security.In 2023 a Birmingham-based Sikh activist, Avtar Singh Khanda,died suddenlyafter complaining that Indian police were harassing him over the phone and threatening his family in Punjab. Apathologist foundthat the result of the postmortem did not mean “that a poisoning can be completely excluded”.Singh Pamma said: “I always feel that [the UK government] is not doing enough. Canada took so many steps in Nijjar’s case, America did so many steps in Mr Pannun’s case. What they have done inMr Khanda’s case? What inquiries are they doing? It’s been nearly three years now.”Gurcharan Singh, a Sikh nationalist activist, has also been told by UK police that they know of credible threats to his safety. In Slough, Singh has a private security team and receives visits from officers nearly every two months.Two days before a planned protest in March against the Indian foreign minister’s visit to London, Singh said he was told in person by two officers that it was not safe to attend and that his safety could not be guaranteed.Singh’s wife died in May 2023 and he feels there are striking similarities between the circumstances of her death and that ofAvtar Singh Khanda. A spokesperson for Singh’s local police force said a two-year investigation concluded that there were “no suspicious circumstances” in his wife’s death, and that her cause of death was cancer. Singh said his wife’s cancer had been “under control” and was “not life-threatening”.“[The UK government] are aware of the threats facing [Sikh nationalists] and it seems they’re being very diplomatic and waiting for the right time to use it as a political leverage rather than thinking about safety,” Singh said.“If people like us are being threatened and quietened to this degree, this idea somehow that they can seek British interest in that region through diplomatic channels is fundamentally flawed.”The high commission of India in London did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsIndiaSikhismSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In answering questions about my association with Jeffrey Epstein I did not want to be held responsible for his crimes of which I was ignorant, not indifferent, because of the lies he told me and so many others.“I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.“I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the full truth about him after his death.“But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am truly sorry I was amongst those who believed him over them.”Lord Mandelson’s association with Epstein had long been known when Keir Starmer appointed the peer as US ambassador.However, he was removed from his diplomatic post after No 10 said it had been unaware of emails from Mandelson to Epstein suggesting the financier’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a child for prostitution was wrongful and should be challenged.Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 and served time in jail but Mandelson said he had believed his excuses and continued to support him out of “misplaced loyalty” and “a most terrible mistake on my part”.In his interview with BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the peer had sought to distance himself from Epstein, saying he was “at the edge of this man’s life”, despite “toe-curlingly embarrassing” emails showing his support and a birthday message describing him as his “best pal”.The interview was Mandelson’s first broadcast appearance since being sacked from his diplomatic role in Washington in September last year.He said: “I never saw anything in his life when I was with him, when I was in his homes, that would give me any reason to suspect what this evil monster was doing in preying on these young women.”He added: “I think the issue is that because I was a gay man in his circle, I was kept separate from what he was doing in the sexual side of his life.”In one of the emails released in September, Mandelson wrote to Epstein after his conviction saying: “I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened. I can still barely understand it.“It just could not happen in Britain. You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.”It continued: “Everything can be turned into an opportunity and that you will come through it and be stronger for it.”The friendship between the two men came under a renewed spotlight after Democratic members of the US House oversight committee released Epstein’s 50th “birthday book”, in which Mandelson called him “my best pal”in a handwritten note.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

You have to be in the room to tackle the issues working people care about.“The cost-of-living crisis will not be solved by isolationism. You cannot deliver peace in Ukraine without being in the room. And you do not secure trade terms for companies like JLR by putting gesture politics first.”After Starmer kicked off the new year with a charm offensive to win over disgruntled MPs, some in No 10 believe his international role has the potential to bolster his leadership, encouraging MPs intent on removing him to pause during global turmoil.Adopting a more upbeat tone about the country’s future, he listed a series of positive changes already delivered on the NHS, wages, crime and infrastructure.“Britain will see change and renewal this year. Our country is moving in the right direction,” he said.He added: “With each change we make for the better, we show working people something even more important.“That decline can be reversed. Opportunity and pride can be restored. The future can be better for them and their families. And politics can be a force for good.”Starmer, who spent the final months of last year dogged by leadership speculation, has been trying to improve relations with Labour MPs by inviting them to Downing Street and Chequers for events, and spending more time meeting them in parliament.He sought to rally his cabinet last week, telling them to ignore the polls and prepare to take on Reform UK.But the latest YouGov poll put the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since the general election, both of them behind Reform, with Labour on just 17%.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourUK cost of living crisisForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The US has dropped that accusation and he is not linked to the 9/11 attacks.MI5 andMI6passed on questions to the CIA to ask Zubaydah until 2006, even though MI6 was warned he was being subjected to harsh mistreatment in 2002, which lawyers argued made the British spy agencies complicit.It was considered that “98% of US Special Forces would have been broken if subject to the same conditions”, according to a report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee published in 2018.On Sunday the BBC reported that Zubaydah had received “substantial” compensation from the UK – a figure that lawyers not directly involved in the case estimated could amount to a six-figure sum.But there was no explanation from the UK government beyond a simple statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. It said it did not comment on intelligence matters, andit is not thought to have admitted liabilityin making the payment. Intelligence sources also declined to comment.Dominic Grieve, a former UK attorney general, who chaired the2018 parliamentary inquiryinto the UK spy agencies involvement in US torture and rendition during the “war on terror”, called for more clarity.“Somebody ought to ask a parliamentary question – and the government ought to make a ministerial statement,” Grieve said. In our inquiry “we could see what had happened, but not why it happened”, he added.The former government chief legal officer said it was “almost inevitable” that the UK would have to pay compensation and that Zubaydah was “undoubtedly a direct victim of UK negligence”.Dan Dolan, the interim deputy executive director of Reprieve, a human rights campaign group, said the UK should clearly express regret: “If the UK government was complicit in Abu Zubaydah’s horrendous torture, they owe him a public apology, not just a cash sum.”Dolan said that there remained a “gap in accountability” on the use of intelligence by the UK obtained from prisoners held abroad in situations were there was a real risk of torture, a practice still permitted in exceptional circumstances.At an earlier stage of the proceedings, Zubaydah was represented by Richard Hermer, who is now the attorney general, as part of a legal battle to demonstrate that English and Welsh law applied to his case. Ultimately, the UK supreme court accepted that argument in December 2023.A public inquiry into cases like Zubaydah’s was promised by David Cameron when he became prime minister, but was halted and replaced by a narrower investigation by parliament’s intelligence and security committee, which was not allowed to question more junior members of the agencies.Nevertheless, in Zubaydah’s case it concluded: “The agencies [MI5 and MI6] continued to send theCIAquestions to be used in interrogations without seeking any assurances regarding Zubaydah’s treatment in detention, until at least 2006.”Court disclosures in another case, brought by Dan Jarvis, now the security minister, and Conservative MP David Davis, indicated there could be a total of 15 other cases where the spy agencies were accused of being involved.Lawyers acting for Zubaydah, who is described as a “forever prisoner”, are engaged in a legal campaign in several countries aimed at obtaining compensation and securing his release after more than two decades in US custody.Explore more on these topicsGuantánamo BayCIAMI6PalestineUS militaryMI5Al-QaidanewsShareReuse this content"

But he stopped short of resigning himself.His decision, which meant he stayed on at the Treasury for a further two months and was privately branded an opportunist by colleagues, showed just how flexible he was willing to be when it came to his own career.EvenNigel Farage, who announced Zahawi had defected to Reform UK on Monday – the 20th and most senior ex-Conservative MP to do so – said at the time that it showed “all he’s interested in is climbing that greasy pole”.Farage has already acknowledged that lack of experience is one of Reform UK’s biggest hurdles in looking like a credible party of government. His solution to this appears to lie in enlisting former Tory ministers – with more defections rumoured to be on the cards.But it also presents Farage with a quandary: pack the ranks with too many former Tories and you end up creating Conservative party 2.0, not long after the original version was booted out of office. Insurgents don’t tend to have been in power for 14 years.The attraction of Reform for former Tories has been clear for some time: the party is well ahead in the polls and – if it maintains that public support – Farage could be on course for No 10. The allure of returning to power is strong.But there’s no guarantee of a seat: Reform’sZia Yusuf warnedlast month that “washed up” former Tory MPs who join the party will not be prioritised when parliamentary candidates are being selected.The Tories’ response to the latest defection was to brief thathe had “begged” them for a peeragejust a few weeks ago but been turned down because he lost a ministerial job owing to a row over his tax affairs.Zahawi has previously sworn he would be a lifelong Tory, posting in 2014: “Been a Conservative all my life and will die a Conservative.”At a press conference in central London on Monday, Zahawi said he had been given “no promises at all” about what role he could play for Reform, saying he switched because the Tory party was a “defunct brand” that could no longer form the next government.The big prize for Reform, however, would be to win over more sitting Tory MPs, after Lee Anderson and Danny Kruger jumped ship. It would herald the end of the Conservative party if its numbers in parliament fell dramatically.Step forward, Nadhim Zahawi: the latest, highest-profile rat to flee the Tory ship | John CraceRead moreJust six months ago, though, Tory MPs were deeply worried that many more of their colleagues would follow the pair out of the door, speeding up the party’s decline. That fear – while it has not gone away entirely – has at least dissipated.First, because while Reform still leads in the polls, its momentum appears to be stalling, prompting speculation it may have hit a ceiling to its support, which potentially makes it difficult for it to form a majority.At the same time, YouGov polling shows that Farage loses in head-to-heads with Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and Ed Davey – suggesting voters could be willing to vote tactically to keep the Reform leader out of power.Second, because the Tory leader has looked, since the party’s autumn conference, as if she is very slowly starting to turn things around. Her party has always had a sharp survival instinct. It is years until the next election. For now, defectors can afford to wait.Nor is Zahawi’s defection risk-free for Reform – and not just because their purple ranks are increasingly tinged blue. He wassacked as Tory party chairin 2023 after an investigation found he had not been sufficiently transparent about paying a penalty to HM Revenue and Customs, as part of a total settlement of £5m for unpaid taxes.The multimillionaire businessman haspreviously faced scrutinyover past dealings with oil companies, medical firms and a tax haven, and has extensive business relationships in the Middle East, so is certain to have his commercial dealings pored over once again.With Farage’s political career littered with dramatic fallouts, opponents will be paying close attention to Zahawi’s relationship with Farage, a politician known not to enjoy sharing the limelight. The two men havesparred in publicfor years.In a 2015 social media post on X – which was only deleted on Monday – Zahawi called comments by Farage that employers could not choose British workers over Polish ones “offensive and racist” and said he would be “frightened” to live in a country run by him.There are also potential flashpoints on policy: Zahawi was the health minister who oversaw the successful Covid vaccine rollout during the pandemic. Reformplatformed a controversial doctor, the cardiologist Aseem Malhotra, who claimed the vaccine had caused cancer in the royal family.For now, though, ambition appears to have won out for the former Conservative chancellor. He is unlikely to be the last to make the same calculation.Explore more on these topicsReform UKConservativesNadhim ZahawiNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

The seven-figure contribution comes as several ultra-wealthy tech moguls have left or threatened to leave California over the tax.Thiel, worth some $26bn, made the donation last month to the California Business Roundtable’s political action committee, according to a public disclosure filing which was firstreported by the New York Times. A representative for Thiel did not respond to requests for comment.The ballot proposal, called 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, is still in the beginning stages of gathering the 900,000 signatures needed for it to go to voters in November. If voted into law, it would levy a one-time, 5% tax on anyone in the state worth more than $1bn and grant a five-year period for payment. Thiel would owe the state roughly $1.3bn based on his current net worth.Tech titans divided over whether to pay billionaire tax or flee CaliforniaRead moreThiel’s contribution to theCaliforniaBusiness Roundtable Pac is an early signal of how California’s tech elite may mobilize their immense resources to quash the proposed tax. As the proposal gains prominence, it has already become a fixation for some of the state’s wealthiest residents, who see an impending threat to their vast fortunes.The proposal has driven opposition from a number of big-name tech billionaires, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Both men, worth upwards of $250bn each,have shifted assetsto other states in recent months, according to the New York Times, while the Wall Street Journal reported that Page recentlyspent about $173m to purchasetwo Miami homes. Other tech billionaires, especially members of the tech-right such as Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and Palantir co-founder, Joe Lonsdale, have egged on their peers to leave the state.Thiel has also made recent moves to relocate some of his empire from California, with his Thiel Capital private investment firmannouncing last yearthat it had opened a Miami office. His donation to the California Business Roundtable also lists Miami as his location. Thiel has a history of bankrolling conservative causes, including $1m for Donald Trump’s first campaign, and hasgiven millions to anti-tax groupsand candidates in past years.Advocates for the tax, including the Service Employees International Union, contend that the revenue would prevent the collapse of California’s healthcare system and fund the state’s public education programs. The tax would only affect approximately 200 people in the state, according to the union.The proposed ballot measure has also proven politically divisive among elected Democrats, with Governor Gavin Newsom vowing to “fight” it and claiming that it would hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive. California representative Ro Khanna, meanwhile, has backed the act.The lobby group involved in fighting the proposal described it as a “dangerous wealth tax” in a statement to the Guardian, alleging it would force investment out of the state.“The California Business Roundtable will continue to be actively engaged in ballot measures that affect the business community and the cost of living for all Californians,” Rob Lapsley, president of the Roundtable, said. “That includes opposing proposals like a dangerous wealth tax that would undermine our economy, decimate the state budget, drive investment out of the state, and ultimately make everyday life more expensive for working families.”While a number of billionaires have spoken out against the tax, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recentlytold Bloomberg Televisionthat he had no problem with it. Huang, who is worth around $159bn, argued that he was “perfectly fine” with the proposal and claimed he hadn’t “even thought about it once”.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPeter ThielWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

And we ask that the courts will end the surge of thousands of DHS agents in Minnesota.”“The deployment of thousands of armed DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is in essence a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said during a press conference, noting the shutdown of schools and the closure of local businesses. “This surge has made us less safe.”A motion for a temporary restraining order will be filed today ahead of the lawsuit, said assistant attorney general Brian Carter.Ellison described the federal agents as poorly trained, and contrasted them with the training ofMinneapolispolice, noting that local police have had to respond to 20 instances of ICE agents’ apparent abduction of Minneapolis residents.“They’re making unconstitutional arrests and using excessive force,” Ellison said. “DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas. And when asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they respond, ‘We don’t need one.’ This has to stop. Let’s be clear; this should have never started.”In the press conference, AC Thompson of PBS Frontline asked if the lawsuit aimed at restraining the use of crowd control weapons. “My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said. “Are you aiming to do anything about them?”Ellison encouraged Thompson to file a complaint and “make sure people know what happened to you and your crew … The press is protected by the first amendment and is vitally important in this moment when freedom of the press and every first amendment right is under a threat.”Ellison noted that Minnesota’s noncitizen immigrant population is just 1½ percent, “which is half the national average. Our state’s percentage is lower than Utah, Texas, and Florida’s,” he said, suggesting that theTrump administrationhas targeted Minnesota out of political bias.Ellison also alluded to Minnesota and its Somali immigrant population coming under vitriolic attacks from the White House and rightwing media after a series of social services fraud cases drew conservative attention in recent weeks.“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to like our state very much,” Ellison added.The Twin Cities’ response to a surge of thousands of federal agents has taxed the law enforcement capacity of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, each of which has about 600 police officers, said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis.“We don’t use the word invasion lightly,” he said. “The stated reason of this federal government for bringing in this full invasion of ice and border control is not safety. If it were safety, there would be other mechanisms to achieve safety.“If this were about fraud, then you’d see an invasion perhaps of accountants. But that’s not what you see. What you see is people being indiscriminately taken off our streets.”Kaohly Her, mayor of Saint Paul and a Hmong-American immigrant, also spoke at the conference and said she was now carrying her passport card and ID with her all the time.“Because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained,” she said. “When I’m going to be approached, the fact is that the tactics don’t even at this point really matter right? It’s the fact that we are being attacked as American citizens right now.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaMinneapolisICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She added that under that reasoning “Congress needs to investigate the department of justice”.Louisiana senator John Kennedy said “we don’t need this” when asked about the investigation by reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday.Congressmen Frank Lucas, from Oklahoma, and Mike Lawler, from New York, who sits on the House financial services committee, also weighed in with support for an independent Fed.“While I fundamentally believe Chairman Powell was late in addressing inflation under Joe Biden and has been woefully slow in lowering interest rates over the past year, the independence of the Federal Reserve is paramount and I oppose any effort to pressure them into action,” Lawler told Politico.The responses come days after the justice department subpoenaed the Federal Reserve as part of an investigation rooted in Powell’s testimony before the Senate in June about the ballooning costs of the Fed’s headquarters renovation. Powell confirmed the subpoena on Sunday and said the investigation was part of a pressure campaign linked to the administration’s frustration with the Fed’s interest rate policy.“No one – certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve – is above the law,” Powell said in a video posted by theFederal Reserve on X. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”1:59US Federal Reserve chair says DOJ has threatened criminal indictment – videoSince returning to office last January, Donald Trump has waged a year-long campaign urging Powell to lower interest rates, and has repeatedly suggested he might remove the Fed chair outright, though he has stopped short of doing so. Powell’s term expires in May, and Trump told Politico last month he would judge Powell’s successor on whether they were willing to cut rates immediately.TrumptoldNBC Newson Sunday he had no knowledge of the investigation, but criticized Powell’s performance. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” the president said.Trump also denied the subpoenas had anything to do with interest rates. “No. I wouldn’t even think of doing it that way. What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” he said, adding that he believed the public was pressuring Powell.The Federal Reserve operates as an independent entity within government, and is meant to shield monetary policy from political interference. Central bank independence is considered essential by economists for maintaining economic stability and credibility.“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell wrote in his statement.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Fed independence mattersCallum Jonesin New YorkMon 12 Jan 2026 12.21 ESTFirst published on Mon 12 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareEvery living former head of the Federal Reserve condemned an “unprecedented” attempt by theTrump administrationto weaken the US central bank’s independence, after the Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell.Ex-Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen warned similar prosecutorial attacks in other countries had led to “highly negative consequences” for the cost of living – and argued they had “no place” in the US.Late on Sunday, it emerged that the justice department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas on Friday, threatening a criminal indictment related to Powell’s testimony before the Senate banking committee in June last year, regarding renovations to the Fed’s historic office buildings in Washington DC.Justice department opens investigation into Jerome Powell as Trump ramps up campaign against Federal ReserveRead moreIn response, Powell argued he had been threatened with criminal charges because the Fed had set interest rates “based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president”.The move amounts to a significant escalation in Donald Trump’s extraordinary attack on the Fed’s independence. The US president has repeatedly blasted Powell and the central bank for declining to bow to his demands for rapid interest rate cuts, and launched an aggressive campaign to and exert greater control over its decisions.Trump has moved to distance himself from the investigation, claiming he was unaware of it. “I don’t know anything about it,” hetoldNBC News. The justice department did not respond to a request for comment.Several Republicanscriticizedthe department’s pursuit of Powell on Monday.Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a member of the Senate banking committee that oversees Fed appointments, said he would oppose any nominee for the central bank “until this legal matter is fully resolved”. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, another committee member, also called for a swift end to the investigation.Fed up: inside Trump’s unprecedented bid to exert control over the US central bankRead moreEx-Fed officials and policymakers also sounded the alarm, warning that this action could damage the US economy. “The reported criminal inquiry intoFederal ReserveChair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,” a blunt statement signed by 13 former senior officials,including Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen, said. “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.“It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.”Economists also cautioned that Trump’s attempts to influence the Fedrisk plunging the US into a period of 1970s-style inflation, and triggering a global backlash in financial markets.A string of analysts drew parallels to when price growth soared after the then president, Richard Nixon, put pressure on the Fed chair, Arthur Burns, to ease monetary policy to help smooth his 1972 election campaign.On Monday, however, Wall Street was calm. The benchmark S&P 500 was flat at lunchtime in New York, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%Allies of Trump spent months last yearaccusing the Fedof mishandling the multibillion-dollar renovations. Trump had repeatedly threatened legal action.In his response on Sunday, Powell insisted the legal threat was “not about” his testimony last summer, or congressional oversight of the Fed. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said.Powell, initially appointed by Trump, and reappointed by Biden, has chaired the Fed since 2018. His term as chair is due to expire in May – at which time Trump’s chosen successor can take his place – although Powell can remain on the Fed’s board of governors until 2028.Kevin Hassett, a senior White official and director of the National Economic Council, is seen as the favorite to succeed Powell as Fed chair. Trump said last week he had made a decision, and whenaskedby the New York Times about Hassett, Trump described him as “certainly one of the people that I like”.Asked about the justice department’s investigation on Monday, Hassett claimed that he respected the independence of the Fed. “I guess the question is, if you think the building cost $20bn, or $10bn, do you think at some point that it’s appropriate for the federal government to investigate? And seems like the justice department has decided that they want to see what’s going on over there.“And if I were Fed chair, I would want them to do that,” he added. “I think that it’s really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS economyFederal ReserveTrump administrationJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what we know about what’s going on.Ex-Fed chairs condemn Trump’s bid to weaken central bank’s independenceRead moreWho is Jerome Powell?As chair of the Fed, Powell has been the public face of the central bank since 2018. Trump initially appointed him for a four-year term, and then Biden reappointed him in 2022. His term as chair will end in May.Powell alone does not set interest rates. He is part of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the 12-member board that votes eight times a year on any changes to interest rates. Though Powell is just one vote out of 12, he has enormous sway as the most influential voice on the state of the US economy.Why is the justice department investigating the Fed chair?The justice department said the investigation is over potential “abuse of taxpayer dollars”, but it’s been pretty quiet on any specific details. Much of what we know so far comes from Powell’s video.The investigation is an escalation of attacks the White House has made before over renovations of the Fed’s Washington DC headquarters. Trump over the summerreproachedPowell about the project, and its cost of $2.5bn, instead of the $1.9bn that had originally been budgeted in 2019.Trump accused Powell of overseeing a lavish renovation, like a VIP dining room and a garden terrace. “It’s possible there’s fraud involved with the $2.5bn,” the president claimed at the time.The justice department has served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment, according to Powell, related to testimony he gave in front of the Senate banking committee in June.Thetestimonyin question is from a regularly scheduled, semiannual update the Fed chair gives to the Senate banking committee on the state of the economy in June.In brief comments, which amounted to less than two minutes out of a two-hour session fielding questions from senators on the economy, Powell had said the renovations were needed for safety purposes on buildings that hadn’t undergone major renovations since the 1930s.“There’s no VIP dining room, there’s no new marble,” he told senators. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. There are no special elevators, there’s just the old elevators.”How has Powell responded to the investigation?Powell hit back on Sunday with a remarkable defense of the Fed’s independence, and explicitly laid out the White House’s unprecedented campaign to lower interest rates. The investigation amounts to an “unprecedented action [that] should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure”, he declared.“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,” said Powell. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”Powell affirmed his commitment to public service and “standing firm in the face of threats”.It’s the first time that Powell, who spent much of the last year declining to publicly address Trump’s criticism, has so directly responded to the White House’s aggression. The president has often publicly mocked the Fed chair in social media posts for being a “very stupid person”, and accused him of damaging the US economy.Why are people worried about this?A statementsigned by every living former Fed chaircondemned the investigation, and warned that similar political attacks on independent central banks have led to unstable economies and higher costs of living.“It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,” the statement said.The move also rattled a few Republican senators, whose support Trump will need to get his Fed chair nominee approved, before Powell’s term ends in May.Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina,saidhe will oppose whoever Trump nominates to replace Powell as Fed chair “until this legal matter is fully resolved”. The Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski called the investigation “coercion” and warned that the economy would suffer if the Fed loses its independence.Economists have alsosounded the alarm, warning that Trump’s attempts to influence the Fed could risk plunging the US into a period of 1970s-style inflation, and trigger a global backlash in financial markets.Why is Trump attacking the Fed?Trump has long wanted the Fed to lower interest rates, claiming that cutting rates would save “$1tn a year” and spur economic activity.Powell, and many of his colleagues at the Fed, take a more cautious approach. Fed economists often refer to the central bank’s “dual mandate”: mitigating price increases, while keeping unemployment low. Cutting rates too quickly risks higher inflation in the long term, but rates that are too high can stagnate the labor market.These complexities appear to matter little to the White House, which has relentlessly pushed for significantly lower rates since Trump re-entered office.Last spring, Trump privately told advisers that he wanted to fire Powell. He backtracked when marketsresponded poorlyto the news, but he hasn’t let up on his pressure campaign.After Trump spent weeks trying to cause a stir around the Fed’s renovations, the White House instead went on to fire the Fed governor Lisa Cook, a voting member of the rate-setting FOMC who was appointed by Joe Biden. The supreme court temporarily reinstated Cook and will hearargumentsover her firing next week.Why is the Fed’s independence so important?The Federal Reserve’s independence was a key part of its structure when it was created by Congress in 1913. Economists have long studied the importance of having a central bank that is unswayed by politics. Markets depend on the central bank to be a steady presence in the economy, making decisions based on economic data, instead of the whims of politicians.The only say the president and Congress have on the Fed is who gets to sit on its board, with terms lasting 14 years. And while the president can fire other leaders within the executive branch, removing someone from the Fed’s board has to be “for cause” – an argument at the heart of the upcoming supreme courttrialon Cook’s firing.In his statement, Powell implied the White House is waging an existential fight against the Fed. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsEconomicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Trump’s Venezuelan dream could make it worseDebbie CarlsonPicture is as murky as a barrel of oil, with US companies in 2026 expecting their first production drop in four yearsMon 12 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.48 ESTShareUS shale-oil producers were already contending withoilprices at four-year lows. News that they may soon face a significant competitor in their back yard probably wasn’t how frackers wanted to greet 2026.The US capture of Venezuela’s PresidentNicolaá Maduroand his wife, Cilia Flores, hit the share prices of independent shale-oil producers, such as Diamondback Energy and Devon Energy, last week.Over the last 20 years, the US fracking industry has built itself into the main driver of domestic oil production: it accounted for64% of totalUS crude oil production in 2023. With average production levels of 13.6m barrels a day (BPD), the US is the world’s largest crude-oil producer.Trump says US companies will invest billions in Venezuelan oil production. Experts aren’t so sureRead moreIt will take years for Venezuela’s production to ramp up, limiting the near-term impact on US suppliers, but Donald Trump has made clear he wants firms to move quickly.The development comes at a difficult time for the industry, which is pressured by aglobal glut of oil. Higher supplies come from an unwinding of 2023 voluntary production cuts by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and growth in non-Opec countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China and Guyana.Oil prices have been trending down since passing $100 in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. With supply overwhelming demand, nearby Nymex West Texas Intermediate crude-oil futures prices – agreed rates for assets to be bought at a later date – are trading at about $56 a barrel. Longer-dated futures contracts for the US oil benchmark forecast prices range between $56 and $57 a barrel until June 2028.Price of oil per barrel over the last five yearsUS fracking is expensive, so the industry will not welcome more price pressures. Potentially, this is a threat to Republicans who have championed fracking in swing states like Pennsylvania, where the shale revolution has been an economic boon.For now, the picture is as murky as a barrel of oil.Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, says any impact Venezuela has on US producers is a matter of timing. The US oil market is currently “acting like a reasonably supplied market with expectations that supply continues to increase, which keeps dampening those oil prices”, he said.Whether Venezuelan productionresumes as projectedis debatable, but one saving grace for US producers is thatVenezuelan oil is heavy, and requires more processing than the light oil the US pumps. That makes Venezuelan petroleum less of a competitive threat to the US, since refiners globally can use light oil, says Peter McNally, global head of sector analysts at Third Bridge. Still, Venezuela’s potential output adds to the growing global glut.The economics of US oil production, when oil is about $57 a barrel, are troublesome in the longer term. TheFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimatesthat break-even prices for existing wells, in both shale and non-shale production, are between $26 and $45 a barrel, but that break-even rises to between $61 and $70 for any newly drilled wells.Despite sluggish returns, the shale-oil industry is in better shape than in 2020. Producers’ balance sheets were already laden with debt when prices briefly turned negative during the Covid lockdown, says Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.Many smaller producers went bankrupt. Those that survived started to focus on generating cashflow and return on invested capital, rather than hiking production. That capital discipline means companies are in better fiscal shape to weather lower oil prices, and are likely to keep a close eye on the bottom line, Thummel says. “What that means is they’re going to cut back on spending and [rein in] production.”The difficult times in 2020 ushered in consolidation, and the industry became dominated by oil majors like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rather than the independent producers that started up during the initial hydraulic fracturing oil boom in the early aughts. Sustained lower prices could spell problems for the numerous small, private drillers, especially if Venezuela’s oil comes online, says Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial.“The overall long-term implication is it’s definitely negative for the … run-of-the-mill frackers, because you’re going to see more supply, and that supply is clearly going to put pressure on the fracking industry,” he says.Companies are likely to keep output flat in 2026. TheEnergy Information Administration, the US Department of Energy’s statistical arm, estimates 2026 production to average 13.5m BPD, down slightly from 2025’s 13.6m-barrel record output – the first production drop in four years.Stewart Glickman, director of fundamental research at CFRA Research, says he’s slightly concerned oil production in the US mainland, referred to as the Lower 48, may be peaking. Capital expenditures are down about 40% from 2014’s peak, as companies relied on technological improvements to increase output. Since shale-oil production declines quicker than traditional drilling, Glickman says the US might be closer to start seeing overall production falling.“Instead of, 13.5 [million BPD] becoming 14, becoming 14.5, maybe we start to get a little bit of cresting and slight decline, because the lack of reinvestment is eventually going to catch up with you,” he says. “There’s a lot of moving parts, and now you add Venezuela on top it, and the longer-term risk.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsOilEconomicsVenezuelaFrackingShale oilCommoditiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Its bid has beenbackstopped by a personal $40bn guaranteeby Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle.Netflix and Paramount deals are both wrong for Warner Bros Discovery – and democracy | Courtney C RadschRead moreUnder the Netflix deal, the streaming company is poised to take control of WBD’s prize assets such as Warner Bros, the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Superman and Batman, as well asHBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.Paramount also said on Monday that it had filed a lawsuit seeking disclosure of “basic information” – including how WBD has valued the global networks operation, which includes CNN, the Cartoon Network and the Discovery Channel, whichNetflixis not buying – so that WBD shareholders can “make an informed decision”.In the letter, David Ellison, the chief executive of Paramount, said: “We are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting.”Paramount said the “slate of directors” it intended to nominate would then engage with the company to assess the merits of its takeover bid.Paramount also said it intended to propose an amendment to WBD’s bylaws to require shareholder approval for the proposed spin-off of the global networks business.“If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval,” David Ellison said. “These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.”The Netflix deal offers $23.25 a share in cash as well as stock in the streaming company and equity in the global networks spin-off that Paramount values at zero.“We do not undertake any of these actions lightly,” David Ellison said. “Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD’s board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.”Paramount argues that its $30-a-share cash offer, which includes buying global networks, is a better deal for WBD shareholders.WBD’s board hastwice told shareholders to reject the “inadequate” $108.4bnhostile takeover bid.​​WBD called the bid the “largest LBO [leveraged buyout] in history”, a structure it said posed risks to the offer.Under the terms of its deal with Netflix, WBD would have to pay a $2.8bn breakup fee if it walked away from the agreement.Paramount Skydance’s revised offer also involved increasing its termination fee to $5.8bn, matching Netflix.However, WBD said if it were to accept the deal with Paramount it would incur $4.7bn in costs, including the breakup fee to Netflix, additional interest on debt and a $1.5bn fee for failing to complete a debt exchange.Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsWarner BrosNetflixParamount PicturesTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Most union members voted last month to authorize the walkout.Anticipating the possibility of a strike, New York’s governor,Kathy Hochul, declared a state of emergency on Friday and urged hospital administrators and union leaders to reach a last-minute agreement. She warned that a strike “could jeopardize the lives of thousands of New Yorkers and patients”.“I’m strongly encouraging everyone to stay at the table, both sides, management and the nurses, until this is resolved,” Hochul said.Thousands of New York City nurses set to strike amid contract disputesRead moreAs in the2023 labor dispute, the current conflict centers on a complex mix of grievances, rebuttals and hospital-specific concerns. Staffing remains a key source of contention, with nurses arguing that well-funded hospitals are unwilling to commit to standards that ensure safe and manageable workloads.In this round of negotiations, the union is also pressing for limits on hospitals’ use of artificial intelligence, along with enhanced workplace safety protections. In November, a gunman entered Mount Sinai, and earlier this week a man armed with a sharp object barricaded himself inside a Brooklyn hospital room; police ultimately killed both individuals.The private, non-profit hospitals involved say they have improved staffing since 2023. Some hospital representatives argue that the union’s full slate of demands would be prohibitively costly.On Friday, dozens of nurses gathered in Manhattan to protest, saying their focus is on patient care and accusing hospital systems, whose top executives earn millions annually, of prioritizing profit and refusing to compromise.“My hospital tries to cut corners on staffing every day, and then they try to fight historic gains we made three years ago,” Sophie Boland, a pediatric intensive care nurse in the NewYork-Presbyterian hospital system, told the Associated Press.Hospital officials have described the union’s strike threat as “reckless”. In a statement released on Thursday, they said they would “do whatever is necessary to minimize disruptions”.Nancy Hagans, the president of theNew YorkState Nurses Association union, has also stressed that patients should not delay care during a potential strike.View image in fullscreenProtesters march on the streets around Montefiore medical center during a nursing strike on 11 January 2023 in the Bronx borough of New York City.Photograph: John Minchillo/APMount Sinai has hired more than 1,000 temporary nurses and held preparatory drills for a strike that could affect its 1,100-bed main hospital and two affiliates – Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West – with about 500 beds each.NewYork-Presbyterian said it also had arranged for temporary nurses but, in the event of a strike, some patients might be moved to new rooms or advised to transfer to another facility. Montefiore posted a message assuring patients that appointments would be kept.The same union mounted a three-day strike at the Mount Sinai flagship facility and Montefiore in 2023, when nurses expressed their sacrifices during the challenging height of the Covid-19 pandemic and the national nurse staffing crisis that followed.The walkout prompted those hospitals to postpone non-emergency surgeries, tell many ambulances to go elsewhere and transfer some intensive-care infants and other patients. Temporary nurses and even administrators with clinical backgrounds were tapped to fill in, but some patients noticed longer waits and understaffed wards.The strike ended with an agreement on raises totaling 19% over three years and staffing improvements, including the possibility of extra pay if nurses had to work short-handed. The previous nurses’ contract expired on 31 December.Now, hospitals are retreating from those guarantees and falling short on other promises, the union says.Montefiore, for example, agreed to “make all reasonable efforts” to stop keeping some emergency room patients in hallways while they wait for space to open up in other wards. Yet three years later, nurses still scramble to treat “hallway patients”, Michelle Gonzalez, a Montefiore intensive care nurse,toldthe Associated Press on Friday.Montefiore has suggested it has made some progress: the hospital told elected officials in a letter in October that there has been a 35% reduction in the time it takes from emergency admission to a clinical unit bed.Overall, the hospitals say they have greatly reduced nursing job vacancy rates in the last three years, and Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia Irving University medical center say they also have added hundreds of nursing positions.In recent days, several smaller hospitals – including multiple NorthwellHealthfacilities on Long Island – averted potential walkouts by striking deals or making what the union viewed as adequate progress.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS healthcareNursingHealthHealthcare industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Madridwon the semi-finalof the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia against Atlético Madrid having been outplayed but then lost the final.The former midfielder’s arrival at the Santiago Bernabéu was announced in May on a contract until 2028.

Five largely unimpressive successive wins since were only a temporary reprieve, defeat on Sunday finally bringing his spell to a close.

His bravery and skill inspire his teammates to elevate their playDoug FarrarMon 12 Jan 2026 03.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 10.59 ESTShareTwo things about the NFL playoffs are predictable: Josh Allenwill play out of his skin... and Josh Allenwill suffera soul-sucking, stupefying loss. Except, maybe, this year.We all know about thepostseason heartbreaks and shortfalls over the yearsfor Allen and the Buffalo Bills. In each season since 2019, Buffalo’s ride has ended in either the divisional or conference championship round, usually at the hands of Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. But with no dominant team coming out of the regular season and no Mahomes this postseason, maybe it’s time for Allen and the Bills to finally capture the franchise’s first Lombardi Trophy.If the Bills were going to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in the wildcard round, it would beon Allen to be Superman. This was a uniquely bad matchup for a Bills team that leads with one of the NFL’s best run games, because Jacksonville, under first-year defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, had the NFL’s best run defense. Meanwhile, Buffalo’s run defense has been among the league’s worst all season long, and the Jaguars took advantage at times. Jacksonville had 154 rushing yards on 23 attempts (6.7 yards per carry), while the Bills managed just 79 yards on 26 carries (3.0 yards per carry).Now that’s how you push a tush.pic.twitter.com/o5julET0Zo— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero)January 11, 2026Of course, the Bills got right with the run game on two massively important plays. With 1:10 left in the game and the score 24-20 in Jacksonville’s favor, the Bills had fourth-and-one at the Jacksonville 11-yard line. The idea was for Allen to run a Tush Push to get the first down, but he did a lot more than that. His run was originally ruled an 11-yard touchdown, reversed on review. No worries for Allen,who took the ball over the linefor the 27-24 win on the next play.Never mind that Bills head coach Sean McDermottwanted to ban the Tush Pushbefore the 2025 season began. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.This was all on Allen, and he did everything he needed to in order for his team to advance. He completed 28 of 35 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown, and he had 33 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries. With that, Allen became the first quarterback in pro football history to complete at least 80% of his passes and run for multiple touchdowns in a playoff game.NFL playoff predictions: who will seize a wide-open Super Bowl race?Read moreAnd he did all of this with a foot injury he’s been dealing with since late December, not to mention the blows he suffered in this game. There was the concussion check … and the part when he suffered to his throwing hand … and the part where blood was seen trickling from his ear … and the part when he hobbled to the sideline after a touchdown run in the first half. Despite all of that, he put his team on his shoulders once again, and rallied the Bills past multiple in-game deficits for the win. And it’s games like this that show why Allen is such a brilliant player. Yes, he can hurl a pinpoint pass 50 yards down the field, or hurdle linebackers on one of his super-soldier runs. But the fact that he staggers on, like a footballing El Cid seemingly unkillable, is crucial - it’s terrifying for his opponents and inspiring for his teammates.“It trickles down from [Allen], the team’s toughness,” McDermott said after the game. “When your quarterback’s that type of warrior, that type of competitor ... from a leadership standpoint, it just goes through the whole team. We’ve got to get him as healthy as we can, though, for next week, and it’s not something we take lightly.”View image in fullscreenChristian McCaffrey helped the 49ers dethrone the reigning champions.Photograph: Matt Rourke/APMVP of the weekChristian McCaffrey, RB, San Francisco 49ers.With 14:52 left in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s San Francisco 49ers-Philadelphia Eagles game, the Niners were down, 16-10, tight end George Kittle was out with a torn achilles tendon that ends his campaign (just the latest in a horrific series of injuriesthe team has dealt with this season), and Kyle Shanahan’s team had first-and-10 at the Philadelphia 29-yard line.That’s when Shanahan decided to get tricky, pulling from the best offensive playbook at any level of football. Brock Purdy handed the ball to Skyy Moore, who flipped it to receiver Jauan Jennings,who threw a dart to McCaffreyfor the 29-yard touchdown that gave San Francisco a 17-16 lead that would ultimately hold in a 23-19 win.Of course, the win might not have happened had Purdy not found McCaffrey for thegame-deciding touchdownwith 2:57 remaining. Through all the injuries, McCaffrey has been the 49ers’ constant all season long.His 413 touches were the most in a regular seasonsince DeMarco Murray’s 449 for the Dallas Cowboys in 2014, and with McCaffrey’s 15 carries for 48 yards and six catches on eight targets for 66 yards and two touchdowns, this win was yet another example of his value to this organization.Video of the weekAnother look at the exchange between AJ Brown and HC Nick Sirianni on the sideline.pic.twitter.com/Syn0hr0MFK— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX)January 11, 2026This back-and-forth between Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and receiver AJ Brown during the first half of Philly’s loss was a fitting encapsulation of all the frustration with an offense that bulldozed through theNFLin the 2024 season under offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.When Moore took the New Orleans Saints’ head coaching job, Sirianni elected to promote Kevin Patullo to offensive coordinator, and nothing has been the same since. Patullo appeared to be in over his head from the start, the Eagles’ formerly brilliantly aligned offense fell apart more often than not, and when Brown dropped two passes he should have caught on two straight plays on Sunday (with a false start on right tackle Fred Johnson in-between for good measure), it all boiled over.Brown,who dropped yet another pass on the Eagles’ final drive, has expressed frustration throughout the season with his role, but it’s hard to be in his corner when he had so many opportunities and dropped all of them.At least his head coach is behind him. “I think he knows how I feel about him,” Sirianni said of Brown after the game. “I have a special relationship with him. We’ve probably [gone] through every emotion you can possibly have together. We’ve laughed together. We’ve cried together. We’ve yelled at each other. We’re both emotional. I was trying to get him off the field, and that happens in this game. That happens in this game, but I love him.”Stat(s) of the week94%.When Packers quarterback Jordan Love hit receiver Matthew Golden for a 23-yard touchdown pass with 6:43 left against the Chicago Bears, it bumped Green Bay’s win probability to 94%, and the score up to 27-16 in their favor. Of course, things didn’t turn out the way the Packers must have expected. Why? Because the Packers were facing a team who have no idea when they’re supposed to quit. The Bearshave won seven gameswhen trailing within the final two minutes this season,which is an NFL record, as you might expect.View image in fullscreenMatthew Stafford’s Rams march on in the NFC.Photograph: Erik Verduzco/APElsewhere around the league–After all the excitement through the Saturday and early Sunday games, Sunday night’s contest between the Patriots and Chargers was a relatively one-sided affair with a 16-3 result in New England’s favor. Drake Maye struggled a bit in the first half against a Jesse Minter-led defense that threw every kind of coverage at him, but the quarterback returned to his MVP form in the second half. As for the Chargers’ injury-ravaged offensive line, Justin Herbert was sacked six times and pressured ceaselessly, which has been the Chargers’ primary story all season long. Herbert is now 0-3 in his playoff appearances. Next season should be better for him once the Chargers offensive line gets healthy but we’ve yet to see Jim Harbaugh fully exploit one of the league’s best talents.– Despite the fact that they beat the Los Angeles Rams 31-28 in Week 13, the Carolina Panthers were serious home underdogs (-10.5) on Saturday. The disparity had a lot to do with the fact that the Rams came into the game with a +172 point differential, while the Panthers stood at -69 – by far the worst of all the playoff teams.Still, the Panthers played like a teenager who took mom’s car out for a joyride … and almost got away with it. When Bryce Young hit Jalen Coker for a touchdown with 2:39 left to put Carolina up 31-27, it seemed we had an upset on our hands. But on the Rams’ subsequent drive, Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero chose to rush four defenders and drop seven into deep coverage over and over, which allowed Matthew Stafford to feast on easy completions underneath. Stafford’s 19-yard touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson with 49 seconds left, which put the Rams up 34-31 for good, seemed preordained.the only thing prevent defense prevents is winningpic.twitter.com/qsmdeK2YqJ— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar)January 11, 2026– If you were surprised by the topsy-turvy nature of Chicago’s aforementioned win, welcome to the 2025 Bears, the NFL’s Kings of Variance. In the regular season, the Bears led the league in turnover differential (+22), but their defense was just as vulnerable as it was opportunistic. On the offensive side, Caleb Williams had been responsible for a ton of big plays this season under first-year head coach and offensive shot-caller Ben Johnson, but he also came into this game with the NFL’s lowest completion rate (58.3%).This is a team that has dug itself crater after crater all season long, and then they’ve filled those holes right back up. It’s quite the waste of energy, but it somehow works. The Bears had six fourth-quarter comebacks in the regular season (in the final two minutes of games) to lead the league, and when trailing in the regular season, Williams had completed 178 of 295 passes for 2,174 yards, 18 touchdowns, four interceptions, and a passer 97.8. On Saturday, in the fourth quarter, which began with a 21-6 Packers lead, Williams completed 10 of 21 passes for 184 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 110.0. The play that saved the Bears’ season came with 5:37 left in the game. Chicago had fourth-and-eight at their own 43-yard line down 27-13, andWilliams made a throwthat Bears fans will talk about for ever.– Monday night’s game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Texans features the most obvious mismatch of the wildcard round: Houston’s carnivorous defense against a Pittsburgh offense that is a mystery from week to week. The Texans don’t scheme a lot defensively because they don’t have to; they’ll simply line their guys up against your guys with the advantage in hand.The Steelers will hope that the return of receiver DK Metcalf,who was suspendedfor the final two games of the regular season after a confrontation with a Detroit Lions fan, will give their passing offense some much-needed juice. Aaron Rodgers threw 24 touchdown passes this season, but only one with Metcalf out those two games. Pittsburgh don’t have another Rodgers target who can upend a defense; certainly not one who can upend a defense of this caliber.Explore more on these topicsBuffalo BillsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he will not be eligible for PGA Tour equity grants for five years, he will not receive FedEx Cup bonus money in 2026 and he cannot play signature events unless he earns his way in.The out-of-pocket cost is a $5m charity donation to be decided jointly with the tour. The financial repercussions – no access to equity or FedEx Cup bonus money this year – is a potential loss the tour puts at $50m and upward.Tiger Woods at 50: golf’s unreachable standard finally meets timeRead moreBrian Rolapp, the CEO of PGA Tour Enterprises, outlined the agreement with Koepka and details of the “Returning Member Program” in a memo to players Monday. A copy of the memo was obtained by The Associated Press.Rolapp made clear, however, this was a one-time program and not a precedent.It applies only to players who have won majors or The Players Championship from 2022 through 2025, meaning Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith would be the only LIV players who could return. They have three weeks to decide.Koepka will have to earn his way into $20m signature events. He would be added to the field to not take a spot from another tour player.The board, which has a majority of players led by Tiger Woods, approved the program.Rolapp described Koepka’s case as a “unique situation.” He said the solution was guided by what would make the PGA Tour stronger, preserving playing opportunities for current members and responding to fans who want to see all the best players together.But this is far from an open path back for LIV players if they want to return. The program had the tone of an ultimatum for the trio of stars still in the Saudi-funded league.“Only those who have recently achieved the highest accomplishments in the game are eligible to return to the PGA Tour, where the best players in the world compete, week in and week out,” Rolapp wrote. “This is a one-time, defined window and is not a precedent for future situations.“Once the door closes, there is no promise that this path will be available again.”This can be viewed as catering to the stars – the tour has a history of that with the Player Impact Program and sponsor exemptions – but the stars are limited to a four-year window of big wins.Those ineligible to return under this program – assuming they even want to – include Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, seven-time LIV winner Joaquin Niemann, Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton of England and Patrick Reed.Koepka, a five-time major champion, was one of the biggest names to sign with LIVGolfin June 2022. He said in a 2023 podcast with boxer Jake Paul that his contract was for at least $100m and that “I signed for the dough.”Koepka, in a brief telephone interview, said he wasn’t entirely sure the PGA Tour would allow him back this quickly but “I’m grateful it’s come to this.”“I’ve got a lot of work to do with some of the players,” he said about the reception he gets. “There’s definitely guys who are happy, and definitely guys who will be angry. It’s a harsh punishment financially. I understand exactly why the tour did that – it’s meant to hurt. But it [his departure] hurt a lot of people.”Rory McIlroy named Sports Personality of the Year at emotional ceremonyRead moreRolapp said he understands there will be questions about holding a defector to LIV accountable, “especially after earning substantial compensation elsewhere.”“Ultimately, by accepting membership in the Returning Member category, Brooks is making the decision to return to the PGA TOUR now – something our fans want, and something that strengthens both the game and our organization.”The financial penalty is based largely on the value of the equity and how the 35-year-old Koepka performs. Assuming he averages a top-30 finish over the next five years and holds his equity shares until he is 50, tour officials estimate the potential loss of earnings at anywhere from $50m to $85m.Otherwise, he is back in the fold, exempt through 2028 based on his 2023 victory in the PGA Championship. He also would be eligible for the Presidents Cup and the indoor TGL league.But he cannot receive sponsor exemptions to the $20m signature events. He could only become eligible by qualifying, either with a PGA Tour victory or in two categories that reward current play.In an effort to protect current players, Rolapp said Koepka would be added to the field at any such tournament he gets in. That includes the FedEx Cup playoffs. If he qualifies this year, the tour would take the 71st player in the standings for the postseason opener, and 51st and 31st players if Koepka advances to the Tour Championship.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That meant the field was reduced to under 21 athletes and fewer qualifying points were on offer due to the lack of competition. Uhlaender believes the Canadian team did so to prevent American athletes from catching them in the standings for Olympic qualifying.Uhlaender claims Joe Cecchini, the head coach of Canada’s skeleton team, told her he had come up with the scheme.“I cried when I found out he went through with this plan,”Uhlaender told DW. “I didn’t know if it hurt more that my friend of 20 years just nailed my coffin, my Olympic dream is over. Or, that my best friend of 20 years is doing something so horrible that hurts so many people.”Uhlaender says that Cecchini told her on Friday that it was not his job to “uplift” athletes from other countries and that his aim was to “eliminate any possibilities” that Canada’s Jane Channell would miss this year’s Olympics.Uhlaender won the event at Lake Placid but the reduced points on offer means the 41-year-old will miss the Olympics. Although she won gold at the 2012 skeleton world championships, the closest she has come to an Olympic medal was when she finished fourth at the 2014 Games in Sochi.Coaches from the US, Denmark, Israel and Malta, whose athletes were all affected by the Canadian withdrawals, have written to the IOC expressing “serious concerns” about the qualification process.In a statement, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton defended the withdrawals, saying some of the athletes who were pulled from competition had already raced several times last week. It said the decision was “appropriate, transparent and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport.”Uhlaender disagrees. “[Cecchini] did not have to do that. He did it because he could. And it wasn’t to protect his athletes; it was to manipulate the system,” she told DW. “He waited until after everyone was registered and gave the illusion that the Canadians were going to be competing. He wanted to make sure that we could not get full points.”The flare-up comes after a number of heated sporting clashes between Canada and the US at a time when Donald Trump has threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and has raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Duringlast year’s 4 Nations Face-off, Canadian ice hockey fans booed the US national anthem and former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” Last season’s World Series saw the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Toronto Blue Jays in athrilling seven-game series, although most of the tension was due to the action on the field.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamCanadaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Spurs were in the market for midfield reinforcements after Rodrigo Bentancur sustained a hamstring injury that is likely to keep him sidelined for three months. The club have identified the 25-year-old as their primary target.Football transfer rumours: Liverpool and Chelsea eye Ramón? Gallagher to Spurs?Read moreGallagher is 18 months into the five-year contract he signed at Atlético when he moved to Spain from Chelsea in 2024, with Spurs expected to pay around £25m up front. It is understood that bonuses could take the deal to the £34m Atlético paid Chelsea.Villa have also held talks with the Spanish club and had been hoping to agree a loan deal that would have included an obligation to make the move permanent at the end of the season, but Atlético are understood to have preferred a sale. Manchester United were also linked with the player, who has not featured for England since their 3-1 defeat against Senegal last summer.Mathys Tel, meanwhile, has informed Tottenham that he is open to leaving on loan, having grown frustrated at his lack of game time under Thomas Frank since a £30m move from Bayern Munich. Paris FC and the Turkish clubs Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are understood to have registered interest in taking the 20-year-old forward on loan until the end of the season. Clubs in Italy and Spain are also believed to have sounded out Spurs, who are thought to be reluctant to let Tel leave after sellingBrennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for £35m.Tel, who startedTottenham’s 2-1 defeat by Aston Villain the FA Cup on Saturday, wants regular playing time to boost his chances of making Didier Deschamps’s World Cup squad, having been named recently as captain of France’s Under-21s. He has scored two goals in five Premier League starts this season and one in his nine league appearances as a substitute. Tel spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Spurs and was an unused substitute in the Europa League final.View image in fullscreenMathys Tel wants more consistent minutes ahead of the World Cup.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesThree days after Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou in June, Tottenham activated their optionto make Tel’s move permanent. He is said to have been extremely surprised by the decision toleave him out of their Champions League squadbecause Spurs were over the limit of the 22 players in September. Tel was added in December in place of the injured striker Dominic Solanke.It is understood there is no suggestion he would like to leave permanently and that he will keep working hard to earn a place in the side. However, having departed Bayern in search of more first-team action, he would like an opportunity to build some momentum in his career.Spurs, who are poised to complete a £13m deal with Santos for the 19-year-old left-back Souza, are in the market for attacking reinforcements, with Mohammed Kudus due to be out until April with a thigh injury. They have been linked with RB Leipzig’s Yan Diomande and Juventus’s Kenan Yildiz.Tottenham’s co-sporting director, Fabio Paratici, is in line to complete a move to Fiorentina once the January window has closed.

But his stint itself was hardly historic; lasting just 11 games and 85 days.He was not lacking qualifications. Before landing in Swansea, Bradley led two national teams, including the US at the 2010 World Cup and Egypt; Chicago Fire, Metrostars and Chivas USA in MLS; Stabaek in Norway and Le Havre in France. But his American soccer résuméwas always a factor, as other coaches to follow him across the pond also learned.The 2026 World Cup may transform US soccer. The 2030 World Cup could be even betterRead more“You always have to prove yourself,” Bradley said. “And when you come from the outside, it is going to be even more the case.”Tolerance for bad results was little, and abuse from fans – many of whom saw Americans as people with a fundamental cluelessness about the game – was common. Chris Armas, a former assistant at Manchester United and Leeds United, agrees. “Nothing will ever come easy for Americans in that world,” he said.A standout MLS midfielder, Armas coached in the league for eight years, including a run in the head role for New York Red Bulls. After he was fired by Toronto in late 2021, he was in no rush to take another job. His wife joked, “You’re not even going to entertain talking about another job until we’re putting up the Christmas tree next year.” Then the phone rang.It was Ralf Rangnick, whom Armas had met during his time with Red Bulls. The German was in temporary charge of Manchester United after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s dismissal and was looking for an assistant.“Ralf got right to it,” Armas said. “I told him I needed to speak with my wife and that I’d call him back in a few minutes. My son starts yelling at me, ‘What do you mean you are going to call him back? You didn’t just say yes?”Armas and Rangnick didn’t take a day off during their six months at United. Armas says one of the most important moments of the job came on the first introduction to the squad, which at the time included Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford.“They will form an opinion from that very first meeting,” Armas said. “Do they like you or do they not like you? Do I want to follow this person or not? … Every time you’re in front of the group you’re on trial – and rightly so. If they’re going to follow you, then you have to show that you are worthy to lead them.”View image in fullscreenChris Armas served as an assistant under Ralf Rangnick at Manchester United.Photograph: Matthew Peters/Manchester United/Getty ImagesWhen Armas’ spell at Man United ended, he joined American compatriot Jesse Marsch at Leeds. Marsch began as an assistant for Bradley with the US and earned Coach of the Year honors in MLS before moving to Europe as an assistant in the Red Bull organization. He worked his way from Austria with RB Salzburg to the top job at Bundesliga club RB Leipzig to thePremier Leaguewith Leeds midway through the 2021-22 season.After a year, with Leeds slipping toward relegation, Marsch was fired. Armas – just two weeks into the job – found himself having to take charge with his fellow assistants in the next match – a 2-2 draw with Manchester United.The United States must create big moments at World Cup 2026. Anything less is not enough | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead more“The stakes are higher with promotion and relegation,” said Armas of the differences between MLS and European leagues. “There is lots of money on the line and the intensity does seem higher. David Beckham, Robbie Keane, and Thomas Müller would all say there is something special going on in MLS but we are not where Europe is in that regard to the top,top, leagues.“You see some managers are at a club in Europe for a very long time and they get the support and then others don’t. I have seen that support in MLS too but the noise can come quickly in Europe. The demands are very high.”Wilfried Nancy is the latest coach to see how high those demands could be. The Frenchman spent 20 years in Canada climbing the coaching ladder, leading CF Montréal and guiding Columbus Crew to an MLS Cup and Leagues Cup before being hired midseason by Celtic.But his tenureended after 33 daysand just eight matches in charge, withboardroom disarrayreflecting uncharacteristically underwhelming performances on the pitch. The fine line between failure and success in European soccer compared with MLS was shown by the fact that Celtic bettered their opponents in xG in much of Nancy’s short reign – better finishing here and there, and he’d probably still be in charge.“When you go in mid-season it is particularly challenging,” said Bradley, who did so at Le Havre and Swansea. “You can come in and try to implement your system immediately. … The other idea is to go and get the best out of things and figure out what is going to be the best for that group in the short term. That results in the short term are tricky and it is results in the short term that give you the platform for what you want to do. There is not a right or wrong.”The business behind top level soccer in Europe – where there is generally less collaboration between coaches and front offices than in MLS – can also make an impact, sometimes unexpectedly. When Bradley was at Stabaek, the club accepted an offer from a Premier League team for a key midfielder on the final day of the transfer window and did not replace him. At Le Havre, the club sold the team’s best striker to a Premier League team for an offer that couldn’t be refused and again didn’t sign a replacement.The most unforgiving factor in coaching abroad are the fine margins in games – something Bradley learned to his cost atSwansea City. He still remembers how his final days at the club played out. After beating Sunderland for eight points in eight games, he met with management and felt the club was going in the right direction.“Then we had West Brom and Middlesbrough, and we lost both games. And by the time we got back for a home game against West Ham, I could feel it in the air.”Swansea lost and Bradley was sacked the next day.“I talked to [manager] Slaven Bilić after the West Ham game, which would be my last even though I didn’t know it yet, and he said, ‘You play some good football, but [the priority] is just survival,’” Bradley said. “He said there are a few teams who can play at a certain level again and again, but for everyone else – it is survival.’”Marsch’s first job after his time in the Premier League was with Canada, who he will lead at this summer’s World Cup. Bradley and Armas both returned to MLS. Bradley won an MLS Cup with LAFC and led Toronto for two years before a short stint back at Stabaek. Armas led Colorado Rapids before he was fired last year and wasappointed last weekto lead NWSL’s Kansas City Current.Will other MLS coaches make the leap to top clubs in Europe?“It’s not always easy to have respect. We have not made the splash,” said Armas. “We have to earn that respect. A few of us have to get that opportunity, go and do it, and do well.”Explore more on these topicsUSASwansea CityBob BradleyPremier LeagueMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The NFC West rivals split the season series.“We just focused on one play at a time,” McCaffrey said. “We knew it was going to be a 12-round fight. That’s what we kept saying. We just had to stick to it. No matter what happened during the game, good or bad, we just keep trusting each other and ended up winning.”Purdy threw for 262 yards and got the road win in Philadelphia he failed to grasp three seasons ago when he was injured in a dismal outing in Philadelphia in a loss in the NFC title game.Purdy had two passes intercepted in this one by All-Pro cornerback Quinyon Mitchell, but the Eagles scored just three points off the turnovers.The 49ers will head to Seattle without star tight end George Kittle, who was carted off the field with a torn achilles tendon late in the first half.The Eagles – who won a Super Bowl on a trick play – were foiled by one when Jennings was pitched the ball and rolled right and hit McCaffrey on a 29-yard touchdown. The score on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the 49ers a 17-16 lead. The Eagles would only get Jake Elliott’s 33-yard field goal in the quarter for a brief 19-17 lead.Philadelphia were again doomed by a lethargic offensive effort that cost them a shot at a repeat championship. Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts threw for only 168 yards and a touchdown and the Eagles failed to build off a 13-10 halftime lead by totaling only 36 total yards in the third quarter on 16 plays. Hurts was incomplete on a last-gasp fourth-and-11 attempt with 43 seconds left that ended their final drive, and their season.“Our team fights,” McCaffrey said. “I love this group so much. I don’t have enough good things to say about it. I’m proud to be a part of this team.”Meanwhile, the Eagles had the wrong kind of fight. Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown had to be separated from coach Nick Sirianni by chief security officer Dom DiSandro during a sideline blowup late in the first half. Brown ripped off his helmet in frustration and yelled in Sirianni’s direction after the Eagles punted to end a drive.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsSan Francisco 49ersPhiladelphia EaglesnewsShareReuse this content"

The club embarks on its first season this year.The 31-year-old has won league titles in the US and France, a Champions League title, a World Cup and an Olympic gold medal. She signed a contract with Denver through 2029.Rodman’s future and Liverpool in need to buy – welcome to the women’s transfer windowRead more“When I first heard about the team, I didn’t really feel like it was real. I couldn’t believe that we were getting a professional women’s soccer team and in Denver,” Heaps told the Associated Press. “I didn’t want to get too excited from the get-go because I didn’t know if it was a real possibility for me. And then, as conversations went on, the first thing I said, I wanted to make sure that it was the right opportunity for me.”Not only does Heaps have family in Colorado, but her husband, Tyler Heaps, is general manager and sporting director of MLS’s San Diego FC, and the two have been juggling the demands of a transatlantic relationship.Heaps also indicated that she was lured to the Summit by majority owner Rob Cohen and coach Nick Cushing, who previously coached the Manchester City women and MLS’s NYC FC.View image in fullscreenLindsey Heaps has featured for the US at two World Cups, in 2019 and 2023.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“I think they align with all of my beliefs in how they see the team, how they see it becoming successful, and the investment that they’re putting in,” she said. “And then hearing Nick and how he sees football, I think that was a huge deciding factor for me as well as I wanted to be with a good coach. So that was exciting.”NWSL proposes $1m salary cap breach to keep players like Trinity Rodman in USRead moreDenver has been assembling a roster in anticipation of its first season, bringing in Ally Watt and Carson Pickett, both formerly of the Orlando Pride, and Kaleigh Kurtz from the North Carolina Courage, among others. More recently, the team signed defender Ayo Oke from the Mexican club Pachuca.Heaps is known as an aggressive facilitator on the field, and her height – she’s 5-foot-9 – gives her an advantage in aerial duels.She said she hopes to foster the “chemistry, values and standards that I want this club to have for years and years, and make it a successful place and a place that everyone wants to play, that’s entertaining to fans and plays good football as well.”Following high school, Heaps turned down a scholarship to North Carolina and instead went overseas and played for Paris Saint-Germain for four seasons.In 2016 and vying for a spot on the Olympic team, she returned to the United States to play for the Portland Thorns, where she won an NWSL title in 2017 and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player in 2018.The Thorns loaned her to Lyon in 2022, and later allowed her permanent transfer to the team in France’s top division. In 95 appearances with Lyon, Heaps has scored 22 goals.A fixture for the US since the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Heaps has made 170 appearances and has served as captain since 2023.At the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France, she served Alex Morgan the go-ahead goal in the semi-final match against England. In addition to the World Cup trophy, Heaps also has a gold medal from the 2024 Paris Olympics.USA midfielder Sam Coffey in talks to join Manchester City from Portland ThornsRead moreHeaps’ return comes as some other US national team stars have departed for Europe in the past year.Naomi GirmaandAlyssa Thompsonmade high-profile moves to Chelsea.

I wanted to challenge myself in a different way,” she said. “Not negating what Portland gave me or what the NWSL gave me, but I was just like, I’d been there for six years and I wanted another challenge and I’d be remiss if I didn’t go and try to challenge myself in a different way in France again.”Explore more on these topicsNWSLUS sportsUSA women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Afcon indicates yesThe Africa Cup of Nations has been a brilliant display for a continent carrying no doubt about quality on the pitchJonathan WilsonMon 12 Jan 2026 10.45 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.21 ESTShareMore than any other continental tournament, there is always a sense with theAfrica Cup of Nationsthat it is a referendum on the continent’s football generally. Perhaps it’s because so many of the players are familiar to those who habitually watch the European leagues or the Champions League, but the question is less about individual quality of players – that is a given – than it is about organisation and structures. Somewhere in the background, perhaps, lurks Pelé’s notorious prediction, made in 1977, that an African team would win the World Cup by the end of the 20th century. Is a World Cup win for Africa any closer than it was half a century ago?In Morocco at this year’s edition of the tournament, there has been an extra element: the country’s status as World Cup co-hosts with Spain and Portugal in 2030. What are facilities like? Is the infrastructure there? This question is readily answered: in terms of stadiums, pitches and hotels, Morocco is already well on the way to being able to stage the World Cup. All six cities hosting games at this Cup of Nations are candidates for 2030.Salah inspires Egypt with energy recalling golden generation to evoke recent history | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe stadiums in rural Rabat and Tangier are ready, with a new 115,000-capacity stadium to be built in Casablanca and renovation planned for the grounds in Agadir, Marrakech and Fez. There should be no qualms about any of them. The pitches have been uniformly excellent, despite unusually heavy rain, which may be one of the reasons for the predictability of this tournament so far (eight of Africa’s 10 highest-ranked sides made the quarter-finals).The high-speed Al-Boraq rail service from Rabat to Tangier is exceptional and should be extended through Casablanca to Marrakech by 2030. The conventional trains are very good, though they would come under strain at a World Cup, and don’t yet reach as far south as Agadir. With internal flights limited, that is an obvious potential problem. Hotels have easily been able to cope with the influx of visitors for the Cup of Nations without absurd price increases, and Morocco has a developed tourist infrastructure. That may yet not be enough for the far greater stresses of a World Cup, but the foundations are there.The biggest concern is access to the stadiums, with potentially dangerous crushes developing at games at the two smaller stadiums in Rabat and in Marrakech, where the stadium is located out of town with only one access road and no rail service. Even when it was just over half-full for Côte d’Ivoire’s last-16 win over Burkina Faso, there was chaos as fans tried to navigate the one road back towards the city centre.The other question is both bigger and harder to answer. At the last World Cup, Morocco became the first African side to reach the semi-finals, finally breaking through the quarter-final ceiling achieved by Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. It’s never wise to read too much into the performance of one country at one tournament but, after years of the pyramid getting broader but not necessarily higher (seen in, for instance, the development of Cape Verde, Burkina Faso and Angola among others over the past couple of decades), it does feel that the continent’s elite are beginning to assert themselves once more.Victor Osimhen’s volatile temperament risks harming Nigeria’s Afcon questRead moreThat this version of Nigeria, who are playing with thrilling attacking verve, will not be at the World Cup (unless theirappealagainst the eligibility of certain DR Congo players succeeds and they then win the interconfederational play-offs) says a lot both about howchaotictheir World Cup campaign was, but also about the quality of the teams who eliminated them: DRC and South Africa. Their bonus dispute at times feels like an infinite onion of ineptitude, with each day bringing a further layer of detail of who authorised what to whom and at what point, but the basic point is that players and coaches should be paid what they are due.Short-termism still reigns: Sami Trabelsi has already paid forTunisia’s last-16 exitwith his job, and the expectation is that Vladimir Petković will pay a similar price forAlgeria’s defeat to Nigeria. The Algerian reaction in general was disappointing, if not unfamiliar: flare-ups in the stands and in the tunnel, a mass berating of the match officials, and a fracas with Moroccan journalists in the mixed zone.But quality on the pitch, in so far as it’s possible to determine in isolation, is improving. All four semi-finalists have had their moments. Senegal are still seeking a balance in midfield but have been comfortably good enough so far. Egypt, so cautious and inhibited over the past decade, arefinally playing with self-beliefand perhaps in the quarter-final found a way to get the best out of Mohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush. Nigeria’s attacking play, based around the passing of Alex Iwobi, the invention of Ademola Lookman and the aerial prowess of Victor Osimhen, has been exceptional. Morocco, while clearly feeling the pressure of expectation, looked in their quarter-final like the well-organised team that put Spain and Portugal out of the last World Cup.Will any of the sides at this Cup of Nations reach the World Cup semi-final? Morocco and Senegal certainly have a chance, and with a fair wind it’s not impossible that Egypt or Algeria, perhaps Côte d’Ivoire, could win a couple of knockout games.

Barnsley made Arne Slot’s side battle for the right to host Brighton in round four while their head coach, Conor Hourihane, accused Dominik Szoboszlai of disrespect for gifting his team a goal while showboating. Slot appeared inclined to agree.Liverpool were grateful for a late Florian Wirtz-inspired flourish for an ultimately comfortable margin of victory and banishing any anxieties. But this had been another slog against a low defensive block until the expensive substitute swept home a fine third goal and created a stoppage‑time fourth for Hugo Ekitiké. There was no more relieved man inside Anfield than Szoboszlai.Liverpool v Barnsley: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreThe Hungary captain punctured an enterprising start byBarnsleywith a brilliant 30-yard strike only to let them back into the tie with a ridiculous error. The former Liverpool academy player Adam Phillips profited in front of the Kop to reduce the arrears to 2-1 and reward Barnsley’s disciplined and occasionally dangerous display. The visitors had other moments, not least when the impressive winger Reyes Cleary went down in the Liverpool penalty area under a Szoboszlai challenge, before Wirtz’s class ultimately told.“It is such an amazing feeling for Adam scoring in front of the Kop,” Hourihane said. “Liverpool fan, coming through the academy; it’s something he can look back on for the rest of his life and say he did that. Not many people can. But it was a little bit disrespectful from their player, to be honest. I don’t think he does that against Chelsea or Arsenal or in a Champions League game. Delighted for Adam, but disrespectful from their player’s point of view.”There was no danger to the Liverpool goal when Szoboszlai intercepted Corey O’Keeffe’s pass towards Phillips and set off across his own penalty area. Once he reached the goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, however, the midfielder, showboating after his superb opener, took the tricks too far. Szoboszlai attempted to backheel the ball to his keeper but scuffed the attempt and left Mamardashvili stranded. Phillips, continuing his own run into the box, duly converted into a gaping Kop goal.View image in fullscreenAdam Phillips scores for Barnsley after a mistake from Dominik Szoboszlai.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAn unhappy Slot said: “I don’t think you should do that in anFA Cupgame or League Cup, a friendly game or even a training session. It’s a weird choice and I also have my opinion about it but I prefer to keep that to myself and speak about that with Dom.”The Liverpool head coach added: “It is not the first time – I’m talking generally – we are 2-0 up, there are no problems in the game and we concede a sloppy or an easy goal but this stands out, even for us. It is definitely not helpful.”Barnsley had started the tie superbly. With only 29 seconds on the clock the striker Davis Keillor-Dunn beat Joe Gomez to a Phillips cross from the right and headed against a post. Nathanael Ogbeta also went close with an angled attempt that sailed just over the Liverpool crossbar.There were no mid-season mini-breaks for Liverpool’s senior players this year. Slot, as promised, named a strong starting lineup and bench for the third-round tie having learned a painful lesson when doing otherwiseat Plymouth last season. Szoboszlai got on the right side of his boss when collecting a ball in space on the left and giving the Barnsley goalkeeper Murphy Cooper no chance with a brilliant drive into the top corner.Liverpool dominated the next 30 minutes. Szoboszlai struck another clean effort from distance that rebounded out for a corner off the head of the defender Jack Shepherd. Jeremie Frimpong supplied the comfort of a two-goal advantage with another fine strike. Receiving Alexis Mac Allister’s pass on the right, the Netherlands international cut across Ogbeta into the penalty area and unleashed a thunderous shot into the roof of Cooper’s net.View image in fullscreenJeremie Frimpong doubles Liverpool’s lead with a fine strike.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesFrimpong’s first Anfield goal should have been the platform for Liverpool to ease into the fourth round. Szoboszlai’s error ensured otherwise. Cooper produced a superb save to tip a Virgil van Dijk volley on to his crossbar before Barnsley raged over Farai Hallam’s decision to dismiss their penalty appeals when Cleary went down in front of Szoboszlai. The midfielder pulled the winger’s shirt but also played the ball and, with no video assistant referee to dissect that one, play continued.The introduction of Wirtz and Ekitiké on the hour eventually paid dividends for Slot. Wirtz missed a glorious opportunity to extend Liverpool’s lead when putting a Szoboszlai cross over the bar from close range. But the Germany international made amends when Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ekitiké combined to prise open the Barnsley lines. Collecting Ekitiké’s flick on the edge of the area, Wirtz curled a lovely finish into the top corner to banish any late Liverpool nerves. He also teed up Ekitiké with an inch-perfect cross in stoppage time. The France forward made no mistake from close range.Explore more on these topicsFA CupLiverpoolBarnsleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In his only No 1 role Carrick oversaw 136 matches, winning 63 and losing 49.Carrick, whopulled ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjærduring the interview process, will lead United for the first time on Wednesday when the players return to training after two days off.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With midfield one of the positions United want to strengthen, Al- Hilal’s Rúben Neves is a target. The Portuguese would cost about £20m and should his acquisition become viable there are funds available for his purchase or for any other player on the club’s transfer wishlist.Carrick had a three-game caretaker spell at United in November and December 2021 after the sacking as the manager of Solskjær, for whom he was a first-team coach.Carrick was unbeaten, overseeing a 2-0 Champions League group game win at Villarreal, a 1-1 draw at Chelsea in the Premier League and a 3-2 league victory against Arsenal at Old Trafford. Carrick departed when Ralf Rangnick became the interim manager until the end of the season.As a midfielder at United, from 2006 to 2018, Carrick was part of a glittering period, winning 10 major honours, so he can expect comprehensive backing from the fanbase.His immediate task will be to lift the mood of the players and the wider club after their2-1 FA Cup third‑round defeat against Brightonat Old Trafford on Sunday. That meant United were eliminated from that competition and the League Cup at the first opportunity for a first time since 1981-82, and so will play only 40 games this season – their lowest number in a complete campaign since 1914-15.Carrick’s first match is the lunchtime visit of Manchester City for the derby on Saturday, after which comes a trip to Arsenal. Carrick will have 17 league games as the interim, and will target taking United to Champions League qualification. They are seventh, three points behind Liverpool in the fourth position that guarantees a berth.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

I haven’t set eyes on the lads since the game against Palace. I don’t know what they’ve been up to but let’s hope they didn’t party too hard.”Non-league Macclesfield were the lowest-ranked team in the draw but it also offered up some fascinating ties. Seven Premier League clubs will be visiting lower-league opposition with Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior, returning to his former club Hull City while Sunderland are heading toOxford United.West Ham, who desperately needed a result in the previous round against Queens Park Rangers will take the trip to League One Burton Albion while Wolves will not fancy an away-day at Blundell Park to face a Grimsby side who have already knocked out Manchester United in the Carabao Cup this season. Leeds United were handed a potentially difficult trip to St Andrew’s andBirmingham City. League Two’s Salford City will be dreaming of visiting Manchester City, if they can overcome Swindon Town in their rearranged third-round game.With promotion to the Premier League the obvious priority forWrexhamand Ipswich, the two in-form Championship sides will come together at the “world’s oldest international football stadium” for what is sure to be an entertaining tie with some Hollywood glitz thrown in. Co-owner Ryan Reynolds watched on as his team beat Premier League Nottingham Forest on penalties in round three and could be joined by celebrity Ipswich fan Ed Sheeran for theSTōK Cae Ras clash.One of the most eye-catching all Premier League ties is Aston Villa’s home clash withNewcastle United. If Liverpool can overcome the challenge of League One Barnsley at Anfield, then they will welcome the conquerors of Manchester United – Brighton – in the next round. The Premier League leaders will welcome Wigan to the Emirates. The fourth-round ties will be played from 13-16 February.Share"

Sincethe deadline-day arrival of Gianluigi Donnarumma, however, he has played in only four domestic cup ties and one Champions League match.Lucas Paquetá asked not to play for West Ham in FA Cup and wants to join FlamengoRead moreThe 23-year-old Trafford will start theCarabao Cupsemi-final first leg at Newcastle on Tuesday and Howe gave the impression that he had not closed the door on the idea of Trafford relocating to Tyneside. The Newcastle manager, who pursued Trafford for two years, is often circumspect when asked about players not in his squad but he said: “James Trafford is a very good goalkeeper. I’m a big fan of his and I wish him all the best in his career.”Guardiola suggested that Trafford could leave. “We want him and what’s going to happen at the end of the season we will see,” he said. “I would like him to stay for many years here because he has the attributes to play in a big club like us.”Trafford returned to City for a second spell in a £31m deal. The club matched Newcastle’s bid for him, though the net fee was £27m owing to a sell-on clause in the deal that took him to Turf Moor in summer 2023.Guardiola was asked how Trafford had responded to Donnarumma usurping him. The City manager said: “There’s no complaints. James is a top keeper. The situation of the keeper is completely special, right? One plays or the other one. It’s not like some positions, you can play in different ones. But we count on him.”Howe is prioritising cup competitions as his injury-hit side competes on four fronts. TheCarabao Cup holdersprogressed in the FA Cupby defeating Bournemouthand resume their Champions League campaign next Wednesday. “The cups are very important to us because the Premier League is incredibly tough to win and we’re not in that position currently,” Howe said.“So we have to look at what else we can win. We will know how important winning the Carabao Cup was to us last year and the feeling it gave everybody at the club. Now we are looking for the same feeling again and we have to try to take every opportunity to achieve it.”Antoine Semenyo, City’s new £62.5m signing, is able to face Newcastle even though he played for Bournemouth in the competition, under an EFL rule change introduced before this season. “It was nice to find out that rule had changed after finding out they’d signed him,” Howe said. “I have to say that’s one rule change I probably wouldn’t be supportive of at this moment.”The centre-back Sven Botman, meanwhile, has signed a contract extension with Newcastle until 2030.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityNewcastle UnitedPep GuardiolaEddie HoweCarabao CupnewsShareReuse this content"

The Brazilian club had a €35m (£30.3m) bid rejected on Monday but are willing to go to €40m.The midfielder has grown disillusioned with life in England and wants to return to his homeland. Paquetá was last yearcleared of alleged breachesof the Football Association’s betting regulations, and it is unclear whether he will play for West Ham again. The uncertainty over his future increased when he missed the third‑round win against QPR despite being fit.Tottenham’s Mathys Tel open to loan for more game time as World Cup loomsRead moreWest Ham are aware of the 28-year-old’s unhappiness but wary of selling him before the end of the season. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side are 18th in the Premier League before visiting Tottenham on Saturday and regard Paquetá as a key asset in their fight against relegation.A source close to Paquetá said there was no chance the Brazil international would be at the London Stadium next season. The former Lyon midfielder, who joined West Ham for £51m in August 2022, began his career atFlamengoand hopes to return before this summer’s World Cup. The Brazilian Série A club are likely to test West Ham’s resolve this month. Links with Tottenham have been played down by the player’s camp.It remains to be seen whether West Ham have a change of heart and decide there is little upside to forcing Paquetá to stay. Paquetá’s form has dipped since the FA’s investigation into spot-fixing allegations came to light in 2023. The episode cost the playmakera move to Manchester Cityand is one of the reasons why he does not want to stay in England.West Ham are disappointed with Paquetá’s determination to leave given that they supported him during the investigation. However, the player has struggled to contain his emotions and boiled over during a2-0 defeat by Liverpoolin November. Paquetá picked up a ludicrous red card when he received two bookings in quick succession for dissent. He lateraccused the FAof not providing him psychological support.A consideration for West Ham is whether they can reinvest a fee for Paquetá in their unbalanced squad this month. Resisting Aston Villa’s attempts to sign him last summer has not paid off. Paquetá has four goals and one assist in 18 league appearances this season and has grown weary of West Ham’s struggles.Nuno must decide whether he has enough in attack to sanction a sale. West Ham have signed Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos, who scored the winner against QPR. They have sold Luis Guilherme to Sporting, loaned Niclas Füllkrug to Milan and are expected torelease Callum Wilsonby mutual consent.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedFlamengonewsShareReuse this content"

But his double at Inter was a very solid startNicky BandiniMon 12 Jan 2026 08.29 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 10.54 ESTShareScott McTominay said recently that he hopes to carry on playing top-level football for another decade. And, if he does, will he ever have another year better than the last one? In 2025, he wonSerie Aand helped deliver Scotland to their first World Cup this century – scoring sensational goals in the games that sealed both achievements. He has described himself as “obsessive” when it comes to self-improvement, but some feats are hard to top.Still, if he was looking to set some intentions for 2026, there are worse places to do it than San Siro. On Sunday night, Napoli’s title defence would be severely tested away to Inter. But every time they strayed into danger, McTominay led them back out.Super Stuttgart sweep Leverkusen aside with in-demand Leweling to the fore | Andy BrassellRead moreWe might only be at the midway stage of this Serie A season, but the stakes already felt high. Inter, on a run of six straight league victories, had established a four-point lead over Napoli at the top. Milan’s draw away to Fiorentina earlier on Sunday meant they were two above their city rivals as well. A win for theNerazzurrihere would allow them to start pulling away.Recent history was against them. Inter have had a woeful record in the so-called “scontri diretti” – head-to-head games against their biggest domestic competitors. They had won none of their past 13 games against Napoli, Juventus and Milan combined.This time, though, felt different. Napoli are in the grip of an injury crisis, with David Neres – whose breakout performances over the past two months had been essential to sustaining their title defence – the latest addition to an absentee list that already included Kevin De Bruyne, Frank Anguissa, Romelu Lukaku and Billy Gilmour.Inter could scarcely ask for a better opportunity to get one over at last on a direct rival. When Federico Dimarco put them ahead in the ninth minute, materialising beside Marcus Thuram’s left shoulder to receive a no-look pass and bury an unstoppable finish into the far corner, it felt as though this must be the moment.View image in fullscreenFederico Dimarco fires home to open the scoring.Photograph: Alessio Morgese/NurPhoto/ShutterstockMcTominay had been at fault, his pocket picked by Piotr Zielinski at the start of the move. But this was also Christian Chivu’s side at their best, ruthlessly direct and all on the same page with their timing and movement. When Inter look like this, it can be tempting to wonder how anyone else stands a chance.The answer, this season, is often found at the other end of the pitch. This is not Simone Inzaghi’s Inter team of two years ago, who won the league conceding just 22 times. They are most of the way to matching that figure already in 2025-26. When Leonardo Spinazzola launched a raid down the left in the 26th minute, Luis Henrique and Alessandro Bastoni both allowed themselves to be drawn to him, neither tracking the run of Eljif Elmas inside. The first Napoli player fed the second, who cut a square ball back for McTominay to convert from the near corner of the six-yard box.Another sumptuous team move; another moment when we might need to remind ourselves that McTominay is not, in fact, a centre-forward. This was the sort of space you might expect to see attacked by a team’s No 9, not a central midfielder who has been forced – first by the arrival of De Bruyne, and more recently by Napoli’s injury crisis – to take on much greater defensive responsibilities this season than last.View image in fullscreenMcTominay grabs Napoli’s first equaliser against Inter.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APBut this is who McTominay has become in Naples, a relentless presence who seems to be in all places at once. The newspaper Il Corriere della Sera would compare him after this performance to a robot, though the online platform Il Napolista framed him as the opposite – a very human throwback to “once upon a time, when the role [of midfielder] demanded sweat and not storytelling”. Theyalso called him “Scott McKing”.His right to rule this weekend did not go unchallenged. After their equaliser, Napoli initially looked the more likely team to score again. Rasmus Højlund fired inches wide after being released with an opportunistic long pass by his goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic at the start of the second half.But a contentious penalty soon afterwards allowed Inter to reclaim their lead instead. It was a foul under current interpretations of the law, Amir Rrahmani making an honest play at the ball but ultimately following through and standing on the foot of Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Criticism of the decision stemmed more from familiar frustrations over the role of VAR. The referee Daniele Doveri had let play flow all game and appeared to have made his own judgment on this incident before being called to take a second look.A spot-kick was finally awarded. Antonio Conte responded by throwing a bottle, kicking a ball away and screaming “Vergognatevi!” – “You should be ashamed” repeatedly at the match officials, actions which predictably led to his being shown a red card.View image in fullscreenAntonio Conte lets out his delight as Scott McTominay scores Napoli’s second against Inter.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn the buildup to this game, some sections of the Italian press had sought to build up the rivalry between Chivu and Conte. The former was in charge at Parma last season during a bad-tempered 0-0 draw against thePartenopeiin the penultimate round that ended with both men being sent off. Chivu downplayed any acrimony at his pre-game press conference, saying a young manager like him could only learn from someone like Conte. “But we give too much weight to managers,” he added. “The real protagonists in football are the players and the fans.”By the time Hakan Calhanoglu smashed his penalty in off the post to make it 2-1 to Inter, the worry was that this would instead be another big occasion remembered for debates about the referee. The previous meeting between these two sides had seen Napoli awarded a less clearcut penalty. Conspiracy theories were starting to brew.View image in fullscreenHakan Calhanoglu, after putting Inter 2-1 ahead against Napoli.Photograph: Tiziano Ballabio/NurPhoto/ShutterstockBut this game was not finished. McTominay had more left to say. He appeared to have been fouled when Matteo Politano served a cross into the Inter box from the right in the 81st minute, held down by a defender to prevent him from jumping. This time, the lack of a whistle served him just fine.Noa Lang, introduced moments earlier as a Napoli substitute, barely managed to keep the ball in, hooking it back into the danger area as it was about to sail out for a goal-kick. McTominay met it with a first-time volley to level the scores again at 2-2. Another goal that a centre-forward might be proud of. And enough to secure a point. Inter did hit the post through Mkhitaryan in stoppage time, but the draw felt a fair result.View image in fullscreenScott McTominay levels the match up again.Photograph: Marco Luzzani/Getty ImagesOn paper, it was not a bad outcome for either team. Inter might feel more frustrated, having led in the second half, but they did ultimately maintain their advantage this weekend over both their closest rivals. Napoli, meanwhile, did enough to stay in the hunt, at the moment when they had appeared most vulnerable.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowInter 2-2 Napoli, Verona 0-1 Lazio, Fiorentina 1-1 Milan, Lecce 1-2 Parma, Atalanta 2-0 Torino, Roma 2-0 Sassuolo, Como 1-1 Bologna, Udinese 2-2 Pisa.Photograph: Paolo Giuliani/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This team will not give in or back down one millimetre,” said McTominay in a post-game interview. “Imagine if Inter were without Thuram, Lautaro Martínez, Nicolò Barella, Calhanoglu …”The only player Napoli might truly not be able to do without was the one speaking.

Janssen said: “Phallon [Tullis-Joyce] went down for us to discuss tactical changes,” when asked about how United adapted to going down to 10 players. Marc Skinner later said that Tullis-Joyce had felt something and needed treatment, but Renée Slegers said perceived time-wasting was “frustrating for the players”, adding: “There’s so many people investing so much to come and watch us, in the stadium, on TV. I think the product needs to be attractive and I think this is probably one of the areas that brings the entertainment down a little bit.”Tom GarryMatch report:Arsenal 0-0 Manchester UnitedManchester City not letting up in title fightThe winter break has done little to stunt Manchester City’s rhythm as Andrée Jeglertz’s side continued to show their dynamism in their 2-0 victory over Everton. City have scored 10 more goals than anyone else in the WSL and you only need to look at the stats on Sunday to see their attacking dominance – 32 shots made, 13 on target and xG of 4.27. The return to form of Kerolin, in particular, caught the eye. With Khadija Shaw having an unusually quiet day in front of goal, the Brazilian stepped up to inject pace and cause Everton constant problems. Though Shaw could not get on the scoresheet herself, her relationship with Vivianne Miedema is becoming almost telepathic as they linked up sublimely for City’s second. Everton’s defensive resolve was also apparent with Courtney Brosnan starring once again – the Irish goalkeeper made 11 saves to keep the scoreline respectable.Sophie DowneyEarly room for improvement with MaestreThe newLondon City Lionesseshead coach, Eder Maestre, urged his team to develop more of a “winning mentality” after they dropped points in a goalless draw against the bottom side, Liverpool. The newly promoted team failed to register any shots on target at the BrewDog Stadium and missed out on the chance to close on the top five. Maestre admitted he was disappointed with his first game in charge and vowed to improve the overall attitude of his squad: “The feeling is not good, obviously. Of course we want to win, we came here to win. The first thing we need to build is the mentality of winning every day. This is a little disappointing to not get the result that we wanted.”Emillia HawkinsGuarino suffers from earring-gate and defeatEvery day is a school day as Rita Guarino and Estelle Cascarino found out at Kingsmeadow. The France international was ready to come on for her West Ham debut at half-time but, after significant delay, was prevented from doing so due to an unmovable earring. It caused surprise for the new head coach as Cascarino had played with the jewellery taped up in Italy and the Champions League but the letter of the law was upheld by the officials. It did little to help a nightmare afternoon for the Hammers who endured a punishing first half against a refreshed Chelsea side. This time of year is when the Blues have historically burst into life and their four first-half goals were a clear statement of intent as Sonia Bompastor’s side ultimately won 5-0 as they try to eat into City’s six-point advantage at the top.SDView image in fullscreenEstelle Cascarino could not make her West Ham debut due to an earring she could not take out.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersMatch report:Chelsea 5-0 West HamNightmare return for NevilleAshleigh Neville’s homecoming was the story as Tottenham edged Leicester 1-0 through the defender’s own goal, just days after she left Spurs. After almost a decade and 191 appearances for the Lilywhites, Neville was straight back at her old ground on debut for Leicester and initially did little wrong. She tidied early danger and even threatened to score, firing wide from 25 yards after a loose pass. The decisive moment came before the break: Eveliina Summanen’s inswinging corner caused confusion, Neville colliding with the Leicester goalkeeper, Olivia Clark, as the ball glanced off her head and in. It proved the only goal of the game. Full time brought sympathy, Spurs honouring their long-serving stalwart as fans chanted her name.Mitul SamjiVilla show new resilience after costly errorAston Villa’s 2-1 victory over Brighton was shaped less by their goals than by how they responded to an early setback. Attempting to play out from the back, Villa’s goalkeeper Sabrina D’Angelo gifted possession straight to Brighton’s Fuka Tsunoda who capitalised to give the visitors the lead. Rather than unravelling, Villa showed composure and increased their intensity to turn the match on its head with two goals in quick succession. The comeback marked the first time Villa have won a WSL match after conceding the opening goal since March 2025, a telling indicator of progress. Natalia Arroyo praised her team’s resilience: “It’s about what you do after a mistake. We want to be brave, take this risk. The players were showing bravery in and out of possession and we were able to build three important points.”Réshma RaoPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1224332Chelsea Women1218273Arsenal Women1213234Tottenham Hotspur Women121235Man Utd Women1211226Aston Villa Women12-3167London City Lionesses12-7168Brighton & Hove Albion Women120149Leicester Women12-14910Everton Women12-10811West Ham Women12-20512Liverpool FC Women12-134Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenArsenal WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenManchester United WomenAston Villa WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 28-year-old, who has already won the world and UK titles, reeled off four consecutive half-centuries as he cruised to a 6-2 victory against Gary Wilson at Alexandra Palace.He told the BBC: “I could see a lot of fans supporting me so I feel very confident and I didn’t want to lose. This is my first win at Alexandra Palace.”Zhao is the third Chinese player in the last eight and he will play John Higgins or Barry Hawkin, who play on Tuesday night.Explore more on these topicsSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

But the 35-year-old told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday she has been ready to retire for three months, after realising her competitive drive was gradually ebbing away.“Every contest I wanted to be a part of and wanted to compete and it’s probably drained me a bit more over the years,” Healy said. “The opportunity to finish at home is something I really wanted to do.”India’s World Cup win can set a new world order in women’s cricket – if it spends money wisely | Raf NicholsonRead moreHer final match is set to be the sole Test of the series against India in Perth from 6 to 9 March. Healy insisted the prospect of stepping away was not worrying her and instead was looking forward to a rousing send-off.“When it comes to retirement, it’s quite daunting for a lot of people, but standing here right now, I’m really excited,” she said.The toll of repeatedly coming back from injuries was getting harder as her career wore on. Persevering through to the T20 World Cup, in England in June-July, would not have felt right while she was lacking some of her drive.“We’re able to take the group and lead this next generation into doing their own thing,” Healy said.Expanding a burgeoning media career could also be on the cards for Healy, who has proven one of the most popular commentators this summer for FoxCricketalongside co-hosting her popular podcast.View image in fullscreenHealy interviews her husband Mitchell Starc at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAShe has previously mentioned her desire to start a family with her husband, fellow cricketer Mitchell Starc, but on Tuesday was non-committal about her immediate plans.“I’ve been fortunate enough to have had a lot of opportunities outside of the game in the last 12 to 18 months,” she said. “But I still feel like I can contribute to the game ... it’s given me so much and I still owe a lot to cricket.”Healy will finish with more than 7000 international runs and 275 dismissals to her name. She is likely to end her career on 299 international matches after ruling out participating in the T20 games against India so as not to impact World Cup preparations, where Australia will have a new captain.Ashleigh Gardner and Tahlia McGrath are the main contenders to replace Healy as skipper, with Beth Mooney, Annabel Sutherland and Phoebe Litchfield other options.The Queenslander was awarded the 2019 Belinda Clark Award and was twice named ICC Women’s T20I Cricketer of the Year. Alongside Lanning and Ellyse Perry, Healy was one of the key leaders of Australia’s all-conquering era who took the women’s game to new heights.She was player of the final in the Australia’s 2022 ODI World Cup triumph and also played in six T20 World Cup-winning campaigns.“Alyssa is one of the all-time greats of the game and has made an immeasurable contribution both on and off the field over her 15-year career,” said Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg.“On behalf of Australian Cricket, I’d like to thank Alyssa and congratulate her on an incredible career that has inspired so many and changed the game for the better.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Last January, they were returning from Wichita, Kansas, host of the 2025 US championships, along with 26 others connected to figure skating, when their plane collided with a military helicopter,killing everyone onboard both aircraft.Maxim Naumov said he talked with his parents regularly about following in their footsteps in becoming an Olympian.“I would not be sitting here without the unimaginable work, effort and love from my parents,” Naumov said on Sunday. “It means absolutely everything to me, fulfilling the dream that we collectively had as a family since I first was on the ice at five years old. So it means absolutely everything. And I know they’re looking down, smiling and proud.”He will compete in men’s singles with world champion Ilia Malinin, fresh offhis fourth straight national title. Malinin will be the prohibitive favorite to follow in the footsteps of Nathan Chen by delivering another men’s gold medal for the American squad when he steps on the ice at the Milano Ice Skating Arena.‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreIce dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who won their record-setting seventh US title on Saturday night, also will be among the Olympic favorites, as will world champion Alysa Liu and women’s teammate Amber Glenn, who wonher third consecutive national titleat the weekend.“I’m just so excited for the Olympic spirit, the Olympic environment,” Malinin said. “Hopefully go for that Olympic gold.”Malinin will be joined on the men’s side by Naumov and Andrew Torgashev, the all-or-nothing 24-year-old from Coral Springs, Florida.Chock and Bates helped the Americans win team gold at the Beijing Games four years ago, but they finished fourth in the ice dance competition. They have hardly finished anywhere but first in the years since, winning three consecutive world championships and the gold medal at three straight Grand Prix Finals.US silver medalists Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik also made the dance team, as did the Canadian-born Christina Carreira, who became eligible for the Olympics in November when her American citizenship came through, and Anthony Ponomarenko.Liu was picked for her second Olympic team after briefly retiring following the Beijing Games.She had been burned outby years of practice and competing, but stepping away seemed to rejuvenate the 20-year-old, and she returned to win the first world title by an American since Kimmie Meissner stood atop the podium two decades ago.Now, the avant-garde Liu will be trying to help Team USA win their first women’s medal since Sasha Cohen in Turin in 2006, and the first gold medal since Sarah Hughes triumphed four years earlier at the Salt Lake City Games.Liu’s biggest competition, besides a powerful Japanese contingent, could come from her own teammates: Glenn, a first-time Olympian, has been nearly unbeatable the past two years, while 18-year-old Isabeau Levito is a former world silver medalist.“This was my goal and my dream and it just feels so special that it came true,” said Levito, whose mother is originally from Milan.The two pairs spots went to Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea, the US silver medalists, and the team of Emily Chan and Spencer Howe.The top American pairs team, two-time reigning US champions Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, were hoping that the Finnish-born Efimova would get her citizenship approved in time to compete in Italy. But despite efforts by the Skating Club of Boston, where they train, and the help of their US senators, she did not receive her passport by the selection deadline.“The importance and magnitude of selecting an Olympic team is one of the most important milestones in an athlete’s life,” the US Figure Skating CEO, Matt Farrell, said, “and it has such an impact, and while there are sometimes rules, there is also a human element to this that we really have to take into account as we make decisions and what’s best going forward from a selection process. Sometimes these aren’t easy, and this is not the fun part.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamUS sportsWashington DC plane crashnewsShareReuse this content"

As the UK’s independent online safety enforcement agency, it’s important we make sure our investigations are legally robust and fairly decided.”Speaking to MPs in the Commons, Kendall said:“The content which has circulated on X is vile. It’s not just an affront to decent society, it is illegal.”She added: “X does not have to wait for the Ofcom investigation to conclude – they can choose to act sooner to ensure this abhorrent and illegal material cannot be shared on their platform.“If they do not, Ofcom will have the backing of this government to use the full powers which parliament has given them … this includes the power to issue fines of up to 10% of a company’s worldwide qualifying revenue and, in the most serious cases, Ofcom can apply for a court order to stop UK users accessing the site.”She added that ministers would also bring into force a new law that would make it illegal to create nonconsensual intimate images, as well as to share them.Campaigners last weekaccused ministersof dragging their heels over enforcing the new law, which was originally passed last June.Sharing intimate image abuse online is illegal under the OSA, which also requires that pornography is age gated. Companies are also required to have systems in place to prevent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) from appearing and to take it down quickly if it is posted on a platform.Ofcom said it had “urgently” made contact with X about its concerns last Monday. Having considered X’s response about the steps it has taken to comply with the act, Ofcom said it had opened a formal investigation after an “expedited” assessment carried out as a “matter of urgency”.The watchdog is focusing on whether X has breached the act in the following ways:Failing to assess the risk of people seeing illegal content on the platform.Not taking appropriate steps to prevent users from viewing illegal content such as intimate image abuse and CSAM.Not taking down illegal material quickly.Not protecting users from breaches of privacy law.Failing to assess the risk X may pose to children.Not using effective age checking for pornography.Grok has been integrated into X, and an update of the AI tool has allowed users to prompt it to alter clothed images of women and children by making them appear in bikinis and sexually suggestive poses.Ofcom has a range of options in terms of punishments under the act including, in extreme cases, effectively blocking an app or website by applying to a court for “business disruption measures” – such as requiring internet service providers to block access to a site in the UK.On Friday the government said it would support Ofcomif it decided X should be effectively banned.Ofcom said it would gather evidence on whether a breach had occurred. If it decides a breach has taken place, it will announce this in a provisional decision before making a final ruling. The regulator did not give exact details on how long the investigation would take.Jess Asato, a Labour MP and campaigner against AI nudification, said the abuse was still happening to her on X as of Monday morning.She said explicit and degrading images were being created using the Grok app – which is also available separately from X – and other AI apps and posted on X, because she was speaking against Musk’s platform.“It’s still happening to me and being posted on X because I speak up about it,” she said. “Thankfully it’s just bikinis, no one has properly nudified me yet. Just this morning someone has made me a tradwife with a massive pregnant tummy.“It’s like they’re saying, this is where you should be, this is your role, you should be a baby birthing machine. This has disturbed me, weirdly more than the bikini pictures.”Some MPs have been pushing for the government to exit the platform in protest, but Kendall said ministers were not planning to take such action – though she added that it remained an option in future.“With 19 million people on X in this country, and more than a quarter of them saying that they use it as their primary source of news, our views – and often simply the facts – need to be heard wherever possible,” she said.Explore more on these topicsXAI (artificial intelligence)InternetOfcomRegulatorsElon MuskWomennewsShareReuse this content"

It found media executives around the world fear search engine referrals will fall by 43% over three years.‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at riskRead moreSearch traffic to news sites has already plunged by a third in a single year globally, with the rise of AI overviews and chatbots, as well as changes to the search algorithms that have been the lifeblood of some media companies since the rise of the internet.Google search is down 33% globally, according to new data for more than 2,500 news sites sourced by Chartbeat. The figure is even higher for the US.Lifestyle, celebrity and travel content is being much more heavily affected than current affairs and news outlets so far. Publications carrying out live reporting and current affairs are more protected from AI summaries.Google’s AI Overviews already appear at the top of about 10% of search results in the US, according to the report, and are rapidly rolling out elsewhere. Referrals to media sites from ChatGPT are growing, but the report still described these referrals as “little more than a rounding error”.Nic Newman, senior research associate at the institute, said the “traffic era” for online publishers, which had sustained them since the advent of the internet, was coming to an end.“It is not clear what comes next,” he said. “Publishers fear that AI chatbots are creating a new convenient way of accessing information that could leave news brands – and journalists – out in the cold.“But tech platforms do not hold all the cards. Reliable news, expert analysis and points of view remain important both to individuals and to society, particularly in uncertain times. Great storytelling – and a human touch – is going to be hard for AI to replicate.”There has already been a swing away from simply trying to score big hits through web traffic – with fewer people clicking on a link to a story. Instead, more companies have moved towards a subscription model that gives them a direct relationship with their audience.The Reuters Institute report also revealed a scramble among media companies to invest in digital platforms like YouTube and TikTok as short-form video use continues to grow. Many also want to encourage their journalists to embrace the content creator culture that the platforms have popularised.Three-quarters of media managers surveyed said they will be trying to get their staff to behave more like creators in 2026. Half are planning to partner with creators to help distribute their content.Downing Street is also trying to tap into social media as Keir Starmer attempts to find ways of reaching Gen Z and bypass the traditional media.The campaigner Anna Whitehouse, who goes by Mother Pukka, and the personal finance influencersCameron SmithandAbi Fosterhave all been given access to senior ministers in recent months.Explore more on these topicsDigital mediaNewspapersInternetNewspapers & magazinesSearch enginesAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?Keza MacDonaldMon 12 Jan 2026 06.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 13.09 ESTShareLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, buteverythingwas painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.I’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.Traditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.In August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit startedmock-ritually-sacrificingeach other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. AndI love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.Silksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.The journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.Except Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.Hornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.Hampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games areverystressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.Unexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.You can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.Indeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.Giving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one buttwoprecious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.Difficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. Youcanalways win. You just have to try hard enough.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.I did not know that Icoulddo things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.After four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksonghashelped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

On Wednesday Brussels is due to outline the terms of the €90bn loan it has promised to Ukraine, amid internal tensions over whether Kyiv can use the money to buy US as well as EU weapons. On the same day, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is due tomeetministers from Denmark and Greenland, as Donald Trump continues toinsistthat the US will take ownership of the latter “one way or another”. And as the body count of protesters rises in Iran, the EU is under mounting pressure to do more than merely “monitor” the situation, as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, somewhat feebly put it over the weekend.Beyond the crisis management, a deeper reckoning is overdue after a tumultuous beginning to 2026. It has long been atruismthat there is a profound mismatch between the EU’s economic heft and its geopolitical clout. But only a year into Mr Trump’s second term, the disjunction looks unsustainable in the “America first” era.As the US president has thrown his weight around across the globe, EU leaders have trailed in the slipstream of events, seeking to mollify and appease Mr Trump in order to preserve what is left of the transatlantic alliance. Given the pivotal importance of the US in guaranteeing Ukraine’s future security, this has perhaps been an understandable strategy of mitigation. But if the EU is to properly assert and protect itself, and project its values in a menacing multipolar world, it needs to start acting with the self-confidence and clarity that should come naturally to an economicsuperpowerwhose GDP dwarfs that of Russia.Some of the problems are structural. The time has surely come, for example, to address the decision-making processes of a union comprising 27 member states, in which the veto mechanism frequently allows small minorities to block decisive action. But the challenge is also one of changing a political mindset that has been both too timid and too complacent regarding internal and external threats.There is already general agreement over the need to accelerate investment in the kind ofhard powerthat the EU previously relied on the US to provide. Europe is playing a belated game of military catch-up that leaves it vulnerable to bullying in the meantime. But instead of raising the money by cutting public spending in other areas, the bolstering of a distinctive social model should become a twin priority. The rise of national populism across the continent – which Mr Trump and his Maga acolytes hope will eventually tear the EU apart – is intimatelylinkedto disillusionment associated with rising inequality and post-crash austerity. Strengthening social solidarity, as well as armies, is key to Europe’s future.The Covid pandemic demonstrated that, when confronted with a health emergency, the EU couldmobiliseits vast collective resources creatively, ambitiously and successfully. Its leaders should show the same flexibility and determination now, leveraging the power of a union comprising 450 million people to stand up for liberal democratic principles that the White House and Vladimir Putin hold in contempt. That may ultimately mean “more Europe”, in the sense of greater integration in relation to security and the economy. The unpalatable alternative is a dangerously weak one in predatory times.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The chair ofthe US Federal Reserveresponded tonews of a subpoena from the US Department of Justicewith a statement that was extraordinary, necessary and stark.A criminal investigation into the Fed, and him personally, over the renovation of the central bank’s headquarters is an attempt to bully officials into setting policy according to the president’s whims,said Powell.“This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” he said.Justice department opens investigation into Jerome Powell as Trump ramps up campaign against Federal ReserveRead moreIt definitely needed to be spelled out. It is one thing forDonald Trumpto whine and hurl insults – Powell has previously been called a “stubborn mule” for not cutting interest rates faster – or even fantasise in public about firing him. But it is a different order of seriousness if the DoJ is involved, even if Trump denied knowledge of its investigation.On day one, financial markets took a ho-hum view of a scene that could come from a banana republic. The dollar weakened, but only slightly, and US treasuries suffered modest selling pressure.The sanguine reaction probably flows from a few factors. First, this affair could fizzle out. An overspend on the refurbishment of a public building hardly seems like the stuff of criminal charges.Second, Powell’s term ends in May. Third, a whole Fed committee sets rates so, if Powell’s current colleagues prize their independence as he does, Trump can’t impose his will overnight even if he picks a tame poodle as the next chair.Fourth, the Fed is in cutting mode on rates currently anyway, so the policy quarrel is about pace rather than a more fundamental “up or down” question.Yet Powell is plainly right to sound the alarm because it is not hard to imagine how tensions could escalate, especially if the next debate on rates is more basic. This is a perilous moment for the US to mess with the principle that rate-setters under an independent system should be free of political pressure – and be seen to be so.1:59US Federal Reserve chair says DOJ has threatened criminal indictment – videoThe US is running an enormous fiscal deficit, and the data on unemployment and prices is giving mixed signals. While the headline growth numbers are still decent, momentum is slowing.One can also question how much work is being done by the boom in spending on AI, which is vulnerable (possibly) if returns on capital don’t match the promoters’ hype. Complicating matters further, the medium-term effect on inflation of Trump’s tariff policies will only start to become clearer this year.Owners of US assets and US bonds, you can be sure, would want the country’s central bank to anchor inflation expectations firmly. “A combination of hot inflation and more bets on the Fed’s loss of independence would feed real rate concerns that could cause major dollar depreciation,” say ING’s currency analysts.You bet. The dollar fell last year on a trade-weighted basis. Any flight from US assets would only increase, via the bond markets, long-term borrowing costs for US businesses and consumers.Therein lies the self-defeating aspect of wrecking confidence in US monetary policymaking, as wiser heads in the Republican party understood on Monday.Does Trump himself recognise how undermining the Fed would backfire on him, and the US? For now, markets seem to cling to the idea that he does – and that he will push things only so far.That assumption, though, remains untested and smacks of complacency given that the administration’s war on the Fed has been running for a year. A pre-emptive revolt in US bond markets would be useful at this point.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveNils Pratley on financeJerome PowellDonald TrumpStock marketsBondsUS economyInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

Here are a fewDave SchillingThis could be your year to worry less about your waistline and spend more time at the moviesMon 12 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.16 ESTShareWe are now more than aweek into 2026, and it might shock you to know I’m feeling quite cheery. All the professional emails I’ve waited a month to send are out. The grout in my shower is scum-free. The music at the pharmacy is normal again. If you’re like me, and you find the holiday season a grim and lonely time that involves too much booze, too much food, too much Mariah Carey and not enough routine, the start of the new year is more than welcome.The one thing that dampens my cheer at being dragged back to my desk for the comfort of drudgery – besides the endless and brutal news headlines – is the New Year’s resolution. The tradition of picking a few things to promise yourself to do (or not do) in the spirit of wellness iscenturies old, dating back as far as 2000BC. Not sure what the Babylonians were resolving to do. Tidy up the storage closet in the ziggurat? Finally finish that tower they’d been thinking about? Try not to get sold into slavery (again)?Most modern New Year’s resolutions are a cause for misery – they’re either things you can’t do (losing weight) or things you don’t want to do (calling your mother more often). They put a dark cloud over what should ideally be a time for reveling in the joy of not being dead yet. How about a few New Year’s resolutions that are positive and easily attainable? I can think of some for you so you don’t have to.1 Seemoremovies in atheaterLook, if you can’t afford this, I understand. Movie theaters are constantly looking to shake coins from your pocket like a demented leprechaun on methamphetamines. The cost of a movie hotdog is challenging the cost of the blood pressure medicine you need after eating a movie hotdog. Yet, there is nothing more life-affirming or meditative than seeing a quality film in the company of other people. As a great woman once said: “We come here for magic.” There’s no shortage of spectacular cinema to enjoy without the impulse to scroll Instagram at the same time. Hamnet, Marty Supreme, No Other Choice, even the latest Avatar sequel. You don’t have to go every week, but at least remember that the cost of your ticket preserves one of the last remaining collective artistic rituals we have left in our techno-dystopia.2 StartdressingbetterFor some, this might fall into the categories of “things you can’t do” or “things you don’t want to do”. Not everyone has a sense of style, or even wants one. But I can assure you, speaking as a bit of a clothes horse, the feeling of taking care of your appearance can change how you perceive yourself for the better. I wear a suit most days, but you don’t have to do that. I’m not asking you to transform yourself into David Beckham or something awful like that. Just think about it more. Care about where your clothes come from, and if they’re made sustainably. Consider color, texture and fit. Even just for a moment. Dressing with intention is a hell of a lot easier than dropping 15lb, and can have a similar effect on your self-esteem. Besides, if you actually do lose all that weight, you’ll have to buy new clothes anyway.3 Startrandomlyputtingyourname onthings fornoreasonIt seems to be working nicely for Donald Trump,whose fanssmeared his name on the Kennedy Centerlast year. For decades, he’s been placing his name on buildings, a university, a line of steaks and shoddily made merchandise. You, too, can luxuriate in a tiny drop of narcissism with ease. Get monogrammed pajamas. Put up a sign on your house that says: “[Insert name] Lives Here.” Wear a name tag so strangers can easily identify you. Sign the bill at a restaurant in easily readable block letters. Get a tattoo of your birth certificate on your back. Never forget who you are, even if you want to.4 Stopworryingaboutwhat’s in the McRibFor some unknown reason, Americans can’t stop fixating on what is actually inside the McRib patty at McDonald’s. Perhaps because this sugary delivery system for mystery chemicals disappears for large swaths of the year, a fascination with the sandwich has persisted like an unwelcome party guest. Now, McDonald’s faces aclass-action lawsuit alleging that the fast-food company is deceiving its customersby claiming the McRib has actual rib meat in it. If you’re worried about the contents of an unnaturally shaped processed patty smothered in barbecue sauce, I would like to request you remember the good people of Babylon, who couldn’t even dream of an indulgence of the magnitude of a McRib. First of all, I don’t think they even had pickles back then. Second, all of their food had sand in it. Third, the concept of a drive-thru was not invented yet.My final resolution for you is to forget the things that don’t matter and focus on the things that do. Your loved ones, your health and seeing art. What else is left to do?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsNew yearOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Iraqis in the audience broke out in cheers, leapt up from their seats and pumped their fists in the air – many had waited decades for that moment. “This is a great day in Iraq’s history,” Bremer said, adding: “The tyrant is a prisoner.”I was in the audience that day in Baghdad, covering the Iraq invasion’s aftermath as a correspondent for a US newspaper. It quickly became clear that Bremer and other jubilant US officials would use the occasion –US soldiers draggedthe disheveled former Iraqi dictator out of a hole in the ground where he had been hiding near his home town – to declare that America’s war had reached a decisive turn. Despite a growing insurgency led by ex-members of the Iraqi security forces, US officials in Baghdad and Washington projected confidence that victory was in sight now that Saddam was locked up and headed for the gallows.That turned out to be wishful thinking, as the Iraq war and insurgency dragged on for years. Saddam’s capture was ultimately a minor blip – and the first in a series of “we got him” episodes, where US officials would celebrate the arrest or killing of an insurgent orjihadist leaderas a turning point, only to be further embroiled in a grinding conflict that destroyed Iraqi society and cost America enormous blood and treasure.I thought of Bremer’s gleeful declaration as I watched Donald Trump announce on 3 January that US forces hadattacked Venezuelaand seized its president, Nicolás Maduro, whisking him to New York to stand trial on drugs, weapons and “narco-terrorism” charges. Trump didn’t have a pithy quote lined up as Bremer had done, but the president struck a triumphalist tone as he expounded on the US military’s ability to carry out more attacks and warned other Venezuelan leaders that they too could be targeted. “All political and military figures in Venezuela should understand what happened to Maduro can happen to them,”Trump saidat his press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, adding: “The dictator and terrorist Maduro is finally gone in Venezuela. People are free, they’re free again.”The rush of a quick, and seemingly clean, military operation that leads to the capture or killing of a despot is a powerful photo op inUS politics. Yet the subsequent hangover instigated by regime change can be long, bloody and destabilizing.Of course, Venezuela is not Iraq and the US intervention unfolding in Caracas is different, with no US troops on the ground and no imminent plans for an American occupation. But even in these early days, Trump is repeating the mistakes that George W Bush’s administration made in Iraq. Aside from Trump’s vague statements that the US would “run” Venezuela for an unspecified transitional period, it seems his administration has donelittle or no planningfor the “day after” scenarios once Maduro was removed from power. On 4 January, a day after Trump declared he would take control of Venezuela, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to backpedal that assertion.Rubio saidthe US would not try to govern Venezuela day-to-day, but instead the US military would enforce a quarantine on the country’s oil shipments that Trump had imposed before Maduro’s ouster.During the Bush administration, the secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, along with other neocons who led the charge to invade Iraq,undermined Pentagon officialswho tried to draft plans to secure and rebuild the country after the invasion. They also discarded a state department initiative, called the Future of Iraq Project, which tried to plan forpostwar scenarios.Trump’s haphazard Venezuela policy has other echoes of US failures in Iraq: his administration is underestimating polarization and thepotential for political violencewithin Venezuelan society, and Trump is eager to claim that oil revenues would recoup the costs of a more extensive US intervention. Trump has long been obsessed with the idea that to the victor belong the spoils. “We should have kept the oil in Iraq,”he has complainedfor years. Now, Trumpkeeps suggestingthat Venezuela’s vast petroleum reserves – the largest in the world at more than 300bn barrels – will underwrite the costs of military intervention andsubsequent rebuilding.Trump is resurrecting one of the Iraq war’s biggest myths – that an oil-rich country can pay for its own occupation and reconstruction. “The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50bn and $100bn over the course of the next two or three years,” Wolfowitz confidentlytold Congressin 2003. “We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.”It did not turn out that way. After years of international sanctions and mismanagement under the Baathist regime, Iraq’s oil infrastructure was dilapidated and needed billions of dollars in investment. It took until 2009, six years after the US invasion, for Iraq to provide security guarantees andattract investmentfrom multinational oil companies that brought production levels back to those under Saddam’s rule. And many US energy firms stayed away from investing in Iraq’s oil sector for two decades, until the Iraqi government offeredmore favorable dealslast year.In the end, the US spent far more than the $50bn to $60bn theBush administration projectedit would need to overthrow the Iraqi regime and install a new government. In 2023, on the 20th anniversary of the US invasion, theCosts of War projectestimated that the conflict in Iraq (along with neighboring Syria, where the US intervened in 2014 to fight Islamic State militants that had emerged from Iraq) had cost Washington nearly $2.9tn. Aside from funding directed to the Pentagon to carry out military operations, that staggering figure also includes spending by the state department; interest on US debt incurred over 20 years; and healthcare costs for US veterans.And yet Trump is hanging on to his fantasy that a large-scale US intervention in, or occupation of, Venezuela would pay for itself. “It won’t cost us anything because the money coming out of the ground is very substantial,”Trump saidat his Mar-a-Lago press conference. He added: “We’re going to get reimbursed for everything that we spend.”Never mind that the Chavista regime under the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, hasdeployed armed militiasto patrol streets and run checkpoints across Caracas to crack down on any potential dissent. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is crumbling and needs tens of billions of dollars in investment. One research firm estimated that the Venezuelan government and oil companies would need to investmore than $180bnover a decade to restore the country’s production back to its levels in the late 1990s, when it pumped about 3m barrels a day. Today, Venezuela produces a third of that output.By openly announcing his desire to seize control of Venezuela’s oil revenue, Trump has stripped away the veneer of benevolence that usually accompanies US military interventions. But the country’s oil riches will provide far fewer spoils than he’s counting on.And while Trump can bask in the glory of a quick military operation that captured his nemesis Maduro, the US president risks unleashing his own series of “we got him” moments – hollow victories that can’t overcome the chaos and bloodshed of failed regime change.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaOpinionVenezuelaTrump administrationIraqDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

From Venezuela to Greenland, the world is unmistakably moving away from the relative stability of the post-cold war era – not least also because of Russia’s war against Ukraine.This erosion of long-established norms has severe implications forEurope, a continent whose core political philosophy is built on limiting (national) power. A rules-based order, international law and negotiated solutions lie at the core of Europe’s self-image. Yet in today’s world, Europe can uphold this vision only if it evolves into a more muscular geopolitical actor itself – and nowhere is this more evident than in the Arctic.Once regarded as a zone of peace, the Arctic has moved to the centre of geopolitical competition amid an expanding US footprint, Russia’s longstanding presence and China’s emergence as a global power. For Europe, this should not come as a surprise. The region is hardly a new frontier; the EU alreadyhas a presence therethrough its three Nordic member states: the Kingdom of Denmark (without Greenland), Finland, and Sweden. Indeed, the European Arctic’s vast resource wealth – from hydrocarbons to critical minerals and marine proteins – already forms part of Europe’s economic backbone and could further shape the continent’s strategic autonomy in the future.Yet despite anevolving EU Arctic policy since 2008, and similar policy efforts by the bigger EU governments, the broader circumpolar north has remained largely absent from European strategic security debates. Its very peace and stability offered few reasons for deeper European engagement.US will have Greenland ‘one way or the other’, says Trump – Europe liveRead moreTrump’s renewed interest in Greenland may change this picture, as illustrated by thejoint statementissued on 6 January by France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK and Denmark, followed by a similar declaration byNordic foreign ministers. Unsurprisingly, however, EU leaders and institutions have largely responded with silence or restraint, with representatives either unable or unwilling toaddress questions on Greenland, or resorting toempty statements on social media. Tellingly, in her annualstate of the union addressin September last year, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, made no reference to the Arctic – or to Greenland – an omission that underscoresthe internal challengesthe “Arctic” has long faced within the EU’s institutional framework.At the same time, as the European Commission and the European External Action Servicebegin updating the EU’s Arctic policy, the moment calls for a more fundamental question: what does northern Europe actually mean for the EU? Following the termination of theNorthern Dimension(a cooperation format that involved the EU, Norway, Iceland and Russia) and amid renewed transatlantic turbulence, Europe needs a new strategic vision – one that redefines its role in a wider European north. This vision should build on the 25-year legacy ofthe Northern Dimensionand nearly two decades of EU Arctic policymaking, while responding to today’s geopolitical upheavals and clearly articulating an EU strategic counterproposal for the region.Here, the EU’s strength lies not in domination but in convening: bringing EU and non-EU actors together on an equal footing to shape a shared regional agenda rather than ceding influence to the nearest strongmen. For decades, north Atlantic countries have relied onaccess to the EU’s internal marketas a guarantor of rules-based trade and economic stability. With the USstepping back from free trade leadership, the EU remains the central anchor of economic order in the region.Such a counterproposal must go beyond existing jurisdictionand assert a stronger political claim to the European north, including non-EU partners such as Norway, Iceland,Greenland, the UK and potentially Canada. As this broader region shifts from zones of peace to spaces shaped by tension, Europe must translate its normative influence into operational capacity.And this is where Greenland comes in. As debates increasingly revolve around acquiring – or even occupying – the island, Europe’s lack of a counterproposal is striking. This should be the moment to explicitly offer EU membership to Greenland, and by extension to the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway – an idearecently raisedin the European parliament. Greenland withdrew from the then European Communities in 1985 after gaining home rule from Denmark in 1979, but in an entirely altered world, attitudes have changed and Europe should respond accordingly. A proposal to Greenland could be pragmatic and phased: EU membership by 2026 or 2027; early agreement on key issues such as fisheries, with renegotiation after five to 10 years; a substantial investment package targeting infrastructure and sustainable extraction of critical raw materials; and a clear commitment to preserving Inuit culture, language and local decision-making.This would constitute a concrete offer by a continent that must increasingly step beyond its comfort zone into the realm ofmachtpolitik(power politics). Even as the US asserts hegemonic influence, Europe’s role as convener could ensure that Greenland – and the broader Arctic – remains a space for multilateral coordination rather than unilateral domination. Trump’s politics are, in many ways, straightforward and should not come as a surprise; what has changed is Europe’s position – from ally to something closer to a strategic frenemy. It is time for European leaders to respond accordingly – and the Arctic may be the place to begin.Robert Habeck served as German vice-chancellor and minister for economy and climate action from 2021 to 2025, and is now working at the Danish Institute for International Studies.Andreas Raspotnik is the director of the High North Center for Business and Governance at Nord University and a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo, NorwayExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkNatoDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

But the evidence is clear: we’re making our streets saferMon 12 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 04.49 ESTShareLast year, something extraordinary happened inLondon. As the conversation about crime got even louder, London quietly reached the lowest per capita homicide rate in its recorded history. Even London’s harshest critics have to accept this is impressive progress.For too many, it will no doubt come as a surprise. In recent years, politicians and commentators have sought to spam our social media feeds with an endless stream of distortions and untruths – painting a dystopian picture of a lawless place where criminals run rampant.Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump has inexplicably veered between describing London as a citymoving towardssharia law, and a place with hospitalslike “warzones”and areas where police don’t want to go. Here in Britain, Nigel Farage is dancing to his tune. Reform UK’s leaderclaimed last weekthat London was “in the grip of a crime wave”. Meanwhile, the party’s new candidate for mayor of London claimed that people pitied Londoners for living in a city that was “no longer safe”.This latest startling statistic shows that those who talk down the capital at every opportunity couldn’t be more wrong: in London, the evidence is clear, we’re winning the battle against violent crime.This hasn’t happened by chance. It’s the outcome of a strategy we’ve pursued since the start of my first term as mayor: to be tough on violent crime, and tough on the complex causes of violent crime.We’vemore than doubledinvestment from City Hall in the Met, funding extra officers and giving them access to the cutting-edge technology they need to target our city’s most dangerous offenders. This is paying dividends. Police in the capital have arrested an extra 1,000 criminals every month, removed 3,750 guns and knives from our streets, and disrupted serious and organised crime groups more than 21,000 times. By closing almost 1,500 county lines operations, they’ve dismantled the violent gangs exploiting the most vulnerable Londoners and causing untold suffering.Enforcement will always be a key part of the solution, but we know we will never be able to simply arrest our way out of the problem – especially when it comes to tackling violence affecting young people. The causes of violent crime are extremely complex, involving deep-seated issues such as poverty, inequality and a lack of life chances for young people.That’s why I’ve invested millions in providing positive opportunities for young Londoners over the past decade, and it’s why I set up London’s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) – the first of its kind in England. Working closely with schools, charities, local councils and communities, the VRU has pioneered an approach rooted in prevention, providing more than 550,000 targeted interventions and opportunities to stop young people from getting caught up in violence and exploitation.The results of our two-pronged approach have been astonishing. London’s homicide rate is lower than rates in New York, Berlin, Brussels, Milan, Toronto and Paris, five times lower than the rate in LA, and almost 12 times lower than the rate in Chicago. Last year, the capital recorded the fewest number of homicides of victims aged under 25 this century. Our homicide rate for under-25s is now three times lower than it was when I set the VRU up in 2019, and hospital admissions of young people for knife assault have fallen by 43% in the same period.The success of our crackdown on violent crime means Londoners are safer in their homes and on our streets. For young people in the capital, the consequences are particularly profound. Every Londoner will remember the tragic story ofDamilola Taylor.A 10-year-old child full of hope for the future, Damilola was killed in 2000 by two schoolboysjust a little olderthan him. I remember being a new father at the time, unable to imagine how it would feel to lose a child so young – nor what could lead two boys to commit such a senseless act of violence.Last week, I visited the Damilola Taylor Centre in Peckham. It’s now home to a youth clubbacked by MyEnds, a City Hall-funded programme supporting young Londoners living in the capital’s most deprived neighbourhoods. In the gym, young people were boxing and playing football. In the common room upstairs, they were playing esports. Whether they were scoring goals on the pitch, learning self-defence in the ring or jostling for first place on the virtual podium, they’d all found a safe space where – with support from a brilliant team of mentors – they were free to be themselves. They were optimistic about the future, and ambitious about all the amazing things they hoped to achieve.Of course, there is still much more to do. As far as I’m concerned, one homicide in the capital will always be one too many. As long as there are Londoners left mourning loved ones whose lives have been stolen by violent crime, we must guard against complacency. But today’s news confirms that we’re on the right path. Our collapsing homicide rate shows that the real London story is not the one spread by loudmouths and alarmists intent on sowing fear and division – it’s the one I saw in Peckham.No one embodies that story better than Damilola Taylor’s parents. Having witnessed how alienation and apathy could drive teenagers towards violence, Richard and Gloria set up the Damilola Taylor Trust to give young Londoners the self-belief to dream of a better future – and the skills to make that dream a reality. Sadly, they are no longer with us. But we must keep on working to build the city they believed in – a safer London for everyone, and a place where no parent is forced to go through what they did.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

With alarming insouciance protests are being outlawed, free speech is being constrained and politicians are rushing through processes to ban phrases and slogans.Now religious leaders are to be policed, universities monitored, the public broadcaster scrutinised and the arts starved. Are you or have you ever been a critic of Israel? Joe McCarthy would be cheering on the inheritors of his tactics.Louise Adler resigns as director of Adelaide writers’ weekRead moreArtists have always been a problem for the state and interest groups but the confrontations have intensified as a consequence of the war on Gaza. Exploiting the rhetoric of social cohesion, crises have proliferated: the acceptance of Israeli government funding by the Sydney festival in 2022, thesanctioning of young actorsin keffiyehs at the Sydney Theatre Company,Jayson Gillham’s cancelled concert by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the initial removal ofKhaled Sabsabi as Australia’s representative at the Venice Biennale, the State Library of Victoria’scancellation of a teen writing program, thecollapse of the Bendigo writers’ festivaland a legion of arts organisations who have quietly yielded to pressure to program this artist and not program that artist.In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns.In 2023 AWWprogrammed a handful of sessions devoted to contemporary Palestinian writers. Propagandists leapt to exhume, misrepresent and misquote social media posts to cultivate the conditions for cancelling writers. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, took exception to one writer’s tweets, expressing his personal distaste, as was his right as a citizen in a democratic country.It was heartening then to listen to his subsequent speech to a packed Town Hall audience. He shared his thinking about the arts, their role in society and the responsibility of the government of the day. He confessed that he had thought of withdrawing our funding. And he concluded that if “politicians decide what is culturally appropriate … it leads us to a future in which politicians can directly stifle events that are themselves predicated on freedom of speech … it’s a path that leads us into the territory of Putin’s Russia”.His speech remains a model for political leaders confronted by art that might personally offend them, damage their electoral prospects or agitate noisy interest groups.The Adelaide festival board has nowcancelled my invitation to Abdel-Fattah, who was to discuss her latest novel, Discipline, because of concerns about “cultural sensitivity” – and the premierhas backed the decision. As a consequence, as at the time of writing, more than 180 writers have withdrawn.Three board members resign from Adelaide festival as Randa Abdel-Fattah sends legal noticeRead moreOne can only assume that in due course these concerns might also be cited by opponents of free speech to demand the cancellation or silencing of others who have demanded justice for Palestinian people, writers who include Kenneth Roth, Francesca Albanese and Najwan Darwish. Many years ago the former premier Don Dunstan touted Adelaide as the “Athens of the south”. Now South Australia’s tourism slogan could be “Welcome to Moscow on the Torrens”.The board’s statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism. This is a managerialist term intended to stop thinking. Who, after all, would argue in favour of social division? Presumably only a terrorist or a nihilist. The raison d’être of art and literature is to disrupt the status quo: and one doesn’t have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of “social cohesion” is propaganda.The arts have allegedly become “unsafe” and artists are a danger to the community’s psycho-social wellbeing. But, let’s be quite clear, the routine invocation of “safety” is code for “I don’t want to hear your opinion”. In this instance, it appears to apply only to a Palestinian invitee.The increasingly extreme and repressive efforts of pro-Israel lobbyists to stifle even the mildest criticism has had a chilling effect on free speech and democratic institutions. The new mantra “Bondi changed everything” has offered this lobby, its stenographers in the media and a spineless political class yet another coercive weapon. Hence, in 2026, the board, in an atmosphere of intense political pressure, has issued an edict that an author is to be cancelled.In the 65-year history of Adelaide writers’ week there have been no civil disturbances apart from the occasional harrumph about the coffee queues or the plaintive query as to why the croissants are filled with pumpkin. One might ask if any of the “concerned” individuals have ventured into the Pioneer Women’s Memorial Gardens, where more than 160,000 enthusiasts have congregated every year since 2023.Adelaide festival did not dump Jewish columnist from 2024 program despite request from Randa Abdel-Fattah and othersRead moreOf course there is no way to protect any of us anywhere from a lone violent extremist (although stronger gun laws are an obvious starting point). But the reality is that the citizens who come to AWW are intensely courteous (beyond the rush to claim a seat), listen with the utmost respect to writers and then head into the book tent to buy stacks of books.But none of this has influenced the decision: a writer is to be cancelled after pressure from pro-Israel lobbyists, bureaucrats and opportunistic politicians.I cannot be party to silencing writers so, with a heavy heart, I am resigning from my role as the director of the AWW. Writers and writing matters, even when they are presenting ideas that discomfort and challenge us.We need writers now more than ever, as our media closes up, as our politicians grow daily more cowed by real power, as Australia grows more unjust and unequal.AWW is the canary in the coalmine. Friends and colleagues in the arts, beware of the future.They are coming for you.Louise Adler was the director of Adelaide writers’ week from 2023 to 2026.

Heap too much ordure on the turncoat, and you invite the question of why you were happy to share a tent with them in the first place; praise them too highly, and you exacerbate whatever damage the defection is doing to you.In the Conservatives’ case, this problem is compounded for journalists by the hyperinflation in key posts. A “former chancellor of the exchequer” sounds like a big deal, and historically it would have been. But in the five years of the last parliament there were no fewer than five chancellors (Margaret Thatcher, across her entire 11-year premiership, had three).So how do we assess this one? Nadhim Zahawi held several cabinet-level positions under the previous government, but none of them for very long. The most sustained stint was education secretary (September 2021 to July 2022), and the most memorable event of that year was thedramatic scrapping of a schools billthat, it turned out, to the apparent surprise of ministers, would have rolled back much of the Tories’ education reform agenda.Perhaps that experience explainsZahawi’s emphasis, at Reform UK’s press conference today, on the need “to take back control from the rich powers of the unelected bureaucracy”. But it doesn’t obviously commend him as the man to do so.At a basic level, all but the most unusual defection is bad for the party being left. Beyond the obvious optical problems it creates, even the departure of the most shameless opportunist says something about the direction in which they think opportunity lies.Moreover, the effect of these things compounds over time: the more people leave, the greater the overall impression of people leaving and the more people who start to think about leaving. So we should be clear that, whatever caveats may apply, this and most other defections from the Tory party are bad for the Tory party.Howbad is a different, more difficult and much more interesting question. One of the problems with covering defections as a journalist is that there is often either great temptation or great pressure (sometimes both) to slot a defection neatly into a grand narrative: “What does this mean for the Tories/Labour?”But at the personal level – and there are few things more personal than changing teams – politics is rarely a question purely, or even mainly, decided by big-picture ideological criteria. All manner of other factors – an individual’s ambitions but also their actual personal relationships on either side of whatever line they are crossing – make a big difference.Only Zahawi truly knows the balance of these factors behind this decision (Tory sources claim it was hisrepeated failure to secure a peeragefrom Kemi Badenoch’s office,which Zahawi denies).But what we outside observers can note is that nothing in his defection speech highlighted any great ideological schism; you will not find Badenoch (or Robert Jenrick, for that matter) offering paeans to the administrative state. His choice of Reform UK is framed therefore as a question of who is best placed to deliver on this (as yet largely unwritten) agenda.On this, Zahawi was not persuasive. That the Conservatives’ record on managing the state was dire, especially between 2019 and 2024, is difficult to dispute. But that does not mean that Farage, whose various parties have contrived to wreak a great deal of change without ever having to actually run anything, is going to do any better. Too many Reform enthusiasts talk as if proving the case against the Conservatives necessarily proves a case for their own party, when it is sadly but obviously true that both are quite capable of disappointing us at the same time.This defection also highlights a difficulty for Reform. A party whose stated objective is to bury the Tories needs to appeal to voters who turfed the Tories out in 2024, and89 of the 98 seats in which it finished secondat the last election are held by Labour. It needs to be quite careful about the extent to which it allows itself to be populated by former Tories.Because Zahawi’s argument today – that the Conservatives can’t be trusted to fix the state because they didn’t manage it last time – doesn’t stop applying to him just because he’s swapped his rosette. A change of heart by a politician can be extremely powerful if accompanied by a sincere mea culpa (as was Keith Joseph’sduring the Tories’ last revolution). But there was no sign of any of that on stage today.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It can be hard to come to terms with this fact when you’re still on the battlefield, but if somehow you manage to step out for a moment, then the truth will become obvious. You have lost, the people on your side have lost, the villains have won and, if anything, you should have run away a long time ago.My own sad epiphany about Twitter, now known asX, came in the immediate aftermath of the US election in 2024. I’d spent a lot of that year lying to myself, ignoring the increasing volume of abuse I’d been receiving and the fact that no one ever read my linked pieces any more, but that week I realised I had to stop. I had to leave X for good.Government ministers cannot be making policy announcements in a space that hosts AI-generated, near-naked pictures of young girlsMuch of the British political sphere chose to stay put, both that November and in the year that followed. Everyone had their reasons: some felt their reach would be curtailed without it, others wanted to be on all available possible platforms. Some said they relished the intensity of the debates, others didn’t believe other platforms could ever be quite as thrilling or all encompassing.Most of those justifications were, of course, nonsense. Humans are creatures of habit and ego. If there is an app you have used every day for years, it will be tough for you to quit it, especially if it provided you with both adrenaline and dopamine. If you have a number of followers on that app, and that makes you feel important, it will be hard for you to willingly leave.I say this not to judge, but in recognition of my own behaviour. There were months and months when I kept lying to myself, pithily saying: “We’re not stuck in here withElon Musk– he’s stuck in here with us!” when I knew I was just shuffling my feet. Being in Washington DC when Donald Trump won the election was such a shock to the system that I had no choice but to do something drastic. Would I have stayed if I hadn’t been in the thick of it on that one awful night? Maybe. It’s hard to say.I did leave then, however, and since then I have watched, perpetually slack jawed, as Musk has kept poisoning the well further, and people I know, love and respect keep merrily drinking from it. Some of them left when Muskpublicly endorsed Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist, but many did not. Some of them realised they had to go when they saw neo-Nazi after neo-Nazi use and abuse the new monetised blue-tick system, but a lot of them stayed put.Most recently, we Bluesky users have seen some arrivals to our little oasis, after Grok, X’s own AI assistant, was used to producesexual abuse imageryof women and children. Still, many of them witnessed thousands and thousands of men requesting pictures of children in small bikinis, covered in “donut glaze”, and they didn’t move.Ofcom investigating Elon Musk’s X after outcry over sexualised AI imagesRead moreSome of them argued that people ought to stay and fight, and couldn’t just retreat to their own comfort zones – but they had it wrong. You may or may not choose to use Bluesky instead of X: as with everywhere else, it’s an app with upsides and downsides. You may head to Instagram instead, or give Threads an honest go, or start writing down your thoughts on smooth rocks then throwing them at various windows across your neighbourhood. It doesn’t matter.What does matter is that X is drifting towards irrelevance, becoming a containment pen for jumped-up fascists. Government ministers cannot be making policy announcements in a space that hosts AI-generated, near-naked pictures of young girls. Journalists cannot share their work in a place that systematically promotes white supremacy. Regular people cannot be getting their brains slowly but surely warped by Maga propaganda.We all love to think that we have power and agency, and that if we try hard enough we can manage to turn the tide – but X is long dead. The only winning move now is to step away from the chess board, and make our peace with it once and for all.Marie Le Conte is a French journalist living in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At my hostel reception, a woman tried her best to help me settle in. “Die Sauna is free after 6pm,” she said cheerfully in a mix of German and English, adding that all I needed was a towel.From that day on, sweating in the steaming sauna became my nightly ritual. I couldn’t quite join the occasional conversations that bubbled up around me – my German was very basic and my confidence level was hitting rock bottom. So mostly I sat quietly, listening, nodding, absorbing the rhythm of strangers unwinding at the end of their day.A week later, two Afghan students from Kandahar checked into the guesthouse. Instantly I felt at home. I insisted on hosting a small welcome dinner.And later I took them along to the sauna. Suddenly, we had our own little gang – laughing, gossiping, talking freely. Time slowed. There was no rush, no interruption. For a few precious moments we just sat, sweated and unwound together.Fast-forward more than a decade – past a fallen democracy in Afghanistan, brushes with war and years spent in journalism in different parts of the world – and I landed in Melbourne. I was staying at a hostel on Swanston Street when I noticed the Melbourne City Baths. Captivated by its grand exterior, I hesitantly stepped inside one afternoon, half-expecting a quiet, museum-like relic. Instead I was met with a buzzing indoor aquatic centre and vibrant community.Pity the fool who owns a pool. It’s like having a large, delicate, expensive pet | Andrew HerrickRead moreI’m not a stereotypical gym junkie, but late-night workouts and regular sauna sessions have helped me physically and mentally. More importantly, they have helped anchor me to new communities as I’ve moved around the world.The real turning point came when I discovered that local pools are scattered across Melbourne – especially in the suburbs – and membership fees are actually affordable.Our local centre in the south-east suburbs seems to glue the community together. Especially the sauna. But if saunas and gyms belong to adults, these public pools belong to children and families – and to the wider community.This scorchingly hot summer, my kids’ favourite hangout has become the local wave pool. Every other day during the school holidays, they beg to dive in. What surprises me isn’t just their enthusiasm, but the sheer vastness and robustness of the community gathered there. “So many people live here,” they tell me, wide-eyed. “And my this-and-that friend also comes to the pool.”What ties all of this together – the sauna in Bonn, the late-night gym in Melbourne, the wave pool in summer – is the quiet magic of shared spaces. Places where phones lose their grip, conversations resurface and communities breathe together.In the sauna rooms, men and women sit side by side, deep in uninterrupted conversation about housing affordability, food choices, travel plans, rising bills, aching knees and weekend barbecues. I can’t help but observe these little segments of society, stripped of titles and uniforms.In all its forms and shapes, on any given day, the pool offers a warm, communal feeling of belonging – in stark contrast to the shopping centre across the street, where people sit shoulder to shoulder in the same food court yet feel utterly alien to one another.And the cultural diversity is extraordinary. Accents mingle. Stories drift across generations and borders. No one asks what you do for a living. No one checks their phone.These public pools feel like a cultural refuge – a small, steamy world where conversations survive, muscles recover and minds reset. Whether students, tradies, retirees or weary office workers, the pool reminds us that wellness isn’t just about fitness. It’s about carving out moments of calm, community, and even absurd little joy – in a world that rarely slows down.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingOpinionSwimmingcommentShareReuse this content"

As further witnesses came forward, we had excuses: it was “banter”, therewasn’t any maliceinvolved and any such abuse wasnever targeted at an individual.Now Reform’s leader says that much, although seemingly not all, of what is being claimed from the now34 alleged witnesses and victimsabout his behaviour is “fantasy”. The motivation of this large group of fantasists is said to be political. The politician’s response does not sit well with me.I know that Farage targeted his contemporaries at the school with abuse because of their ethnicity and nationality because I was there – and I was one of them. I knew him throughout my time at Dulwich: sometimes we would be on the same train, when he would smoke the thinnest rollups you’ve ever seen in the compartments.I remember it so clearly because Farage was so different to what my friends and I were all about. His presence felt like a constant noise. The persona he had adopted was negative, destructive and intolerant of anything non-British. As he wasn’t really very good at anything – no great orator, not charismatic or engaging – he had clearly worked out that being vitriolic was the only way he’d get noticed.View image in fullscreenRickard Berg at Dulwich College when he was about 15 years old.Photograph: Supplied by Rickard BergYes, he had a few others that thought like him, but he didn’t need them around to repeatedly taunt the targets he had singled out based on their skin colour, nationality or religion, and had targeted because retribution was unlikely – as in essence he was a simple bully.I was picked on because I am Swedish. He had no retort when people like myself who he told to “go home, back to your own country” told him to fuck off.In case he’s forgotten, he said that to me in the classroom overlooking the science block. It was definitely not playground banter – at Dulwich there was no playground apart from in Lower School, years 7 and 8 – the school grounds were massive and we all disappeared to different corners to hang out with our friends during breaks. To repeatedly harass someone took a bit of effort.Why does it matter now? Yesterday, today or tomorrow, it matters. If there is any doubt about the impact he had, please readthe testimony of Peter Ettedgui, the award winning film-maker who counts people murdered in the Holocaust among his family. He described how Farage would hiss “Hitler was right” into his ear, and “gas them”.Farage and his acolytes are today calling me, some of my friends and other ex-Dulwich boys liars. It is bullying those who were hurt by him all over again.My motivation is not political. Farage has chosen a profession where character matters. It’s pathetic of him to pretend he shouldn’t be open to personal scrutiny or that his behaviour at Dulwich wouldn’t resurface: as pathetic aspicking on a wounded BBCto deflect from having to answer questions, but I guess that’s the bully right there. Had he wanted to remain anonymous, he should have stayed in the City rather than choosing a public career.My motivation is that in not acknowledging and explaining that “that was school, this is now”, he is showing that he simply isn’t beinghonest – and insulting us ex-fellow pupils in the process.Farage coming into the classroom in which Peter was sitting to start a rendition of the antisemitic song “Gas ’em all”, about killing Jews and other minority ethnic people, is not something you forget. I could no longer keep to just telling this story to my mates on bike rides through the Surrey Hills.Fudge (Farage’s nickname) is someone I remember as being nothing but a racist, antisemitic, obnoxious bully who would get the early train so he could polish hisCCF bootsbefore first bell; that’s about it. His response to the recent accounts of him at Dulwich doesn’t really make me feel he’s changed that much. To me, he remains a spineless little person incapable of making anything better.Rickard Berg is a musician, music producer and composerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why are its days numbered?Mon 12 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 10.52 ESTShareWhat do James McAvoy and my three-year-old son have in common? Very little, you might think, notwithstanding their sharedawareness of the bookThe Dinosaur That Pooped a Planet. Yet their lives overlap in a more tangible way, because they, along with Benedict Cumberbatch, patronise the same cafes on Hampstead Heath. Both actorshave signed a petitionprotesting against the takeover of four family-owned north London cafes by the Australian-inspired chain Daisy Green. It’s a move that has dismayed the local community, leading to protests, andthreats of legal actionagainst the landowner, the City of London Corporation, whosenew funding modelfor green spaces prioritises “income generation”.You’re probably wondering why you should care, either about what Hollywood actors think, or about this notoriously chi-chi part of London. And yet, like them, and like me, you probably have a favourite cafe, one that feels very special. So please indulge me in describing mine: the Parliament Hill cafe, which has beenrun by the D’Auria familyfor more than 40 years.It looks far fromremarkable. Unlike the polished,trend-led interiorsof the Daisy Green cafes – with their marble bars and high stools (God I hate high stools, an accessibility nightmare that feel specifically designed for rapid customer turnover), their lush, green hanging plants and twee parasols – it isn’t designed to look good on social media. This is a 1960s-style bunker with no-frills decor inside.My son and I were last there on New Year’s Eve. The time before, he had been very hungry and upset, and the kind woman on the till – in typical child-friendly, Italian fashion – had said: “Next time, just come to the front.” We are all products of our upbringings, however, so I chose to queue. As we waited, I looked around at the scene. The cafe was packed with customers of all ages, races, nationalities and backgrounds. There are often buggies and wheelchair users – it has a ramp. At several tables, local families with young kids tucked into steaming bowls of pasta followed by cannoli. At another, a man on a work break devoured a jacket potato. At yet another, a trio of arty-looking octogenarians enjoyed a bottle of red wine.As I paid for our Cornish pasty – a firm favourite with my son since babyhood – I told one of the staff how sad I was that they were losing the lease. She was sad, too: they had been told a week before Christmas that they had to be out by the end of January. There aren’t many places in north London where you get such affordable food and such a diverse mix of people. The UK used to be full of cafes such as this: often immigrant-owned, and serving a combination of cuisines. On the surface they seem basic, perhaps even a little scruffy. They are certainly not Instagrammable. Yetwhat they offer– friendliness, inclusivity – is worth more to the clientele than social media kudos.No doubt some will say that nostalgia underpins my sentimentality about a place where the coffee is good, but not great, and the menu homely, as opposed to innovative. Yet I know I am not the only one who feels emotionally attached to it, or the other business under threat – thefamily-run Hoxton Beachthat operates in Queen’s Park, Parliament Hill Lido cafe and one inHighgate Wood (new leaseholder TBC). Local newspaper coverage has focused on how people who struggle financially – there are more of them than some assume, as it’s an area of great income disparity ­– have an affordable, welcoming place to go, and also on the importance of such cafes and how they foster togetherness in aloneliness epidemic.This isn’t just a story about gentrification and the homogeneity that comes with it, but one of social atomisation. As more and more chains dominate high streets all over the country, truly mixed, inclusive spaces become rarer and rarer.It’s good for mental health to have a conversation with staff that isn’t rushed. I like that they remember me and ask after my son, or give him a free falafel while his food is cooking – that human touch that makes a long, lonely day feel less arduous, which, I suspect, you just don’t get in a busy Gail’s or a Nando’s or a Daisy Green.I know I am not alone in not wanting my local cafe to turn into what so many others have across the UK and beyond: a list of signifiers, part of a corporate, global language that masquerades as friendly and laid-back but is – in its aesthetic and its pricing – tailored only for a certain demographic, and is indistinguishable from a thousand other similar places. I’m sick of avocado toast. I don’t want to stand under a cherry blossom arch and have my photo taken. I want a cork noticeboard that advertises guitar lessons and babysitters, I want a brew, a pasty, and – most of all – that most human of essentials: a nice chat. The City ofLondonCorporation must urgently rethink, before, as in so many other places, another community loses a piece of its heart in the ruthless pursuit of profit.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGentrificationOpinionCommunitiesFoodLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

Our writer celebrates an extraordinary British talent who died in obscurityJoanna MoorheadMon 12 Jan 2026 11.14 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShareIn 1972, the mighty Kunstmuseum in the Hague bought three paintings by a little known British artist called Marlow Moss. The prestigious art gallery was keen to show the enormous influence ofPiet Mondrian– the famous Dutch painter acclaimed for his black grids lit with bold blues and brash yellows – on such lowly also-rans as Moss.Yet, should you visit the Kunstmuseum today, you’ll find the Moss works positioned front and centre, while a similar piece by the great Mondrian, who would later become the toast of New York, is hidden behind a pillar. Why the volte-face? Because it is now widely recognised in the art world that it was as much Moss who influenced Mondrian as the other way round, at least when it came to the double or parallel lines he started using in the 1930s to add tension to his harmonious abstract paintings,one of which hammered last May for $48m.The smart feminist money was on him having stolen from herSeven decades after her death in Cornwall at the age of 69, Moss is enjoying a major revival and reappraisal. As well as the current exhibition of her paintings and sketches in the Kunstmuseum, her sculpture will go on show at the Georg Kolbe Museum in Berlin in April. Last year, meanwhile, her 1944 work White, Black, Blue and Red fetched £609,000 at Sotheby’s in London, double its estimate and a record for her work at auction. Not quite in Mondrian territory, not yet anyway.View image in fullscreen‘She’s now getting attention’ … Marlow Moss.Photograph: Nijhoff/Oosthoek, Literatuurmuseum, Den HaagIt’s an extraordinary turnaround for an artist who was shunned by much of the art world in her lifetime. The Tate wasn’t interested in her. When Moss moved to Cornwall, settling in the beautiful and remote Lamorna Cove near Penzance, she made repeated efforts to contact sculptor Barbara Hepworth and her painter husband Ben Nicholson. They ignored her.“Moss’s time has come,” says Florette Dijkstra, author of The Leap into the Light, a biography recently published in Dutch. “Art history is a strange science. The landscape can totally shift. The buzzwords today are inclusivity and diversity. Women artists are being promoted, as well as queer artists. This explains – partly – why Moss is getting so much attention.”Marjorie Jewel Moss, as she was first named, was born in London in 1889. Drawn initially to dance and music, she went on to study art before moving to Cornwall, where she cut her hair short and changed her name to the gender-neutral Marlow, though was still known as “she”. In the late 1920s, Moss moved to Paris, where she became part of the avant garde scene and a member of the Abstraction-Creation group, which favoured abstraction over figurative work or surrealism.Her entry into the group came via an early admirer, Mondrian, who was a few years her senior and Dutch. Moss had been introduced to him by her partner Netty Nijhoff, a writer from Zeeland. Moss and Nijhoff had met at the Cafe de Flore in Paris. When Nijhoff asked her son to take a note to the lady at the nearby table, the boy asked: “What lady?” Moss was, as usual, in male attire. After they became a couple, both would go about Paris in men’s suits and hats. Nijhoff remained married to her husband, the Dutch poet Martinus Nijhoff, for years to come, though both had other lovers. At times, Moss and Nijhoff had other partners as well.The reaction this unusual pair prompted wasn’t straightforward, says Dijkstra, even in the so-called liberal art community in Paris. “Some accepted them,” she says. “Others didn’t.” Mondrian did up to a point – but he was far more interested in Moss’s art than her love life.View image in fullscreenPrecise … Moss’s Composition Yellow, Blue, Black, Red and White, 1956-1957.Photograph: © The Estate of Marlow Moss“He was impressed,” adds Dijkstra, “by her experimentation with the ingredients of ‘neoplasticism’ – how she used materials other than paint, such as cork and wood, and her use of the ‘double line’, which allowed for more dynamic compositions.” Mondrian has since gone down in history as the father of neoplasticism, which was all about paring art down to basic components, using only lines and shapes with minimal colours.When Mondrian saw Moss was deploying the double line in a new way – not using it to cross other lines – his interest was aroused and he wrote to ask what she meant by it. When she told him she regarded the single-line grid he’d been using for over a decade as “a conclusion and restriction” to a composition, he replied saying he couldn’t quite follow what she meant.Mondrian, however, would go on to become famous for the double line. Clairie Hondtong, the Hague show’s curator, believes its use evolved from exchanges between the two, rather than as something Mondrian created that was then borrowed by Moss, as earlier art historians believed. “For a long time, he was seen as the instigator – but, though it’s unclear who used it first, we now know Mondrian was intrigued by Moss’s use of double lines.”The sands have certainly shifted over the years. Back in 1972, the assumption was that artists such as Moss had been influenced by Mondrian’s use of it. Then came the discovery that Moss had also used it – and the smart feminist money was on him having stolen it. But now, says Hondtong, there’s a new approach. “Many museums put Moss to the front in the originality debate, but we’re moving away from the ‘Who did it first?’ narrative, focusing instead on the interchange of knowledge.”Visitors to the exhibition will be able to admire Moss’s use of the technique in her 1932 work White, Black, Red and Grey. They will also be able to compare it to Mondrian’s, in his 1937 Composition of Lines and Colour.Some LGBTQ+ commentators have suggested that Moss’s use of double lines may have been her response to a world that didn’t make space for a gay woman who dressed in masculine clothes. Since her double lines didn’t cross other lines, she effectively opened up a new space on a canvas – one she may have longed for in the real world. “It might have been an expression of her search for freedom,” says Hondtong. “It could be interpreted as an original response for people outside binary spaces.”How does Moss fit into today’s transgender debate? “If she was alive today,” says Hondtong, “would she identify as trans? We can’t know – and we don’t want to put words into her mouth. It’s certainly great that she was seen as a pioneer and is an inspiration for queer artists today.”In 1940, Mondrian moved to New York. Moss, by then living in the Netherlands with Nijhoff, returned to Cornwall, since her Jewish ancestry made life impossible in now-Nazi occupied territory. Mondrian urged her to follow him, but she did not. He died there in 1944, and the two never met again. In Lamorna, Moss seems to have found acceptance and a place conducive to her work. After the war, she reunited with Nijhoff and the pair continued to be lifelong companions until Moss’s death in 1958. They split their life between Cornwall, Paris and the Netherlands, where they lived sometimes on a houseboat in The Hague.View image in fullscreenIntuitive … Mondrian’s Tableau I, Plate I, 1921.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesNew York, whose grid-like streets echoed Mondrian’s works, helped catapult him to global fame, and he has gone down as a giant of art history, one of the three greatest Dutch painters – along with Van Gogh and Rembrandt – of all time. He is regarded as a central pioneer on the journey from figurative to abstract art, and in the US his work connected with the jazz music and boogie-woogie of the time. In 2022, his Composition No II went for $51m, the record for a Mondrian.Moss, by contrast, became a footnote in art history, a situation compounded by the destruction of much of her work when a house in Normandy where she and Nijhoff had lived was bombed by the Allies in 1944. It’s the discovery of a suitcase full of sketches that has prompted The Hague exhibition. “The case was left in the Netherlands,” says Hondtong. “It was acquired by the Kunstmuseum in 2025.” A lot of the works were undated, but it’s believed some are from the early 1940s. There are rare examples of her sketches, which reveal much about her thought process.“We see her using mathematical calculations to plan her geometric paintings,” says Hondtong, “which is very different from Mondrian. She was very precise and her works were carefully mapped out, whereas Mondrian worked more intuitively.” Also in the suitcase are automatic drawings, revealing another layer of Moss’s oeuvre.Hondtong hopes the contents of the suitcase will spur a new chapter in the artist’s legacy, a focus on her work rather than her life story – an ambition supported by Lucy Howarth, author of the only book in English on Moss, a short eponymous biography. “Moss has a fascinating story. For most people, the way into knowing about her is via the Mondrian link. But she deserves to be explored in her own right. She’s been downplayed by Mondrian scholars for years, but she is one of the few top-tier non-figurative British artists from between the wars, and she was the only Briton and the only female artist who appeared in all five Abstraction-Creation journals.”Howarth, a historian at the University for the Creative Arts in Canterbury, has been researching Moss since the early years of the 21st century, and says much has changed. “In those days, I’d be looking for her work in storerooms and back rooms. Today, Moss’s work is up on the walls and much sought after for exhibitions.” The upcoming Berlin sculpture exhibition is co-curated by Howarth. “Moss worked in metal, stone and wood and we’ll have about 10 pieces,” she says. “But we’ll also have photographs of sculptures that were lost.”View image in fullscreenHe urged her to follow him to New York … Mondrian.Photograph: Granger/ShutterstockUnlike Mondrian, who was a painter, Moss was a constructivist who used a range of materials and methods. The new show, it is hoped, will shift the focus on to that. Nijhoff once described her partner as an artist whose work was all about space, movement and light – and that’s every bit as true of her sculpture, says Howarth.Perhaps most exciting of all is the idea that the current focus on Moss is reframing art history. For centuries, it’s been the story of singular men, geniuses who toiled alone brilliantly to change the direction of the canon. “We’re realising art history is a lot more interesting than that,” says Howarth. “Mondrian was an amazing artist, but he wasn’t the only one practising neoplasticism. It’s so interesting to find lesser-known artists and to examine their impact – and it’s no surprise to find many of them were women and/or queer. Their presence complicates the story. But it also enriches it – for all of us.”Marlow Moss: A Suitcase Full of Sketches is at the Kunstmuseum, The Hague, until 10 May.Creating Space: The Constructivist Marlow Moss is at the Georg Kolbe Museum, Berlin, 2 April to 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingPiet MondrianfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But we soon made up – and wrote this about the process’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 12 Jan 2026 10.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 12.15 ESTShareTom Bailey, singer, songwriter, bass, guitar, keyboardsThompson Twins were a seven-piece, rag-bag, guitar-based band living in a squat when I met Alannah Currie, who was also squatting in London. She was in an anarchic improv band, the Unfuckables, who were clearly not destined for Top of the Pops, but there was something very exciting about her. When I invited her to come on at the end of a Thompson Twins gig, she stole the show.We slimmed down to a three-piece with Alannah, Joe Leeway [keyboards, percussion, vocals] and myself. Suddenly we were a recognisable trio who could all fit in one car. After I bought a synthesiser, our trackIn the Name of Lovebecame a dance/club sensation, which opened doors in America. Until then, we’d always vaguely hoped our music would do well, but after that we thought: “Why don’t we actually design it to do well?”We'd fill eggs with black paint and throw them at sexist advertsHold Me Now came about after we’d gone off to write songs in some house somewhere and had a creative disagreement that spilled over into personal insults. But behind that was real affection and a relationship we’d kept secret from the press. We soon made up and immediately wrote Hold Me Now about that process. The song came very easily. It felt more mature than the clubby stuff. It was slower, heartfelt, more emotional, and being about real stuff gave it authenticity.I was keen to record it as soon as possible but Alex Sadkin, our regular producer, wasn’t available, so I went into RAK Studios and recorded most of it myself, something I’d never done before. Alex came in at the end and wanted to redo some of the vocals. Joe and I shared the falsetto bits. We knew we were on to something because everyone who heard it said it was going to be a big hit, including the BBC.We released it in November 1983 because in those days everyone wanted a Christmas No 1. We were away recording at Compass Point in the Bahamas when Hold Me Now came out and had very little contact with the outside world. We came out of those sessions to find it racing up the charts, then it just became this monster hit.Alannah Currie, singer, songwriter, percussionI remember a van pulling up outside with all this gear and the whole band moving into a really bad squat opposite mine. When Tom gave me a lift to the tube, we hit it off straight away. In those days, loads of bands came from the squat scene: you had free housing, you’d bunk the tube and have the run of London.The Unfuckables only did one gig but we were wild feminists who’d fill eggs with black paint and throw them at sexist adverts. We were fearless. Once I joined the Twins, we only had each other so really went for it. I was a woman musician at a time when there weren’t many and Joe was Black, so we got a hard time.Everybody focused on Tom, who’d had classical training – while we were dirty punks. But we always tried to find the common ground between the three of us. I remember us all sitting in my squat deciding we wanted to be a new type of band – synthesisers and drum machines brought incredible freedom. After being broke for so long, suddenly we could do what we wanted: try to make amazing records.Hold Me Now is basically a letter from me to Tom, and him to me, with interjections from Joe. I never had “a picture, pinned to my wall”, but that lyric was inspired by a photo-booth picture of me and Tom snogging, which I kept inside my writing book. I scrawled most of the lyrics down like a love letter, one of those frenzied things you do to find out what you’re really thinking. Then we tailored the words as if they were coming from Tom, because he’d be singing it.Everything was done so quickly it was absolutely from the heart. Then the song just seemed to take on a life of its own. It was such a huge, bombastic, painful but madly great time in our lives. Tom and I have two children together but while we’re no longer a couple, or a band, but all three of us are like family and stay in touch. Occasionally, I’ll hear Hold Me Now playing somewhere and my heart just goes: “Ohh.”Industry & Seduction: A Thompson Twins Collection is out now on three CD deluxe set, coloured vinyl two LP set and CD.Tom Bailey tours the UK in SeptemberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Indeed, the best joke of Nikki Glaser’sGolden Globesmonologue last night revolved around that fact that DiCaprio givesso little of himselfaway that the only things she could find to joke about him were his notoriouslyyounger girlfriendsand an obscure magazine interview he gave when he was 17, where he announced that his favourite food was “pasta, pasta and more pasta”.However, DiCaprio then went and instantly gave some of himself away. A camera remained on him during a commercial break, and it caught him giving one of the most flamboyant demonstrations of his personality ever seen.One Battle After Another and Adolescence dominate 83rd Golden GlobesRead moreIf you missed it, it’s a doozy.The clipseems to show DiCaprio spotting someone from across the auditorium, and giving them a kind of Dramatic Chipmunk look. Putting his fingers to his eyes, he mouths something along the lines of: “I saw you with the K-pop thing.” He then appears to re-enact what this person was like with the K-pop thing, pointing around him with a flourish. He touches his lips. He mimes a moment of realisation. He cracks himself up again so much that he then re-enacts his own re-enactment, with more points and a stage-whispered “K-pop”.And then, like a cloud drifting across the sun, it ends. Blankly Inscrutable ActorLeonardo DiCapriocomes to the fore once again. He sullenly signs something for someone, and the clip ends.On TikTok they’re already calling it “2026’s first meme” and it’s obvious why. Especially during his Oscar-chasing years, DiCaprio staunchly made a point of never showing an ounce of personality. He would talk about craft. He’d talk about his love of storytelling. Production videos, where they exist, showed little more than arobotic dedication to technique.This is, of course, what makes him a movie star. Unlike most of us, who fart out each ambient thought and meal we experience on to social media, DiCaprio values the importance of mystique. He knows that the bulk of what we think of movie star charisma simply consists of the ideas and values that we project on to people, and he wants to give us the widest canvas available.But the downside of this is that, whenever there’s a momentary slip of the facade and a small chink of the real DiCaprio leaks out, people fall on top of it. Would this much noise have been made had, say, Chris Pratt mouthed something about K-pop at theGolden Globes? No, of course not.Chalamet a smash, Sinners shut out: the key Golden Globes snubs and surprisesRead moreSimilarly, had Jack Black pulled a bizarre microexpression during an Actors on Actors video with Jennifer Lawrence, not a single person would have noticed. But when DiCapriodid it this year– answering a question about directors he’d like to work with by narrowing his eyes and giving a sassy little neck snap, before snapping back into character and responding sincerely – it basically halted the internet for an entire week.You could write entire dissertations about that moment. Did he forget he was being filmed? Was it a private joke? Is it a form of neurological tic? It was a smaller, more demure version of thatinsane Little Mix accent challenge videofrom many years ago. If anything, it only deepened the mystery of who Leonardo DiCaprio actually is.Arguably the first glimpse we got of this side of DiCaprio came during, of all things, aCarpool Karaoke video. James Corden used his guest Jennifer Lopez’s phone to message DiCaprio, asking if he wanted to cut loose. His near-instant reply – “You mean tonight, boo boo? Club wise?” – was a jolt. It felt like the sort of thing that an actor might say, either obliviously or with heightened irony, but Leonardo DiCaprio? Leonardo DiCaprio from Blood Diamond? It didn’t quite fit.But, look, now it’s out there. DiCaprio has given enough peeks into his actual personality that he might as well just ditch the pretense and keep it up full-time.One Battle After Anotheralready showed that he can be funny, so why not just hang it all out there for everyone to see? Let him gurn and mug and vamp. We don’t need to see him as the serious actor whooccasionally grimacesat Lady Gaga any more. He has earned the right to be himself, regardless of how silly that is.Of course, there is always the possibility that DiCaprio’s next role will be Man Who Fails to Understand the Concept of K-pop in an upcoming hard-hitting drama about theHallyuphenomenon, and his Golden Globes bit was simply actorly preparation. In which case, congratulations, Leonardo. It’s sure to be a masterpiece.Explore more on these topicsGolden Globes 2026Leonardo DiCaprioGolden GlobesAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In her debut show Laid, a maternal-anxiety antic that won her best newcomer at the Edinburgh comedy awards, she gave birth to eggs then broke them on stage. In her second, Nate, she cross-dressed asa beer-chugging douchebagto workshop sexual assault and consent with her astonished audience. Who foresaw that this loose cannon would soon be Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s clown coach, in the series Gutsy? Who then saw an extended New York City run beckoning, thronged with celebrity attendees?“Drew Barrymore came, Kevin Bacon came,” says Palamides, on a video call from her native California. “Sabrina Carpenter came: that was nuts. Dua Lipa, Nathan Fielder, Neil Patrick Harris.” The show was Weer, and the run (until shortly before Christmas) was at “the birthplace of Off-Broadway”, the Cherry Lane theatre,recently relaunched by hip movie studio A24. When we speak, Palamides, 36, is laid low with flu, her body’s revenge for that marathon three-month run. “I thought a month would be the longest I’d ever do it,” she croaks. “It takes a lot of physical endurance to make it through the show.”Premiering in Edinburgh in 2024,Weerbuilt on the gender-bending Nate, and stars Palamides as both halves of a romantic comedy couple. And when I say “halves”, I mean it: one half of her face and body plays Mark (plaid shirt; facial hair), the other, Christina (fluffy pink top; flowing locks). This hot mess of a show flashes back from a car accident to stage the three-year span of their relationship, as Palamides now flirts and makes out with herself, now bickers with and abuses herself. It’s a virtuosic performance stunt, all in the name of outrageous entertainment and a warped celebration of the 90s romcom.View image in fullscreen‘It takes a lot of physical endurance to make it through the show’ … Natalie Palamides in Nate.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianEven getting into makeup and costume each night takes several hours, she reports, never mind the exhausting solo turn. “I made sure to take good care of myself,” she says. “I do biotherapy and red light therapy every day.” Convalescent in LA, she’d love a break – but the show’s UK return beckons, another chance for London audiences (and maybe celebs too) to see what the Off-Broadway fuss is about.What chord does Palamides think Weer has struck with audiences? “I hope it’s the rollercoaster ride element that makes them feel so taken by the show,” she says. “Being able to get big laughs and joy then also feel those tender, vulnerable moments.”“When I was making it, I went to seeThe Notebook on Broadway. Not to dog anybody, but that’s one of the most successful romantic films of all time. And it’s such a letdown how they did it on stage. In the film, when they kiss in the rain, it’s so cathartic, they’re finally back together. But on stage, you didn’t get to relish that feeling, they didn’t build any tension with them being apart and wanting each other.” Weer would be different. “I was determined that all those feelings you feel watching those movies would be there in my show.”Mission accomplished – and more. Weer is no mere homage to romcoms, it’s also a critique, burrowing (like most of Palamides’ work) under the skin of gender assumptions and conventions. “I wanted to explore how in most romantic comedies we’re fed in our culture, the relationships are toxic, but you still root for them to be together. Was it possible to show the audience a relationship much more intense and toxic, and see if the audience still wanted them to be together?”View image in fullscreenOutrageous entertainment … Natalie Palamides in Weer.Photograph: A24It’s an inquiry that’s consolidated Palamides’ position, next to her old mentorPhil “Dr Brown” Burgers, at the spearhead of the current clown boom. Alongside her own shows, and a starring voiceover role in animated sitcom The Powerpuff Girls, she has directed Bill O’Neill’s slapstick smashThe Amazing Banana Brothers, is developing a clown-conjuring cabaret Lady Magic (previewed at last year’s Edinburgh fringe) for a Las Vegas residency – and was invited by the Clintons to tutor them in physical comedy fortheir TV series. She’s also now plotting a screen version of Weer.“I have no idea how it’s happened,” says Palamides of her status as comedy’s hippest goon. “I just keep persevering and trying to make good art.” Though she’d love some downtime, Palamides is premiering a new solo project at the Netflix Is a Joke festival this May – and if you were expecting a cash-in on her recent success, you’ll be disappointed. This next idea, she says, “is not palatable. It’s very off-putting. It’s based on a character I’ve done a couple times [on stage] who says she’s pregnant with the second coming, and she births a raw steak and beats it until it’s stopped crying, then she eats it.”“I’m fearful to do this, because I was raised Catholic. I was super-scared of Satan and demons when I was growing up. It feels so taboo to delve into this area.” But taboos are Palamides’ currency: this is a clown who trades less in red noses, more in red flags. Whether she’s flying them in Weer or in the carnival of sacrilege set to follow, good luck taking your eyes off her.Weer is atSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, 14-24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsComedyClownsTheatreSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A rare Bob Weir-penned lyric details the Dead’s youngest member being busted by the cops “for smiling on a cloudy day” – referencing a real-life incident when Weir pelted police with water balloons as they conducted what he took to be illegal searches outside the group’s Haight-Ashbury hangout. It then connects with the band’s spiritual forebearsthe Merry Prankstersby referencing Neal Cassady, driver of “a bus to never-ever land”. The song later evolved into The Other One, one of the Dead’s most played tunes and a launchpad for their exploratory jams – as inthis languid, brilliant versionat San Francisco’s Winterland in 1974.The Grateful Dead – Truckin’ (1970)“What a long, strange trip it’s been,” reflected Weir on what is arguably the Grateful Dead’s anthem. The group were only half a decade into a remarkable 30-year career when lyricist Robert Hunter penned this picaresque of their touring escapades. It’s heavy on the gnarly details – groupies consumed by “reds, vitamin C and cocaine”, and endless hotel-room drug-busts – but the Dead’s spirited delivery and, in particular, Weir’s jovial growl, located the magic in their peripatetic lifestyle. As with many Dead tunes, Truckin’ was best heard in concert (or on a fan-taped bootleg traded in the car park before a show). The rumble captured at London’s Lyceum on the Europe ’72 live LP is as fine as any you’ll hear.The Grateful Dead – Sugar Magnolia (1971)The Grateful Dead: Sugar Magnolia / Scarlet Begonias / Fire on the Mountain (Winterland 12/31/78) – videoA tribute to Weir’s longtime paramour Frankie Hart – “a summer love in the spring, fall and winter” who could “make happy any man alive” – and a highlight of their 1970 LP American Beauty, Sugar Magnolia showcased the Dead’s embrace of Americana and songcraft. Their second most played song evolved a joyful coda in concert, Sunshine Daydream, and it was often the first song they would play after the clock struck midnight at their New Year’s Eve concerts.The performance at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom on 31 December 1978, marking the closure of the venerated venue, is a true Deadhead favourite.Bob Weir – Playing in the Band (1972)Playing in the Band portrays the Dead’s lifestyle as some quasi-mystical vocation, with the narrator a talk-is-cheap road warrior who has developed his own philosophies along the way: “I don’t trust to nothing / But I know it come out right.” Evolving from a riff coined by David Crosby during a jam in Dead percussionist Mickey Hart’s barn, the track first surfaced on the Dead’s eponymous 1971 live LP, then featured on Weir’s 1972 solo debut Ace, before the group reclaimed it as a vehicle for their most questing, open-ended excursions. The legendary 46-minuteversion from Seattle’s Edmundson Pavilion in 1974is reckoned to be the longest song performance the Dead ever pulled off.Bob Weir – Cassidy (1972)View image in fullscreenBob Weir pictured in 1976.Photograph: Mark SullivanNamed for the young daughter of a Dead roadie, Cassidy doubles as a tribute to beat poet Neal Cassady, whose restless, questing example cast a long shadow for Weir. A lilting, upbeat folk-rocker, it finds Weir offering the infant Cassidy life lessons he has drawn from Cassady’s quixotic lust for freedom, singing on the coda: “Let your life proceed by its own designs … Let the word be yours.” This sentiment, along with the pearlescent, folky tangle of a riff, made Cassidy a song Weir revisited throughout his career,with the Deadand also with RatDog, the group he formed following Garcia’s death in 1995.The Grateful Dead – The Music Never Stopped (1975)Is 1975’s Blues for Allah the funkiest Dead album? The Meters-esque swing of Jerry Garcia’s Franklin’s Tower suggests as much, as does this Weir-penned reverie, steeped in the rhythms of the south. The Music Never Stopped is driven by Weir’s prickly guitar figures, stirring up a groove that wouldn’t have shamed Allen Toussaint, while the sparring harmonies with singerDonna Jean Godchauxgive this playful number a Bourbon Street-worthy earthiness. The down-home imagery, co-written with Weir’s regular collaborator John Perry Barlow, verges on the hokey, but if you aren’t seduced by the “rainbow full of sound … fireworks, calliopes and clowns”, that’s your loss.Kingfish – Lazy Lightning/Supplication (1976)After the Dead temporarily ran aground in the mid-70s, Weir jumped ship to join his pal Matthew Kelly’s group Kingfish, for whom he wrote this luminous two-parter mixing imagery of lust and addiction. The studio version, all pristine harmonies and succinct, FM radio-ready AOR, is charming. But as is always the way with Dead-related music, the song truly came into its own after the group reformed and Weir added it to their setlists. Performances such as this onefrom the Sportatorium in Florida in 1977unlocked the conversational, jazzy potential that is only hinted at on Kingfish’s studio original.The Grateful Dead – Estimated Prophet (1977)The Grateful Dead: Estimated Prophet (Live at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, New York 3/29/90) – video“The Grateful Dead play reggae” may be a hard sell as a concept, but Estimated Prophet is something else. The track possesses a menace that is rare in Dead music, with Weir portraying a darkly charismatic Manson-like figure duelling with the voices in his head and threatening to “call down thunder” and “fill the sky with flame”. The portrait is grimly compelling, the band doubtless having crossed paths with many such drug-damaged characters as the 60s soured. Fans citethe 1990 recording from New York’s Nassau Coliseumas the keeper, with guest musician Branford Marsalis playing lyrical saxophone, but the song’s dark heart is perhaps best represented on the recording oftheir 1979 show at Oakland Auditorium Arena, where Weir’s choppy guitar lends a foreboding undertow to Brent Mydland’s sprawling keyboard solo.The Grateful Dead – Lost Sailor (1980)The Dead seemed mostly unconcerned by whatever trends were moving the mainstream. During their tenure at Clive Davis’s Arista records, however, the storied record mogul teamed them with outside producers, hoping to connect the Dead, however reluctantly, with the zeitgeist. The sleeve of 1980’s Go to Heaven, with the group in white disco suits and flowing tresses as if they’d hired the Bee Gees’ stylists, suggested an uncharacteristic misstep. But the album itself has aged well, in particular this meditative and melancholic number. On Lost Sailor, a disillusioned Weir recognises himself in the figure of a haggard old boatman as dedicated to the sea as the singer and guitarist is to the open road, musing “freedom don’t come easy”.The Grateful Dead – Hell in a Bucket (1987)The Grateful Dead’s only US Top 10 LP, 1987’s In the Dark, is far from beloved among Deadheads. But whilea goofy, skeleton-packed videobriefly sold these boomers to the MTV generation, this cynical kiss-off to a former lover proved the Dead hadn’t sacrificed their dark wit for stardom. The narrator plays like a character from a Steely Dan song, a loser nevertheless focused on having the last laugh, as Weir’s Dylanesque croak depicts his ex as “the reincarnation of the ravenous Catherine the Great” and reasoning, in the irresistible hook, “I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe, but at least I’m enjoyin’ the ride”. It’s a timeless sentiment, even if thegonzo music videofeaturing Weir in a pastel suit straight out of Miami Vice, and his leather-clad ex, has not aged so well – though Bob is clearly having fun throughout.Explore more on these topicsMusicGrateful DeadPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As his new show thrills Paris, the US-based, Irish-born artist talks about the pain that drives himMon 12 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 06.59 ESTShareWhen I askSean Scullywhat an abstract painting has over a figurative one it’s music he reaches for. “You might ask, what’s Miles Davis got over the Beatles? And the answer is: doesn’t have any words in it. And then you could say, what have the Beatles got over John Coltrane? Well, they’ve got words.”It’s clear which choice he has made. Scully, who paints rectangles and squares and strips of colour abutting and sliding into each other, is an instrumentalist in paint rather than a pop artist. The meaning of his art is something you feel, not something you can easily describe. He has more in common with Davis and Coltrane than with the Beatles. In addition to improvisational brilliance, his new paintings even colour-match with Coltrane’s classic album Blue Train and Davis’s Kind of Blue. For Scully, the greatest living abstract painter, is playing the blues in Paris. In his current exhibition at the city’s Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery, long, textured blue notes as smoky as a sax at midnight alternate and mingle with black and red and brown in a slow, sad, beautiful music that doesn’t need words, art that doesn’t require images.Even now, I am terrified of the dark. I can’t cross a room or get out of my car in the darkThose blues have been with Scully since childhood. “I got interested in blue because I had the blues.” He is still driven by pain, he tells me, over green tea in an upper room of the gallery. “Even now I’m terrified of the dark. I can’t walk across a room in the dark and I can’t get out of my car in the dark.” Luckily the gallery is brightly lit – all white. But the anguish is there in his art, a sense that under an apparently decorous, civilising order – patterns of rectangles as neat as ploughed fields or windows in a house front – bubbles up a storm of barely controlled feeling. In his Blue paintings that inner turbulence foams more mightily than ever.Born in Dublin in 1945, Scully moved to London as a small child. He is named after his grandfather who hanged himself in military prison in 1916 in Chatham, Kent, while awaiting execution by firing squad – he had deserted from the British army to try to join the Easter Rising. But Scully doesn’t identify as purely Irish: rather he feels an internal tug-of-war. “I’m Anglo-Irish. And you’ve got this irresolvable, endlessly irresolvable dance between order and abandon that’s all in me all the time and it will be in me until the day I drop dead.”View image in fullscreenSmoky as a sax at midnight … Blue, 2024, by Scully.Photograph: Sean ScullyHe has been “tormented” since he was a child in postwar London. “I’m the product of a completely smashed-up family, an Irish family.” His father, too, deserted from the British army, during the second world war, and was imprisoned. By the late 1940s, “my mum and I were in this slum off the Old Kent Road. On my birth certificate for father’s profession it says ‘traveller’.”His mother’s personality dominated his childhood. “My mother was really a hurricane. Or a monsoon, perhaps, would be a bit more accurate: she was warm and enveloping but left everything broken. So that would be a good metaphor.”It was a conflict between his mother and the nuns who taught him that scarred him. She “got into a huge fight with them because they said if my father worked on a Sunday, the devil would move in under my bed”.At the age of seven Scully was taken away from the scary nuns, but also from the ceremony and ritual beauty of Catholicism. “And so I had a kind of nervous breakdown. I went to the state school and I think that is when I became an artist. That incredible rupture. I asked my mother could I have an altar at home and she said no. So I lost my religion, and I’ve never been able to put it back together again. I’ve tried to put it back together with art.”View image in fullscreen‘Abstract works go bang, straight inside’ … Backs and Fronts 1981.Photograph: © Sean Scully. Courtesy of the ArtistScully trained in England as a figurative artist, supporting himself with manual jobs, then in 1975 moved to New York, where postwar art took a walk on the abstract side. When he arrived, the last abstract expressionists were battling it out with the minimalists. But for him the American avant garde had lost all feeling. “They got emptied out. They made art big and emblematic but also empty.”Like who?“Newman,” he says, referring to the abstract expressionist painter and sculptor Barnett Newman, who created fields of pure colour and vast space divided by vertical lines that have been interpreted as divine lightning: he vaunted the quasi-religious vocation of abstract art in his painting cycle Stations of the Cross. For Scully this was pure pomposity. He is even sceptical about that abstract expressionist holy of holies, the Rothko Chapel in Houston: “I found it extraordinarily underwhelming.” I bristle a bit because I love Rothko.Despite his misgivings, Scully was and is an heir of these artists. He is attracted to the “religious, romantic” side of America that gave birth to their sublime art. In the 1970s and 80s, he found a way to infuse that romantic spirituality into paintings that at first glance looked like the regular, uninflected patterns and arrangements with which the minimalist movement sought to cool out their grand elders. He’s still moving shapes about with minimalist simplicity but with unmistakable inner passion. In his Blue paintings, he says, “I try to make abutments and unions and relationships that are difficult, strange, tender, poetic, that reflect all the ways that bodies can come together, that bodies can share something, just like we have to share this planet. I think about all this stuff when I’m making my paintings and that’s kind of what they stand for.” The scale of his paintings also matters hugely, or rather not hugely. “The fact that they’re so small I think makes them vulnerable in some way. And their intimacy is very, very strong. They’re not heroic.”Clearly, he is still searching for the faith he lost as a child, and is deeply drawn to the spiritual dimension in art that made Rothko want to put his paintings in a chapel: “Abstract painting goes straight into your soul. So I think it has to believe in some kind of spiritual power. I mean, that’s its function, because it’s pre-verbal, isn’t it? It goes bang, straight inside.”View image in fullscreen‘I love to go there and mess around’ … the artist in his studio.Photograph: Richard Beaven/The GuardianAs he speaks I can see his paintings downstairs, rivulets and ridges of blue and black and tear-pools of paint that do speak directly to the soul. But I wonder whether it’s the “English” side of his Anglo-Irish identity that has enabled him to renew abstract art. His paintings have a meat-and-potatoes English empiricism, a digging down into real feelings.And Scully really has been shattered. In 1983 his first son, Paul, died in a car accident aged 18. “Those things, they just feed on themselves.” He “went off the rails” with grief. “I have a lot of sadness in me, but I love painting. I love it. I’m so happy in my studio. I go there every day. I love to go there and mess around or prepare something, you know, do something. But when I paint, I paint very, very direct.”He has flown to Paris today from Dublin where he has just opened a show and has another coming up in London. Scully is devoted to family life and dotes on his teenage son Oisin. Not long ago they moved to London for the schools. Now they’re back in New York because Oisin “detested” London. And they’re attending a Catholic church, because even though Scully cannot recover his faith, his son has become interested in religion. In his garden, he has a replica of the bridge from Monet’s garden and beyond it statues of Buddha and an angel. He likes to tease visitors by saying: “You can’t speak loudly because there’s an angel,” as if he believes there’s a real one out there.Go fake yourself! The creators of trippy, four-hour art forgery epic Rohtko on their quest for truthRead moreAbstract painting is still divisive: random squares, dollops of colour are all very well but aren’t they just pretty patterns like wallpaper? Today, a lot of what passes for abstract art is as vacant as dots on wrapping paper. But truly powerful abstract painting, like Scully’s, has a sense of necessity and inevitability: it must be this way. It expresses mysteries that can’t be put in any other form.In spite of his scepticism about Mark Rothko’s chapel, Scully is the only abstract painter around today I would dream of comparing to the Russia-born, Jewish American genius. In the Blue paintings you sense a Rothko-esque mystery and intensity.“When you listen to Nessun Dorma,” he says, again reaching for music as an analogy, “it makes you cry – but you don’t know what the words are. That’s what I’m trying to do. I’m trying to break people’s hearts. I want to make abstraction popular without lowering the bar.”Sean Scully, Blue is atThaddaeus Ropac, Paris, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designSean ScullyPaintingArtFranceinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFans of Jane Austen and Bridgerton delight in recreating historical dances – but how do they learn the right moves?ByPriya BharadiaMon 12 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 10.53 ESTShareInside the high-arched lobby of the Bank of England Museum, lines of women in flowing satin dresses twirl around men wearing stiff collars and black tailcoats. The room is filled with the sound of violins and conversation. The feathers and flowers on dancers’ heads sway as they laugh and chatter.This Jane Austen-themed ball, in celebration of the author’s 250th anniversary, is one of many held by historical dance societies across the country. Enthusiasts of the Regency period, including fans ofNetflix’s Bridgerton, come together to learn and perform the dances enjoyed by Austen and her contemporaries.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDavid Symington, 73, and Irina Porter (above left) became friends through such gatherings. “People who take part in these events get a lot of personal interaction – and that’s something we are gradually losing,” says Porter. “We often change partners, and introduce ourselves to other people. This lovely sense of community and personal interaction is very special.”“It’s a really effective socialising space,” says Gemima Lodge, 40. “You see the same faces and start making connections.”Everyone is so disconnected, stuck behind their phones now. We’re harking back to the old timesCostumes are an important element, with attenders commissioning specialist tailors, hand making their own dresses or sourcing Bridgerton-inspired outfits online. Mary Davidson, 26, and Lian Cooper, 37, sew together Regency-era dresses using old bedsheets, curtains and secondhand sarees. They became friends through their mutual love of historical dance and costume-making.“Everyone is so disconnected, stuck behind their phones now,” says Davidson. “We’re harking back to the old times. People have done this for hundreds of years and it’s really fun and social.”View image in fullscreenPutting on these events takes careful interpretation of 18th-century manuals, which instructed how to perform various social dances (or contredanses, due to partners standing opposite one another). Some, such as John Playford’s 1651 The Dancing Master, contain written instructions for the dances beneath sheet music. Others, such as Thomas Wilson’s, are filled with swirling diagrams known as dance notations, that represent a dancer’s movements across the floor.The Beauchamp-Feuillet system, first published by Raoul-Auger Feuillet in his 1700 book Chorégraphie, recorded the steps of courtly dances in spiralling and geometric patterns. In his 1706 manual for contredanses, Feuillet omitted individual steps and laid out the patterns of how dancers will move across the floor – a system known as Simplified Feuillet. The book was translated into English by John Essex in 1710.View image in fullscreen“It’s the first visual guide we get,” explains Jennifer Thorp, a dance historian and emeritus archivist for New College, Oxford. “You get the tune at the top of the page and then these floor plans telling people where to go. There were occasionally special symbols, because in some contredanses you might clap your hands or wag a finger at your partner. And people actually had the choice of what steps they were going to use.”Dance notation is still used today, particularly in ballet. The Benesh Movement Notation uses five lines, like the stave on a sheet of music, to record the movements of the dancer’s head, shoulders, waist, knees and feet.Paul Cooper, a member of theHampshire Regency Dancers, transforms written instructions and diagrams intoanimationsof Regency dances, making it easier for others to learn. “The instructions, as written, are close to being a computer programme,” says Cooper. “There’s iterative activity and a sort of algorithm to it. There are these little conditional statements: if one dancer does this, the other one does that. It’s all very mathematical in the way it’s expressed. Some of these dancing masters would probably do quite well in the modern world as computer programmers.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPart of his work involves interpreting some of the ambiguities left behind by written instructions. “It’s often quite terse, and invariably leaves you with as many questions as answers. What does this mean? Is there something implied here that isn’t said? How do I go about interpreting that?”Some dances also need to be adapted for modern tastes. The Triple Minor, a popular country dance in Austen’s time, involves three couples in a line that slowly alternate positions. The first couple performs most of the steps, while the third couple does little to nothing – a rare chance for young men and women to share a few words, out of earshot from their chaperones.“But that’s not something we particularly care about in the modern world,” says Cooper. “We’re much more interested in enjoying the dance. So we’ve adapted that into a three couple set, where all of us get a turn at being the first couple, one after another. Everyone gets a pretty much equal amount of activity.”View image in fullscreenCooper met his partner and fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers member, Jorien van der Bor, at a historical dance event. “We were dancing, and I kept tripping on the carpet, and he kept steadying me,” she laughs. “I remember looking at him and going: ‘Oh, he is cute!’’Van der Bor is an experienced caller – a term in country dancing for a person who teaches the dance to a group, and calls out the different moves as the music plays. “You’re orchestrating the room,” she says. “Sometimes, you give the instructions like a metronome all the way through. But I’ve also had groups where people know what they’re doing, and you call it once or twice, and then get quieter and quieter as everyone gets on with it.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThese societies offer history-lovers an opportunity to revive dances that may not have received enough appreciation at the time. The Duke of Kent’s Waltz, dated around 1802, is “quite a swishy” dance for the Hampshire Regency Dancers, according to Van der Bor. “It was probably not well-known at the time, but it’s become a favourite among the modern community.”From a strict, historian’s point of view, we probably shouldn’t be doing itAnother favourite is Mr Beveridge’s Maggot, the slow, stately dance performed by Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice TV adaptation. “From a strict, historian’s point of view, we probably shouldn’t be doing it,” she says. “It’s from well over a century earlier. But many people in our community just love that particular adaptation.”View image in fullscreenHelen Davidge, the caller at the Bank of England Museum ball, puts her favourite as The Duchess of Devonshire’s Reel. It was choreographed byCharles Ignatius Sancho, who was sold into slavery as a child and later became a prominent composer and abolitionist. “It’s very intuitive,” Davidge says. “You’ll do a move and have your partner’s right hand, and the next bit also needs your partner’s right hand. So it’s already in place.”Davidge founded theGeorgettes of Oxforddancing society in 2023. Her interest in historical dance began as a way to build community, marry her love of history and ballet, and enjoy a bit of escapism.“The world is so busy, and sometimes quite a scary place,” she says. “To have a space to just come and focus on your body, dancing and sharing that with other people – it’s a little break from the busyness of life.”Explore more on these topicsDanceJane AustenBridgertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A talented musician and a kind, loving man finally succumbed; despite all efforts.“He will always be loved. Please take a moment to check in with your loved ones so we can stop this happening to our young men.”Sharing the statement on social media, Black Midi’s record label Rough Trade called Kwasniewski-Kelvin “an incredibly talented person who will be truly missed”.Kwasniewski-Kelvin helped to make Black Midi into one of the most talked-about, musically adventurous rock bands in recent years, after meeting the other members at London performing arts institution the Brit School.After being drawn to pop-punk and classic rock as a child, Kwasniewski-Kelvin became fascinated with noise and experimental rock after meeting Black Midi frontman Geordie Greep, and these elements – plus plenty more – coalesced into an energetic, progressive sound on their 2019 debut album Schlagenheim. The band earned a passionate fan following and the album was shortlisted for that year’s Mercury prize. It was also given Pitchfork’s “best new music” rating, with the album described as “magnetic and dazzling”.Kwasniewski-Kelvin left the band in 2021, citing his mental health difficulties. The band said at the time they were “fully behind our best mate in his recovery”. They continued as a trio, recording two more studios albums before splitting in 2024.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He never went to school or university but taught himself, through reading and friendships with artistic, bohemian rural residents, particularly the artists John and Christine Nash. He published more than 40 books in his lifetime, including social history, fiction, poetry, rural nature writing and essays.Helen Melody, the lead curator for contemporary literary and creative archives at theBritish Library, said: “We are delighted to haveacquired Ronald Blythe’s archive, which will be a wonderful resource for Blythe scholars and those interested in the societal and cultural changes that Blythe’s work chronicled.”According to Melody, the archive offers “an amazing insight into the century he lived through because he did a lot of reflecting backwards as well as thinking about contemporary events too”.Blythe’s papers reveal the depths of his research for Akenfield, which tells the vivid and unvarnished story of a Suffolk village through the voices of its inhabitants, young and old. He writes to the Ministry of Agriculture to obtain records of the cows and geese kept in the village of Charsfield, his model for fictionalised Akenfield, while his index cards show he spoke to hundreds of people, seeking out everyone from otter hunters to commuters to create a kaleidoscopic and authentic account of rural life.His notebooks show how his interviews were written up immediately afterwards, almost always from memory, according to Collins.View image in fullscreenBlythe pictured in 1983. He published more than 40 books in his lifetime.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty Images“He listened very, very attentively and he had this incredible memory because he’d been so watchful as a child, and he was very good at catching his interviewees’ voice,” said Collins. “All his books are true but it’s a deeper and broader truth than verbatim. That’s why Akenfield resonates because it’s not just 49 interviews from that period; it’s as though Thomas Hardy was interviewing them. Oral history tells us what people did; Ronnie tells us what people are.”The archive reveals Blythe’s frugality, with the writer reusing index cards, and paper, and cramming as many neat words as possible into each cheap school notebook. Collins said his habits went to the heart of his “genius” as a writer, too. “It’s so neat because he knows that paper is precious, ink is precious and words are precious. Every word has to work so he’s constantly revisiting and honing it down to get the essence of it all. There’s no waste. He hates waste. You’d think that would make him into a puritan but we know from his life he wasn’t that at all – he was a hedonist.”Blythe was a hermetic figure wholived alone on the Essex borderfor most of his life and held a sturdy Anglican faith butCollins’s biographyrevealed his sociability and uninhibited gay sex life, even in rural East Anglia in an era when homosexuality was outlawed.This Blythe is found in the archive’s collection of letters from the American novelist Patricia Highsmith. “Ron” and “Pat” struck up an unlikely friendship andeven slept with each otheron one experimental occasion.The archive includes letters from fans in the US, where Akenfield was a surprise bestseller, and the occasional critical note, such as a missive from the Earl of Stradbroke who criticised Blythe for the honesty of his depictions of the friction, exploitation and misery in neo-feudal relationships between lords, landowners and farm labourers.“Those of us whose families have for generations cared for Suffolk are, I am sure you will understand, jealous that its good name should not be smirched,” wrote Stradbroke.In a characteristically polite but steely reply, Blythe wrote: “Akenfield was never intended to be a public relations exercise for Suffolk but a statement about human nature in the context where I most understood it.”Collins added: “Ronnie was endlessly kind, endlessly gentle and he’s endlessly tough.“It’s an important archive for Britain. He was a humble person but he knew his worth and he always said his papers should go to the British Library. It’s such a rich archive, he is a writers’ writer but also the writer for every person – you can recommend Ronald Blythe to anybody.”Explore more on these topicsBooksBritish LibraryRural affairsSuffolkEssexHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

But the discovery of the footprint of a large Roman villa in a country park on the outskirts of Port Talbot gives an intriguing fresh insight into life here centuries before heavy industry took hold.Found below the surface ofMargam country parkand close to the M4, the presence of the villa – which has been labelled “Port Talbot’s Pompeii” – suggests the area was not on the fringes of the Roman empire but very much part of it and may have been an important agricultural centre.Alex Langlands, an associate professor of heritage and history atSwanseaUniversity, said he was taken aback when ground-penetrating radar suggested the hidden structure could be the largest villa of its kind in Wales.View image in fullscreenAn interpretation of the ground-penetrating survey conducted at Margam country park.Illustration: TerraDat“It’s a lifetime find for me, the park and the community,” said Langlands, the project lead forArchaeoMargam. “We suspected there was something Romano-British there but we didn’t for a moment think it would be as significant as this.“When I saw the footprint of this site, I was like: ‘My word, this is really big.’ It changes the story. Until nowWalesin the Romano-British period has, for the most part, been about legionary forts, Roman practice camps, marching camps, Roman roads.“It’s always been around conquest, which hangs like a lead weight around Wales’s cultural identity in many respects but this paints a different picture. This wasn’t necessarily a frontier zone, an unstable place. The villa suggests, to use a problematic word, that it was civilised.”The villa appears to be set within an enclosure measuring 43 metres by 55 metres. There was a substantial building to the south-east, either a large agricultural storage building or a meeting hall.Langlands said the work so far suggested the Margam villa could be akin to the luxurious homes found in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset.“This may be comparable to the grand stately villas that you’ve got there, which are centres of agriculture. It suddenly feels like we were less out on some windswept frontier.”It is not yet possible to precisely date the site but Langlands said: “I think we’re in the fourth century – it really fits that kind of late Roman flourish that we see in the south-west of Britain.”View image in fullscreenThe team said the park’s use as a deer park had kept the site safe from damage over the centuries.Photograph: Hazel LanglandsHe added that the finding of such a building here may suggest that Margam lent its name to the historic region of Glamorgan. “We’ve jokingly been referring to the site as the Port Talbot Pompeii,” Langlands said. “We don’t have a large settlement like that but what we do have is a high level of preservation because Margam is a deer park.“It’s a deer park today, it was a deer park in the medieval period and it was probably a deer park going back to Romano-British times. That means it hasn’t been subjected to the kind of intensive ploughing that very often does irreparable damage.”Surveys seem to show that floor surfaces and wall foundations are intact. “Fingers crossed, we’re hopeful that we’re going to have a pretty good level of survival in there,” Langlands said.While the next steps on how to investigate the site are planned, the exact spot is being kept secret to deter “nighthawkers”, who illegally dig historical sites.ArchaeoMargam is a collaboration between Swansea University’s Centre forHeritageResearch and Training, Neath Port Talbot council and Margam abbey church.Langlands said: “Margam is famous for bronze age, iron age, medieval and [post-medieval heritage. But we knew practically nothing about what was going on in the Romano-British period. This is the missing piece of the puzzle.”Explore more on these topicsRoman BritainArchaeologyHeritageWalesSwanseaShareReuse this content"

His appointment was clinched by a personal recommendation to the editor fromthe late Alfred Brendel, who argued for Clements to get the job on account of his deep understanding of contemporary music. For the next 32 years, Clements ranged across all fields of classical music in his writing for the Guardian, and often beyond.An outstanding and distinctive critical voice, his deep knowledge and love of music was evident in everything he wrote. He was hugely respected by his fellow critics and the value of his very hard-won five-star reviews was inestimable. While ill health prevented him reviewing live events since March 2025, his lastCD review was published on 2 January.Clements’ musical interests were transformed while still at school as a young flautist when he encountered a work by Pierre Boulez that opened the door to his lifelong engagement with, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, contemporary music. For decades afterwards he could remember almost every concert he ever attended. In all fields of music, he was unafraid to ruffle feathers, happy to stick to his well-formed convictions, and refusing to follow more conservative or orthodox views.Before joining the Guardian, Clements was music critic of the New Statesman and editor of Musical Times. He wrote for the Financial Times between 1979 and 1993. He began his career working as Classical Music books editor at Faber & Faber, and for the Open University after a degree in theoretical physics from Cambridge University.His championing of composers includingHarrison Birtwistle,Hans Abrahamsen,Oliver KnussenandMark-Anthony Turnagehelped to ensure their work was taken seriously by other critics and by musical managements. Solo piano music was also one of Clements’ greatest loves; inone of the last pieces he wrote, he said of the late Romanian musician Radu Lupu: “no pianist I have heard in more than 50 years of recital going has given me more consistent pleasure or a greater sense of wonder.”Outside music, birds, butterflies and orchids were an abiding passion – woe betide an opera designer who got a bird wrong.The sometimes gruff exterior he presented belied a kind and warm nature. He was supportive and generous with his colleagues, quick with praise, patient with questions and penetrating with his insights. Above all, he was always happy to laugh at himself.Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, said: “Andrew Clements wrote about classical music with the utmost passion and precision. His reviews for the Guardian drew on a lifetime of discerning listening and, as well as being illuminating, were always a joy to read.”Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe GuardianNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

As a teenager under General Franco, he read clandestine newspapers from exiled republicans in Tangier.Back in Brazil, he began studying social sciences before moving to Leuven in Belgium and finally to Paris in 1968, drawn by its radical, intellectual ferment. At Nanterre University, he crossed paths withDaniel Cohn-Benditand the future Brazilian presidentFernando Henrique Cardoso, joining the May 1968 protests that shaped his later activism in a Trotskyist group,the Fourth International.That militancy took Paranaguá back to Latin America, where in 1975 he was imprisoned for two years by Argentina’s dictatorship. Stripped of his passport by Brazil’s military regime, he escaped with help from his French contacts, gaining refugee status and returning home only after Brazil’s 1979 amnesty.View image in fullscreen1986 Santiago, Chile:Mujeres por la vida(Women for Life) highlights women’s role in leading human rights protests in the fight for democracy in South America after the military dictatorships of the 1960s and 70s.Photograph: Kena Lorenzini/National History Museum of ChileParanaguá began as a photographer in 1968, then joined the newspaper Jornal do Brasil as its Paris correspondent, later working for Radio France Internationale and finally for Le Monde as editor for Latin America and the Caribbean.Alongside journalism, he became a leading scholar of Latin American cinema, publishingCinema na América Latina: Longe de Deus e Perto de Hollywoodin 1985 and editing volumes on the region’s cultural history.In 2017, he co-authoredHistory of Brazil in 100 Photographs. For this new book, he worked alone. “I appreciate collective work,” he says, “but to tell the story of Latin America, I needed more control.”Rejecting national narratives, Paranaguá builds a connected global history of the region, covering Indigenous peoples, colonisation, slavery and migration – even the non‑Latin Caribbean, from Dutch Suriname to British Belize.“National histories, even those of small countries, are inadequate to explain Latin America’s evolution,” he says. “Connected and global history challenge the old paradigm.”View image in fullscreenA self-portrait at the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu by the Peruvian photographer Martín Chambi, who was among the first to document the archaeological discoveries in Latin America at the turn of the 19th century.Photograph: Archivo Fotográfico Martín ChambiPhotography, he says, expands history beyond politics. “I wanted to develop, alongside political history, the cultural, social and anthropological history of Latin America – all the creativity that defined its identity.”Drawing on archaeological discoveries, Paranaguá revisits the Olmec, Aztec, Inca and Guarani civilisations and the 19th‑ and 20th‑century archaeologists who helped forge national images in Mexico andPeru.He also avoids cliches: the Mexican Revolution is seen through images of female soldiers rather than the usual portraits ofPancho Villaor Zapata; theTrujillo dictatorshipin the Dominican Republic is portrayed through the murdered Mirabal sisters rather than the ‘Generalísimo’ himself.View image in fullscreenPatria, Minerva and María Teresa Mirabal, members of an elite family in the Dominican Republic who were tortured and murdered in 1960 on the orders of Rafael Trujillo, who ruled from 1930 until his death in 1961.Photograph: Casa Museo Hermanas MirabalAlongside the great upheavals – wars, revolutions, dictatorships – appear peripheral yet revealing subjects. Frida Kahlo poses for American photographers, crafting her international persona; Wifredo Lam links surrealism with Afro‑Cuban culture.

The photo of Che Guevara, after the Argentinian revolutionary’s body had been put on display in Vallegrande, Bolivia, reproduced here came from Buenos Aires, not Bolivia. “Some archives have been digitised, but most remain in uneven conditions,” he says.View image in fullscreenA huge pro-Nazi rally in Buenos Aires in 1938.Photograph: Marc Turkow Centre/AMIAHis images connect Latin America’s past to its present, revealing how fascist ideas, inequality and violence endure. A 1938 Nazi rally celebrating the Anschluss at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, filled with swastikas, mirrors the far-right resurgence across the region.“These moments help us understand the present,” Paranaguá says. “Today’s far-right movements are not unprecedented – they echo our past.”National independence, he argues, did not free Latin Americans from entrenched elites. “At the heart of Latin American societies, exclusion is the rule,” he says.Class and corporate interests remain entwined with foreign powers – above all, the United States. “The political regression we are seeing takes us not back to the 20th century, but to the 19th, when the US sought territorial expansion,” he adds.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s President Getúlio Vargas and his US counterpart, Franklin Roosevelt, meet in 1943 to discuss the two countries’ wartime collaboration.Photograph: CPDOC da Fundação Getulio VargasThe legacies of slavery and conquest still shape the region. InBrazil, the violence of colonisation persists in state brutality and urban inequality.View image in fullscreenAcross the continent, Paranaguá says: “A murder is a cluster bomb: it traumatises families, communities and young black people, with impunity and devastating economic impact.”In an age of AI‑generated images, Paranaguá values historical photography for its authenticity. “A photograph, like a letter or document, isn’t the absolute truth but evidence,” he says. “We’ll need ever-stricter criteria to analyse where images come from.”In his latest work, Paranaguá depicts a Latin America that is unstable yet vibrant, brutal yet creative – a mosaic of tragedies and hopes for a fairer future.

The Studio was similarly successful, on the basis that it is simultaneously funny, about the entertainment industry and one episode was literally about the Golden Globes. All deserving winners.‘Timothée Chalamet gained over 60 ounces for Marty Supreme!’: the best quotes from the 2026 Golden GlobesRead moreBut when you dig into the nominations, things become less clearcut.The White Lotuswent into the ceremony with six nods, and came away empty-handed. Five of those nominations were bundled into just two categories – best supporting male actor and best supporting female actor – which meant that the maximum awards it could have won was three. But, still, to come away with none isn’t great.There are a few potential reasons for this. The first is that, now that the show is an ongoing concern with a fourth season already in production, it no longer qualifies as a limited series. Instead, every nomination The White Lotus received this year was in the drama series field, which is much harder to break into.View image in fullscreenBy far the weakest yet … The White Lotus.Photograph: Home Box Office/PABut also, in terms of quality, this was by far the weakest season of The White Lotus. The scripting was especially off, with plots either outstaying their welcome (the robbery) or vanishing without resolution (that weird scene between Leslie Bibb and Parker Posey). Also, you get the sense that this was the year where the off-screen drama outpaced the show itself. Thinking about a fleet of isolated actors losing their minds in the tropical heat was far more fascinating than whatever their characters got up to.View image in fullscreenFew things disappointed as much as this … Severance season two.Photograph: Apple undefinedSimilarly,Severancewas probably expecting a much better night. Nominated for best drama, best actor, best actress and best supporting actor, the show also benefited from being a critical darling. Few things were quite as anticipated as Severance’s second season, but then few things disappointed quite as much as it. What began life as a biting piece of social commentary – surely we all hate work enough to want to switch our brains off during office hours – mutated into screensaver territory, as it attempted to paper over its lack of momentum with needlessly showy direction.In terms of surprises, you could argue that Jean Smart was lucky to receive another award for Hacks, given that the show has just given us its least enjoyable season so far. There has always been a question over exactly how funny Smart’s character Deborah Vance is meant to be, but the late night talkshow format of this season gave her nowhere to hide. As such, the whole season was essentially a lot of people telling Vance that she’s brilliant, then Vance being dismally unfunny in return. Not even an actor of Smart’s quality can sell that.View image in fullscreenNot even an actor of this quality can sell something dismally unfunny … Jean Smart in Hacks.Photograph: HBOHowever, given that Smart’s competitors included Ayo Edebiri, Natasha Lyonne and Jenna Ortega – all of whom star in shows that aren’t really comedies – perhaps her win was inevitable. In fact, let’s blame the Golden Globes themselves for this. Maybe this whole mess could have been avoided if it widened its gaze to look at shows that prioritise comedy over anything else.However, one snub looms above all other snubs this year. And, if you’re reading this in the UK, it’s you. The Pitt won two awards last night – best drama and best actor – just as it has won pretty much everything else. The show can add this haul to its five Emmys, fourTelevisionCritics Association awards and three Astra TV awards.The show has been such a runaway success that it is literally changing how television is being made. Last March, HBO Max CEO Casey Bloys gleefully pointed at how quick and cheap it was to make in comparison with big lumbering beasts like House of the Dragon, and noted that it was a model he’d like to replicate.So, from any angle, The Pitt is an absolute juggernaut of a series. Except none of us would know that, because it isn’t available to watch in the UK. Even though the second season of The Pitt is already showing in the US, and pretty much the rest of the world, we’re left in the wilderness. Apparently we might be getting it in March, when HBO Max arrives here, but that feels too long to keep us from the hottest show of the moment. As such, if there’s one loser to emerge from last night, it’s definitely us.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionGolden Globes 2026AdolescenceSeveranceThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His negative judgment has been shared by many in the near 90 years since Freud’s death. A reputational high-water mark in the postwar period was followed by a collapse, at least in scientific circles, but there are signs of newfound respectability for his ideas, including among those who once rejected him outright. Mark Solms’s latest book,a wide-ranging and engrossing defence of Freud as a scientist and a healer, is a striking contribution to the re-evaluation of a thinker whom WH Auden described as “no more a person now but a whole climate of opinion”.It would be difficult to improve on Solms’s credentials for the task he sets himself. He is a neuroscientist, expert in the neuropsychology of dreams, the author of severalbooks on the relationship between brain and consciousness, a practising psychoanalyst and the editor of the 24-volume revised standard edition ofFreud’s complete works. He is also a wonderfully witty and lucid writer.I read The Only Cure through the lens of its bold – perhaps too bold – title.It contains two claims. First, that psychoanalysis is a cure in the sense that its benefits are lasting and may continue after treatment has been completed. Second, it is the only cure since rival treatments – notably drugs – may lose their effect when they are discontinued because they do not address underlying causes. Solms cites overviews of clinical trials that he believes support these claims. The story he tells seems extremely encouraging – unless, like me, you are obsessional enough to read the papers to which he refers.Solms opens his defence by citing a review that lumps together psychological, educational and behavioural treatments. It is not clear how this makes the case for the specific benefits of psychoanalysis. Moreover, a response to this review from an equally impressive source deems the various therapiesno more effective than a placebo.When Solms homes in on the evidence for what he calls “good old-fashioned psychoanalysis”, he cites the positive findings of an authoritativesystematic overview, but omits reference to the final lines of the paper, which warns against drawing hasty conclusions and calls for “larger studies of higher quality”. A more recent systematic review published in the Lancet Psychiatrywas similarly cautious. Admittedly, the treatment schedule was brief. More relevant, perhaps, is an examination of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapy (at least 50 sessions over a year). This seems to show clear benefit, but again the authors counsel caution “given the low quality of available evidence”.In fairness, researchers in this area face daunting problems. Gold-standard clinical trials are double-blind (meaning neither the patient nor the doctor knows what treatment the patient is receiving until the end of the study); incorporate an appropriate alternative against which to measure the effect of the treatment being tested; require a well-defined, even homogeneous, patient population; have objective, quantifiable measures of outcome, and control for other relevant variables. These criteria cannot be met for psychotherapies.The jury is still out, therefore, as to whether psychoanalysis is a cure, never mind the only cure. At best one can conclude it is as effective as other psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which are, however, less labour intensive.‘We don’t need to rehabilitate every thought Freud had,’ Solms writesNear the end of his life, Freud reflected that better therapies than psychoanalysis might be discovered when we understood more about how the brain worked. Has this hope been fulfilled? Here we might look to drugs such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. Solms accepts that these can complement or supplement psychotherapies, but argues that, since they do not address the fundamental causes of mental health conditions, they are palliative, not curative. He compares prescribing drugs to employing painkillers rather than surgery to treat angina due to a blocked coronary artery.That said, Solms does not dismiss neuroscientific understanding of mental illnesses. This would anyway conflict with his fascinating and laudatory account of the early Freud as a serious contributor to neuroscience, and Freud’s belief that there would ultimately be a convergence between functional models of the mind and physiological ones. In highlighting Freud-the-neuroscientist, Solms distances him from the image of a quack whose theoretical claims were unscientific, not least because, as Karl Popper argued, they were unfalsifiable. This charge underlies the much-quoted joke about the patient who protested to Freud that his dreams were often horrible, disproving the psychoanalytic dogma that dreams are wish fulfilment. To this, Freud responded that horrible dreams fulfil a patient’s wish to upset his therapist.Solms rejects much Freudian orthodoxy, loosening some of the connections between the more notorious and vulnerable theoretical underpinnings of psychoanalysis and its clinical application. “We don’t need to rehabilitate every thought Freud had,” he writes. Articles of faith such as the sexual basis of all pleasures, the death drive, penis envy and the id are discarded. He also deals sceptically with the carnival of characters – among them shrink from hell Jacques Lacan – who developed their own eccentric versions of psychoanalysis.Nevertheless, Freud’s central insight is retained: the longstanding and profound effects of early-life experiences. These are more powerful for being buried. In modern society, an individual’s emotional needs may go unmet for long periods of time, meaning “we can spend our lives under the intoxicating influence of contextually inappropriate emotions”. Solms illustrates this with deeply moving case histories of patients who have been prisoners of unresolved issues from their past, as well as an account of his own psychoanalysis. These cases show that at the heart of psychoanalytic practice is an empathy that enables patients to detoxify their experiences by being allowed to speak about them to a sympathetic and intelligent listener. His description of psychoanalysis as “a re-parenting process” captures its humanity.One particularly compelling story opens and closes the book. Teddy P is a doctor whose professional and personal life disintegrate after his mother’s sudden death. Overwhelming depression, memory loss, sleep disturbance, episodic unconsciousness, headaches, muscle pains and so on attract various diagnoses, which prompt a range of ineffective treatments whose side effects add to his woes. Over four years of therapy, Solms helps Teddy P to exhume his loveless early life and the subsequent inward deflection of aggressive impulses originally felt towards his emotionally unavailable mother. We learn of his ultimate recovery, leading to a happy marriage and work life.The extrapolation from successful cases to a defence of the psychoanalytic approach reminded me of the aphorism “data is not the plural of anecdote”. And Solms’s claim to be able to synthesise “the best of modern neuroscience” with “the core insights of psychoanalysis” remains a promissory note.Notwithstanding lingering doubts about the evidence for the unique clinical efficacy of his cure,Solms has nudged the attitude of this sceptic towards Freudian (or Freudian-inspired) psychoanalysis from scorn to agnosticism. I am prepared to recognise its clinical role, though further research would be welcome. What it delivers in practice will, of course, depend on the personal qualities – above all the acumen and integrity – of the therapist.Professor Raymond Tallis is a clinical neuroscientist and philosopher.The Only Cure: Freud and the Neuroscience of Mental Healing by Mark Solms is published by W&N (£25).

It has a music that lifts it immediately from the page, and, although it questions anticipated regularities of scansion, rhyme scheme and form, these minor instabilities in fact contribute to its effectiveness.The first line, for instance, has various rhythmic possibilities: it works well if scanned as two doubledactyls(“Ifthere weredreamsto sell”), but also fits the bill asiambic trimeter(“Ifthereweredreamstosell”), or, perhaps most appealingly, a combination: “Ifthere weredreamstosell”. Awareness of that flexibility benefits the reading of the subsequent first lines – the first line of the second stanza, for example, which is rather more effective with the slower movement of three iambs: “A cottageloneandstill.”There’s a further shift, in that the poem seems to begin as a personal, rather whimsical question to the reader (“If there were dreams to sell / What would you buy?”: that suggestion of intimacy certainly helps engage us. But in the second stanza, the speaker answers his own question, and we begin to feel the inwards-turning of his thoughts, sustained until the final stanza, where the “you” and the speaker’s “I” again become separate, or apparently so.Regarding the rhyme scheme and stanza-form, the first stanza is distinctive in having 10 lines, with lines one and two repeated unchanged, and a little group of triplets that picks up the “A” rhyme: “sell / tell / bell”. That triplet pattern is dropped in the subsequent nine-lined stanzas. Repetition remains important, though: it’s audible throughout, in the three times recurring “crown / down” rhymes, for instance, and the bigger pattern of question-and-answer.Argument begins to predominate: there had been “dreams to sell” but, the speaker tells himself in stanza three, “ill didst thou buy”. The most urgent question concerns the issue of “ghosts to raise” – a concern born of Beddoes’ practice both in poetry and medicine. His fascination with the gothic in the poems and dramatic writing, Death’s Jest Book in particular, comes from his medical studies, and the serious investigation into post-death spiritual survival. His conclusion that no evidence existed didn’t preclude the poetic argument with mortality.Beddoes’ search for “a dream to prize” centres on the question of which ghost he would “raise”. He refers to those “buried well”, the adverb hinting that there may be a psychological depth desirable for effective burial. A newly rumoured possibility appears: if “life is a dream”, to die may be to wake to a different level of reality.The dreamed-of ghost in stanza iv, ”the loved long-lost boy”, is thought to be the Russian medical student, Benjamin Bernhard Reich, with whom Beddoes lived for a year when he himself was studying medicine at Göttingen. The complexity of the poet’s sense of alienation has gained a new dimension from an increasing recognition of his homosexuality. It was integral to the spectrum of his creative and political rebellion, and to his way of life. In continental Europe, he was mostly a wanderer, essentially homeless. In the poem, the earlier dream of the settled dwelling that would “best heal my ill” has particular pathos.Dream-Pedlary, as it deftly negotiates technical and imaginative integration, shows Beddoes finding his place as a kind of late-Romantic poet: see also his earlytribute to Shelley. At the same time, there’s a self-parodic, almost camp consciousness at work: Romantic tropes beget wry questions, delicate metaphors gain fleshly weight. The first-stanza dream (lines five and six) which costs only “a light sigh” rather than the funeral bell, is revised in the fifth stanza, where the “rose-leaf” and “Life’s fresh crown” reappear, differently balanced. The rose-leaf falls less lightly: the certainty larger than the “crown” is the fact of death, and optimistic inferences can only be paradoxical, perhaps made in pure jest: “Thus are the ghosts to woo; / Thus are all dreams made true, / Ever to last!”The text (sadly, without the indentations) is copied from Edmund Gosse’s 1890 edition of the Poems,which can be read here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But their big winner taps today’s unhappy turbulencePeter BradshawOne Battle After Another engages with the tense climate of the second Trump administration unlike any other contenderMon 12 Jan 2026 01.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 15.35 ESTShareNow that the political scene in the contemporary United States looks like an unending string of military PR coups for the Trumpian right at home and abroad, it’s appropriate that Paul Thomas Anderson’s spectacular, mysterious counterculture epic One Battle After Another – with Leonardo DiCaprio as a clueless, dishevelled ex-revolutionary – should consolidate its current position as one of the leading movies of this awards season: winning four Globes including best musical or comedy and best director forPaul Thomas Anderson– whose fluency, productivity and pure technique and ambition are arguably making him America’s pre-eminent film-maker. The excellent Teyana Taylor got best supporting actress.This is a movie scene in which no mainstream is directly attacking the Trump regime head-on (such as, say, Ali Abbasi’s satirical Trump biopic The Apprentice) but there is something in Anderson’s film that inhales and intuits both the current febrile mood of reactionary hysteria and the tension and depression of those opposing it. Sean Penn wasn’t up for any Globes last night for his role as the bullish and yet pathetic Col Lockjaw in One Battle After Another, the oppressor despised by his masters, but I see a great deal of Lockjaw in Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio, the disposable courtiers uneasily standing ramrod straight behind the president at public events.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley with her award.Photograph: Ariana Ruiz/PI/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockYin to that picture’s yang was Chloé Zhao’s impassioned romantic fantasy Hamnet, which wins best drama and best actress forJessie Buckleyas William Shakespeare’s wife Agnes or Anne Hathaway: Buckley’s award was very well earned, she was the heart and soul of a film which boldly, perhaps even heretically, reached back into the past and speculatively invented William and Agnes’s anguish at the death of their son and created a new fiction that this bereavement fed into Shakespeare’s Hamlet or even governed its creation, almost line by line.It’s not intended as a documentary, but rather a kind of folk myth: for some Hamnet is pedantic and coercive, but I responded to its vehemence, its creative intelligence and its mystery and it’s great to see Buckley rewarded at the Globes.Elsewhere, Josh Safdie’s hellzapoppin’ pingpong comedy Marty Supreme landedTimothée Chalamethis first Globe for actor in a musical or comedy after years of losing out – and it’s an amazing, exhilarating performance from Chalamet, his needy hyperactivity and charm entirely in tune with the rest of the film. What an amazing and distinctive actor Chalamet is, buzzing with energy and movie-star like a plucked guitar string.Nervousness and jittery high anxiety was also the performance keynote in Rose Byrne’s turn in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, for which she was the winner of best actress in a comedy or musical, beating big hitters like Cynthia Erivo and Emma Stone. Certainly 2026 is the unhappy year for this kind of existential disquiet.View image in fullscreenWagner Moura with his award.Photograph: Jim Ruymen/UPI/ShutterstockIt was great to see two Globes going to a film which I think was the best of last year: Kleber Mendonca Filho’s Brazilian movie The Secret Agent, about a scientist on the run from the authorities in 1970s Brazil – it was best non-English language film and Wagner Moura was the night’s winner of best actor in a drama for playing the lead. Perhaps all the obviously big male acting contenders were in the musical/comedy category but nonetheless it was great to see this excellent actor get an award.This was a good list for an award ceremony which has been tarnished by the Golden Globes’s various scandals over membership non-diversity and bribes, although the resulting prizes were never obviously much different from those of other awarding bodies and sometimes more diverse. Some tonight will be very disappointed that Ryan Coogler’s Sinners was not rewarded more than it was – Sinners was not my favourite Coogler film, though I think it’s a shame that Delroy Lindo couldn’t get a supporting actor Globe for his performance.This was an intelligent and serious list of prizewinners, leaving the Oscar field open between One Battle After Another, Hamnet and the delirious Marty Supreme.Explore more on these topicsGolden Globes 2026Paul Thomas AndersonJessie BuckleyTimothée ChalametcommentShareReuse this content"

He was never recognised and finallyconfessed his true selfon his hospital deathbed in 2024, having being diagnosed with terminal cancer.Rairu Sugita plays the young Satoshi, a long-haired, bespectacled radical whose grinning face on his police mugshot made him a national icon, and the older Satoshi is played by Kanji Furutachi. The movie, in its stylised way, gives us the moment of youth transformed to age by having young Satoshi accidentally bump into older, wizened Satoshi on a gloomy country walk and glumly cede his identity to him.What can have been going through Satoshi’s mind all those years? The film imagines him to have embraced, with monkish asceticism, the idea of “escape” as a noble Zen vocation of inactivity. This is not simply a matter of mutely taunting authority and not betraying one’s comrades: it is an existential state of defiance, perhaps even ascending, mysteriously, to something higher than that. But what exactly? And shouldn’t Satoshi have tried to flee the country and promote the cause abroad, just as the director did?It could be that Adachi intendsthe audience to remember Hiroo Onoda, the Japanese soldier who held out in the Philippine jungle from 1945 until 1974, refusing to believe the war was over. But that was a kind of quixotic, tragicomic heroism which Satoshi doesn’t quite have; his life seems more to have been a quasi-accidental embrace of stasis, as he toiled pointlessly away on construction sites. Or perhaps, in a rather pathetic way, his transcendentally inactive revolutionary existence was how he transformed the idea of contrition for those innocent lives lost in the bombings caused by his comrades.Escape is at the ICA, London from 16 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJapanPeriod and historical filmsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Noi and his dad share a cosy home with colourful bunting, sands on the doorstep and views of a stripy lighthouse. The Storm Whale, an adaptation ofthe 2013 picture book by Benji Daviesand its sequel, opens with a romantic ode to the briny air. These gulls swoop majestically, rather than cause a nuisance.Lydia Denno’s designs are idyllic but Davies’s story foregrounds how forlorn Noi (Emily Essery) feels while his dad (Richard Lounds) is away fishing each day. When a little whale is washed up, Noi gratefully befriends the animal before accepting he must set it free. Director Matt Aston’s adaptation, for children aged four to eight, sensitively explores how solitude need not mean loneliness. It’s a lesson passed on to Noi by the mother he has lost, as Aston sketches in a fuller backstory for the family.The script is touching and evocative but its earnest messages also grow repetitive and the dialogue can be wearyingly solemn – you miss the raucous fun of this theatre’sThe Singing Mermaid. Noi’s story is retrospectively framed by his friend Flo (Géhane Strehler), whose references to a midlife crisis will mean little to young audiences. Far better are flights of fancy such as the imagined strawberries-and-cream taste if you licked that lighthouse.View image in fullscreenEvocative … Géhane Strehler as Flo.Photograph: Ferdy EmmetIt’s a shame only one of Noi’s six cats is a fully realised puppet but they are cutely named after coastal towns and, in a sweet touch, the marmalade one is Sandwich. The whale puppet, made by Keith Frederick, is a squishy delight, with quivering tail and glinting eyes. Its sense of wonder is gradually realised through Sue Dacre’s puppet direction.The tempest that washes up the whale is beautifully rendered in Hayley Del Harrison’s choreography to composer Julian Butler’s jig. There are stirring sea shanties, too, and an array of light sources are creatively used in Jason Salvin’s lighting design.While affectionately illustrated, Davies’ original tale is not particularly playful, the language a bit flat. Aside from Noi wrestling the whale into his cart and hiding it in his tub, this unusual partnership lacks the offbeat humour of Oliver Jeffers’ boy-and-penguin double act inLost and Found. There are two set pieces – when Noi returns the whale to the water and, in a less focused second half based onThe Storm Whale in Winter, Noi’s father is rescued at sea. Both scenes are too brief. With wilder humour and a more adventurous spirit, the show would go down a storm.AtLittle Angel Studios, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatrePuppetryLittle Angel theatreChildren's books: 7 and underPicture booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?Keza MacDonaldMon 12 Jan 2026 06.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 12 Jan 2026 13.09 ESTShareLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, buteverythingwas painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.I’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.Traditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.In August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit startedmock-ritually-sacrificingeach other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. AndI love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.Silksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.The journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.Except Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.Hornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.Hampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games areverystressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.Unexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.You can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.Indeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.Giving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one buttwoprecious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.Difficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. Youcanalways win. You just have to try hard enough.View image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.I did not know that Icoulddo things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.After four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksonghashelped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

Getting here without flying or driving from my home in Essex involves three trains, two underground stops, two buses and aferry(foot passengers from £38 each way, cabins from £35). It’s a surprisingly enjoyable adventure: a couple of comfortable hours by rail from London to Liverpool (advance tickets from about £20-25 each way), then a short hop to Hamilton Square and the docks. I fall asleep with a moonlit view of the Mersey and wake before sunrise over Belfast Lough, which I watch from the train window. By mid-morning, I’m on the beach with a post-swim buzz.Breakfasts include a cauldron of porridge with honey and Bushmills whiskey to addInside the glowing castle are hot baths, log fires, slow-cooked Irish beef, hearty bowls of chowder and warm wheaten scones.

The walled garden reopens in spring and hosts a tulip festival in early May. Ancestral seat of the earls of Antrim, Glenarm is home to the 15th earl and family. Their butler, George Lynn, who originally took the job for a couple of weeks and is still here 25 years later, runs perfectly pitched, book-ahead tours of the castle.Exploring Glenarm village, there’s a red sandstone arch with an arrow marked Forest. Following it, I soon reach ferny riverside woods, where little waterfalls pour down through mossy banks and ivy-covered pines, while a red squirrel leaps through the leafless canopy. Heading back as a storm hits the coast at high tide, waves break right on to the bus windscreen. I decide to spend what’s left of the day inside, exploring Ballygally Castle. Through an inscribed stone doorway and up a spiral staircase, the highest room in the tallest tower is said to be haunted by Lady Isabella Shaw, imprisoned here after failing to produce a male heir.Next day, I take the train to Portrush (via Belfast), spotting herons from the window as the train passes Ballycarry station. It’s a 20-minute walk from Ballycarry station to the exhilaratingGobbins cliff path, due to reopen early in 2026 as a newly upgraded circular route.

Strong winds mean the bridge itself is closed today and I stroll the mile-long scenic path to the viewpoint feeling secretly relieved. There’s virtually no other company on this wintry afternoon but sheep on the hillside and bright stonechats perched on the brambles.On my last day, I walk five blustery, dramatic miles of coast path to neighbouring Portstewart, catching a late lilac sunrise over Portrush harbour. Flocks of coral-legged turnstones swirl and scamper; huge gannets plunge into the foaming white waves at 60mph.

I know I still have a few to get through, but, other than that, my fridge and cupboards are looking pretty bare. Beans on toast has always been my go-to meal in times such as these, and when I need comfort, familiarity and ease. What used to involve opening a tin and reheating the contents, however, has now become something slightly more elaborate. But only slightly: these beans are incredibly simple and quick to make, with store-bought antipasti adding real depth.Antipasti beans on toastI like to use about one third pitted olives to a mix of sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes, but use whichever ratio and vegetables you have to hand. And absolutely use the olive oil from the antipasti jars – it is liquid gold.Prep10 minCook35 minServes4Olive oil, or the oil from the antipasti jars4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced2 shallots,peeled and finely sliced250g vegetable antipasti of your choice, chopped (see recipe introduction)1 tsp dried oregano½ tsp sweet smoked paprika1 heapedtbsptomato puree350g passata700g jar cannellini beans, or 2 400g tinsSea salt andblack pepper4 slicesciabatta½ bunch of basil, leaves pickedLeftover cheese, if you likePut a large, ovenproof frying pan or wide, shallow casserole on a medium-low heat, add three tablespoons of olive oil, the garlic and shallots, and fry for five minutes, until they’re starting to soften. Stir in the chopped antipasti, dried oregano and paprika, fry for another five minutes, then stir in the tomato puree followed by the passata, and cannellini beans, including the liquid from the jar. Season well, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a rapid simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 20 minutes, until reduced slightly and rich.When the beans are ready, heat the grill to high. Toast the ciabatta and divide between four plates. Tear most of the basil into the beans, then pop the pan under the hot grill for three to five minutes, until a lovely crust forms on top. Drizzle a little olive oil over each slice of toasted ciabatta, then pile on the beans. Finish with the remaining basil leaves and any leftover cheese you have, and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodBeans, pulses and legumesBreadSnacksMain courseTomatoesVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’ve long enjoyed innovating fusions between west African and other cuisines, and today’s marriage of a deeply flavourful Senegalese chicken yassa-inspired filling in buttery, flaky puff pastry is one of my all-time favourites. But, first, my take on hearty Nigerian stewed beans –ewa riro– using tinned beans for added convenience. Typically paired with ripe plantain, I use the rich beans to fillcanoas(plantain boats) in a playful, Latin American-inspired twist.Plantain boats stuffed with stewed black-eyed beans (pictured top)Dried prawns and west African red palm oil, which areintegral to our cooking (and the latter isnot to be confused with those industrial palm oils that are driving mass deforestation),give this dish its signature umami and uniquely earthy and subtly sweet flavour.Prep25 minCook1 hr 15 minMakes6For the base2400g tins plum tomatoes4 long red sweet peppers, deseeded and cut into chunks1 scotch bonnet, deseeded5 garlic cloves, peeled½ onion, cut into chunks2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled3 tbsp tomato pureeFor the stew180ml red palm oil– you can find this in the world food aisle of larger supermarkets and in African stores2 onions, peeled and sliced1 tbspstock powder1½ tbsp ground smoked prawns– look for them in Asian and African supermarkets6 ripe plantainswith large black patches, peeled3 tbsp melted butter, or ghee, or olive/vegetable oil1 pinch salt1 tsp dried thyme1 tsp white pepper2400g tins black-eyed beans, drained and rinsed700ml water2125g tins skinless and boneless mackerelin oil or brine, drainedFresh herbs(coriander, thyme, parsley), to garnish (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a blender, blitz all the ingredients for the stew base until smooth. In a large, deep pan, melt the palm oil on a medium-high heat until it’s hot enough that a piece of onion sizzles immediately.Fry half the sliced onion with the stock powder and a tablespoon of ground prawns, until softened. Stir in the blended stew base, then cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes, until bubbling, slightly reduced and thickened.Meanwhile, line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and put a rack on top. Coat each peeled plantain with a half-tablespoon of melted butter (or ghee or oil) and transfer to the rack. Sprinkle the plantains with salt and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.During this time, stir the thyme and white pepper into the stew mix and turn down the heat to low-medium. In a medium pot with a lid, cook the beans and the remaining sliced onion in 700ml water on a medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, until very soft. Drain, discard the onion, then set the beans aside.Flip the plantains and bake them for another 15-20 minutes, until cooked through and golden brown all over. Meanwhile, bring the stew to a simmer; it should be reduced and crusting at the edges, with the oil separating. Add the mackerel in chunks, then stir in the cooked beans, mashing them into the stew (you don’t want a paste). Sprinkle in the remaining half-tablespoon of ground prawns.Carefully split open each plantain, cutting into them about 1cm deep. Carefully lengthen and widen the pocket as needed, then stuff with the stewed beans a tablespoon at a time. Garnish with herbs, if you like, and serve.Chicken yassa-inspired pot pieView image in fullscreenToyo Odetunde’s chicken yassa-inspired pot pie.Treacly, caramelised onions, tart mustard and citrus, and briny olives harmoniously elevate the nostalgic comfort of chicken in pastry.Prep15 minMarinate2hr+Cook2 hrServes4-6For the marinade5 garlic cloves,peeled2½cm piecefresh ginger, peeled¼ medium-large onion½scotch bonnet, deseeded1 tspstock powder½ tsp white pepper½ tsp black pepper1 tsp paprika½ tsp rock salt2 tbsp lemon juice2 tbsp dijonmustardFor the pie2320g sheets ready-made puff pastry500gboneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks5 tbspvegetable oil3 large onions, peeled and sliced (about 580g)2 tspbrown sugar1 tsp allspice100ml stock50gpitted green olives1 eggIn a blender or food processor, blitz the garlic, ginger, onion and chilli, adding a little water if needed to make a paste. Tip this into a bowl, add the chicken and the remaining marinade ingredients, toss to coat, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least two hours.Put three tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a deep pan on a medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken, cover with the lid and leave to cook for 15 minutes, until cooked through. Remove the chicken and set aside.Heat the remaining two tablespoons of vegetable oil in the same pot, stir in the sliced onion, cover and cook on a low-medium heat for 15 minutes, until soft.Take off the lid, add the brown sugar and allspice, and turn up the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring regularly, for about 30 minutes, until the mix is deep brown and caramelised; if need be, add splashes of water to stop it burning.Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and olives, simmer on low-medium for five to 10 minutes, then take off the heat.Grease a 22cm shallow pie dish. Fold one pastry sheet in half and gently stretch or roll it to line the base and sides of the pie dish. Spoon the chicken filling into the base and spread it out evenly. Fold the second pastry sheet in half and gently stretch or roll it to top the pie dish. Seal the edges, then trim off any excess pastry. Beat the egg with two tablespoons of water, then brush a thin layer of egg wash all over the top of the pie.Bake at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for an hour, until a deep golden brown. After 45 minutes, cover the pie with baking paper to stop it browning too much.Toyo Odetundeis a food writer and supper club hostExplore more on these topicsFoodWest African food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesChickenPieMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
