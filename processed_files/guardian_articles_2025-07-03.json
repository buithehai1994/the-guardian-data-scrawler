It’s just a normal day for Labour’s happy family of Keir, Rachel and WesJohn CraceStreeting gave a normal speech to show how normal everything was and Starmer tried to channel his most caring selfThu 3 Jul 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 18.05 EDTShareThe show must go on. Less than 48 hours after the government’s welfare bill was left in tatters and a day afterRachel Reevesbreaking down in tears at prime minister’s questions had caused falls in the financial markets, Keir Starmer, his chancellor and the health secretary were keen to present a clean slate.Everything was totally normal. Couldn’t be more normal. This had been just another ordinary week in Westminster. Everyone cries during PMQs at some stage in their career. The kind of thing that happens all the time. So normal that Keir, Rachel andWes Streetinghad come mob-handed to make the same announcement. What could be more normal than that? Denial will get you a long way in politics.First, though, Keir had popped up on the Chris Evans show on Virgin Radio to tell listeners how much he admired Rachel and how central she was to theLabourproject. He and the chancellor were in lockstep. He couldn’t manage without her. She would be around long after he had drifted off the Downing Street mortal coil. She was irreplaceable. He walked in her shadow.Was that enough hyperbole? Keir had more, if more was needed. Simply the best. Better than all the rest. It just made you wonder why he couldn’t have said a simple “yes” when Kemi Badenoch had asked him if Reeves would still be in a job come the next election. That could have saved him, the chancellor and the government a whole world of pain. Not to mention the financial markets. Just a thought.Then to the main event. The launch of the government’s 10-year plan for the NHS. Old lags will need no reminding that previous governments have had countless of their own 10-year plans to save the NHS. All of which have ended with the NHS even further on its knees. These days it often feels as if it is on life support. But hope springs eternal and all that. Today marked the day when the NHS would start its rise from the ashes. This 10-year plan would be different. Provided Labour won the next two elections and got to see it through. What could possibly go wrong?Wes is the ideal warmup man. Invariably chipper and upbeat. Everything is always great in WesWorld. Wes is lucky enough to be one of those who always knows he’s loved by everyone. None more so than by himself. Change is happening around us, he declared. Maybe we wouldn’t even need 10 years. Maybe he could achieve miracles sooner. It just needed people to believe.“Now,” said Wes. I want to introduce you to the woman without whom none of this is possible. The woman who has single-handedly saved not just the whole NHS but the entire UK economy. Please say a huge thank you to … Rachel Reeves.This was, of course, just another perfectly normal speech to show just how normal everything was. No matter that there had been no mention of the chancellor also showing up at the community health centre in Stratford, east London, when the media invitation had been sent out. The note had only promised us the health secretary and the prime minister. But sometime between sundown and sunrise, Rachel had been told she was needed onboard. To show just what a normal, tight-knit family everyone was.You had to feel for Rachel. Here she was as Exhibit A in the battle to keep the Labour roadshow going. Politics as performance. Under the spotlight. Damned if she did, damned if she didn’t. A barrage of questions if she didn’t show her face sometime soon, a barrage of questions if she did. All we had been told was that she had very personal reasons for crying at PMQs and she was planning to keep them private. As if having one of the most stressful jobs in the country and not getting publicly backed by your boss was not personal enough.Reeves had just one job. To look relaxed and smile a lot. She managed half of that. The Autocue had constant reminders. SMILE. SMILE AGAIN. SMILE BETTER. The relaxed bit was not such a success. Happy was hard. Her eyes gave her away. A bit like Gordon Brown trying to be chilled out. She would clearly rather have been anywhere but here. But she said a few dull, instantly forgettable words and it was job done. Her first ordeal after her tears over and done with. There would be questions, which she wouldn’t answer, but then she could try to move on. The next time wouldn’t be so bad.Then came Keir. No mention of WINO. Welfare In Name Only. No mention of Wednesday’s unusual Keir and Rachel show. In this new hyper-normal reality, it was time to focus on all the things Labour had done brilliantly in its first year. Four million more hospital appointments. More houses. Trade deals. And now the 10-year NHS plan. He hated to say this but he was spoiling us.Lives were about to be transformed. Disease prevention. Fat jabs for everyone. Here, Westminster was well ahead of the curve. You’re hard pushed to find an MP of any party who hasn’t managed to secure themselves access to a doctor who will prescribe them a course of weight loss injections.Not forgetting the NHS app. That was going to transform everything. Here I started getting euphoric recall for Matt Hancock. He also had believed in the power of his NHS app. Maybe this new NHS app will be different from Matt’s. Pray for Matt. Last heard of giving evidence to the Covid inquiry.Most of the media questions focused on the chancellor. What had really made her cry? Was she really OK now? Not just putting on an act? Would she really still be in a job in four years’ time? Keir tried to channel his most caring, protective self. Rachel was fine. It had been personal and would remain so. Could we just focus on the Labour success story? After the press conference, Reeves gave a short interview off camera. She was fine. Really fine. SMILE. Things had never been so normal.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe politics sketchKeir StarmerRachel ReevesWes StreetingcommentShareReuse this content"

It is knockout TVHannah J DaviesThu 3 Jul 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 19.46 EDTShareThere’s a scene early on in the first series of Such Brave Girls that sums the whole thing up nicely. Josie – a millennial not long out of a mental health crisis, now just in a general, all-encompassing life crisis – has helped her sister to bleach her hair. Unfortunately, she has neglected to tell Billie that the plastic bag she put over her head has left a massive, Shrek-green Asda logo on the dye job. Billie – who alternates between sweetly naive and absolutely petrifying, with little warning – lunges at Josie and smothers her new dress in ketchup, before threatening to kill herself. The girls’ mother will later attempt to return said dress to the shop – stains and all – feigning tears as she tells the shop assistant how much debt she’s in.Suffice to say, Such Brave Girls isn’t a wholesome coming-of-age affair. It is, however, a brilliant, startlingly feral comedy, one which scooped the scripted comedy Bafta last year (previous winners include Derry Girls, This Country and Peep Show). The subject matter – suicide, abortion, financial ruin, deep-seated abandonment issues – sounds likethe stuff of sadcoms. But what makes it stand out in a post-Waller-Bridge world is that it is an unashamed sitcom, with a regular cast and recurring gags. Think The Inbetweeners, if it had it been written by Julia Davis.It is, in fact, from the twisted mind of Kat Sadler, who plays Josie alongside her real-life sister Lizzie Davidson as Billie; the show, in particular the mental health and debt parts, are loosely based on their own lives. (There is an Inbetweeners connection, though: Simon Bird, AKA Will, is the director.) Along with Sadler and Davidson, Louise Brealey completes the troubled triad as their mum, Deb, who is just as – if not more – self-absorbed and unstable than her daughters (staunchly anti-therapy, at one point she declares that it is only “for celebrities”). Broke thanks to a runaway husband and cosplaying as a widow, Deb pins all her hopes on rich boyfriend Dev (Paul Bazely), “our Willy Wonka ticket out of fucking hell” and an actual widower. Billie, meanwhile, is both impressively nonchalant – she pitches up at an abortion clinic in the witch’s outfit from her job at Kidz Cauldron – and dangerously obsessed with on-off boyfriend Nicky (Sam Buchanan).‘Who else can we annoy with our show?’: Such Brave Girls, Britain’s most gleefully offensive comedy returnsRead moreIf Billie often feels like Blanche DuBois for the TikTok generation, Josie is a more muted presence. Controlled by her sister, mother and a boyfriend she can’t stand (because she’s secretly queer), she is often afforded only a supporting role in her own life story.Series two arrives with only a smattering of preview episodes and a spoiler list that makes writing about it feel like navigating a hallway blocked by lasers. What I can say, though, is that it’s excellent, and that Josie is still completely overpowered: episode one begins with Deb and Billie forcibly removing her from an art school lecture and sticking a bag over her head to get her to comply with their latest scheme. Still repulsed by the idea of having any sort of sexual contact with Seb (Freddie Meredith), Josie becomes fixated on a fellow student, a girl named Charlie. What unfolds takes us to even darker places than series one.Sadler’s performance during Josie’s long-awaited NHS mental health assessment, in particular, is at once terrifyingly unpredictable and a complete hoot. Billie says of her sister’s unconvincing display of sanity: “Your mouth’s doing the right thing, but your eyes are trying to call the Samaritans.” Not that she is doing much better, having embarked on an inadvisable affair with an older man named Graham (he told her he wasn’t married, she told him she was 15), launching herself at him at every opportunity then rebranding herself as a sugar baby when he pays her to leave him alone.Deb’s mental state is disintegrating, too, along with her finances, and we see her careening to the supermarket on a scooter, card declined at the till. The rest of the cast remain just as compellingly pathetic, and the decision to make Seb and Dev co-workers at a banal, Wernham Hogg-esque office is a neat trick to guarantee enough screen time for both.Such Brave Girls won’t be to everyone’s tastes. In fact, there are plenty of people I can imagine not rolling about at lines like “I heard she gets a smear test every week just so someone has to look at her vagina”, or revelling in the sheer lack of empathy that every single character here has for one another. But if you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout. Josie is pretty brave, but Sadler is even braver.Such Brave Girls aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now in the UK and on Stan in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyComedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m a musician and Oasis have been a very big influence on my life and my career.” The couple last saw the band perform in 2009, and they have tickets for one of the two Japan dates in October as well as Cardiff on Friday.The masterplan: Alexis Petridis on his dream Oasis tour setlistRead more“We were worried they might not stay together until Tokyo, so we decided to take a road trip in Wales too so we will definitely get to see them,” he added.Elinor Maizey and her two friends, all 18, also stopped to look at the mural. “We weren’t around for the Britpop era, obviously, but we know the songs,” she said.“I’m actually a Blur fan. I’m in a longstanding argument with my music teacher over whether Blur or Oasis are better … He tried to get tickets for Oasis but the sellers went silent on him twice and he’s gutted,” the Cardiff student said.View image in fullscreenElinor Maizey is more of a Blur fan but knows all of Oasis’s songs.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianThe build up to the tour’s opening gig in Cardiff on Friday will be broadcast by the BBC before Oasis head to Manchester, their home town, for five nights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gallaghers are reportedly in line to earn £50m each –more than they made in the entire 1990s, at the height of their fame – and by some estimates the gigs will inject £940m into the UK economy.“Oasis are an important band, maybe they are a bit past it now. We’ll find out on Friday,” said Graham Coath, 53, a music podcaster from Somerset, who was in Cardiff to seeAlanis Morissette, another 1990s alt-rock icon, play on Wednesday night.“It would have been nice to see them bring some up-and-coming talent and local musicians with them on this tour, pay it forward a bit,” he added.View image in fullscreenMorgan Philp, who works at the City Arms pub in Cardiff near the stadium, expects it to be like a rugby day.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianAbout 149,000 concert-goers are expected to visit Cardiff over the weekend.

But Jota’s footballing talent, heart and will should be cherished, amid the griefThu 3 Jul 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 15.28 EDTShareBad moon, bad times and a river that will be overflowing for some time yet. It is impossible not to feel a deep sense of pain, sadness and shared heartbreak at news of the sudden death of Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva in a car crash in Spain. Jota was 28, father to three young children and a husband to his long-term partner, whom he married 11 days before his death.Things that happen in sport are often described, with due dramatic licence, as tragedies. This is not a sports story. But it is the most terrible human tragedy. Those who have suffered similarly can empathise. But it is above all a private horror, an event that will alter the lives of family and friends for ever.And yet it is of course a sport story too, and for good, warm, vital reasons, because Jota was blessed with the talent, heart and will that qualified him to live the extraordinary public life of a modern-day elite footballer. Within that nexus he was able to do so with the grace, humour and commitment that made him a beloved teammate and fan favourite, and also a fine public sporting figure, an athlete who poured energy, life and love into providing moments of uplift and connection in the shirts ofLiverpool, Wolves, Porto, Portugal and his first club, Paços de Ferreira.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota scores for Porto in their Champions League match against Leicester in December 2016.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesThere is no sensible response when someone dies so young, with an entire second human life as father and husband still to be lived. But at a time when footballers are present constantly in our lives, when to exist in that form is to carry a distinct kind of responsibility – one players such as Jota gladly assume – his death will be a source of much public grief too.Everybody liked Diogo Jota. Those who saw him progress from his Porto neighbourhood of Gondomar felt a huge sense of pride. Liverpool supporters cherished his presence, his intelligence and his hunger for the team. Three years ago he got the song his contributions deserved:He’s a lad fromPortugal/Better than Figo don’t you know, to the tune of Argentina’s 2014 World Cup final hymn, which is in turn derived and football-ised from Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Bad Moon Rising.And even in the immediate shock there is a huge amount to remember and be glad of in the life of Diogo José Teixeira da Silva, the Portuguese word for the letter J added early on as a footballing nickname. He came through at Paços de Ferreira to the north-east of his home city. Atlético Madrid signed him and loaned him to Porto and then Wolves, which became permanent in 2018.He settled instantly in Wolverhampton,hanging out at the Aromas de Portugal cafein the city centre, welcoming his first child, playing a bit of training-ground cricket, always ready to meet local people, and even revealing at one point that he’d grown up with a soft spot for Everton in the David Moyes years, because they were “relentless”.Nobody was ever going to hold that against Jota at Anfield. Have you met this guy? Too nice, too smart, too much of an all-round mensch.He signed in September 2020and set off like a train, scoring seven goals in his first 10 games and adding speed, drive and expert finishing to that mid-Klopp team.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota (left) with his then Wolves teammates Rúben Neves outside the Aromas De Portugal cafe in September 2018.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianOverall, and we must now sayfinally, Jota played 182 matches for Liverpool in a revolving folk‑hero frontline that also featured Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino, Divock Origi, Luis Díaz, Cody Gakpo and Darwin Núñez. Even within that extended cast he was distinct, notable for his intelligence, movement and commitment to the team cause. He made 49 appearances for Portugal and played the last 15 minutes ofthe Nations League final victoryfour weeks ago, which would turn out to be his last game of football.And now we have this, a full stop. Why does it seem quite so shocking, even from a distance, even beyond the fans who watched him in the flesh or on some fast-cut remote stream? Perhaps because Jota had that lightness about him, the kind of footballer who barely seems to leave a dent in the grass, who, for all the tactical match-smarts seems still to be playing the same endless teenage game, just in the way he moved and twirled into space.Perhaps because he was a notably intelligent forward, one of those players where you feel you know them just by watching them, every run and pass part of some high-speed internal monologue.Nothing will ease the private grief. There is no script for moments like theseProbably it has something to do with the way we observe sports people now generally, something to do with the way the game has become more remote, the connection coming in other ways, through the figures on the screen, the way they move and react, a strange kind of public-private intimacy.Plus, of course, this is just such a violent interruption. It makes no sense. Youth is a finite quality. But young, smart, beautiful, nice people are supposed to live for ever. Whereas in reality it is perhaps a blessing this doesn’t happen more often. Professional athletes live hugely intense, fast‑paced lives of constant travel and change. Rishabh Pant, who batted on Wednesday for India at Edgbaston, was lucky to escape with his life after a horrific car crash in Uttarakhand in December 2022,and is additionally cherishedfor every day he gets to keep on doing this.2:27Diogo Jota, Liverpool and Portugal footballer, dies aged 28 – videoJota will now be cherished instead as a vivid and indelible memory. He always spoke really well, which was part of that feeling of intimacy. After scoringa late winner against Tottenhamtwo years ago there was a notably lucid TV interview in which he gave an insight into his own connection to the moment after Liverpool had been pegged back late on.“I remember Robbo [Andy Robertson] telling me to go on because we normally play that long ball – to go on and believe, and you could feel that was already a good sign. We did that, we won the second ball, we played back, we played again in behind and I could intercept a pass and score the winner. It was amazing.“It doesn’t require too much thinking. I think the moment there that I believed I could intercept was key because I started running in behind and I saw their full-back could pass the ball back. That was the key moment for me and then it was just: ‘Make sure you control it right and you hit the target,’ and hopefully it’s in – and it was!”View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota scores Liverpool’s winner in April 2023 after Tottenham had come back to level from 3-0 down.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesJota also mentioned his song that day, which was sung relentlessly around Anfield at full-time, a coronational moment in a career that had begun in the hush of Covid.“In my first season I scored a few winners as well, late, but there was no crowd and everybody was telling me: ‘You should see it if this was full,’ the feeling, and I could feel that tonight. It was something special that I will remember for ever.”The reverse is of course now true. Anfield will remember Diogo Jota for ever. Nothing will ease the private grief. There is no script for moments like these. But for what it’s worth that song and the feeling behind it will provide its own fond, rolling Viking funeral in the years to come.Explore more on these topicsFootballLiverpoolPortugal (World news)Portugal (Football)Wolverhampton WandererscommentShareReuse this content"

We like to have a good moan. When people hear a regional accent, they immediately make assumptions about your class, financial status and education. People generally think if you’ve got a strong regional accent, you can’t do much else. Obviously there are amazing actors like Jodie Comer who smash that to pieces because people don’t realise she’s from Liverpool. But because I came out the traps with the northern accent it’s probably helped.Do you ever suffer from impostor syndrome and think: “Why arepeople so fascinated by me?”RealEdPhillipsI don’t ever think people are – I think they are generally quite bored by me! Of course I have impostor syndrome. When you don’t get a job, you can’t help but think: “Why didn’t I get that job? Why don’t they think I’m good enough?” So there’s a healthy balance of inferiority complex and slightly prickly ego.What are your memories of filmingFunny Cow?Michel3AmsterdamWe had such a good time because it was made with a bunch of friends. We managed to twist Paddy Considine’s arm to be part of it. We had Stephen Graham, Christine Bottomley, John Bishop. All these amazing people, so it was quite colourful. I have always been fascinated by female comics’ journeys through working men’s clubs in the 70s, and the sacrifices and compromises they had to make. The material they were using was horrific, really. It was all about: “How do you get noticed?” The answer was: “If you can’t beat them, join them.” The politics of the 70s seemed to come crashing down as we were filming it, with Brexit.

Once I started writing about Beryl, I joined a club and went on my first 50km ride and nearly died. But then I became addicted, and would go out three times a week and do 70 or 80km. So, yes, I was inspired by Beryl. I love the camaraderie and the freedom. It’s like being a kid, getting on your bike with your pals. It’s great.Would you like to do more nihilistic action hero stuff, like you did inBlack Mirror?ColdCountyHomeView image in fullscreen‘Count me in’ … Peake in Black Mirror: Metalhead.Photograph: Jonathan Prime/NetflixI remember an email came through saying: “You’ve been offered Black Mirror, can you read the script quickly and let us know?” I said: “I don’t need to read it.

He loves actors. He has such a specific way of rehearsing and character development, but he’s so thorough and – I don’t know whether he’d like me saying – humble. There are no airs and graces about him. He’s so passionate about what he does, and I just love the fact that he loves actors.Words of War review – Maxine Peake leads line as murdered Putin-critic journalist Anna PolitkovskayaRead moreHappy Birthday!

I binged Zombie Flesh Eaters and Slaughtered Vomit Dolls to find outThe ‘obscene’ movies once banned in the UK are now mostly freely available. Are these tales of cannibals and the undead antiquated schlock or genuinely repellent?Stuart HeritageThu 3 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 12.32 EDTShareLater this month, the cult film service Arrow will do something that would once have plunged the UK into screaming fits of utter chaos. That’s right, it’s going to stream Zombie Flesh Eaters.The film comes with a tremendously confusing backstory. In Italy, George A Romero’s Dawn of the Dead was recut by Dario Argento and retitled Zombi. Zombi, no relation to Bambi, was such a success that a sequel was commissioned, using the script of an unmade movie entitled Nightmare Island. This film became Zombi 2. In the UK, Zombi 2 was renamed Zombie Flesh Eaters. And then it was banned.Look at the head on that! Bottoms up to a pint of 28 Years Later beerRead moreThis was largely down to the campaign waged against so-called “video nasties” in the early 1980s. Driven by newspaper front pages screaming things like “BAN VIDEO SADISM NOW”, police officers began conducting raids on video shops, confiscating anything they saw as breaching the Obscene Publications Act.The confiscations felt arbitrary (in Slough, officers seized Dolly Parton’s The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, under the impression it was pornography), but eventually 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the act. Zombie Flesh Eaters was one of them. And now its unimaginable horrors are available to stream, uncut and in pin-sharp 4K.In truth, it’s been around for a while. Around the turn of the century, the BBFC loosened its regulations, and the banned films began to trickle out. Not all of them – 1969’s Nazi sex film Love Camp 7 is still routinely refused a certificate, as is the thematically similar Gestapo’s Last Orgy – but Zombie Flesh Eaters has been available to legally watch uncut for two decades now.View image in fullscreenMore fleshed out … Cannibal Holocaust.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveWhich means that I probably should have watched it by now. After all, if you grew up in the 80s and 90s like I did, nothing gave a movie more cachet than being banned. All these films had a too-hot-for-TV thrill to them; if you weren’t allowed to watch them, they had to be good. And yet I never got around to watching Zombie Flesh Eaters.Turns out I didn’t need to bother. Not because the Thatcher government was right and the film has turned me into a depraved subversive, but because it lumbers on for ever, grinding through endless overlong, overacted dialogue scenes that go nowhere and do nothing. Admittedly there are hints of gleeful gore here and there. In one scene a woman’s eyeball is impaled, and there’s a tremendous underwater sequence with a zombie, a topless woman and what appears to be an actual live shark. Maybe there was some religious outrage that has lost its impact over the years (OK, a zombie does get its head caved in with a crucifix), but otherwise it contains nothing that wouldn’t be found in a workaday Game of Thrones episode.Would it get banned today? Unlikely. In an age where Damien Leone can release threeTerrifiermovies (where, variously, a man is chainsawed to death through his scrotum and a woman has a rat-filled pipe hammered down her throat), it’s practically daytime television. I grew up scared and fascinated by the prospect of Zombie Flesh Eaters corrupting my mind. Now that I have actually seen it, I’m afraid to report that Zombie Flesh Eaters is no Zombie Flesh Eaters.Were all the banned films like that? Has society moved on so much that everything we once feared would undo society has become unimaginably hokey? I decided to watch some of the other 39 films to find out. I started with the most notorious, John Alan Schwartz’s Faces of Death.View image in fullscreenHarrowing … Faces of Death.Photograph: Courtesy: John FeliceNo film was arguably bolstered more by a banning than Faces of Death. A mockumentary that combines unaired news footage with material shot for the film, Faces of Death presented itself as a compilation of every kind of death: accidents, executions, suicide, cannibalism. Back when nobody could see it, it sounded like a kind of aggressively violent precursor to You’ve Been Framed. But that isn’t what it is at all. It is, in fact, a harrowing look at human suffering. There’s Holocaust footage. There are starving children. There’s violence against animals (staged) and footage of body parts scattered across the ground following a plane crash (real). It is, to put it lightly, an incredible bummer to watch.Despite its reputation, Ruggero Deodato’s Cannibal Holocaust was slightly easier to watch. You can understand the nerves around releasing it – it features graphic sexual violence, and more than one scene of animals being killed – but at least it had the benefit of having an identifiable point of view. The film is a satire about cultural appropriation and media sensationalism, in which an American documentary crew travel to the Amazon rainforest and get in over their heads. Which in terms of intent puts it above a lot of the other banned films, but the execution muddles the message. After all, if you have to kill an animal to make a point about media sensationalism, you’ve already lost the argument.And then there’s Meir Zarchi’s I Spit on Your Grave, a film that lacks either the intellectual rigour of Cannibal Holocaust or the fun of Zombie Flesh Eaters. It is one of the least enjoyable films I have ever watched.I Spit on Your Grave is a film in which a woman exacts revenge against a group of men who gang rape her. It was banned in the UK, as well as in Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and West Germany. This is likely due to the point of the film being the rape itself. So much time is dedicated to the rape sequence that the revenge part feels tacked on, as if it wants to trick you into thinking that it’s a feminist film. It’s worth pointing out that I Spit on Your Grave still hasn’t been released here uncut – some heavily eroticised rape scenes still contravene BBFC guidance – but the edited version available on Amazon Prime was still so unpleasant that it represents the only time I have ever welcomed the intrusion of interstitial ads.View image in fullscreenSickening … Slaughtered Vomit Dolls.Photograph: MUBIAnd yet by modern standards, even these video nasties pale next to what is now circulating online. For the purposes of this feature, my editor ushered me towards a 2006 film called Slaughtered Vomit Dolls, part of Lucifer Valentine’s Vomit Gore trilogy, along with ReGOREgitated Sacrifice and Slow Torture Puke Chamber. A surreal satanist film about a woman with an eating disorder, Slaughtered Vomit Dolls contains scenes of torture and several scenes in which people vomit various fluids, some of which are gobbled straight back up. It was awful. If this was 1983, it would have been banned in a heartbeat.Because time has rendered Zombie Flesh Eaters so quaint, my assumption was that all the other banned films would be equally silly and kitschy. After all, we’re talking about a government so jumpy that it also banned the third word in the title of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But that isn’t the case, since a lot of these films are still genuinely repellent. What has changed, though, is our attitude to them. Clearly, banning them only served to boost their reputation, whereas if they had been allowed to remain in public, I’m convinced that they would have all died in obscurity decades ago. In other words, less “BAN VIDEO SADISM NOW” and more “LET’S WATCH SOMETHING THAT’S ACTUALLY GOOD”.Zombie Flesh Eaters is available to stream onArrowand on Limited Edition 4K UHD from 28 JulyInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

While Corbyn has long hinted at plans to establish a more organised vehicle for leftwing and pro-Palestinian campaigning, he has so far avoided confirming any formal structure or leadership arrangements.Corbyn, 76, has not committed to the project becoming a party, or endorsed any specific leadership roles. The Guardian understands he was frustrated by Sultana’s unilateral announcement, which some regard as premature and potentially counterproductive.So far, he has confined his public comments to cautious remarks about the group “coming together” and “offering an alternative”, without outlining further details.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme this week, he confirmed talks were under way but did not rule out other possibilities. “That grouping [of independents] will come together, there will be an alternative,” he said.Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, is reluctant to take on the title of leader – as consistent with his preference for collective decision-making – and is believed to think that imposing a hierarchy too soon would risk fragmenting the already fragile coalition he spent months encouraging to work together.Sultana was first elected in December 2019 and has sat in the Commons as an independent MP since September last year, having had theLabourwhip removed after voting to abolish the two-child benefit cap.In a statement at the time, she said she would “do it again” and accused the government of seeking to make disabled people suffer.Corbyn led Labour from 2015 to 2020 before he was suspended over his response to the party’s antisemitism report. He retained his Islington North seat last year as an independent candidate.The Independent Alliance includes four other independent MPs who all beat Labour candidates and MPs over the party’s position on Gaza. The group has the same number of MPs – five – as Reform UK and the Democratic Unionist party, and more than the Green party and Plaid Cymru (four each).In her full statement, Sultana added: “A year ago I was suspended by the Labour party for voting to abolish the two-child benefit cap and lift 400,000 children out of poverty. I’d do it again.“I voted against scrapping winter fuel payments for pensioners. I’d do it again. Now, the government wants to make disabled people suffer; they just can’t decide how much.”After a year studying Starmer, I can tell you that he is at once a very kind man and a ruthless one | Anushka AsthanaRead moreThe move could dismantle the left-of-centre vote and present a headache for Starmer, who has repositioned Labour in the political centre.Corbyn’s group includes Shockat Adam, the MP for Leicester South; Ayoub Khan, the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr; Adnan Hussain, the MP for Blackburn; and Iqbal Mohamed, the MP for Dewsbury and Batley.Before Sultana’s statement, Corbyn had said any new party would focus on poverty, inequality and a foreign policy “based on peace rather than war”. Asked if he would lead the party, he said: “I’m here to work – I’m here to serve the people in the way I’ve always tried to do.“The Alliance group of MPs has worked very hard and very well together over the past year in parliament, and we’re coming up to our first anniversary.”Last September,Corbyn addressed a meetingto prepare for a leftwing political partynamed Collectivewhich was also attended by the former Unite general secretary Len McCluskey and a number of former independent candidates.Key figures in the group said they hoped the party would act as an incubator for future leaders who could replace Corbyn as a figurehead of the left, and aim to contest seats at the next general election.At the private meeting, founders said they would begin drawing up democratic structures for a new party to launch.A source close to Corbyn said his attendance was not an official endorsement and that he had attended the meeting to “listen to and share a variety of views about the way forward for the left”.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

If that bet doesn’t pay off the NHS could face an even larger staffing crisis.”By 2028 the app will let patients access a new single patient record containing details of previous interactions with the NHS such as tests, operations and outpatient appointments.The prime minister, Keir Starmer, told an audience of frontline staff in east London: “Look at your phones, look at your apps — because what you see on that screen is that entire industries have reorganised around apps. Retail, transport, finance, weather — you name it. Why can’t we do that with health?”He said: “We will transform the NHS app so it becomes an indispensable part of life for everyone. It will become, as technology develops, like having a doctor in your pocket, providing you with 24-hour advice, seven days a week.”The NHS’s embrace of tech to tackle its ills will also involve AI taking notes during GPs’ and hospital doctors’ consultations with patients and use generative AI to create the first draft of care plans, in an effort to give clinicians more time with the sick.In a move designed to drive up standards of care, patients will be able to see the data underpinning the rankings of hospital league tables, which will be published for the first time this summer – such as waiting times, how patients have rated particular services, and details of their clinical outcomes – and use it to choose the NHS trust where they will have their next treatment.Expanding the role of technology to help the NHS “could be a real gamechanger”, said Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have a lot more work to do and we will do it.“But let’s be under no illusions. Because of the fair choices we made, the tough Labour decisions we made, the future already looks better for our NHS.”The plan makes clear that in future, the more prevention-focused NHS will operate on the basis that “care should happen as locally as it can; [be] digitally by default; in a patient’s home if possible; in a neighbourhood health centre when needed; [and] in a hospital if necessary”.Over the next few years, billions of pounds of NHS funding will be taken away from hospitals and used to create a network of new one-stop-shop-style neighbourhood health centres “in every community” offering a range of services, including diagnostic tests and mental health support. However, it is unclear how many there will be or when they will open.Dr Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of theHealthFoundation, warned that even Labour’s cash injection would not be enough to fulfil its pledge to “get the NHS back on its feet”.“Making the plan happen with the resources on offer will be tough,” she said, given that the average 2.8% rise in the NHS’s budget from 2026 to 2029 was well below its historical average of 3.7%.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyWes StreetingNHSHospitalsPublic services policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It focused on inquiries for typical first-time buyer properties, that is those with a maximum of two bedrooms.It revealed that number two on its “city hotspots” list wasEdinburgh, followed by three locations in England: Doncaster, Liverpool and Plymouth.Its findings provide fresh evidence that the pandemic-fuelled “exodus from the city” – or at least the fantasies that millions harboured aboutrelocating to a coastal or rural area– was, statistically speaking, something of a blip.Areas that estate agents were naming as property hotspots in 2020 included the fishing village of Port Isaac in Cornwall, the seaside towns of Margate in Kent and Clevedon in north Somerset, and Canford Cliffs, a suburb of Poole in Dorset.Rightmove issued a list in January 2022 ofthe 10 most popular homebuyer search hotspotsfor the previous year, all of which were either villages or located near the sea. Rhos-on-Sea, a small seaside town near Colwyn Bay in north Wales, topped the list.Fast-forward to today and the property website said that while more potential first-time buyers were looking to move to cities, the number contemplating popular coastal areas was “completely flat compared with 10 years ago”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall first-time buyer demand in the capital is down by 7% versus 10 years ago. That is thought to be in large part because of the capital’s higher property prices, which have locked many out of the housing market.First-time buyer demand in Dundee jumped by 176% over the period. On the banks of the River Tay, the city has developed a reputation asa vibrant arts and culture hubin recent years. It is also said to have more urban green space per head of population than anywhere else in the UK.Much of its popularity with would-be first-time buyers is also likely to be down to its relatively affordable housing.Official data issued last monthshowed that the average price paid by first-time buyers was just under £121,000 in April this year, compared with £156,800 for Scotland as a whole and £223,400 across Great Britain.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketPropertyReal estateDundeeScotlandDoncasterLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Russia’s foreign affairs ministry also confirmed the news to the Tass news agency.The move comes shortly after Gul Hassan, a Taliban diplomat, assumed the role of Kabul’s ambassador to Moscow.Moscow has taken steps to normalise relations with the Taliban government, removing its designation as a “terrorist organisation” in April and inviting representatives to official events.Russia was the first country to open a business representative office in Kabul after the Taliban takeover, and has announced plans to use Afghanistan as a transit hub for gas heading to south-east Asia.In July 2024, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, called the Taliban “allies in the fight against terrorism”.Only Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates recognised the Taliban during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.This time, multiple other states, including China and Pakistan, have accepted Taliban ambassadors in their capitals, but have not officially recognised Afghanistan as an Islamic emirate.However, their restrictions on women and girls – barring them from education and squeezing them from public life – have been key sticking points for other nations.The Taliban authorities have keenly sought international recognition and investment, as the country recovers from four decades of war, including the Soviet invasion from 1979 to 1989.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaRussiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

No foul play is suspected, the sheriff’s department confirmed, after deputies responded to the Los Angeles county home following a call to the emergency services on Thursday morning.Michael Madsen’s brooding charisma needed Tarantino to unlock it | Peter BradshawRead moreHe was pronounced dead at 8.25am. In an email, Madsen’s manager, Ron Smith, confirmed his client had died from cardiac arrest.A statement from Smith and another manager, Susan Ferris, along with publicist Liz Rodriguez said:“In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life.“Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears for My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems, currently being edited. Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood’s most iconic actors, who will be missed by many.”View image in fullscreenMadsen in Reservoir Dogs (1992).Photograph: Cinetext/Rank/AllstarOver a four-decade career, Madsen had won acclaim for his portrayals of often enigmatic and frequently wise-cracking tough guys in films including Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Reservoir Dogs, Thelma & Louise and Donnie Brasco.He also features in later Tarantino films including The Hateful Eight and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Other credits among the 346 listed on IMDb include The Doors, Free Willy, Species, Die Another Day, Sin City and Scary Movie 4.Michael Madsen: Mr Blonde’s ambitionRead moreMadsen began his career in Chicago as part of the Steppenwolf Theatre company as as apprentice to John Malkovich before debuting on the big screen in the 1983 sci-fi WarGames. His global breakthrough came in 1992 when he played the menacing criminal Mr Blonde in Tarantino’s feature debut, Reservoir Dogs.Madsen’s performance won acclaim for its fleet-footed menace and unreadable joviality – despite the actor originally desiring the part of Mr Pink,(eventually played by Steve Buscemi), because it featured more scenes alongside his hero Harvey Keitel.Despite teaming up with Tarantino again for Kill Bill: Vol. 1 11 years later, Madsen missed out on a number of significant film roles that might have expanded the scope of his career, including the leads in LA Confidential and Natural Born Killers.Speaking to the Guardian in 2004, he expressed frustration with some fellow film-makers for passing him over for parts, as well as with what he perceived as a wider lack of care within the industry.View image in fullscreenMadsen in Donnie Brasco (1997).Photograph: TRISTAR/Allstar“When I was really down and out,” he said, “and I was just ready to flatline, you would think that an element of Hollywood would try to hold you up, just keep you going. I mean, everybody pretty much knows that I’m a father. A lot of people have made a lot of money with me involved in their projects, so if only for that reason. But no – nothing was happening.”Madsen also ascribed the “patchiness” of his career to a being a man out of time. “Maybe I was just born in the wrong era,” he said. “I’m a bit of a throwback to the days of black-and-white movies. Those guys back then, they had a certain kind of directness about them. A lot of the screenplays, the plots were very simplistic – they gave rise to a type of antihero that maybe I suit better.”The actor also said he felt more at home with traditional male pursuits than in performance. “All the putting on makeup and dressing up in clothes,’ he says. ‘And you got to be a bit self-centred to pull it off. I guess it’s just the way I was brought up. For me, it’s more masculine to dig ditches or drive a tow truck.”The brother of actor Virginia Madsen, he was married three times and had seven children, one of whom pre-deceased him.Virginia Madsen paid tribute to her older brother on Thursday with a statement toVariety. The two mutually supported their careers over the years, often attending each other’s red carpets.“My brother Michael has left the stage,” Virginia wrote. “He was thunder and velvet. Mischief wrapped in tenderness. A poet disguised as an outlaw. A father, a son, a brother – etched in contradiction, tempered by love that left its mark.“We’re not mourning a public figure,” she continued. “We’re not mourning a myth – but flesh and blood and ferocious heart. Who stormed through life loud, brilliant, and half on fire. Who leaves us echoes – gruff, brilliant, unrepeatable – half legend, half lullaby.”“I’ll miss our inside jokes, the sudden laughter, the sound of him. I’ll miss the boy he was before the legend; I miss my big brother,” she concluded. “In time, we’ll share how we plan to celebrate his life – but for now, we stay close, and let the silence say what words can’t.”View image in fullscreenVirginia and Michael Madsen in 2007.Photograph: Matt Sayles/APNumerous other friends, collaborators and Hollywood figures shared tributes in the wake of Madsen’s death. Vivica A Fox told the New York Post: “I had the pleasure of working with Michael Madsen on ‘Kill Bill’ & several other films! Michael was a talented man with an AMAZING on screen presence! My deepest condolences & prayers to his family.”Michael Madsen – a life in picturesRead moreMadsen was “one of my favorite actors I ever worked with”, Jennifer Tilly, his co-star in The Getaway,postedon X. “The Getaway was very early in my career and he made me feel safe and supported. He was wildly audacious and rambunctious with his character choices, and had a wicked sense of humor. I don’t recall ever laughing so much on a film set in my life. A huge talent. Gone too soon.”OnInstagram, Madsen’s The Hateful Eight co-star Walton Goggins wrote: “Michael Madsen… this man… this artist… this poet… this rascal…Fucking ICON…. Aura like no one else. Ain’t enough words so I’ll just say this…. I love you buddy. A H8TER forever.”“Michael Madsen was a dream to work with,”wroteRob Schneider on X along with a photo of Madsen guest-starring on his sitcom Real Rob in 2017. “A truly gifted actor & gentleman who made every person on the set comfortable; generous with his stories & with his infectious laughter.”Explore more on these topicsMichael MadsenCaliforniaLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

They may not have shared a dressing room with Jota or his equally mourned brother, André Silva, but that cannot minimise the fact two members of their nation’s tightly-knit footballing family had been taken away in devastating circumstances.It took guts and no little honour to show up and keep running, probing, scrapping, hunting for moments to take pride in while their opponents left no doubt that they are runaway favourites for this competition. Spain should be lauded, too, for resisting any temptation to go easy, starting at a rattling pace and completing a thoroughly professional job. In their case that often means administering a sound beating and there is no escaping that they delivered one here.Arianna Caruso’s stunner earns Italy opening Euro 2025 win against BelgiumRead moreThey settled for five, Cristina Martín-Prieto adding late gloss, and could strike further fear into their rivals by giving a brief runout to Aitana Bonmatí. But the night’s awful context was always hanging, the heartbreaking fate of Portugal’s lost star a visual presence in the form of placards held among the fans. “You took the name of Portugal beyond borders,” read a tribute hung from the upper tier of the west stand. “Now it is our turn to raise your name.”Francisco Neto, the Portugal manager, did that himself after the match. He explained that he had coached Jota during a spell as assistant coach of the men’s under-19 side; the pair had remained on warm terms and Jota, true to every account of his personality, had taken a close interest in the fortunes of the women’s team.“Today is a really sad day because two of us lost their lives so young,” Neto said. “It’s not a good day. If we had the chance to change everything, of course we would.“Diogo followed our team because he loved the country. We kept in contact. When we would cross the room and see the men’s team, I would talk with him and he always knew our results. He knew the team, the players, and this is the culture we have in Portugal.”Jota embodied Portugal’s roaming, joyful, acutely accomplished football spirit. It is a matter of time before their women’s team, hoping for a first knockout spot this summer, produces heroes with his staying power. The Barcelona forward Kika Nazareth, a safe bet to be among them, was not deemed fit enough to start but would have been hard pressed to shift the dial. Even before tragedy visited them, opening their tournament against Spain looked the tallest of orders.View image in fullscreenVicky López slides in at the back post to double Spain’s lead in the seventh minute.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesThe improving condition of Bonmatí, who had caused widespread concern by contracting viral meningitis, bodes well for Spain although she requires handling with care. They should be able to ramp up without her, although this became a welcome opportunity to taper down. Montse Tomé’s team had scored 11 times in two Nations League ties against Portugal in April; here they were two up within seven minutes and, in mid-20s heat, could run through the hits when it suited thereafter.It took under 90 seconds for Esther González, found by a raking pass from the left-back Olga Carmona, to tame the ball smartly before improvising a deft finish past Pereira. The second quickly followed, Mariona Caldentey snaking a tantalising low cross from the other side and seeing the 18-year-old Vicky López convert at full stretch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They hung in admirably, Pereira saving from González and twice from Clàudia Pina. Between those chances Alexia Putellas sidefooted wide, but she would join in four minutes before half-time after a shimmy past Diana Gomes. González quickly doubled her tally, Pina’s cross striking the far post and presenting the simplest finish. It was no slight on Portugal that the favourites were impossible to subdue.The livewire Jessica Silva, among the players who made tributes to Jota on Instagram, symbolised Portugal’s appetite to persist. After the interval she tried to catch Adriana Nanclares out and then, blazing past Laia Aleixandri, forced a booking. A goal would have raised the roof and it almost came when Ana Capeta jabbed over. In the end Martín-Prieto had the last word but only one figure had, in truth, dominated thoughts all day.Portugal had been backed fabulously, their contingent largely culled from an extensive émigré community, and faced their most vocal bank of supporters together after the final whistle. They lined up behind a banner printed with “Thank you for everything, Diogo Jota”, the two groups acknowledging one another for an extended spell. They will never need telling to elevate his memory.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It clarified that “these persons who have arrived in Europe are neither members of the CRC nor formally affiliated”.The statement added that the CRC would be launching a “European public relations campaign to share its vision of reparations with political stakeholders and the general public”.Caricom is also combining efforts with the African Union to advocate for reparations.The issue of reparations for transatlantic slavery has been heating up over the last year, dominating headlines in October when the British prime minister, Keir Starmer,resisted pressure from member statesto include reparations on the agenda at the Commonwealth summit.Pressure is intensifying from different sections of the global reparations movement on European countries involved in the kidnap, trafficking, forced labour, torture and sexual exploitation of millions of enslaved African peoples over a 300-year period.Caribbean leaders have remained resolute in their pursuitof justice, with Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, stressing the importance of a face-to-face discussion on the issue and the prime minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, pointing to “legal avenues … if the negotiations fail”.In June it emerged that Jamaica was seeking legal remedy, asking King Charles, who remains the island’s head of state, to use his authority to request legal advice from the judicial committee of the London-based privy council, the final court of appeal for UK overseas territories and some Commonwealth countries, on whether the forced transport of Africans to Jamaica was lawful, if it constituted a crime against humanity, and whether Britain was under obligation to provide a remedy to Jamaica for slavery and its enduring consequences.Responding to questions about whether King Charles is obliged to honour Jamaica’s request, the deputy chair of the country’s National Reparations Council, Bert Samuels, said if King Charles,who is part of the monarchy that benefited from slavery, refuses to refer the issue or if the privy council does not come back giving “positive recognition to the three questions” there would be a global “avalanche of criticism” of Britain.He added thatthe toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol in 2020 anti-racism protests was evidence of“an across-the-board rejection for the celebration of the slave trade, no matter how long ago it was”.Samuels added that Jamaica may take the matter to the international courts if it fails to get justice in Britain’s legal system.Explore more on these topicsReparations and reparative justiceJamaicaBarbadosBahamasEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Countries should take ‘urgent and effective’ action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IACHR.Photograph: Agencia Press South/Getty ImagesEnvironmentCountries must protect human right to a stable climate, court rulesCosta Rica-based inter-American court of human rights says states have obligation to respond to climate changeIsabella KaminskiThu 3 Jul 2025 17.53 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 18.18 EDTShareThere is a human right to a stable climate and states have a duty to protect it, a top court has ruled.Announcing the publication of a crucial advisory opinion on climate change on Thursday, Nancy Hernández López, president of the inter-American court of human rights (IACHR), said climate change carries “extraordinary risks” that are felt particularly keenly by people who are already vulnerable.In the strongly worded and wide-ranging 300-page document setting out its perspective on the climate emergency and human rights, the court says states have legal obligations to protect people alive today and future generations from the impacts of climate breakdown. That includes taking “urgent and effective” actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions based on the best available science, to adapt, to cooperate internationally, and to guard against the threat of climate disinformation.The inquiry was instigated byColombiaand Chile, which in 2023 asked what legal responsibilities states have to tackle climate change and to stop them breaching people’s human rights.The Costa Rica-based court received hundreds of submissions and held a series of hearings last year in Barbados and the Brazilian cities of Brasília and Manaus.EU may allow carbon credits from developing countries to count towards climate goalsRead moreA wide variety of states and regional bodies, academics and civil society groups – as well as individual victims of climate breakdown themselves – were allowed to participate.“The evidence we have seen and received during the hearing and written submissions shows that there is no margin for indifference,” López said.“Success depends on all of us.”The IACHR’s founding purpose is to interpret and apply the American convention on human rights, a treaty ratified by members of the Organization of American States (OAS). But its newly published opinion takes into account a broad range of national, regional and international laws and principles. And it affirms that the findings not just apply only to signatories of the convention but to all 35 members of the OAS, which includes the US and Canada.The court affirmed the right to a healthy environment, and said for the first time that this includes the right to a stable climate.This means states have legal obligations to regulate emissions from public and private organisations.The court says all businesses have a responsibility not to harm human rights but those that have emitted huge volumes of greenhouse gas emissions in the past or present have a particular responsibility “due to the risk created by their activities”. It singles out the exploration, extraction, transportation and processing of fossil fuels, cement manufacturing and agro-industry.States must set tougher requirements for such sectors, it says, suggesting changes to business operating conditions, taxation, contributions to just transition plans and strategies, investment in education, adaptation measures and addressing loss and damage. If companies do not comply, it suggests the polluting activities should stop and states consider demanding compensation for the harm caused to the climate.It adds that states should pass laws so that transnational corporations and conglomerates can be fully held to account for the emissions of their subsidiaries.States also have a duty to ensure a fair transition to a cleaner society, and must ensure that this does not in itself involve breaching human rights, for example, when mining for critical minerals needed for electric vehicles.“This is not just about the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” said Marcella Ribeiro, a senior human rights and environment attorney for the Asociación Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente (Aida), an environmental law organisation that works in Latin America. “This is an opportunity for a structural transformation that will correct historical inequality and protect people and ecosystems.”The IACHR also recognised the rights of nature and states have a duty to restore damage to ecosystems caused by climate change.Luisa Gómez, senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law, said the court made a “critical connection” between the effects of the climate crisis on the rights of people and ecosystems, and how those responsible for guaranteeing those rights should react. “It sends a clear message that impunity in climate matters can no longer be tolerated.”The inter-American court of human rights is the second of four top courts to publish an advisory opinion on climate change.The first court to publish its opinion, the international tribunal for the law of the sea, concluded last year that greenhouse gases are pollutants that are wrecking the marine environment, andstates have a legal responsibility to control them.The international court of justice held hearings on its own opinion last December and is expected to publish in the coming months. Meanwhile, the African court on human and people’s rights has only just begun the process.These documents are technically nonbinding but are considered authoritative because they summarise existing law. And they are expected to be used in future litigation and political negotiations.Viviana Krsticevic, executive director of the Centre for Justice and International Law, a human rights NGO which supported Colombia and Chile’s request for the advisory opinion, said the new opinion gives a “very rich roadmap” for responding to the climate emergency across society, including setting a series of standards for national climate strategies that could be very important for the forthcomingCop30 in Brazil.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentGreenhouse gas emissionsColombiaChileAmericasCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

One year later, how do they think the government is doing?Aletha AduPolitical correspondentThu 3 Jul 2025 16.17 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 18.05 EDTShareLabour’s first year back in power has been marked by high stakes and harsh realities.Despite ambitious promises, the party has struggled to maintain the support of voters – reflected in low poll numbers anda near defeat on its big welfare legislation.For new MPs the challenge has been to push urgent reforms while navigating Westminster’s unforgiving terrain.Seven rising Labour voices speak about the year that has tested them all.The idealistsSteve Witherden, Miatta Fahnbulleh, Jeevun SandherFor Witherden, the MP for Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, Fahnbulleh, the MP for Camberwell and Peckham and Sandher, the MP for Loughborough, Labour’s first year has been a lesson in managing urgent reform against the weight of political constraints. All talk about the urgency to drive radical reforms – and the costs of falling short.View image in fullscreenSteve Witherden, Miatta Fahnbulleh and Jeevun Sandher.Composite: Sean Smith/The GuardianWitherden’s first day in parliament was also the day he lost his mother. “The serjeant at arms came in and said I needed to get on a train straight back to north-east Wales. I was able to be with my mum and hold her hand when she died just before midnight.”He calls the experience disorienting and says he struggled to find his footing. But a year on, he is unrepentant about voting against the government’s welfare plans.“My feeling was we’d got it wrong. I thought we did need to make a stand on that. You risk undermining your own side – but ultimately, it led to a sound decision.”Witherden argues Labour has been bold on workers’ rights and renationalisation but warns the party should not retreat. “Labour is best when it is bold.”He sums up the year as “a great honour and a privilege to represent the area where you come from”.Fahnbulleh, as a government minister, opts for a measured tone, sharing challenges without criticising the government. She describes the past year in one word: “Pace. When you look at the policies, the interventions, the legislation, it’s a ridiculous amount in one year – particularly when you think about the inertia of government for the last five.”She accepts it hasn’t all landed. “We’ve got to do more on bread-and-butter cost of living issues. That’s what people will judge us by.” She is proud of the recent extension of the warm homes discount, a policy she has long championed. “That intervention will touch 6m households and countless lives.” But she says the government is still united. “The stakes are too high for us not to rally. We have a collective duty to make this count.”Sandher calls the year “determined” and describes this period as an “angrier time in politics. People are literally turning away from us in Westminster and say democracy feels like it isn’t working.” He says he is proudest of helping to organise Labour support for the assisted dying legislation.But for him, the real challenge is to balance stability with a bigger vision. “Ideas are what move people to change the country. Until you get here, you don’t realise how important ideology really is.”The pragmatistsJessica Toale, Rachel BlakeFor Blake, the MP for Cities of London and Westminster, and Toale, the MP for Bournemouth West, Labour’s first year has been a test of discipline and expectations. Both MPs argue the government has made progress but acknowledge the limits of what voters will tolerate, and how proving credibility after episodes like the welfare vote remains the harder part.View image in fullscreenJessica Toale and Rachel Blake.Composite: Sean Smith/The GuardianBlake does not hide the pressure of a year in government. “[Wednesday] was quite hard. We just saw the scale of what we’re trying to do and how visible we all are. The tone of PMQs, seeing that pressure … that was quite hard.”She rejects the idea that Labour is simply managing decline. “I disagree. I think there are really significant structural changes happening.” Housing, she argues, is the clearest example.“If you look at the underinvestment in social housing over the last 14 years and contrast it with the government’s proposals, that’s a clear example of investing in the future.” Blake points to reforms to renters’ rights as proof the shift is real, and cites the bill passing the Commons as a “great day”.She also argues business remains onside. “There is that trust there because of fiscal discipline and the clear objective to have regulation which supports economic growth.” Blake sums up the year as a “whirlwind”.Toale is blunt about the gap between progress and perception. “No, we haven’t restored trust in politics. You can’t expect that we’ll solve all the issues we have in one year.” She highlights tackling knife crime as a high point. But she says it has been confronting to be seen as part of the system she hoped to improve.“I’ve gone from being Jess to being ‘a politician’. And with that comes a whole lot of assumptions people make about me.” Toale adds that misinformation online has made it harder to convince and speak to voters. “You can’t have a good debate about the challenges we face in 140 characters on X. It’s very difficult to turn around a narrative once it’s started.”But she argues the government has made meaningful changes – and says the priority now is to prove it. “We’re on the way,” she says describing the past 12 months as “a year of planting seeds”.The modernisersCallum Anderson and Jess AsatoFor Anderson, MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, and Asato, MP for Lowestoft, the first year in government has been about turning promises into results, and avoiding the drift that has cost Labour trust. Anderson is clear the stakes are high if voters don’t see results. Asato says the progress is already visible.View image in fullscreenCallum Anderson and Jess Asato.Composite: Sean Smith/The GuardianAsato dismisses any suggestion the government has been too timid. “I would dispute that we’re not bold,” she says.“We have to cut through all the planning delays to bring 1.5m homes. We’ve invested in the NHS and have the most ambitious pledge of any other country in the world to halve violence against women and girls. You cannot say that’s not bold – we’re making that difference.”Despite the workload, she says the sense of purpose outweighs the strain. “There are days where you think: ‘Gosh, this is quite a lot.’ But there’s never been a day where I have not looked around and felt the deep honour of service.” Her word for the year: “Progress.”Anderson is unusually frank about the risks. “I think if people don’t think they’re better off, their public services haven’t really improved – I mean the NHS – and that we haven’t really cracked the small boats issue, there’s a healthy chance that they will roll the dice again.”Despite that, he says ambition matters: “I think there’s no point being a member of parliament, being in government, if you’re not really ambitious about what you want to change.” He sums up his year as “relentless”.Explore more on these topicsLabourHouse of CommonsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pieces unearthed in the excavation, laid out before him, revealed evidence of humans living there 30,000 years ago, arriving from the north and the south. But how did they get there?“There are stone tools and archaeological remains at the site but they don’t answer those questions,” Kaifu, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Tokyo, says.In the Paleolithic era, or the old stone age, technology was rudimentary, he says. “I thought it was great they reached those islands with such simple technology. I wanted to experience it.”Video loopSo Kaifu devised an adventurous plan that would see a team of researchers take to the sea in a 225km canoe trip from Taiwan to Japan’sYonaguniisland.Yonaguni is the closest of the Ryukyu islands – a chain stretching south-west from Kyushu toTaiwan– but it lies across one of the world’s strongest currents. The voyage was reminiscent of the famed 1947 Kontiki crossing by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl, which proved it was possible that peoples from South Americas paddled to Polynesia.But first, Kaifu’s team needed a boat. Any vessel used by the original Paleolithic travellers had long since disintegrated. The team used traditional techniques to build rafts made of bamboo and reed, but ocean tests found they were too slow to battle the Kuroshio current, which was even stronger at the time of the Paleolithic crossing.“Through those failed experiments we gradually learned the difficulty of the crossing, but at the same time we knew the Palaeolithic people were on the island. They had succeeded, so there must be a resolution which we just hadn’t found,” Kaifu says.View image in fullscreenThe canoe’s route by day (in red) and night (in blue).Composite: Google Earth / Yousuke Kaifu/The University of TokyoEventually, the team built a heavy, unstable but workable dugout canoe out of Japanese cedar, and identified Wushibi bay on Taiwan’s east coast from which to launch the “Sugime”.The quiet Japanese island paradise on the frontline of growing Taiwan-China tensionsRead moreCrucially, Yonaguni is not visible from Taiwan’s shore but can be seen on a clear day from its mountains, near Taroko. The researchers believed it likely that the early migrants had seen it, and that they were well aware of the strength and behaviour of the Kuroshio current from fishing ventures.The team of five included professional paddlers as well as the scientists, but no one who had made such a journey, let alone without modern navigation. The day they set out, the weather was not good, Kaifu recalls, with choppy seas and clouds obscuring the stars they needed to find their way. Instead, they had to rely on another ancient technique, monitoring the direction of the swell to keep their own direction stable. “Polynesian and Micronesian people did it, and we learned the technique,” says Kaifu, who travelled on the crew’s escort vessel, “the safe place”, he laughs.Video loopFor 45 hours they paddled, suffering muscle aches, fatigue, cramps and even hallucinations. “Surrounded only by the sea, clouds, and sky, they were uncertain about their position,” the report’s journey log notes.But their arrival on the second night was anti-climactically untraditional.Still almost 40km away, “they found the island by the lighthouse, which was unfortunate”, Kaifu said.“But the beautiful moment for me was the time of [the previous day’s] dawn, the sun was coming up and the sky became gradually light, and we saw the clouds on the horizon. But at one point on the horizon the clouds were different, so there must be something under the clouds. That was the moment we were sure the island was there. Just like the ancient people, the ancestors, it was good to capture the island from the natural signature.”The team made the journey in 2019, with support from Japan’s National Museum of Science and Nature, Taiwan’s National Museum of Prehistory, and crowdfunding donors. Last week they published two papers and a 90-minute documentary on their findings, onthe journey itselfand onthe ocean modellingof the route’s treacherous currents and unpredictable weather.View image in fullscreenPaddlers sit in reed-bundle rafts. The team experimented with different materials before settling on Japanese cedar.Photograph: Danee Hazama/The University of Tokyo“Paleolithic people are often regarded as ‘inferior’ among the general public, primarily due to their ‘primitive’ culture and technology,” the report said. “In sharp contrast, our experiment highlighted that they accomplished something extraordinary with the rudimentary technology available to them at the time.”There is much unknown about the early migration of humans. Homo sapiens are believed to have spread across the world with large-scale maritime expansion occurring at least 50,000 years ago. A 2017 study in northern Australia foundit could have been 15,000 to 30,000 years earlierthan that.The team’s report noted growing consensus in the scientific community that the maritime migrations were driven by intentional seafaring more than accidental drifting, but without really knowing much about how. Kaifu’s team found that while the journey from Taiwan to an unseen island was treacherous and required skill, strength and a lot of luck, it was possible.Almost six years to the day since his team paddled away from Wushibi, Kaifu is excited recalling the details of their “imperfect” journey.“We anthropologist and archeologists who have studied human migration in the past, we draw a line on a map,” Kaifu said. “But behind each of those lines there must be a great story. Crossing the ocean can’t be represented by a simple line. I wanted to know the real story behind those migrations.”Explore more on these topicsJapanTaiwanAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wish it hadn’t happened because it was disgusting, but the kiss helped to expose the whole iceberg underneath.”Before the World Cup, 15 La Roja playersfaced public smearsand belittling by some media after they refused to play for Jorge Vilda, the coach at the time, complaining about his tactics, training methods and controlling management style.One year later, as media around the world captured Rubiales’refusal to resign, with the football chief instead hitting out at the “scourge” of “false feminism”, the spotlight was recast on the team’s struggle for flight times that would allow them a decent night’s sleep before games and equal pay, among other problems.View image in fullscreenLuis Rubiales speaking to the press during the trial over the kiss.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersIn the lead-up to theWomen’s Euro 2025, players were swift to highlight how things have changed. “I remember when I used to come play for the national team and I didn’t enjoy it; I just wanted to go home, to be honest,” the two-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí told reporters late last month. “It was tough to play here; the situation wasn’t good … Now everything is better.”That sentiment was echoed by La Roja’s other two-time Ballon d’Or winner, Alexia Putellas. “The conditions have changed a lot,” she said. “Especially in terms of travel, nutrition, training, things have changed radically. Now we’re enjoying conditions that are at the top level of the men’s team. It’s something that has taken a lot of effort and work by many people.”Earlier this year, Rubialeswas convictedof sexual assault over the unsolicited kiss. He was ordered to pay more than €10,000 in fines and barred from contacting or approaching Hermoso for a year. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said he will file an appeal against the verdict with the supreme court.La Roja’s push for equality gripped Spain, setting off a conversation thatswiftly spilledinto other spheres of society. “What was very clear was that it was never about the kiss,” said Prof Helena Legido-Quigley, of Imperial College London. “It was much more about power, about consent and also the way that institutions protect power for men.”With fellow members of Women in Global Health Spain, Legido-Quigley seized on the moment, calling for women in academia and healthcare who identified with Hermoso to share their own experiences. Within five days,more than 200 storieshad poured in.Aitana Bonmatí’s return lifts Spain in pursuit of Euro 2025 dreamRead moreIt was a clear sign of how the squad’s struggle had tapped into a wider vein of discontent, one that Legido-Quigley said she hoped would pave the way forSpainto start tackling the structural problems that had long allowed this behaviour.Instead she watched as the backlash began. “A new narrative has emerged,” she said. “It’s about discrediting feminism and making people doubt the seriousness of these issues.”While the pushback has seemingly been smaller in Spain than in some other countries, Legido-Quigley said she worried that this reaction would hinder the search for solutions.View image in fullscreenThe Spain national team’s head coach, Montse Tomé, during a Euro 2025 press conference.Photograph: Fran Santiago/Uefa/Getty ImagesThe global scrutiny of Spain came after years of the country positioning itself as a leader in women’s equality, putting in place laws and protocols to ensure equal treatment.The longstanding treatment of the country’s female football squad, however, hinted at a glaring void of sanctions and inspectors to ensure these regulations were followed, said Mar Mas, who leads the Spain-based Association forWomenin Professional Sports. “You can fill a city with traffic lights, but if there’s nobody to fine those who sail through red lights, it’s not going to make any difference.”While Mas welcomed the changes that had been made, she emphasised that much work remained to be done.When Spain takes to the pitch on Thursday, the squadwill not includeHermoso, the all-time leading scorer for Spain’s national team with 57 goals in 123 matches – a controversial decision that has sparked questions about how far-reaching the federation’s changes have been.In the wake of the World Cup kiss, the coach Montse Tomé left Hermoso out of the squad,describingit as a “way to protect her”. Tomé did eventually call Hermoso up again but this time has declined to do so, citing the competition for her position.Mas said she believed Hermoso was being made to pay a personal price for speaking up. “What is clear in this country is that there are many women who have spoken out against their federations and who have ended up sacrificing their athletic careers. That is how it works. Despite all the laws on equality and protocols, women are still not fully protected when it comes to exercising their rights.”Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025Aitana BonmatíInequalityFeminismWomen (Life and style)featuresShareReuse this content"

Thirteen medieval churches rise above the old town, some in disrepair. Others are renascent: St Mary-le-Tower was recently redesignated as a minster in recognition of its value to the community and its 1,000 years of existence. That’s not so long ago in a town settled very early – perhaps as early as the fifth century, and established by the seventh – by the Anglo-Saxons.Seen from between the columns and arches of Lloyds Avenue, Ipswich’s medieval core could be Trieste or Venice, minus the overtourismYou have to rummage to find historical treasures, which lie scattered, disguised, buried, bullied. The town has one of the best-preserved medieval cores in the country, but local planners wrapped it in roads, houses and, latterly, retail and leisure centres. Things are revealed by walking: the Tooley’s Court almshouses; lemon-hued, half-timbered Curson Lodge; gloriously pargeted Ancient House; an opulent town hall; and an ostentatious former post office on Cornhill, the main square. Seen from between the columns and arches of Lloyds Avenue, it could be Trieste or Venice, minus the overtourism and rip-off cappuccinos.View image in fullscreenCurson Lodge dates to the 15th century.Photograph: Alan Curtis/AlamyErica, fromThe Friends of the Ipswich Museums, shows me around themansion in Christchurch Park. Only four families ever lived here – the Withypolls, Devereux, Fonnereaus and Cobbolds – each associated with their times’ trades and trends: Atlantic merchant-adventurers, titled nobles, Huguenot linen traders, brewers and bankers. A standout exhibit is a patinaed oak overmantel rescued from a house on Fore Street that belonged to Thomas Eldred, who sailed round the world with Thomas Cavendish on his1586-8 circumnavigation. The flagship Desire gave its name to a port on the Patagonian coast. In a corner hangs a portrait of Admiral Edward Vernon, who participated in theWar of Jenkins’ Earbetween Britain and Spain in the mid-18th century andthe capture of Portobeloin Panama; he wore grogram cloth and is thought to have introduced toasts of rum-and-water – or “grog” – to the navy.Ipswich traded with northern Europe from Saxon times, growing to become aHanseatic Leagueport, exporting wool and woollen cloth, and importing wine from Bordeaux.On the harbour front isIsaacs on the Quay, a pub carved out of an old maltings. Behind it, at 80 Fore Street, is – according toHistoric England– “the last surviving example of a 15th- to 17th-century Ipswich merchant’s house with warehouses at the rear opening directly on the dock front, where merchandise was unshipped, stored and distributed wholesale or sold retail in the shop on the street front”. The local council considered filling the harbour in to build houses, but a festival in 1971 showed the area could be a place of recreation as well as cultural preservation; the Ipswich Maritime Trust, still very active, grew out of this showdown.Things to see and do:Willis Building;river cruise on the sailing barge Victor;freeA Peep into the Past touratChristchurch Mansion;Blackfriarsmonastery ruinsRamsey, Isle of ManView image in fullscreenThe Manx Electric Railway to Laxey and Snaefell summit.Photograph: Allan Hartley/AlamyTravelling overland to Ramsey from Douglas, you have a premonition of how important the sea must once have been. The meandering road and heritage electric railway both scale a mountain on the journey. Doing the trip on foot or horseback must have been hell. The Isle of Man’s longest river, the Sulby, plummets and meanders down from the uplands to meet the sea at Ramsey. Vikings, as well as Scots, entered theIsle of Manhere. Its name derives from the Old Norse for “wild garlic river”.The small working port breaks up a shoreline of sand and pebble beaches backed by apartment buildings and grand-seeming hotels. Timber and aggregate are massed up on the wharves. A bulk carrier called Snaefell River is moored beneath a single tall crane. To the south is the long Queen’s Pier, once a landing stage. Victoria never disembarked, but the pier recalls her visit. Above town is the Albert Tower. The consort made landfall.Once Ramsey was a popular seaside resort, with Steam Packet ships to Kirkcudbright, Liverpool and WhitehavenOnce Ramsey was a popular seaside resort, with Steam Packet ships to Kirkcudbright and Garlieston in Dumfries and Galloway; Liverpool and Whitehaven (I can see the Cumbrian fells). A swing bridge – closed to motorised traffic – connects the northern beach to Ramsey town centre, a likeable mishmash of Victorian buildings housing pubs, food and drink outlets, antique and bric-a-brac shops – and a very 80s strip mall with a Tesco, a drycleaner, a model shop and tattooists.On the edge of town, I find myself at Grove House, now a museum. It was the holiday home of the island’s second most famous Gibb family. Duncan Gibb was a shipping agent from Greenock. The house reaches out to foreign climes. A tiger skin on the floor of the drawing room. A leopard skin in the bedroom. Mahogany furniture from a primeval forest. Curtains from India. A japanned backgammon set. When the men sailed away or died out, a matriarchy took over.The Trafalgar pub, on West Quay, must have seen so many deals and binges, squabbles and scuffles. I drink an Odin’s mild in the corner.

The former snakes north of the town centre, often behind buildings – supermarkets, an enterprise zone – and is cut off by the city’s notorious roads. The canal sneaks up from the south-west, hopping across the river near a McDonald’s. Anyway, the natural movement here for pedestrians is upward and inland.The Romans took the high road. Marching through north Lancashire, operating in conjunction with naval transports, they could look out for landing troop detachments. A Roman fort was built on the hill now occupied by Lancaster Castle. It dates from the 12th century, as does the name of Lancashire, and is infamous as the place the Pendle Witches were imprisoned prior to their trial, sentencing and hanging. A small exhibition in a dungeon of the Well Tower recounts the key points of the story, reminding us Jack Straw refused to pardon them in 1998. The castle housed a prison till 2011; its Shire Hall is still used as a courtroom.Lancaster was once England’s fourth largest slave port, with at least 122 ships sailing to Africa between 1700 and 1800Lancaster was once England’s fourth largest slave port, with at least 122 ships sailing to Africa between 1700 and 1800. Local merchants were involved in the capture and sale of around 30,000 enslaved people. Slave-produced goods from the West Indies included sugar, dyes, rice, spices, coffee, rum and, later, cotton for Lancashire’s mills. Fine furniture, gunpowder, clothing and other goods were produced in and around Lancaster and traded in Africa for enslaved people, or sent to the colonies.View image in fullscreenThe Ashton Memorial, in Lancaster’s Williamson Park, has views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland fells.Photograph: Rob Atherton/AlamyThe slave trade and abolitiontrail, revised by Lancaster University professor Alan Rice, takes in churches, with their memorials to merchants who made money from slavery; theSugarhouse, a nightclub on the site of a former refinery; Gillow’s Warehouse, which imported slave-harvested mahogany to make furniture; and 20 Castle Park, home of the slave-owning Satterthwaite family. On the abolition side are a Friends Meeting House (Quakers were among the earliest opponents of slavery) and, most poignantly, three benches in and near Williamson Park provided by philanthropists for the vagrant poor – including cotton workers laid off during thecotton faminecaused by anti-slavery measures taken by Lancashire firms.The small city of Lancaster, with its university campus and would-be genteel airs, looks and feels innocuous, and altogether unconnected to stormy seas.

Her latest show, Diamonds and Dust, feels like it could have been made back then, in that this wild west-themed floor show comes without much of the innovation, subversion, irony and identity politics that have happened on the burlesque scene in between, including in Von Teese’s own work.The show is actually led by Faye Tozer from Steps. She’s a likable front woman, playing saloon owner Kitty LeRoy, her story of hardscrabble life and multiple husbands interspersed with acts combining burlesque, circus and dance. It’s gorgeous girls draped in pearls and lacy layers (teasingly removed), with a bit of lasso brandishing, a cowboy swinging from a chandelier (Magic Mike vibes) andTosca Rivolaproving herself talented on the cyr wheel. But the overall effect? I think the word is basic. Pretty young women taking off their clothes in not-that-interesting ways.View image in fullscreenArtistically, this feels like a step backwards … l to r, Sienna Walker, Cristian Liberti, Faye Tozer as Miss Kitty LeRoy, Manny Tsakanika and Zinzile Tshuma in Diamonds and Dust.Photograph: Chris Davis StudioVon Teese’s whole appeal is retro, and her obsession with period glamour is taken to deliciously detailed levels, but there’s retro and there’s retrograde. Or is that the point, that it’s a throwback? There’s something Tarantinoesque about the setting, a fetishisation of American pop culture and iconography. But I also couldn’t help thinking of the return to stereotypical femininity seen intradwivesand Maga women in push-up bras.Dita Von Teese: ‘Even when I was a bondage model, I had big-time boundaries’Read moreThe real point of it all, of course, is Von Teese herself (beware, she’s not performing in every show). She appears at the end of each half, a vivid, otherworldly presence smothered in diamante, with sparkling red lips and tiny corseted waist. At 52 she’s the absolute doyenne and holds the stage with regal charisma. Whether in statuesque pose or exultantly riding a contraption that’s a cross between a bucking bronco and a pink velvet Chesterfield, she’s untouchable, and therein lies the appeal. There is no doubt she’s worth seeing, and it’s important to say this could be a perfectly fun night out, but artistically, it feels like a step backwards.AtEmerald theatre, London, until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsBurlesqueDanceTheatreCabaretCircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

Are these fun life hacks or symptoms of a snowed-under society?Chloë HamiltonThu 3 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareAs you read this, there will probably be a cup of tea going cold on Veronica Pullen’s kitchen counter. Every time she wants a cup, Pullen makes two, one milkier than the other. She drinks the milkier one (she likes her tea lukewarm) immediately. She lets the other one sit for 40 minutes before drinking it once it has reached optimum temperature. It is an efficiency – albeit a tiny one – that she has been perfecting for two years. A copywriter and online trainer, Pullen, who is 54 and lives on the Isle of Wight with her husband and their chihuahua, says it takes her five minutes to boil a kettle, so she saves five minutes with every other cup. Over 24 hours, that adds up to 20 minutes saved. Across two years? She has clawed back slightly more than 10 full days.Pullen is just one of many people incorporating microefficiencies into their daily lives. There are people who brush their teeth in the shower; lay out their clothes the night before to save time in the morning; boil hot water for the day first thing and keep it to hand in a flask. But are these small, savvy streamlinings that shave minutes (sometimes, just seconds) off a task merely fun life hacks? Are they a symptom of a snowed-under society? Or are they indicative of an obsession with productivity?Take Pullen. As well as her conveyor belt of tea, she also saves time by cutting out decision-making when it comes to food. Every day, she has a hard-boiled egg for breakfast and a two-egg omelette for lunch. Then, for dinner, she eats whatever is on her weekly menu – on Wednesdays, for example, it’s Thai chicken curry, and on Saturdays, sirloin steak. As well as this, she has a “pool” of the same clothes, again removing the need to make a decision; and intentionally wears her trainers loose so she can slip them on and off rather than spending time tying and untying her laces. And she doesn’t make her bed: nobody is going to see it, she says.View image in fullscreenSave time and energy by leaving your bed unmade.Illustration: Mark Long/The GuardianIf Pullen can streamline something, she will. “Having more simplicity with these habits in my day-to-day life gives me more capacity and energy to do the things I want to do,” she says. “I prefer not having to keep making micro choices.” Curiously, Pullen’s husband doesn’t follow her efficiencies, especially when it comes to food: often he cooks something different for himself. The only time Pullen relinquishes her microefficiencies is on holiday.The allure of microefficiencies is unsurprising. After all, so much of our self-worth is tied to output and achievement – at work and at home. You only have to glance at social media to see this writ large. #LifeHack has 11m posts on TikTok and 2.5m on Instagram, while Reddit’s Productivity thread is a steady stream of people talking about how to boost, fine-tune and maximise. Elsewhere, productivity influencers such asAli Abdaal(1 million followers on Instagram),Casey Major-Bunce(730,000 followers) andJames Clear(1.6 million followers) implore us – one life hack and Ted talk at a time – to self-optimise, whether that is by getting up half an hour early to work out or by inflating a paddling pool “within seconds” using a hairdryer. In particular, Clear’s approach, in his bestselling book Atomic Habits, focuses on incorporating incremental changes that add up to a larger transformation, feeding into the idea that even tiny things have a big impact. Is it any wonder that people have become determined not to waste a second on any given task?Jennifer Babey, 36, from Hampshire has gone one step further than Pullen’s loose trainers: six years ago she replaced her regular shoelaces with elastic ones. “It’s been a gamechanger,” she says. Babey, a business owner, estimates that she saves herself a minute each time she puts on her shoes. “It helps me to make a swift exit out of the house.”As well as shunning shoelaces, Babey also streamlines breakfast by laying out her cutlery and crockery so it is ready when she gets home from the gym. “Bowl, spoon, knife and chopping board if I plan for fruit, and cereal all on the table,” she says. “Then, when I get home, I can just get the refrigerated stuff out and get on with eating.” While she concedes this doesn’t necessarily save a huge amount of time, it does free up “brain power” she may need to use on other jobs once home. “Present Jenny is always grateful for the little efforts of past Jenny.”Because efficiency, of course, isn’t just about doing things as quickly as possible but, rather, deploying resources – time, brain power – in the most effective way. Birmingham-based Jude Smith*, 45, whoowns 11 spare pairs of glasses, stashes them in places such as her bedside table, her car glove box, her handbag, her church, a friend’s house and even her sister’s house in Germany, so she never has to think about where her specs are. “It is very efficient for mental energy,” says Smith, who works in data protection and lives alone.Sarah Ingram, a 44-year-old freelance writer from Gloucestershire, keeps a notebook next to her during the work day and writes in it the names of anyone who WhatsApps her so she can reply to them in one go in the evening. Ingram says this method means it takes her five minutes to do what, with the endless distractions that come with picking up a phone, could consume up to 30 minutes of her day.View image in fullscreenAdjust your lights without leaving the comfort of your sofa.Illustration: Mark Long/The GuardianTeacher Caroline Fisher*, 59, from Merseyside has fashioned a special tool from a bamboo pole and masking tape to enable her – to the chagrin of her grandchildren – to switch her living room light on and off from her sofa. This saves her, she says, “three to four minutes walking around the sofa every day”. London-based Polly Arrowsmith, 57, who works in marketing and lives with her dog, cuts down on the time she spends getting ready by mostly wearing dresses, claiming this saves a few minutes every day. “It makes dressing easy,” she says, because she can just slip them over her head.Not all microefficiencies are welcome, though. Lydia Berman, 47, who lives in Hertfordshire, tells me about the time her dad – efficiency aficionado Geoffrey Shalet, 81, who also Velcros his phone charger to his bedside for quick and easy access – fitted talking bathroom scales as a present for her mum. “He installed them in the bathroom under the lino, so that every time she walked into the bathroom, the scales would say her weight,” says Berman. “He thought it would be practical and time-saving. She thought it was near divorce.” In the end, the scales were removed from the lino and Berman’s mum didn’t speak to her dad for a week.View image in fullscreen‘Having more simplicity in my day-to-day life gives me more capacity’ … Veronica Pullen with a time-optimised cup of tea.Photograph: Amanda Hutchinson AKP Branding StoriesOf course, while all microefficiencies, on the surface, serve the same purpose – to save snippets of time and mental energy – there are many other reasons why they might be incorporated into people’s lives. Pullen, for example, has rheumatoid arthritis and says her hacks help her to conserve physical energy. “I cut out what I term unnecessary effort,” she says. “Routines are soothing.” And, although Shalet – who is retired and now lives alone after his wife died in 2020 – has used microefficiencies all his life, they have recently become even more helpful after a diagnosis of dementia. They have been so helpful, in fact, that the occupational therapist who came to assess his needs left with a collection of his efficiencies to share with other patients, such as writing down the expiry dates of every item in the fridge (including leftovers) on sticky notes, which go on a clipboard in the kitchen. Fisher admits to being “bloody lazy” while Arrowsmith simply likes to spend time doing what she enjoys: visiting her local comedy club.One can’t help but wonder, though, whether our love of efficiency speaks to how much store we set by productivity. Consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, who has delivered keynote speeches on burnout, high-functioning anxiety and our cultural obsession with output, thinks our fascination with microefficiencies suggests we have internalised an idea that every moment must be maximised. “On the surface, it can look like ambition, but it’s often a sign of burnout creeping in,” she says. “These behaviours are less about choice and more about survival. It can be driven by the belief that slowing down is unsafe or unproductive.”View image in fullscreenFree up brainpower by keeping a log of all your WhatsApp messages each day.Illustration: Mark Long/The GuardianSusie Masterson, a Manchester-based psychotherapist who used to work in the technology sector (including for Google, where productivity was a “persistent theme”), is seeing the impact efficiency obsessions can have on her clients. “I’ve seen the pursuit of microefficiencies trigger OCD tendencies in clients as well as anxiety and depression. Feelings of not being good enough are common.” Microefficiencies, she adds, don’t help us feel less lonely or disconnected, and being productive is not the same as feeling fulfilled.Babey agrees. “The world is full of so much to be engaged with – podcasts, TV, social media, hobbies – that I think some people are feeling overwhelmed by everything they feel they should be doing,” she says. “I certainly feel I always need to be doing something and being productive.” Smith, too, thinks our busy lives are to blame, saying: “I don’t know whether society really prizes efficiency or if it’s just become a necessity to help people cope with overfull lives.”It’s true, our lives are full. According to a report byLloyds TSB Bank, the average adult in the UK feels they have just 23 hours of “genuinely free” time a week (out of a possible 112 waking hours) – and 86% of those surveyed said they wanted more. With so little time, it’s hardly surprising people have resorted to elasticated laces. What, then, can be done?Sort out your life! 100 tiny tricks to help with everything from digital overwhelm to lumpy sugar and unpaid billsRead moreAccording to Gabrielle Treanor, author ofThe 1% Wellness Experiment: Micro-gains to Change Your Life in 10 Minutes a Day, it’s good to ask yourself why you are employing these microefficiencies. She confesses that when she worked in children’s magazine publishing, she swapped from heels to flats at work so she could get across the office faster. “Is it so you can squeeze more time out of your day to get more done, be more productive? Or is it so you can have more time for fun, for relaxing, connecting with loved ones, taking care of your wellbeing?”Interestingly, the efficiency hackers I spoke to all had one thing in common, and it wasn’t burnout. Every one, without exception, was delighted with the microefficiencies they had developed. And although I suspect these efficiencies are symptomatic of a society that values success and being busy over, say, love or happiness or stability, there is also something undeniably charming about inventive people tinkering creatively, quietly, with the way they do things. Something to think about, perhaps, while that second cup of tea is cooling.* These names have been changedExplore more on these topicsLife and styleTime managementHealth & wellbeingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the second occasion three years later in California when he was caught with a woman in his car, he just told his congregation: “The Lord told me it’s flat out none of your business.”His plight had not been helped by his previous denunciations of rival Pentecostal preachers, which suddenly smacked of hypocrisy. When Jim Bakker had admitted to an affair with a church secretary, Swaggart described him as a cancer on the body of Christ, one of those“pompadoured pretty boys with their hair done and their nails done who call themselves preachers”.He had also hounded a rival televangelist called Marvin Gorman out of ministry with accusations of adultery. It was Gorman who then proved his nemesis, tracking him to the motel.Swaggart’s style as a preacher was bellowing alternating with whispering, speaking in tongues, bursts of song and bouts of tears. There were anecdotes of miraculous saves – his car’s engine came unclogged on one occasion apparently by the application of anointing oil – and there were dreadful warnings too. These were well within the American Pentecostal traditions of what was called the sawdust trail, pioneered in rural circus tents by earlier evangelists such asBilly Sunday. Indeed Swaggart started his ministry preaching on street corners and from a flatbed truck, and living in church basements when he could not afford anywhere more upmarket to stay.His denunciations were scattergun and not exactly Christian, though he was of course a Biblical literalist. He denounced Catholics and Jews, Mormons and Muslims with equal venom as cultists and heretics, as well as Darwinists, communists, liberals and judges. He suggested that the Jews had brought the Holocaust on themselves by denying Christ – and of course the End Times were nigh.View image in fullscreenJimmy Swaggart’s 1972 gospel album At an Altar of Prayer. He had a fine baritone voice and made many bestselling records.Photograph: Alamy“Armageddon is coming,” he would proclaim. “My Lord, I am happy. I don’t care who it bothers. It thrills my soul.”He came from the tiny rural Louisiana town of Ferriday, part of a tightly knit clan “entwined like a big tight ball of rubber bands”. His father, Willie Leon “Sun” Swaggart, was a sharecropper, grocery store manager, moonshiner, fiddle player and occasional preacher, and his mother, Minnie Bell (nee Herron), was from the same rural background. One cousin was the future rock’n’roll starJerry Lee Lewisand another the country and western musicianMickey Gilley.Swaggart himself had a fine baritone singing voice and might have followed Lewis. He was offered terms by the pioneering Sun Records producerSam Phillipsbut turned him down because of his religious calling, which, unlike his cousins, forbade alcohol, dancing, tobacco and secular music.It was said the cousins preached from the opposite shores of the river they called salvation. However it did not stop him later issuing bestselling gospel albums, including This Is Just What Heaven Means to Me, though he claimed characteristically that he had negotiated the contracts through God’s help: “Could you take 90% and let me have 10%?” The albums sold in their millions.Swaggart was ordained by the Pentecostal Assemblies of God sect in 1961 after several years of preaching around the south, began broadcasting to Christian religious radio stations a year later and in 1969 founded his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, from where he launched the weekly Camp Meeting Hour radio programme. He promoted himself as an “old-fashioned, Holy Ghost-filled, shouting, weeping, soul-winning, Gospel preachin’ preacher”. It was certainly entertaining.The centre itself grew to hold a congregation of 7,000 and the purchase of a bankrupt television studio in 1975 expanded Swaggart’s ministry across the country. Within a few years 200 local television companies were taking his daily programmes. Eventually it was beamed internationally and Swaggart briefly became the biggest star in the televangelical firmament.There were also merchandising opportunities: the sale of knick-knacks including belt buckles, T-shirts, mugs, plates and even replicas of Jesus’s crown of thorns. Swaggart himself contributed more than 50 books and bible study guides. The worship centre became the largest mail-order business inLouisianaand the church grounds expanded to 200 acres, at one stage including a bible college.Swaggart was less politically active nationally than his contemporariesPat RobertsonandJerry Falwell, though he supported Robertson’s presidential bid in 1988 and later voted for Donald Trump. But he did become entangled with the brutal anti-communist, pro-South African Mozambican resistance group Renamo during the country’s civil war of the 1980s, with his ministries accused of funding them and certainly supplying the guerrillas with “improving” literature.At the age of 17 Swaggart had married his childhood sweetheart, 15-year-old Frances Anderson. He would later declare: “It is impossible for me to stray. My wife is with me all the time. I’m never alone.”This assertion was severely tested by the sex scandals, which came to light after Swaggart fell out with Gorman, both competing for similar television audiences in Louisiana. Swaggart got Gorman defrocked from the Assemblies of God after making allegations of adultery, which led Gorman to employ a private detective who recorded Swaggart visiting a sex worker at a Travel Inn on the outskirts of New Orleans.Gorman offered a deal: he would not release the footage if Swaggart publicly apologised and withdrew his allegations, but when Swaggart did not answer the story rapidly went public.This prompted Swaggart’s highly public mea culpa to his television followers. Damp with sweat and ostentatiously crying he called on the Almighty’s help: “I have sinned against you my Lord and I would ask that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God’s forgiveness, not to be remembered against me any more.”The authorities were notably more forgiving than they had been to Gorman, suspending him from preaching for two years, which Swaggart ignored on the grounds that he could not afford the loss of earnings. Defrocked, he then became an independent preacher.Scepticism about Swaggart’s sincerity hardened even among his most devoted followers when three years later he was stopped by police while driving his white Jaguar erratically in Indio, California. His passenger told reporters: “He asked me for sex. I mean that’s why he stopped me. That’s what I do. I’m a prostitute.” She claimed the car had been swerving because he was trying to hide pornographic magazines under the driver’s seat.With that his national ministry effectively collapsed. He eventually reached a million-dollar settlement with Gorman, but the bible college, private jet and his and hers limousines had to go. He continued preaching but his ministry essentially passed to his son Donnie.Frances and Donnie survive him, as do several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Jimmy Lee Swaggart, television evangelist, born 15 March 1935; died 1 July 2025Explore more on these topicsUS newsReligionUS televisionChristianityLouisianaJerry Lee LewisPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

Instead, tell voters that taxes must rise – and be clear about the good that will doThu 3 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 12.50 EDTShareRachel Reeves will not be sacked, because she is unsackable. The ever-hysterical bond markets just confirmed that by spinning out of control over her tears, then restoring previous rates as soon as Keir Starmer’s serial interviewsconfirmed heartfelt supportafter she was seen to be crying during PMQs. Quite right. Joined at the hip, her tough fiscal policy is his. History shows that prime ministers rarely last after sacking their chancellors.The question for both, and all ofLabour, is: what next? Every management guru and motivational speaker will tell you that mistakes don’t matter – the key to success is what you learn and how adroitly you change. Labour has four long years ahead and, most important of all, a stonking great majority. They are the masters so long as they don’t frighten the bond markets that ejected Liz Truss and forced Donald Trump’s handbrake tariff U-turn.A change of direction is forced on Starmer and Reeves by circumstances mostly not of their making. Every month that passes reconfirms their dire inheritance and the harsh global economic climate. The Bank of England, wrong so often, delays rate cuts and unwinds quantitative easing at a damagingly faster rate than other central banks, harming public finances, as my colleague Randeep Rameshpointed out.Everyone knows tax rises are inevitable in the October budget: £6bn lost because of U-turns on disability benefits and winter fuel allowance is only a trivial rounding error in about£1.3tn of spending. How will they do it?Let’s hope the government has learned that fiddling with tiny tax rises causes maximum outrage for minimum gain. It’s dead right to challenge such things as farmers and family businesses escaping inheritance tax, or the well-off getting winter fuel allowances that might be used, according to the Spectator, for buying thebest possible bottle of wine. But confronting older people, disabled people, farmers and small business lobbies with no overarching explanation was political suicide. The only tax rise commanding wide public support is removing VAT relief from private schools to spend on state schools (though you would never guess it from Tory press outrage).Minor taxes have gigantic coverage and wide public awareness, while big spending in tens of billions passes people by, a one-day announcement vanishing into the political ether. Bad comms, some Labour people grumble. Maybe so – but the real lack of messaging comes from the top. Yes, we know about the “non-negotiable” iron straitjacket and other mean, tough things, but we hear a lot less about purpose, hope, what George HW Bush dismissed sneerily as “the vision thing” (he was a one-term president). Yet you can detect Labour’s priorities when it actually spends taxpayers’ money on the good stuff.It’s time to remind citizens that their taxes go to things everyone values most – a strongNHS, good schools, safe streets, green energy, public places and parks to be proud of, and, of course, defence. The things that really matter can only be bought through taxation. Let’s hear that speech a hundred times from every minister; taxes will rise anyway, so get on the front foot and remind people that taxes are not a “burden”, but the price of civilisation. Britain has paid too little for too long compared with similar countries, and it shows in comparatively worse growth and services. Tell people we are not a high-tax country at all.Bad politics would be trying to sneak through tax rises unexplained, something that would be bound to fail. The Sunak-Hunt government lied through its teeth, promised things it never funded, pencilled in imaginary spending cuts for the future and introduced the unaffordable 4p national insurance cuts bribe that never paid off.Labour has no choice but honesty, after suffering the biggestdip in popularityof any newly elected UK government in 40 years. YouGov finds the greatest reason for defection is “broken promises or not delivering”. Here’s the irony: keeping its tax promises is its greatest risk for non-delivery. But for the best examination of how well or badly Labour’s first year has really gone, look at Full Fact’s thoroughanalysis of 62 manifesto pledges. I expected gloom, but was surprised at how relatively positive this diagnosis was. Most of Labour’s best outcomes will take years, such as building homes and huge sustainable energy projects. An impatient public may not wait, but the emphasis on long-term investment, green energy, housing, transport and defence is a brave endeavour.A blizzard of policies is emerging from months of reviews. Angela Rayner’s announcement this week that her£39bn social and affordable homes programmewould have at least 60% for social rent, was widely welcomed. Employment policy now relies, as it always should have done, on encouraging support from newly trained work coaches, not punishing benefit cuts, as did Labour’s successful 1997 New Deal.Thursday saw the10-year NHS plan, with its emphasis on prioritising community over hospital treatment, prevention before sickness, and the white heat of IT technology to drag the NHS into the 21st century. I spent time last week with Wes Streeting, when he spoke of gross health inequality in Blackpool, England’s worst area forpoverty and sickness, before visiting Whitegate health centre in the town, the kind of specialist health centre every neighbourhood needs. More of these are needed in hard-pressed places. But poverty is not for the NHS to solve. The child poverty taskforce led by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson has to restore faith in Labour’s prime purpose to give all children fair life chances.It so happens that Starmer’s first year in power on Saturday falls exactly on the 80th anniversary of Clement Attlee’s election in 1945. Times were far harder, debt far higher, but look what can be done, driving on regardless.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’ve heard it time and again.The former Labour leaderNeil Kinnockdescribed how Starmer was among the first to turn up on his doorstep after he lost his beloved wife, Glenys. “You don’t have time for this; you’ve got a party to lead,” Kinnock told him.Then there was the former employee who started crying over a cup of coffee as she recounted to me how warm her boss had been when she lost a loved one.The lawyerParvais Jabbar, who has been a close friend of the PM’s for almost 30 years since they started working together to oppose the death penalty around the world, offered the same opinion. “On a personal level, Keir is the opposite of ruthless,” he said.But on a political level?Having spoken to more than 100 sources for my paperbackTaken As Red, which tracks Starmer’s career from the moment he arrived in Westminster as a backbench MP through shadow cabinet roles to becoming Labour leader and then his first year as prime minister, I discovered his willingness to be politically ruthless, especially when it came to fixing things that had gone wrong. And right now it feels as if things have gone very wrong for the prime minister.On the eve of the anniversary of his first year in power, Starmer has not just suffered a humiliating climbdown over flagship reforms. His party is alsotrailing Reform UKin the polls and his personal popularity has spiralled down.Ben Walker at Britain Elects has compared Starmer’s position with those of his predecessors through their first year and showed that his-33 approval rating, 339 days into the role, was six points lower than Rishi Sunak’s (-27) at the same point and 77 points below Tony Blair’s (+44).Although some of the problems have little to do with the Treasury (such as a failure to plan across government, or thefreebiegate scandal), a number have emerged directly from No 11 Downing Street, including policies on winter fuel payments, inheritance tax changes for farmers and now welfare.That is why the sight of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,visibly upsetduring yesterday’s prime minister’s questions, and Starmer’s failure to fully back her in the moment (although his team later did), are leading people to ask how the prime minister will act in the face of declining popularity. Could he sack Reeves? Or his chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney?I know from studying Starmer that he is certainly capable of being ruthless. To that end, surely no one is safe.Don’t forget that he actually moved McSweeney on once before. After Labour’s disastrous loss in the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, thekey strategist was redeployedfrom Starmer’s chief of staff to campaign director. And he wasn’t the only one. McSweeney’s successor,Sam White, found his period in charge also brought to an early end, as did the next in line,Sue Gray.They are far from the only examples of Starmer’s willingness to take harsh action for political reasons. Take the phone call he made only 20 minutes after becoming Labour leader.Jennie Formby, who had been general secretary for Labour for two years, had wanted to discuss how she and Starmer would work together in the coming weeks. We won’t, Starmer told her. One of her allies told me there was shock. Pushing out Formby, who had been unwell with cancer, was without precedent, they said, pointing out it took Jeremy Corbyn three years to replace the previous general secretary.But after the controversies under Corbyn, including an antisemitism crisis, Starmer wanted to overhaul the party and did not hesitate when it came tosacking his leadership rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and thenremoving Corbyn himself. Starmer also forced through rule changes which meant that those on the most leftwing flank of the party would struggle to ever again reach the ballot for leadership.So I don’t doubt that Starmer could act now if he felt it were necessary. Arguably there was a streak of ruthlessness in his decision to tell his biographer Tom Baldwin that he “deeply regrets” using the term “island of strangers” in a recent speech.As for McSweeney, there are rumours of vulnerability, suggesting that he could be replaced by someone such as Liz Lloyd, Tony Blair’s former deputy chief of staff who joined Starmer’s administration last November as director of policy. But it’s worth remembering that Starmer credits McSweeney with last year’s election victory and for turning things around when he hit tough times in the past.Would he really move against Reeves? In this case, there is definitely a different dynamic from those he has acted against in the past. Starmer has liked and trusted Reeves since a breakfast shortly before he became leader. And surely this has been their joint project, in which the most controversial decisions being blamed on the Treasury could also be laid at No 10’s door.After the welfare vote debacle, this much is clear: Starmer must change. Labour MPs will demand it | Rafael BehrRead moreSources tell me that the PM trusted his chancellor so completely over means-testing winter fuel payments that he nodded through the proposal based on the figures alone. As for welfare, senior figures under Starmer have known for weeks that it was going to be a major problem.When it comes to this threatened rebellion that was unprecedented in scale, many blame the prime minister himself for failing to reach out personally to his own backbenchers and persuade them to remain loyal. Rebuilding relations with backbenchers is going to be key for Starmer if he is to recover.For some close to Starmer, his loyalty to Reeves has been “frustrating”. I don’t doubt that it has wobbled and that he would be prepared to act. But he must also know that removing a chancellor carries the risk of turning all the ire towards him. As ever, he’ll deliberate and weigh the options very carefully. He is ruthless, that we know – but far from reckless.Anushka Asthana is the US editor for Channel 4 News and author ofTaken As Red: The Truth About Starmer’s LabourExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourRachel ReevesPMQscommentShareReuse this content"

He has unashamedlyflashed an apparent Nazi salute;encouragedrightwing extremists in Germany and elsewhere;falsely claimedthere is a “genocide” in South Africaagainst white farmers; callouslycelebrated the dismantling of USAID, whose shuttering will lead tothe deaths of millions, according to a study published in the Lancet this week; andincreased misinformation and empowered extremistson his Twitter/X platform while advancing his sham “I am a free speech absolutist” claims. And so much more.So the news that Donald Trump “will take a look” at deporting his billionaire former “first buddy” Musk has many smirking and shrugging: “Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.”I like a good comeuppance, but this doesn’t please me at all. It sends a chill down the spine. It is the use of law enforcement agencies as a tool to chill debate, to silence disagreement and dissent, and to punish political opposition. Democracy isdimming fastin the United States, but threats to deport US citizens for disagreeing with the governing administration’s policies are the domain of authoritarian regimes such asBelarusorCameroon.Ice is cracking down on Trump’s own supporters. Will they change their minds? | Tayo BeroRead moreComing just hours after his officialsraised the possibilityof stripping Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral candidate for New York who was naturalised in 2018, of his US citizenship, Trump’s threat should have all of America – a country of immigrants – appalled, afraid and up in arms. As theGuardian reportedon Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, appeared to pave the way for an investigation into Mamdani’s status after Andy Ogles, a rightwing Republican congressman for Tennessee, called for his citizenship to be revoked on the grounds that he might have concealed his support for “terrorism” during the naturalization process. Trump has branded Mamdani “a pure communist” and said “we don’t need a communist in this country”.Mamdani has not broken any laws. His sin? Running for office.In his threats against Mamdani and Musk, the president comes across like the notorious Republican senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. McCarthy was, according to the Harvard law dean Ervin Griswold, “judge, jury, prosecutor, castigator, and press agent, all in one”. Trump’s threats to Musk and Mamdani are a departure from the administration’s modus operandi of targeting foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian organizing on US college campuses. It is now targeting people it disagrees with on any issue. The threats are not based on any generally applicable laws but on the whim of the president or other administration leaders. It is an escalation of the assault on civil liberties using government entities to arbitrarily investigate and potentially punish critics.Over the past four weeks Musk’s sin has been to vehemently oppose Trump’ssweeping spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination”. Musk is of course not concerned about the bill’sslashing of health insurance, food stamps and other aid for the poor, but that it does not slash enough and that its cuts to green energy tax credits maycost his company, Tesla, about $1.2bn.But Musk is a US citizen with the right to oppose a piece of legislation without threats from the highest office in the land and the fear of deportation. When Musk poured$288m of his moneyinto Trump and other Republicans’ 2024 candidacies, no one raised a hand to question his credentials as an American. Instead, the administration gave him therun of the White Houseincluding midnight ice cream binges and a job asa glorified bean counterat the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge).The Guardian view on Trump and deportation protests: the king of confected emergencies | EditorialRead moreThe hypocrisy and the corruption embedded within Trump’s deportation threats is mind-boggling but unsurprising given his track record. The consequence, like the McCarthyism of the 1950s, is a climate of fear and a chilling of political discourse and action. Proud Americans who arrived here recently, such as Mamdani, are fearful of running for office, of speaking their minds in true American tradition, despite having the same responsibilities and privileges as every other American conferred on them. Trump’s threat does to Musk what it does to every immigrant: it shuts them up, it holds over their head the possibility of made-up charges and deportation to El Salvador or some other country.Musk and his like were chortling when the Columbia University activistMahmoud Khalilwas cruelly detained for months. It is in the nature of those who like to tweet about freedom but do not think about it deeply enough, such as Musk, to not realize that their silence when the rights of a Khalil or a Mamdani are trampled upon will come back to haunt them. The Republican rump is silent today as Musk is threatened with deportation, just as it has been when masked men have come for Khalil and others who dared exercise their first amendment rights.There will be silence when they come for theRepublicans. That’s because we will all be gone by then, after no one else said a thing.Justice Malala is a political commentator and author of The Plot To Save South Africa: The Week Mandela Averted Civil War and Forged a New NationExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniUS immigrationRepublicansTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

That takes courageThu 3 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 09.53 EDTShareAvery unusual thing happened at the weekend, an event so outlandish, so vanishingly rare, that even in these times of general chaos and disorder it deserves our attention: someone prominent joined the tiny cohort of people willing to publicly criticise Oprah. I’m not talking about an attack from the right. Donald Trump and his Maga cronies routinely go after Oprah Winfrey as (feel free to laugh) a lefty agitator. I’m talking about the actor Rosie O’Donnell, on Instagram,calling outAmerica’s queen for showing up at the Jeff Bezos wedding.Of course, criticising someone for throwing in their lot with Bezos shouldn’t be in the least controversial. The gross parade of wedding guests attending his marriage to Lauren Sánchez in Venice last weekend looked like a catwalk of shame. There was Leonardo DiCaprio,hiding his face with his hat(we still see you!), in the company of his positively geriatric 27-year-old girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti. There were the Kardashians, not hiding their faces. There was Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. And there, accompanied by her lady-in-waiting, Gayle King, who walked several paces behind her as is proper, was Oprah Winfrey.Why shouldn’t Oprah go to the wedding ofJeff Bezosand Lauren Sánchez? It’s a big splashy event that, given the chance, wouldn’t any of us have gone to as well? (Honestly? Probably.) Still, we hold Oprah to higher standards. It’s Oprah, for god sake, the woman we grew up adoring, who burst through so many ceilings, who Tina Fey correctly cast as a god-like figure in that episode of 30 Rock (where her character, Liz Lemon, took too many pills, got on a flight, and hallucinated that Oprah was sitting next to her in club class). In that scene, Fey did what we would all do if encountering Oprah while our inhibitions were lowered: she sniffed Oprah’s hair, told her she loved her and went on a deranged monologue that included the phrases “I eat emotionally” and “I saw your show about following your fear and it inspired me to wear shorts to work”.And it’s not only love that staunches our criticism of Oprah. We also fear her. It has been the case for years now that the quickest and most effective way for a screen personality to curb press criticism is to launch a book group, guaranteeing that every hack touting a book – which is every hack in existence – nurtures a tiny flame of hope they will be chosen and whisked away from all this. Who among us has a bad word to say about Sarah Jessica Parker (hello!), or Reese Witherspoon (hi!), or the apex predator of celebrity book groups, the original and best, Oprah.2:21Celebrities and protesters converge on Venice for Bezos and Sánchez wedding – videoLikewise: who can forget the cautionary tale of what happened to Jonathan Franzen in 2001 when he expressed doubt that being selected for Oprah’s Book Club was the best thing ever to have happened to him? Granted, Franzen’s criticism was graceless. (He suggested Oprah’s picks were a bit low-brow.) But his broader point about TV consuming literary culture was given no credence whatsoever. This was a few years before James Frey’s makey-uppy memoir was exposed,and Oprah’s book club brand briefly damaged. Instead, Franzen was burned alive for his remarks, not least by Joyce Carol Oates, whose novel, We Were the Mulvaneys, was chosen by Oprah that season and who told me at the time: “Jonathan Franzen perceives the Oprah book readers as mainly women, and he would prefer a male readership.” Brutal.Anyway, back to Rosie O’Donnell, an icon in her own right who is now living in Ireland after making good on her threat to leave the US if Trump was elected. “Is Oprah friends with Jeff Bezos,” she asked rhetoricallyon Instagramin the wake of the wedding. “Really? How is that possible? He treats his employees with disdain. By any metric he is not a nice man.”That was it. Doesn’t look like much, but it was seismic given the general timorousness around Oprah. And this despite years of evidence that a woman who was once a trailblazer for good has drifted into murkier waters, from her promotion ofshonky showbiz medic, Dr Oz, to her enabling of crankslikeJenny McCarthy, and the power of positive thinkingpseudoscience ofRhonda Byrne, to showing up at the wedding of one of the world’s richest men, who begrudges his minimum wage workers their pee breaks.Congrats to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez on the wedding – and to Venice for running them out of town | Emma BrockesRead moreGoing back further, you can even take issue with the aspirational tone of Oprah’s original brand, the only sustained critique of which I’ve read is by Janice Peck, an academic at the University of Colorado, who wrote a book called The Age of Oprah in which she questioned whether the media titan’s dare-to-dream ethos was so apolitical as to skew heavily rightwing. Per Oprah’s narrative, said Peck, “she was poor and living in sackcloth someplace and then becameOprah Winfreyand everything in between and the whole historical context, all the conditions that made it possible for her to succeed, disappear. The American dream is based on that notion of: if you just put your mind to it.”I understand this point, although I also think there’s room for dare-to-dream cheerleading alongside rigorous, data-supported policy platforms. But whichever way you see these things, the bottom line is we should be able to criticise Oprah, right? This should not be hard. And yet as I type this, now, I have a small knot of dread in my stomach. Oh, god. I’ve done the wrong thing, haven’t I. Oprah! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it! I still love you!

The corporations would asset-strip our brains, but we can take back controlThu 3 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 06.41 EDTShareAyoung woman I met recently remarked that it was not so much the existence of pure evil that drove her berserk, but rather people or institutions with the capacity to do good who instead ended up damaging humanity. Her musing made me think ofKarl Marx, whose quarrel with capitalism was precisely that – not so much that it was exploitative but that it dehumanised and alienated usdespitebeing such a progressive force.Preceding social systems might have been more oppressive or exploitative than capitalism. However, only under capitalism have humans been so fully alienated from our products and environment, so divorced from our labour, so robbed of even a modicum of control over what we think and do. Capitalism, especially after it shifted into itstechnofeudal phase, turned us all into some version of Caliban or Shylock – monads in an archipelago of isolated selves whose quality of life is inversely related to the abundance of gizmos our newfangled machinery produces.This week, alongside a host of other politicians, writers and thinkers, I will be speaking at theMarxism 2025 festivalin London, and one of the questions that occupies me is the way in which young people today clearly feel this alienation Marx identified. But the backlash against immigrants and identity politics – not to mention the algorithmic distortion of their voices – paralyses them. Here Marx can re-enter with advice on how to overcome this paralysis – good advice that lies buried under the sands of time.Take the argument that minorities living in the west should assimilate lest we end up a society of strangers. When Marx was 25, he read a book by Otto Bauer, a thinker he respected, making the case that to qualify for citizenship, German Jews should renounce Judaism.Marx was livid. Though the young Marx had no time for Judaism, indeed for any religion, his passionate demolition of Bauer’s argument is a sight for sore eyes: “Does the standpoint ofpoliticalemancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion? … Just as the stateevangelizeswhen … it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, so the Jewacts politicallywhen, although a Jew, he demands civic rights.”The trick that Marx is teaching us here is how to combine a commitment to the religious freedom of Jews, Muslims, Christians etc with the wholesale rejection of the presumption that, in a class society, the state can represent the general interest. Yes, Jews, Muslims, people of faiths that we may not share – or even much like – must be emancipated immediately. Yes, women, black people and LGBTQ+ people must be granted equal rights well before any socialist revolution appears on the horizon. But freedom will take a lot more than that.Shifting to the topic of immigrant workers suppressing the wages of local workers, another minefield for today’s younger people, a letter Marx sent in 1870 to two associates in New York City offers brilliant clues on how to deal not only with the Nigel Farages of the world but also with some leftists who have bitten the anti-immigration bait.In his letter, Marx fully acknowledges that American and English employers were purposely exploiting cheap Irish immigrant labour, pitting them against native-born workers and weakening labour solidarity. But for Marx it was self-defeating for trade unions to turn against the Irish immigrants and espouse anti-immigration narratives. No, the solution was never to banish immigrant workers but to organise them. And if the problem is the weakness of the unions, or fiscal austerity, then the solution can never be to scapegoat immigrant workers.Speaking of trade unions, Marx also has some splendid advice for them. Yes, it is crucial to boost wages to reduce worker exploitation. But let us not fall for the fantasy of fair wages. The only way to render the workplace fair is to do away with an irrational system based on the strict separation of those who work but do not own and the tiny minority who own but do not work.In his words: “Trade unions work well as centres of resistance against the encroachments of capital. [But] [t]hey fail generally from limiting themselves to a guerrilla war against the effects of the existing system, instead of also trying to change it.”‘Capitalism is dead. Now we have something much worse’: Yanis Varoufakis on extremism, Starmer, and the tyranny of big techRead moreChange it into what? A new corporate structure based on the principle of one-employee-one-share-one vote – the kind of agenda that can truly inspire youngsters who crave freedom both from statism and from corporations driven by the bottom lines of private equity firms or an absent owner who may not even know he or she owns part of the firm they work for.Last, Marx’s freshness shines through when we try to make sense of the technofeudal world that big tech, along with big finance and our states, has surreptitiously encased us in. To understand why this is a form of technofeudalism, something much worse than surveillance capitalism, we need to think as Marx would have of our smartphones, tablets etc. To see them as a mutation of capital – or “cloud capital” – that directly modifies our behaviour. To grasp how mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs created a world where, while privatisation and private equity asset-strip all physical wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains.Only through Marx’s lens can we truly get it: that to own our minds individually, we must own cloud capital collectively.Yanis Varoufakis is the leader of MeRA25, a former finance minister and author ofTechnofeudalism: What Killed CapitalismExplore more on these topicsKarl MarxOpinionYanis VaroufakisImmigration and asylumEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

But unless Starmer can articulate an idea of the Britain he wants, the public – and his party – may desert himThu 3 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 05.33 EDTShareThere will be no birthday candles in Downing Street this week. Nor should there be. Twelve months after Labour’s landslide election win on 4 July 2024, Keir Starmer’s government has capped a year in office with a week of political dishevelment and ineptitude. The welfare reform bill itself isnow a meaningless shell. The Labour party is united only in its frustrations.The welfare rebellion was not a bolt from the blue. Instead, it provides the keystone to an arc of earlier blunders. It poses urgent issues about professional incompetence in Labour’s Westminster machine. It embodies what is not working in the way Starmer’s top-down party does politics more generally. This will not be the end of it, as the furore over Rachel Reeves’s tears at a raucous prime minister’s questions seems to confirm. Things can’t go on like this.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer’s past 12 months have been riddled with avoidable errors.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAMore specifically, the welfare bill poses the question of how the Labour party now negotiates its commitment to the truly poor with the concerns of the much larger number of voters who are not poor. Tuesday’s divisions showed that pitting one against the other is merely destructive. Yet Labour has not developed a plan to reconcile the two more sensibly. It will need to learn fast from this shock. The fact remains that Labour can only ever win and retain power if it is more than just the party of the poor.The MPs’ revolt turbocharges other questions that were already dominating politics, long before this week, but which the welfare row embodied. First, how on earth did Starmer’s Labour manage to squander so much support so fast and decisively after winning its 174-seat Commons majority in 2024? And, second, what can Labour do about it in the time that remains?The two are umbilically connected. But the second question is the one that matters more. Retrieving a dire situation means focusing on the future, not apologising for the past. Labour has to reverse its losses to have any hope of winning the second election victory on which Starmer once banked, but which now seems an unrealisably distant dream.To do this nevertheless requires understanding of what has gone so badly. The past 12 months have been riddled with avoidable errors, tin-eared moments and, above all, have been painfully marked by an absence of vision and even competence. Anthony Seldon, doyen of historians of Downing Street, saysno prime minister since 1945has begun as badly as Starmer. The polling figures bear this out.This is a crisis. Don’t bullshit about it. Don’t take refuge in blaming the media. It won’t do, either, to harp on about the unfairness of partisan attacks from Labour’s rivals. Nor is there much value in stressing the immense difficulties that have undoubtedly faced Starmer: attempting to govern amid war in Europe, the Trump counter-revolution, global migration pressures and a seemingly embedded economic stagnation. These are truths. They define the real context of the government’s task. But they cannot be excuses.It should have been obvious on day one, even with a vast majority and the Tory party on its knees, that Labour’s 2024 performance wasn’t the triumph it sometimes felt like.Only 34% of the votescast last year were for Labour. But only 60% of Britons voted at all. So Starmer’s parliamentary supremacy was conferred by a mere 20% of the country, and by fewer than 10 million voters. Right from the start he needed to broaden his coalition, to pay far more attention to building trust across the nation.This required more than triangulating Nigel Farage or the striking of attitudes. The underlying truth about Labour’s relationship with the nation is that four out of five Britons were unconvinced by the party, even after the shambles of the Johnson-Truss-Sunak years. Today, that doubting majority is even larger. In anaverage of polls, Labour now stands on 23%. One in three of its already low total of 2024 voters have gone elsewhere. It was always a loveless landslide. It is now in grave danger of being an unwanted one.It is true that other prime ministers have got themselves into difficulties, lost byelections, faced parliamentary revolts and had bad press in their first year. Within months of winning power in 1979, Margaret Thatcher came under open attack from members of her own cabinet over economic policy, something that has not yet happened to Starmer. Tony Blair faced a 47-MP revolt on lone parent benefit in his year one in 1997, almost identical to Starmer’s 49-MP rebellion on Tuesday. Both recovered to win landslides at the next general elections.Why should Starmer not do the same? One reason is because trust in government and politics is now far lower than in the past. Starmer is an analogue prime minister in a digital age. Another is that it was always extremely clear what both Thatcher and Blair were aiming to achieve in government. Each had a project – Thatcher to roll back the state and the trade unions, Blair to modernise Britain’s economy and place in the world. Voters knew what they were getting. What, though, is Starmer’s project? What is the destination he aims to reach?Answering this question is the most important task facing Starmer today. In the most famous sentence Charles de Gaulle ever penned, at the start of the war memoirs he wrote in the 1950s, he said: “All my life, I have had a certain idea of France.” As his biographer Julian Jackson makes clear, De Gaulle’s “certain idea” was not always consistent, and was never a fully articulated programme – more a stance than a doctrine. But De Gaulle’s idea had very clear features, which millions of French voters understood and often approved of. He stood for a distinct French historical identity, for France’s political independence, for its grandeur and for its social cohesion.Whether Starmer has a certain idea of Britain, let alone has held that idea all his life, is hard to know.His recent interviewwith his biographer Tom Baldwin suggests not. The interview is oddly naive. It is full of regrets and admissions of bad judgment but has little sense of history or people. Yet the need for Starmer to tell an uplifting story to Britons about Britain is at least as important as his need to solve some of his more specific policy problems.Starmer is a bit like a ship’s captain who, faced with rough weather and heavy seas, ploughs on without telling the passengers and crew why. He may in fact be doing the right thing for the ship of state. Calmer seas may perhaps await. The voyage may eventually prove prosperous. But whether the problem is his failure to explain, a lack of basic seagoing skills, or just a stubborn overconfidence, the result right now is very different – an unhappy Labour ship, and even a mutinous one.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourGeneral election 2024commentShareReuse this content"

None of the Israelis I spoke to were willing to publicly name these horrorsThu 3 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 07.13 EDTShareIt has been less than two months since my niece Juri – a bright, giggling six-year-old – was killed inGaza. We buried her while her sister recovered from her injuries and her father tried to walk again on shattered legs. Just a week ago, I was struck by another unbearable loss. My 16-year-old nephew Ali was killed: a drone-fired rocket tore through him and six members of our extended family while they were sitting outside the last house we had left – the only one that hadn’t yet been reduced to dust.Ali was split in two. That’s not a metaphor: it’s literally what the rocket did to his body. A child trying to escape the stifling heat inside a home without electricity, without water, without safety. A child whose only crime was sitting on a plastic chair in a corridor with his uncles – men in their 60s – trying to breathe, trying to live, trying to find a sliver of comfort in a place where even comfort has become a threat.Why were they killed? They were not fighters. They had no weapons. They were not hiding. They were not “human shields”. They were not even moving. Just sitting quietly, maybe sipping tea, maybe just sweating and waiting for the night breeze. And then – a drone. A rocket. A flash. A crater. A silence that never ends. There is no “mistake” here. No misfire. The drone did not guess. It hovered. It watched. It picked its target. It aimed. And it hit. Directly.And still there will be no headlines. No outrage, no press conferences, no candlelit vigils in western capitals, no hashtags, no questions asked. But I want to tell you something else. Even after all the horror inflicted on my family by Israel – the killings, the starvation, the loss – I said yes to an invitation to attend a peace conference in Paris. It was part of a series of gatherings leading up to a major summit that was meant to take place in New York, where President Emmanuel Macron had promised to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state.Not long after the Paris meeting, the New York conference was quietly postponed. No explanation. No urgency. As if peace – like everything else in our lives – could be delayed indefinitely. Still, I went to Paris. I went even though I was warned there would be supporters of the Israeli governmentin the room.I didn’t flinch.I will go anywhere and speak to anyone if it means stopping the mass killing of my people.I went not for revenge but for hope. I sat in a room with Israeli participants who said they wanted peace, just like I did. But something was off. While we all spoke of peace, only I seemed willing to speak of death. None of the Israelis I spoke to would acknowledge the genocide in Gaza. At best, a few admitted that Israel was committing war crimes – but not genocide. This, in spite of the overwhelming consensus amonginternational organisations,Israeli academicsandgenocide scholarsthat what is happening in Gaza amounts to a genocide.A couple approached me quietly and, in whispers, confessed that, yes, what was happening was indeed a genocide. But they said it like a secret. A thing too dangerous to say aloud. As if the truth was a weapon that might ruin the prospect of peace.We spoke of peace in abstract terms. Big, sweeping, beautiful ideas about coexistence and shared futures. But no one wanted to confront the blood-soaked ground beneath us. No one wanted to talk about starving children. Or the drone that tore through my nephew’s body. Or the silence that follows the screams. Even some fellow Palestinians – from other parts of Palestine – didn’t want to acknowledge the ongoing massacre in Gaza. I felt extremely alone. I felt like an obstacle. Like I was too raw, too inconvenient, too real. Everyone else was busy building bridges while I was still trying tokeep my family alive.In the Jabalia refugee camp, my sister has reached breaking point. What will it take to stop this nightmare? | Ahmed NajarRead moreAt one point, an Israeli woman asked me: “Wouldn’t it be better if Gazans left for a while, until Gaza is rebuilt?” She said it as if exile was neutral.As if 1948hadn’t happened. As if we hadn’t learned that when Palestinians leave, they’re not allowed to return. I told her: perhaps in theory, if people could leave temporarily and come back, then maybe. I even said: “Perhaps they could stay in the Negev desert [in southern Israel] and return when Gaza is rebuilt.” She stormed out. “You don’t want peace,” she told me.But amid all of this, I also spoke with another Israeli woman – kind, thoughtful and honest – who told me that she had been directly impacted by the 7 October attack. She didn’t hide her pain. “We are the minority in Israel,” she said to me. “Most people are much more anti-Palestinian.” I believed her. And I appreciated her willingness to talk. But even she – someone who truly seemed to want peace – couldn’t bring herself to call what’s happening in Gaza a genocide.And that left me wondering: if this is the small minority of Israelis who believe in coexistence, and even they cannot confront what is happening in Gaza, what hope do we really have? If those who say they want peace cannot even recognise our suffering, what kind of peace are we talking about?I don’t know whether that conference left me hopeless about peace or whether it taught me something essential: that peace between Palestinians and Israelis will require unimaginable courage. The kind that doesn’t flinch from reality or hide behind lofty words while people are being buried under concrete and fire.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead morePeace will require Palestinians to be willing to speak about their pain and still see the humanity of those who inflicted it. And it will require Israelis who are brave enough to confront what their government has done, and continues to do, in their name. There will be no real peace until both sides can stand face to face and say: “We were wrong. We were complicit. And we choose something better.”Ali was killed after I returned from Paris, where I’d sat in the room and tried to build bridges. I’d told people about my niece Juri and begged them to see our pain – and now Ali too is gone. But something inside me has shifted. Not into rage but into resolve. Peace cannot be built on silence or denial. It cannot be built while Palestinians are treated as disposable. It begins with justice, truth and a political solution that guarantees the rights of Palestinians to live in freedom, in dignity and with self-determination. And at the very least, it must begin with the most basic right of all: the right to stay alive.Ahmed Najar is a financial and political analyst as well as a playwrightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So the publication of Labour’s 10-year plan for health in England was a crucial opportunity for ministers to show that they are in tune with the public. Given that satisfaction with the health service has hit arecord low of 21%, and doctors are again threatening togo on strike, the announcement was also a moment of peril – even before thedamage suffered by the prime minister and chancellorearlier this week, when rebels forced a U-turn on planned cuts to welfare.The overarching principles of Labour’s reforms were set out last year: more prevention, more technology, more caredelivered in the community(as opposed to in hospital). So the challenge was to find something fresh, original and hopeful to say. The promise of science and the potential of localism are what Wes Streeting’s team has come up with. Thestrand of DNApictured on the document’s cover points to high expectations ofgenomic medicineand other cutting-edge technology. Neighbourhood clinics, by contrast, represent a prosaic recognition of demand for more ordinary services and treatments, from an ageing and increasingly unhealthy population. The aim is to deliver most outpatient care away from hospitals by 2035.This could mean GP surgeries becoming more like hospitals, or hospital trusts taking a bigger role in primary care. The plans for new contracts make it clear that both are possible. But while this sounds fine in theory, questions remain over how, and by whom, such crucial decisions will be taken, and whether the new model will be better than the old one. With theabolition of NHS England, and scaling back of integrated care boards, the existing administration is being radically downsized. One of the risks of the next few years is that this backstage upheaval will distract time and energy from the frontline.Plans toshift resources from richer areas to poorer onesdeserve an unequivocal welcome. There is no great secret about expertise being concentrated in prestigious teaching hospitals, or about richer, better educated people being more confident advocates for themselves and their loved ones. Shifting the “best to the rest” is both a neat slogan and an acknowledgment of present unfairness. Plans to integrate employment support and services such as debt advice into healthcare hubs signal an encouraging awareness that illness and disability have socioeconomic as well as biological causes.The plan tells a promising story. Healthcare is an area of human progress that all can celebrate. It is plausible that proactiveLabourministers can both drive advances and ensure that they are more equitably shared than in marketised systems. Embedding more healthcare workers in communities, and focusing on outreach, could help to improve population health. But there are some worrying gaps.Social care reform is due to be tackled separately, but worsening mental health,particularly in young people, also needs dedicated attention and research. Ministers should also be pressed on the contradictions between their health plan and their pro-growth, anti-regulation message to businesses – including those that sell alcohol and the high-sugar foods thatcause obesity. Having brought control of the NHS in England back in-house, to the heart of government, Mr Streeting must now find the people with the imagination to further develop his plan, while turning it into action.Explore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHospitalsGPsWes StreetingHealth policyGeneticsMental healtheditorialsShareReuse this content"

It … aims to create a climate of extreme fear,” said Jack Straw, the then home secretary.Some MPs still feared that a group like Greenpeace, which had destroyed genetically modified crops and temporarily halted nuclear weapons production at Aldermaston,might be proscribed. Mr Straw reassured them that such bans would be used only when absolutely necessary; he knew of “no evidence whatever” that the actions of the environmental group “would fall remotely under [its] scope”.UN expertswarned this weekthat “acts of protest that damage property, but are not intended to kill or injure people, should not be treated as terrorism”. Yet on Wednesday, MPs voted – by385 to 26– to proscribe Palestine Action under the 2000 legislation. The Lords were expected to approve the order on Thursday. Unless a high court judge orders its suspension ata hearingon Friday, from Saturday, being a member of or simply expressing support for the groupwill carry a maximum penaltyof 14 years. The ban was announced days after Palestine Action claimed responsibility forbreaking into an RAF baseand spraying paint on to planes that it claimed were supporting the Israeli military campaign. Four peoplehave been charged.Hundreds of lawyers, cultural figures and groups such as Amnesty International have condemned the ban. It is lamentable that MPs backed it. But cynically listing two white-supremacist organisations on the same order – Maniacs Murder Cult, whose members have claimed violent attacks globally, and Russian Imperial Movement, which seeks to create a new Russian imperial state – made it harder for legislators to vote it down.The British state has plenty of legislation to deal with direct action. Palestine Action activists have been arrested and charged with criminal damage, violent disorder and burglary. Thesuspicionis that frequent acquittals have led to this order. Pouring paint over military aircraft and buildings, and tossing smoke bombs, does not sound like the kind of extreme act that the public rightly reviles as terrorism. Rather, the ban appears designed not only to silence supporters but to reduce public sympathy by placing the group on a par with Islamic State and the extreme-right group National Action.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary,alleges thatPalestine Action’s methods “have become more aggressive, with its members demonstrating a willingness to use violence”. The public will need to see evidence of this – rather than take such claims on trust – if their faith in the state is not to be undermined.Palestine Action has targeted property to challenge a war in which tens of thousands of civilians have been killed. The group’s protests embarrass the government: the UK continues tosupply equipment to Israel’s militaryas it slaughters Palestinians. Despite overwhelming evidence that war crime is piling on war crime in Gaza, and reportedlycontrary to the advice of its own lawyers, the British governmentwill not saythat Israel has broken international law. The government should be doing all it can to end this conflict, not to criminalise protests against it. But you do not need to sympathise with Palestine Action’s aims to believe that its proscription sets a chilling precedent and undermines democracy.Explore more on these topicsProtestOpinionJack StrawCounter-terrorism policyLabourIsrael-Gaza warActivismThe far righteditorialsShareReuse this content"

Draper, the new hope of British men’s tennis, had come into these championships with expectations that he would leave his mark. Instead he was taught a grand slam lesson by the veteran Marin Cilic and leaves Wimbledon with fresh lessons to take on board in his burgeoning career.There has been distinct excitement at Draper’s prospects in SW19 this summer after his heady ascent up the rankings and victory at Indian Wells in the spring. That this was only his fourthWimbledonappearance and that none of his previous outings had gone beyond the second round was not given much weight. But perhaps a lack of experience told here, at least in how Draper managed the match, while the 36-year-old Cilic, a Wimbledon finalist in 2017, revelled in his own on-court Indian summer.Wimbledon 2025: Draper crashes out against Cilic, Sinner v Vukic – liveRead more“It makes me think that Andy’s achievement of what he did, winning here twice, was just unbelievable,” Draper said, having collected his thoughts after the 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 reverse. “I wasn’t going out there thinking I was under so much pressure. I just didn’t play good enough today. I lost to a better player. I wasn’t able to find the level I wanted.”It seems, too, fair to imagine there’s an element of deflection in that answer. Part of Murray’s great triumph was to rise above the clamour of expectation that met him every time he set foot in the All England Club. And Draper did look tight in the match, particularly the opening two sets. But there were other obvious factors: he points to a struggle to find his feet on grass, and then there was the form of Cilic.View image in fullscreenMarin Cilic closes in to play a forehand against Jack Draper. The victor has come back from injury and said: ‘To play in front of this crowd and against Jack is incredible.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe Croat’s strength of serve is well known and his whipped forehand a deadly weapon. What was less clear was how able he would be to summon those powers after more than two years out of the game dealing with a knee injury that required two rounds of surgery. An omen was to be found in Nottingham last month, when the 36-year-old won the grass-court tournament and became the oldest winner ever of an ATP Challenger event (usurping Murray). Here he looked a player who had emerged fully from rehabilitation, and was the more mobile player on court.Speaking in front of the crowds on Court One, Cilic described his emotions as “just incredible”. Coming back from the place he was in two years ago “I can’t even describe” he said. “It has been a long journey but I never lost any doubt. It was a long and testing period, plus a huge challenge for me in this part of my career to come back and play at this level. To play in front of this crowd and against Jack is incredible, so thanks everyone for your great sportsmanship.”The dynamic of the first set had seen Cilic leading the rallies and Draper in dogged pursuit of the ball. It had allowed the 23-year-old to stay in the game, but he was leaving himself little room for error. At 4-3 Draper fell 0-40 down on his serve but somehow clawed his way back. At 5-4, however, Cilic tore into Draper again, got to three break points again, and this time converted with a backhand return winner off an anaemic second serve.The Briton’s head was down, he appeared to be in his own thoughts and the second set slipped away from him quickly. “You run out of time,” was how he put it. “The match is going so quick, the points are going by so quickly. I feel like every ball is on my feet on the returns and on the serves, you’re not really getting a look.” By the time he was 4-2 down in the second set Draper was railing against the umpires and the narrow calls dictated by Wimbledon’s AI, a service he thinks “isn’t 100% correct”. It didn’t look good.In the third set Draper reset. The energy returned and with it some execution. Game on, or at least it felt that way. Cilic was not paying attention to the narrative, however. After ceding the third set, he stayed calm in the fourth and summoned again the power and placement that had served him so well. With the match reaching a decisive point at 5-4, he stepped forward on to Draper’s serve once more. He missed a drop shot inches from the net on the first point but did not let it rock him and while Draper struggled to find his rhythm, Cilic found the lines and the corners. At 30-40 a limp forehand from Draper failed to clear the cord and that was that.“I think in some ways it’s a good thing,” Draper said of defeat. “It highlighted a lot of areas of my game which I need to continue to improve on if I want to be consistently a top player and going deep in these slams. Everyone is a great player [here] and you’re going to come unstuck if you’re not good enough.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Marin CilicJack DraperWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Arianna Caruso’s spectacular first-half goal proved the difference in a close encounter against a well-organised Belgium.With the game evenly matched, it was one that required just a moment of quality. Caruso is Italy’s puppet-master, pulling the strings with ease from the heart of the midfield. Her goal was an example of what Italy can do when they are at their best.Belgium v Italy: Women’s Euro 2025 – liveRead moreWith space opening up, Caruso broke forward and collected Lucia Di Guglielmo’s pinpoint pass into her feet on the edge of the penalty area. The finish was exquisite, a curling shot past the helpless Lisa Lichtfus.The beauty of the goal was matched only by the majesty of the Swiss Alps that surrounded the scenic Stade de Tourbillon. This promised to be an intriguing encounter with both knowing how important a victory would be.Italy have been on a journey under Andrea Soncin since he took over the reins in September 2023. TheAzzurrehave undergone somewhat of a regeneration since. A technical and creative side, they beat Germany in December and recently finished second in their Nations League campaign.Soncin opted to change shape, moving to a back three of Martina Lenzini, Cecilia Salvai, Elena Linari in an attempt to control Belgium’s counterattacking potency. They were dealt a blow earlier in the week when the forward Chiara Beccari was ruled out of the tournament with a thigh injury but they are certainly not short of attacking talent. Leading the line was their captain and centurion, Cristiana Girelli. The 35-year-old striker continues to prove that age is but a number, finishing as top scorer in the Serie A Femminile this past season and now appearing in her fourth European Championship.Coming up against Belgium, however, has traditionally proven to be a hurdle for the Italians. Elisabet Gunnarsdóttir’s side have had some eye-catching results themselves in recent months – their3-2 victory over Englandin April was a highlight – and have enjoyed the better head-to-head record against the Italians in recent years. Euro 2022, in particular, would have been fresh in the memory when they edged past Italy in the group stage to reach the quarter-finals. They have their own talismanic forward in Tessa Wullaert, who drives her side forward with her energy and instinctive eye for goal.There was a sombre feeling before the game as players and fans stood inmemory of the Portugal and Liverpool player Diogo Jotaand his brother André Silva, who died in a car crash in the early hours of Thursday morning. It is news that has shaken the football world and was the first of four games where a minute’s silence will be held in tribute over the next two days.View image in fullscreenLucia Di Guglielmo (left) and Hannah Eurlings battle for possession with the Swiss Alps in view.Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/APFrom the first whistle, the game was tight and highly competitive, characterised by strong organisation and challenges. Belgium started the better, controlling possession. As predicted, they were at their best when they were able to break forward on transition, using the pace of Wullaert and the full-back Jill Janssens in particular. The pair had the Red Flames’ best opportunities in the first half; both misfired with agonising inaccuracy. Justine Vanhaevermaet’s physical presence was disrupting Italy in the middle of the park and as the BBC’s Vicki Sparks commented, she “towered over the Italians much like the mountains of Sion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The breakthrough came at the perfect time, a minute before the break, to take the wind out of their opponents’ sails.The second half was a scrappy affair as the play became littered with interruptions. Lichtfus made two important saves to ensure the deficit remained narrow, denying Girelli a clever back-heeled finish before getting a glove to Michela Cambiaghi’s effort.Italy finished the stronger and were able to see out an important three points before a meeting with Portugal. For Belgium, the challenge of Spain awaits and the pressure is on if they want to avoid an early exit.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Belgium women's football teamItaly women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And batted. And batted. They batted on so long that summer’s roses had budded, bloomed and withered again before they were finished. Excited little kids who had taken seats in the family stand first thing in the morning left it as jaded pensioners in the evening.It was even rumoured that a man who had come up from London to catch the end of the innings was able to use the newly finished HS2. Among all their other achievements India’s batsmen even silenced the Barmy Army, so that by the very end the volume in the Hollies Stand was reduced to the sort of somnolent hum usually heard at Lord’s.England’s bowlers visibly aged too as the innings went on. Brydon Carse seemed to only have one working leg by the time it was over, Chris Woakes, who bowled only seven overs on day two, all of them first thing in the morning, had apparently slipped quietly into retirement while no one was looking, and even Ben Stokes gave up flagellating himself. Among the quicks only Josh Tongue was still going, rolling in from the pavilion end like some decrepit trebuchet being wheeled up to hurl boulders at the walls of Harlech castle in the seventh year of the siege.England in Deep trouble on day two after Shubman Gill’s 269 piles on the painRead moreAt the other end, Shoaib Bashir bowled more overs in this one innings than he has done in all his last 12 months for Somerset.Time was when a lot of Test cricket was played at this sort of tempo, but it’s been a while since we’ve a seen a game like it in England and, unless you’ve had the misfortune to be following the last couple of rounds of the County Championship, it takes some readjusting to get used to the slower rhythm.Before this series, we hadn’t even had a five-day game since the Ashes back in 2023. India’s was the longest team innings anyone has played against England in this country since Stokes took over as captain. You have to go all the way back to 2014, and the first Test against a very different iteration of the India team, to find one that went on longer.It’s been coming.England’s attack looked pretty thinfor stretches ofboth the Teststhey have already played this season. And in these conditions it was left absolutely threadbare. They are partly to blame themselves. They had boundary ropes brought in tight, and Stokes said before the game that England have asked the groundstaff to produce these pitches for them, although he must have hoped for one with a bit more “bounce and carry”, as he put it, than an abandoned mattress that’s been left on the corner in the rain then peed on by the neighbourhood strays.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse was not the only bowler to struggle against India’s long game.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAEdgbaston’s head groundsman, Gary Barwell, posted an insistent message on X before the match talking about how few draws there have been here recently, which made him sound like John Cleese’s pet-shop keeper in the dead parrot sketch.In the past, Stokes has been able to find a way to conjure the wickets regardless. He tried here, there were umbrella fields, with five men arrayed in a rainbow behind the wicket, and wall fields, with five in a line from mid-off to mid-on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the pitch was unforgiving, and India’s batsmen so pitilessly committed to their strategy that even the No 9, Akash Deep, who came in when the score was 574, got a quick lecture from his captain on batting responsibly after he had played and missed at a delivery.There is an undeniable logic to it (despite, ahem, the impression eager Guardian readers have got from Thursday’s edition). Stokes’s England like to play the game at such a lick that they give the opposition a lot of time to work with, and India have decided to use it to try to bat them out of the match.The question for them is whether they have enough bowling to take 20 wickets on this pitch themselves given the way they had sandbagged their middle order with all-rounders. The key confrontation in the game may yet turn out to be between England and their own public insistence that they would rather lose a game by trying to win it than play for a draw.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

With their European Championship Group D opener against France approaching on Saturday evening why shouldn’t the Lionesses head coach be calm? Wiegman has, after all, reached four major tournament finals in a row.However, she does acknowledge she has changed since taking over England four years ago, and there are far fewer rules in camp almost three years after she guided the Lionesses to theirfirst major trophy at Euro 2022: “My values won’t change but I have to adapt to new situations and figure out: ‘OK, what’s best for the team now?’Jorge Vilda, pay disputes and incredible talent on show – Wafcon 2024 about to start a year lateRead more“When I came in [2021], everyone was wearing jewellery and watches and I said: ‘No, we can’t wear jewellery. We measure everything and I want you to take off your earrings and things like that,’ so they did. [But] I actually hate rules. We are here to perform and be at our best, and if you use your common sense then you make the right decisions. We want to set standards, but I think coaching is also about giving players responsibility – help players make their own decisions.”For that reason, she does not enforce a seating plan for mealtimes, nor ask her players to rotate who they spend time with: “I don’t do that. When I was a school teacher I would do those things, but now it’s so intense, the players travel so much, playing at the highest level, they need to find some space away where they can just sit with who they want to. That headspace and relaxation, that’s good for the team.”Wiegman also allows her players to have free choice in their use of social media, though many avoid it amida rise in online abuse.“Yes, there is a concern,” Wiegman says. “Of course players, especially this generation, want to share what they’re doing, but you can’t control how the outside world responds. [The FA communication officers] have really been supportive to the team and the individuals about that. With the team we make principles of how to use social media [but] I would never say: ‘You’re not allowed to use social media’, because that’s not how I work.“I stay, a lot, out of the media and the socials. So I don’t [read] everything that comes. Everyone will have a different opinion and that’s OK too. I know what we’re working on. I know what the team is about. I work with them every single day, so I know what’s really going on in our bubble.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman believes in giving her players responsibility to make their own decisions.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAA constant of Wiegman’s tenure has been to maintain her players’ privacy within the camp. That was never more apparent than earlier this summer with Mary Earps’ and Fran Kirby’ssudden international retirementsand Millie Bright’s withdrawal from Euros contention. Wiegman declined to share details of their private conversations. During that camp, the manager’s approach to her players was described as direct, even blunt at times, but she says: “What I try to do is give them as much information as possible.“The players call that direct, but do not confuse that with being blunt. I am not blunt – well, I hope not. I am trying to be honest and clear about things to give them context. I am actually very caring and that’s often not very helpful in this job. I want to take care of people but I have a job where I have to make hard decisions.“I think I learned a little bit here with England, too. Sometimes in England we can be a little bit [Wiegman gestures to illustrate skirting around a difficult subject]. Yes, you do! So sometimes I’m like: ‘OK, is this really the message?

But that’s not typical English, is it? But I really like it. It’s in the English culture.“I really like the culture [in England]. It’s such a massive sport culture in England. And in the Netherlands, it’s also a sport culture, but here, at every corner, the whole day on TV, for example, there’s sports, either football or rugby or cricket. And if that’s not there, then there’s something else, but there’s always sports and football is so in society.”The feeling from her bosses in England is clearly mutual, with the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, saying only last week thathe could see “no scenario”where he would not want Wiegman to stay in charge, regardless of how the Lionesses perform at this tournament. She is under contract until 2027’s World Cup. Would she like to stay even longer?“I’m now really focusing on this tournament,” she replies. “I don’t want to look any further [than her contract length]. You never know what happens in life. Things can change quickly and in your personal life, too. So I just feel that I just love to work with this team. I love to work in England with the FA and I hope that stays for a little bit longer.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She tuned up on an exercise bike during the first part of Tuesday’s warm-up before later working with the ball.If the sighs of relief were audible from Madrid, Barcelona and beyond, the Spanish football federation’s accompanying statement resembled a giant exhalation of its own. “With Aitana back, the entire group is now at their base camp in Lausanne, ready to take on the European dream,” it said.Aitana Bonmatí: ‘No one has given me anything to be where I am’Read moreBonmatí’sbout of viral meningitishad been the worst possible pre-tournament news, primarily because of the ramifications for the two-time Ballon d’Or winner’s health. It is impossible to know how her fitness may be affected, but what a boost it would be if an expectant crowd in Bern are treated to even the briefest of cameos on Thursday.Spain will seek to make an early statement against Portugal at a European Championship where the sense of opportunity is tantalising. If theymeet expectations, they will surely rubber-stamp their status as the greatest international team of the modern era.This is not the same squad thatswept all before them in Australia and New Zealand. Twelve World Cup winners will not be present for various reasons and there was tension in the air last month when Jenni Hermoso, Spain’s record goalscorer, blasted the head coach, Montse Tomé, on social media after being omittedHermoso, dragged so appallingly intothe Luis Rubiales scandaltwo years ago, referenced removing “environments with such a bad energy from my life”. Tomé had explained that her conscience was clear after leaving the 35-year-old out.Should Spain go all the way, such disputes will matter little. They would love to claim their first continental title without the kind of cloud that engulfed them in Sydney. A huge chunk of joy was taken away from them. It does no harm they have been dealt the kindest possible landing in Group B, particularly when Bonmatí will clearly require easing in. Portugal, Belgium and Italy will not offer much of a challenge for first place; their biggest difficulty may be ensuring that cruising through those assignments does not leave them undercooked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hope for neutrals will be that their opponents rise to the stage, perhaps with help from a swathe of the 255,000 Portuguese nationals who live in Switzerland. Spain will have to switch on to ensure they are not caught cold in the quarter-finals, where they are likely to face the hosts or an improving Norway.That is one reason the captain, Irene Paredes, who will be suspended from the Portugal game after a red card in the qualifier against Czech Republic last July, preached caution when assessing their prospects this week. Maybe it helps that Spain, for all the galaxy of talent at their disposal, are no strangers to disappointment. They finished outside the medals at Paris 2024, losing to Germany in the tussle for bronze. Tomé came under fire but it felt, at times, as if the emotional weight of the previous 12 months had contributed to their mini-slump.Paredes referred to the intense frustration of missing out last summer, a fate confirmed when Alexia Putellas failed to convert a late penalty against Germany. At leastPutellas, back from her most recent injury hell, will grace the Swiss stage. Perhaps the reminder that other contenders pack a punch will keep the favourites keen in a schedule that may not overexert them until the last four. Maybe the fact 10 of their squad were badly bruised byBarcelona’s Champions League final defeat by Arsenalwill add a further sense of scores to settle.Aitana BonmatíSpain were given a useful test by Japan in Leganés before leaving home. A 3-1 win offered plenty of encouragement while leaving space to correct errors; it also highlighted once again the gifts of Clàudia Pina,their match-winner against Englandlast month and a lethal operator in the box. “When you see her with the ball you sense danger,” Tomé said. The problem for Spain’s opponents is that Pina is hardly alone in delivering that.Should Bonmatí hit her stride quickly then that threat will increase. “She’s so eager – we have to hold her back a bit – but according to the medical staff, her progress is positive,” Tomé said. “Health comes first and she’s been able to complete all the tasks required.”If Spain can set down a marker they will be a step closer to realising all those confident predictions of their supremacy and, perhaps, affording themselves the unfettered celebrations they were denied two years ago. The dream is within touching distance for Tomé and a team with few parallels.Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Verstappen, in turn, flatly refused to comment on the matter.Max Verstappen reportedly in advanced talks with Mercedes over blockbuster moveRead moreThe speculation came on a day when there was more flux at the top of the sport as a challenge emerged to the authority of the president of the FIA, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, with the news that the former FIA steward Tim Mayer will stand against the president in elections later this year.On Wednesday, there were unconfirmed reports that Verstappen’s talks with Mercedes have intensified and that a deal was close to being confirmed. However, it is understood this remains entirely speculation and that Mercedes are still conducting consideration of advances made toward them from the Verstappen camp.Russell was considered more likely to lose his seat than his teammate Kimi Antonelli were a deal to be done with Verstappen, but at Silverstone the Briton was bullish about his position. “I’ve been focused on my side, I am loyal to Mercedes, so at the end of the day, everything will work itself out,” he said. “And the likelihood I’m not at Mercedes next year, I think is exceptionally low.“For me it’s nothing to worry about as I don’t think I’ll be going anywhere and whoever my teammate is doesn’t concern me either, so I’ll just focus on the driving. There’s a lot of conversations behind the scenes that are not public and I know where their [Mercedes’s] loyalty lies. I’m performing better than ever, it’s as simple as that, performance speaks for everything.”Mercedes are unlikely to announce any decision until the summer break after the Hungarian Grand Prix on 3 August, which is the point when potential exit clauses in Verstappen’s contract would become applicable. The Dutchman did not deny the talks were taking place but declined to make any further comment.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen has been heavily linked with a move to Mercedes.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesIt also became clear on Thursday at Silverstone that Mayer will announce his candidacy to oppose Ben Sulayem for the FIA presidency on Friday morning in a press conference. The 59-year-old American was a long-serving FIA steward, well-liked and respecteduntil he was sackedlast November after a dispute between the governing body and the organisers of the US Grand Prix, for whom Mayer was working in an independent capacity.Mayer claimed the dismissal had taken place because Ben Sulayem personally took umbrage at him and he was highly critical of how it had been handled. “In spite of the matter being resolved quietly and amicably, he’s still upset and decided to fire me,” he said. “After 15 years of volunteering my time as a steward, a decade teaching other stewards and hundreds of hours volunteering in other roles, I got a text from one of his assistants.” The FIA denied he had been told by text message.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farrell also said he had had no hesitation in picking the former England captain despite the fact he has not played Test rugby for 20 months and struggled for form and fitness this year.Farrell Jr is due to fly in to join the squad on Friday as a replacement for the luckless Elliot Daly who broke a forearm in the52-12 win against the Queensland Reds. It is a big call for a number of reasons but Farrell Sr insists it is the right one for the squad as they build towards their best-of-three Test series against the Wallabies kicking off in just over a fortnight.Daly injury blow takes shine off dominant Lions display against Queensland RedsRead moreFarrell Jr has not played any rugby at all in the last two months and is not a like-for-like positional swap for Daly but his father is focused on the impact he could have on a squad that is not overflowing with Lions experience. With his 112 caps for England and six Lions Test appearances, there is certainly no questioning Farrell’s big game mindset as he flies in for his fourth Lions tour.In January last year, Farrell announced he wasstepping away from Test rugbyto “prioritise his and his family’s mental wellbeing” but his father suggested when the squad was announced that the door could yet reopen. Sure enough, the Lions’ prodigal son is now en route, his dad having lobbed a large rock into a previously tranquil touring pool.Listening to Farrell Sr, it sounded very much as if that was his deliberate intention. Far from worrying about accusations of nepotism or whether the decision implied a lack of faith in his younger English 10s, Marcus Smith and Fin Smith, the management seem more concerned with upping the ante before a potentially intense series.“We have said from minute one that the only thing we want is competition,” said Farrell Sr, stressing that Owen could yet make the Test squad. “If he didn’t have a chance then what is the point? Everybody should be competing, that is what everyone in the group would want.”Farrell Sr also cited “the experience he brings, the support that you need for the group and how you make the room feel” among the reasons why Farrell has leapfrogged ahead of other contenders including Scotland’s Tom Jordan, Ireland’s Jamie Osborne and England’s George Ford. “He’s the right man at this moment in time for us. We see him adding to the group and injecting a bit of life and experience as far as what he can bring to the squad.”View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell will provide valuable experience in the British & Irish Lions squad.Photograph: Themba Hadebe/APIn addition, Farrell Jr, who will turn 34 in September, is the sole player on tour who has tasted a previous Lions series victory. He is also a longtime Saracens colleague of the Lions captain, Maro Itoje, and the assistant coach, Richard Wigglesworth, and his father stressed the whole management team had been consulted. “There are other coaches in that conversation; it’s not just on me. Obviously I make the final call and I’m happy to do that, but these conversations have been going on in the background the whole time about all sorts of players and that’s the call we came to.”Quick GuideLions team to face NSW WaratahsShowNSW Waratahs v British & Irish Lions, Allianz Stadium, Saturday 5 July, 8pm AEST/11am BSTLionsHugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Blair Kinghorn; Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell; Pierre Schoeman, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Finlay Bealham, Tadhg Beirne (capt), James Ryan, Henry Pollock, Josh van der Flier, Ben Earl.ReplacementsDan Sheehan, Ellis Genge, Tadhg Furlong, Joe McCarthy, Scott Cummings, Jac Morgan, Ben White, Marcus Smith.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Not since Colin Cowdrey was summoned from the depths of an English winter in 1974-75 to take on Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in an Ashes series, at the age of 41, has a tour replacement arrived with more fanfare and less recent match practice. The jury of social media will also be keen to see if Farrell is picked for the bench against the ACT Brumbies on Wednesday – his father predicted he would feature “soon enough” – almost two years on from the persistent online abuse that contributed to him stepping away from the international game.“Look, I hope people can get past that,” said Farrell Sr. “There has been a lot of that nonsense for some time. That was in the past. We all just need to move on and embrace what the Lions is all about and what we have got coming ahead.”In the short term, the priority is now this weekend’s looming game against the Waratahs. Tadhg Beirne will captain the Lions for the first time with Hugo Keenan and Blair Kinghorn finally making their belated debuts. There is also a 6-2 forward bench split with Ben Earl covering the centre positions should injury strike Huw Jones or Sione Tuipulotu.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsOwen FarrellLions tour 2025Andy FarrellAustralia sportRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

On the flat stages, VDP uses his explosive power and superlative bike handling to lead out Philipsen, who has won nine stages in the last three Tours and the green jersey in 2023.

On the hilly days look out for Edward Theuns and Mattias Skjelmose, whosnaffled the Amstel Gold Classicfrom under the nose of Tadej Pogacar in April.

They landed the Vuelta last year with Primoz Roglic but the Slovene is more than usually accident prone – he quit the Tour last year and the Giro this year after heavy crashes – so fingers will be crossed every time there’s a pile-up of any dimension. If Roglic can stay upright, the podium is a fair target, as he is a doughty all-rounder when he’s in one piece, and his mountain support men, Florian Lipowitz and Aleksandr Vlasov, were bubbling under nicely in the buildup to the Tour.Team:Roglic, Vlasov, Lipowitz, Danny van Poppel, Laurence Pithie, Mick van Dijke, Gianni Moscon, Jordi Meeus.Main man:Primoz Roglic. The Slovene has five Grand Tour wins and two weaknesses – his age and his capacity for falling off when he really shouldn’t.Soudal-Quick-StepIn early June, the Belgian squad nudged past 1,000 wins since their foundation; they will add to that in the next few weeks, targeting sprint stages with the European champion, Tim Merlier, and the overall classification with the double Olympic champion, Remco Evenepoel, who will have the stage five time trial in his sights after winning the Critérium du Dauphinécontre la montreahead of Tadej Pogacar. Win that and the foundations are there for a repeat of last year’s third place overall. One question: do they target green with Merlier or yellow with Evenepoel? It’s the kind of dilemma most managers would give their eye teeth for.Team:Evenepoel, Merlier, Bert Van Lerberghe, Mattia Cattaneo, Ilan Van Wilder, Pascal Eenkhoorn, Valentin Paret-Peintre, Maximilian Schachmann.Main man:Remco Evenepoel. The Belgian prodigy is the best time-triallist in the race but he needs to gain a few per cent in the mountains to stay with Tadej Pogacar andJonas Vingegaard.Total EnergiesPerennial underdog French squad who hit the jackpot last year with astage win for Anthony Turgis; they will be a daily presence in doomed escapes to garner television time. Their main sponsor will also appear on the Ineos Grenadiers jersey, but rumours of a merger are reportedly unfounded.Team:Turgis, Mathieu Burgaudeau, Steff Cras, Alexandre Delettre, Thomas Gachignard, Emilien Jeannière, Jordan Jegat, Mattéo Vercher.Main man:Anthony Turgis.

Another stage win would be career-defining.View image in fullscreenAnthony Turgis reacts after his epic win on stage nine of the 2024 Tour.Photograph: Getty ImagesTudor Pro CyclingFounded by Fabian Cancellara, this Swiss division two squad looks promising for their first Tour. Michael Storer is the climber, Alberto Dainese the sprinter, Marc Hirschi the man for the lumpy stages, while Julian Alaphilippe just has to be his sparkling self. You wouldn’t bet against a stage win for this group.Team:Alaphilippe, Dainese, Hirschi, Storer, Marco Haller, Matteo Trentin, Fabian Lienhard, Marius Mayrhofer.Main man:Julian Alaphilippe. His years of plenty are over but the double world champion needs only a hint of success to get the home press purring.UAE Team EmiratesYou can argue the relative merits of Tadej Pogacar’s UAE posse or Jonas Vingegaard’s Visma all you will, but it’s academic. If Pogacar is on song, UAE are the strongest, without a weak link in their Tour team, perfectly drilled and improving each year as their leader matures. It’s when things go wrong for the Slovene, or he’s absent, that it gets interesting. At the Giro a few weeks ago, UAE were shapeless and unable to win the race for their Mexican Isaac del Toro; at the 2022 and 2023 Tours, they were unable to control Visma. João Almeida, the Tour of Switzerland winner, is a possible plan B.Team:Pogacar, Almeida, Adam Yates, Pavel Sivakov, Marc Soler, Tim Wellens, Jhonatan Narváez, Nils Politt.Main man:Tadej Pogacar. En route to a record to match Eddy Merckx, “Pogi” is the perfect all-rounder. But even big Ted had off days; that’s all his rivals can hope for.Uno-X MobilityNow in their third Tour, the Norwegians are canny operators, targeting what they can when the big men aren’t playing. For example, they put Jonas Abrahamsen in the mountains jersey for 12 stages last year. No place for the veteran Alexander Kristoff but every chance of a stage win from this talented, aggressive squad.Team:Abrahamsen, Magnus Cort, Søren Waerenskjold, Andreas Leknessund, Tobias Halland Johannessen, Anders Halland Johannessen, Markus Hoelgaard, Stian Fredheim.Main man:With nine stage wins across the Grand Tours, the mustachioed Magnus Cort is a threat every time he gets in a break.Visma-Lease a BikeAlongside UAE Emirates, Visma is the race’s other mighty Armada – winners of all three Grand Tours in 2023. They field the most valuable teammate in cycling, Wout van Aert, alongside therecent Giro champion, Simon Yates, plus the2023 Vuelta winner, Sepp Kuss: either of these or even the US’s Matteo Jorgenson can take on the role of leader if Jonas Vingegaard crumbles or falls. A well-drilled team was key when Yates snatched this year’s Giro, and helped Vingegaard break Pogacar in 2022 and 2023; Visma need to be perfect to crack the Slovene and his team this year.Team:Vingegaard, Van Aert, Jorgenson, Kuss, Simon Yates, Victor Campenaerts, Tiesj Benoot, Edoardo Affini.Main man:Jonas Vingegaard. The Danish double Tour winner is the only rider who can match Pogacar, but he was slightly off the pace at the recent Critérium du Dauphiné.XDS AstanaA monstrously strong spring has lifted Kazakhstan’s finest out of the World Tour relegation zone – 21 wins for 10 different riders is spectacular – but this lineup, without any of their big winners from earlier this season, suggests that they threw everything at the Giro d’Italia, a more fertile source of ranking points. They will get in the breaks on the hilly and mountain days, but other teams will be better organised and more desperate.Team:Harold Tejada, Sergio Higuita, Simone Velasco, Clément Champoussin, Mike Teunissen, Evgeny Fedorov, Davide Ballerini, Cees Bol.Main man:No clear leader. Evgeny Fedorov has won twice recently, but the Kazakh road and time trial titles aren’t the best pointer to Tour form.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingTadej PogačarJonas VingegaardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the organisation grew, his followers discovered a darker realityBySam EdwardsThu 3 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 05.12 EDTShareThe first time Dalia* took ayahuasca nothing happened. The second time it changed her life. It was 2017, and she had joined a dozen strangers in a chalet outside Barcelona. Everyone was searching for something. For many it was a way out of misery: an escape from years of addiction, or a last-ditch attempt to survive crippling depression. Dalia, a therapist in her early 30s, hoped ayahuasca would help her process the recent death of her mother. “I felt completely alone at that time,” she said. “And I think in some form that’s how everyone there felt.”The retreat, run by a wellness company called Inner Mastery, began with the two dozen participants talking about their expectations, before imbibing ayahuasca. The Amazonian plant brew, which contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful naturally occurring psychoactive, induces an altered sense of self and reality. Users often report revisiting past trauma or repressed experiences.Within an hour of her first dose, Dalia began to yawn uncontrollably, then she felt cries escaping from her mouth. She vomited, and then the trip began. In what she would subsequently learn was a common experience, she felt as if a part of her was dying. She had several visions, but one, towards the end of her trip, conjured the anxiety around money that had haunted her for years. Money was just an illusion, she realised. She felt soothed.The next week, Dalia decided she wanted to train with Inner Mastery to help others have the same healing experience. The company offered training programmes for those who wanted to work with ayahuasca, but they cost thousands of euros. “There was an energy that I connected to, and it told me to go ahead and pay the money,” Dalia said.Inner Mastery was a large organisation, with centres in 14 countries and regular events in many more. Retreats took place over weekends in centres acrossEuropeand the Americas. More than 100 regular participants decided they not only wanted to take ayahuasca but train to administer it, and began building their lives around the company. “It felt like joining a family,” Dalia said. She wasn’t the only one driven by a sense of being part of a movement. Other members reported finding a community of like-minded people: spiritual seekers looking for meaning. “Most people there were black sheep,” said Adrián*, another longstanding participant. “Those on the outside who didn’t question anything were like NPCs [non-player characters, the mindless figures in video games who can’t think for themselves]. Everyone on the inside wanted to heal the world in some way.”The head of Inner Mastery was Alberto Varela, an Argentine entrepreneur, who founded the company in 2013. Often dressed in white, with a nest of grey curls behind his domed head, Varela would speak for hours from a throne-like chair, his voice slowly rising and falling. He described Inner Mastery as thefirst ayahuasca multinational. Having experienced an ayahuasca ceremony in Colombia, he came up with a formula more suited to a western market, stripping the ceremony of its religious connotations and rebranding it in the new age language of self-realisation. The only way to survive in a sick world, he said, was to turn inwards and heal yourself. Gone was the collective tradition, wherein members of a community would drink ayahuasca together; in its place came gatherings of strangers, all drawn in by the belief that ayahuasca could help them gain insight into their individual lives.At its peak in the late 2010s, Inner Mastery claimed to have more than 130 staffrunning 1,000 retreatsfor 30,000 customers each year. It had a training academy, a media department, a travel agency, a dedicated streaming service and later its own cryptocurrency. Its retreat centres, about 20 sprawling villas rented or owned by Varela’s network of companies, eventually became communes where dozens of Inner Mastery employees-cum-followers could live – for a fee.Like all new recruits, Dalia helped cook meals for retreats or cleaned for little or no pay. “It was normal to work from the morning until 4am or 5am the next day, when the ayahuasca sessions usually finished. It was relentless. We barely slept,” she said. But she was buoyed up by their sense of mission. “We were building something incredible.”The popularity of the retreats and their link to mind-altering substances inevitably attracted speculation. Some people called it a cult. “It was something we used to laugh about,” Dalia said. “The word cult was just a way to discredit anyone taking a different path or trying to change the world. Once you see it like that, many people, myself included, end up thinking: ‘So what if it’s a cult? I don’t care. It’s doing me good.’”But over time, Varela began to draw criticism for the way he ran the business. His staff were underpaid and overworked, his manner overbearing. He built a hierarchical organisation that made him rich, while many of his employees went into debt with the company. He promoted ayahuasca as a panacea for all suffering, and despite having no training, practised a confrontational and sometimes cruel form of therapy on vulnerable people with serious trauma.Traditional practitioners and healers protested he was bringing their practice into disrepute. Ayahuasca was not something you could roll out on an industrial scale with minimal oversight, they said. Accidents would happen.Before spirituality, Alberto Varela’s passion was business. Born to middle-class parents in Santa Fe, Argentina, in 1960, he believed himself to be exceptional from a young age. As a teenager he eschewed drugs and alcohol. His only vice was work, he claimed. At 17, he started a clothing company. By the time he was 30, he was married with three children, but after his wife left him, he realised he needed to make a change. He signed up for sessions with Osvaldo Gordín, a life coach and marketing expert. The two men became followers of Osho, the leader of the Rajneesh movement, who was known for rejecting asceticism in favour of material abundance and accumulating a fleet of 93 Rolls-Royces.Together, Varela and Gordín started a marketing consultancy. It was the early 90s, and Argentinian society was flirting with a new culture of success that valued wealth and conspicuous consumption. Varela excelled in this world. “It’s incredible,” he later wrote. “People pay to be told lies, and they are happy to believe them. How easy it is to control, dominate, lead and manipulate a man!”By 1999, Varela had followed his ex-wife to Spain, where she had moved with their three children.He took ayahuasca, or yage as it is also known, for the first time a year or so later when visiting the mountains outside Bogotá, Colombia. He claimed the Indigenous shaman, or “taita”, saw special qualities in him. When he returned to Madrid, he launched an alternative medicine centre, positioning himself as a western conduit to Indigenous ayahuasca rituals.Varela had spotted a lucrative opportunity. Meaning “vine of the dead” in Quechua, ayahuasca has been used by Amazonian Indigenous groups for centuries. In shamanic cures and initiation rituals, for which the guides undergo long apprenticeships, the plant brew is believed to aid communication with ancestors, spirits and gods. Interest in ayahuasca began to grow in the west during the late 20th century, fuelled by disenchantment with conventional mental health treatments, and a growing western appetite for altered states and new spiritual experiences.By the mid-2000s, Varela was starting to offer ayahuasca ceremonies alongside reiki and meditation at his Madrid centre. Soon he was expanding to other parts ofSpain. Those who met him around this time were struck by his drive. “He was intelligent, observant and very hard-working,” said Hugo Oklander, a fellow Argentine and early collaborator. But Oklander could see his ambition had no limit. “I don’t think it was possible for him to ever be satisfied.”View image in fullscreenAlberto Varela of Inner Mastery during an ayahuasca ceremony.Photograph: Crónica/El MundoAyahuasca had been used under the radar in therapeutic settings since the 1980s. “The police didn’t even know what it was. You could bring it into the country without any issue,” said Manuel Villaescusa, a psychologist who has worked with ayahuasca for two decades. But Varela wanted to reach a much larger market. He bought full page ads in alternative health magazines, promoting ayahuasca as a cure for a range of ailments, according to Villaescusa. The attention brought customers, but also scrutiny. One local news crew ran a story based on claims Varela was leading a cult.In December 2008, Spanish police raided a villa in an upmarket suburb of Madrid, interrupting 21 people, three of them children, whowere reportedly watchinga porn film while they waited to take ayahuasca. Forty kilos of the plant were seized, and Varela, who was identified as the leader, was arrested on charges of crimes against public health. “It was a bombshell,” Villaescusa said. “Ayahuasca had been tolerated for 20 years and then suddenly not only are the police raiding a ceremony but the story appears in every newspaper in the country, and the first contact the Spanish public has with ayahuasca is associating it with some kind of [alleged] sex cult.”Varela went to prison for 14 months. By the time he came out, he was determined to expand his plans for an ayahuasca business. “Like criminals who prepare bank robberies while they’re locked up, I planned my own heist,” he later said. “When I got out, I would multiply by 1,000 the energy I put into this before I went to jail.” Varela’s release from prison coincided with the financial crisis in Spain and a surge in anger at politicians. He capitalised on his newfound fame and styled himself as a guru persecuted by repressive authorities. He published a memoir, then a free magazine, which he distributed in Madrid’s vegetarian restaurants and yoga studios. Its content was a mix of new age therapies and self-promotion. Most of its early covers featured Varela’s adult children and their modelling careers or world travels.In 2011, the year after his release from prison, Varela spent several weeks at a commune called Budas Factory near Seville, run by a self-declared guru called Fulvio Carbone. The commune hosted a series of in-person courses promising enlightenment,reportedly costing upwards of €1,500. Varela was accustomed to casting himself as a leader, but at Budas Factory, “the ‘Master’ had met someone from whom he could learn”,wrote Rafael Palacios, a mutual acquaintance of the two.That same year, a Spanish nonprofit dedicated to exposing cultsclaimed Budas Factoryused fasting and aggressive group therapy sessions to make participants more susceptible to manipulation. Carbone disbanded his organisationafter being caughton a hidden camera claiming an aloe vera cream marketed by his organisation could cure cancer. By the time the commune closed, Varela was working on his own plans.After the bad publicity that came with Varela’s arrest, once he was released from prison, Spain’s small community of ayahuasca practitioners tried to reason with him. “We tried to persuade him to stop using aggressive marketing and adopt a more ethical approach to participants,” Villaescusa said. But Varela declined. “He was convinced that he had been chosen to bring ayahuasca to the world, and that we were cowards for not working in the open.”In 2013, Varela bought a popular Facebook group for ayahuasca users for US$4,000 and started advertising himself as the “first westerner granted authorisation to use ayahuasca” by Indigenous experts in Colombia. Within months he had hundreds of thousands of followers around the world, centred on his Facebook community, which he called Ayahuasca International. For anyone in Europe searching online for more information about the Indigenous brew, Varela’s organisation was usually the first they would see.At this point, there was no company yet, just an idea. Varela went on a whirlwind promotional offensive, organising conferences and workshops on ayahuasca and personal development across Europe and Latin America. By his side was his compatriot Oklander, who had spent several decades in Asia exploring meditation, body work and other therapies only to conclude that few could really help people. He hoped ayahuasca would be different. While Varela managed the Spanish-speaking world, Oklander oversaw international expansion, flying to different cities every weekend to promote the newly launched company.Perhaps Varela’s most lucrative innovation came in late 2013 with the School of Ayahuasca, a training academy for those who wanted to administer the brew themselves. These “facilitators” were a low-cost alternative to traditional shamans. Training cost €150 a day, and often added up to several thousand euros before new recruits could begin to work for the company. Trainees earned a commission by finding new customers. One former member compared it to working for a telemarketing firm. “The aim was to sell, sell, sell,” he said. In practice, it functioned like a multilevel marketing scheme. “The School of Ayahuasca operated to indoctrinate people and entrap them. They went into debt with the company,” said Oklander, who after co-founding the company later turned whistleblower. “It was machiavellian.”Cristian Alcalá came into contact with Inner Mastery in 2015 when he picked up a friend from one of its retreats in Spain. “There was something different about her. She just seemed to sparkle,” Alcalá said. He was intrigued and decided to take up a role as a handyman in one Inner Mastery centre in Spain. Not long after he began, Varela offered to send him to train at the company’s base in the Colombian jungle, where it sourced the plant brew. Alcalá had no money to pay for his ticket, but Varela brushed this aside. “Don’t worry, I’ll pay for you, and when you come back, you’ll bring some ayahuasca with you,” he told him.Alcalá said yes immediately. “At 35 I had never even left the country and suddenly they were putting me on a plane to go to Colombia to take ayahuasca with local shamans,” he said. After two weeks in the jungle, he returned to Spain with 40 kilos of ayahuasca disguised as a product to treat wood. (Ayahuasca’s legal status varies between countries. DMT, the psychoactive alkaloid found in the plant, is included in the United Nations convention on psychotropic substances. But the ayahuasca brew itself is not under international control.) Soon Alcalá was leading ayahuasca ceremonies. He spent the next four years running retreat centres in Mexico and Italy. “They gave me the opportunity to see myself as something else,” he said.By 2016, the company had opened centres in Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Mexico and Uruguay. Employees ran retreats and sent profits back to Varela in Madrid. A single weekend retreat could make up to €40,000, Oklander said. The company also developed other revenue streams, like offering trips to Colombia, additional psychoactives or selling ayahuasca directly online to customers. Varela bought supplies cheaply, paid employees little, and usually in cash, and declared little or nothing to tax authorities, according to Oklander. “It was incredibly profitable,” he said. “Like drug smuggling lite.”Varela structured the organisation like a multinational conglomerate: services werecontracted to subsidiariesunder a holding company, limiting financial and legal liability. Nothing was in Varela’s name. “That was part of the strategy. The idea was you could never see the whole thing,” Oklander said.The bigger Inner Mastery got, the more criticism it drew for its high prices, understaffing and cost-cutting. At one overcrowded weekend retreat priced at about €450, instead of buckets, customers were given plastic bags to be sick into, one review complained, resulting in a room of people hallucinating around “puke landmines”.Some staff members began to fear it was putting participants in danger. Ayahuasca sessions entailed loss of control, physically and emotionally, and it could get frightening and messy. “In our team meetings there was a lot of emphasis on the wellbeing of the participants and the team, but in practice it became clear that the expansion of the company was above that,” Adrián said.In its rush to enter new markets, Inner Mastery held events wherever it could, packing tripping participants into yoga studios or hotel conference rooms under the supervision of inexperienced facilitators. At one such retreat in a dance studio on the outskirts of Cologne, around 2016, one man had an adverse reaction to the brew and started acting aggressively, pacing around the room in circles. Fearing he might hurt someone or himself, Adrián tried to calm him down. Eventually, the man went outside to sleep in his car. When Adrián went to check on him a few hours later, he was gone. “I was really worried he could be driving around Cologne in the midst of a psychotic episode,” Adrián said.At another retreat, a woman became paranoid after taking ayahuasca, fearing the organisers were planning to attack her while she was under the influence. “She just fled. She jumped over a wall of the house and ran off, without her shoes, her phone or anything,” Dalia said. Later that night police arrived at the retreat after the woman had turned up at the station, practically naked, claiming someone had tried to steal her organs.Within Inner Mastery, losing control was often interpreted as a necessary step in each person’s “process”. Soon after joining the organisation as a trainee, Dalia was encouraged to take yopo, a snuff and powerful hallucinogen, which the company was adding to its menu of psychoactives on offer at retreats. “We were encouraged to try it as trainees. Really, we were guinea pigs,” she said.Almost immediately after the snuff was blown up her nostril, Dalia felt as if she couldn’t breathe. She remembers screaming for help before blacking out. When she came round, someone told her she had stopped breathing, and a doctor employed by Inner Mastery had resuscitated her. The doctor told her it was a good thing. “You had an incredible process, the best of everyone,” he told her later. The next night, the same doctor pushed Dalia to take ayahuasca. “You were calling for your mother last night; you have to speak to her,” he told her. “Take a high dose. A really high dose.” She did as directed, and in the hours that followed Dalia lost all sense of herself.The next day, when she woke up, her clothes were soiled and her head bruised, apparently from falling. At first she felt ashamed, but like many in the organisation, Dalia learned to see her shame as a product of her own resistance to change. “No one said: ‘You were on the verge of dying.’ Quite the opposite, I was told I had the best trip of all and they congratulated me.”Varela frequently emphasised his connection to Colombia, where Inner Mastery owned a property and sourced its ayahuasca. With the profits he made, Varela said he was supporting the Indigenous community in Putumayo that he claimed had authorised him to work with the sacred plant medicine. But in 2015, representatives of the Cofán Indigenous community denounced him as an impostor. Varela had falsified his authorisation and used itto promote his business, they said, and they had seen none of the money he claimed to be collecting on their behalf. Anyone attending Inner Mastery retreats was putting their life and health in “serious risk”. (The complaint was echoed inan open lettersigned by 100 academics and anthropologists, who claimed Inner Mastery had taken advantage “of the ignorance, credulity, good faith and vulnerability of many people”.)Varela denied the accusation. He said the Cofán community had tried to blackmail him for a share in Inner Mastery’s profits, and after he refused, were taking revenge. His lawyerthreatened to sue themfor libel.

Before his first arrest in 2008, he had been accused of practising therapy without a licence, he told Dalia. “And so he called it ‘anti-therapy’ or ‘not therapy’ to avoid any issues,” she said. All work should be carried out in groups, Varela insisted, “because the ego can lie better in private”. He would use “chaos” and “confrontation” to “unmask the lies and beliefs we hold about ourselves”.In psychedelic-assisted therapy, “integrations”, or sessions held after taking hallucinogens, are a common practice to help participants understand their experiences. But Varela often seemed to use his “anti-therapy” to lead participants to his own predetermined conclusions. “He would push ideas and thoughts on to people,” Dalia said. A common theme was telling people to break up with their partner. “It was dressed up as a way to help people be free, but really it was quite twisted.”Through the training academy, new recruits would learn to replicate Varela’s method. The confrontational approach could be unsettling. Inone promotional videofrom 2016, a woman lies face up on a mattress. Around her is a circle of onlookers. Her limbs are pulled in different directions by the four people closest to her. She wails, her eyes closed, while they tell her: “You’re a bad sister.” “I hate you.” “You deserve to die.”In another, a young woman wearing only a bra sobs in a circle of sniggering onlookers, before storming out. In the next scene of the video, she is shown embracing Varela.Dalia had suffered physical abuse as a child, and so when Varela told her she needed to stop identifying with the pain of her inner child, it made sense. But his methods could be cruel. One day, when she started to cry, he mimicked her, wailing theatrically and repeating: “Look at her, the little hurt girl. Let’s all cry like her!” On his cue, others joined him, forming a circle around her, laughing while she sobbed.As the company grew, so did the number of accidents. On a rainy March day in 2019, a 31-year-old Hungarian man arrived at a hospital in the Dutch city of Eindhoven looking for help. It was early morning and he was displaying signs of confusion, the police report later noted, but he was not admitted. He left the hospital, only to reportedly return a second time before being sent home again. Hewas found deadat the bottom of an apartment building soon after.Police concluded the man had probably died by suicide. They found DMT in his bloodstream and learned he had just attended a retreat in a nearby town called Eersel in a property owned by Inner Mastery. A few weeks later, police raided the house and arrested several employees of the company. “We tried to stop him, because we don’t want people to leave in the middle of the night,” an Inner Mastery spokesperson told Dutch reporters after the case became public. There were risks involved in retreats, they added, but the organisation had followed its protocols to protect its customers.Varela’s only response to the deaths was to say that people who take ayahuasca do so at their own risk.Within Inner Mastery, responsibility for accidents was often placed on participants, said Dalia, who was working for the company in Spain when word spread that someone had died at a retreat. Another former Inner Mastery member was more blunt, telling me that those who had bad reactions were directly to blame: “They are not going to therapy, which they need. They are not ready to face what ayahuasca or other substances bring to their psychology after being consumed. So it may end up very badly for the person, including killing themselves or jumping from a window.”In October 2019, three Inner Mastery employees – the manager, master of ceremonies and the person who prepared the ayahuasca – as well as the company itself, were investigated for their role in the Hungarian client’s death. Eventually, the prosecutor’s office dropped manslaughter charges, but charged the three with drug offences for supplying ayahuasca. According to witness statements, which contradicted Inner Mastery’s initial statement, the Hungarian man had taken iboga, a powerful psychoactive whose effects can last up to 48 hours, then later ayahuasca.Inner Mastery had begun offering iboga alongside ayahuasca and other psychoactives a few months before the accident. Taking iboga and ayahuasca in the same retreat significantly increases the risk of an adverse reaction, said José Carlos Bouso, scientific director at The International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service (ICEERS), a nonprofit that supports psychedelic therapy.Separately, a second man died at another retreat in the Netherlands six months later, after combining the plant brew with other unnamed substances. At trial in 2022, two Inner Mastery workers were convicted for transporting, providing and processing ayahuasca and sentenced to 100 hours’ community service and a suspended two-week prison sentence.The case involving the death of the Hungarian man finally went to trial in January this year, where the court held one Inner Mastery employee responsible for possession and supply of ayahuasca and “ignoring the health risks of DMT”. A second employee and Inner Mastery itself will face the same charges at a trial set for September.Former members of Inner Mastery say the company initially gave participants forms to list any history of psychosis or other drug use that could conflict with ayahuasca. “But the main problem was people lied,” Oklander said. Facilitators often had little or no medical or psychological experience. Oklander said he was regularly called in to deal with difficult cases. One time he was woken in the middle of the night after a woman in apparent psychosis began scratching her arms, drawing blood. “I took her to a shower and got under the freezing cold water with her, and held her. That worked,” he said.At some point, staff began conducting brief interviews to screen participants, but a small minority of participants continued having psychotic episodes. “If you do it well, it’s very, very safe. But if it’s done wrong you multiply the risks of an accident,” said Villaescusa. Bouso agreed. “Ayahuasca on its own is quite safe, physically. What you have to be aware of are the psychological effects.” More than 800,000 people across the Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand took ayahuasca in 2019, according to Bouso’s organisation.In a report, it found that between 2010 and 2022, of the 58 deaths linked to ayahuasca, many involved other substances, pre-existing health conditions, or other circumstances.Within Inner Mastery, it was difficult to express reservations. Varela would make a person feel ashamed for asking questions, and “that was the end of the argument”, Oklander said. The two fell out, and Oklander brought a civil suit against Inner Mastery for unpaid wages in 2019, which he won. He also made a criminal complaint to police, saying he’d been an “unwitting participant” in tax fraud and crimes against public health. In his complaint, he included messages from senior company leadership to employees, which threatened to “immediately fire” anyone who didn’t send profits back to the company’s headquarters in Madrid.View image in fullscreenVarela with two unnamed people during an ayahuasca ritual.Photograph: Crónica/El MundoBy the early 2020s, negative attention was growing, and Varela started locking the gate to the company’s headquarters outside Madrid, where he lived. In the early days of the organisation, Varela had emphasised the anti-hierarchical ethos of the company. But over time, he seemed more and more focused on his own profile as a leader. “Little by little, he started wanting to be everyone’s master,” said Alcalá, the handyman turned retreat centre manager.Varela’s writings and hours of talks betray a dark obsession with weakness. He wrote constantly about “slavery”, “domination” and “control,” seeing society as divided between dominant and submissive people. In 2016, Varela published a blog post about the power imbalance between men and women. He described “feminine energy” as “a wave that emanates from a woman and heads toward a man, drowning him, rendering him useless, humiliating, breaking him, and stripping him of almost all power”.There have been several accusations of sexual abuse against members of Inner Mastery over the years. Last year, one woman told Spanish TV that she suffered abuse at a retreat. She alleges that when she was in a semi-conscious state, having allegedly been pressured into taking ayahuasca, several people touched her inappropriately. In a separate incident,the company saidit fired an employee after he sent explicit messages and photos to clients.Other accusations centred on Varela himself. One anonymous account – on a blog set up to collect testimonies of alleged victims of the organisation –accused Varelaand a collaborator of encouraging women to masturbate in front of them to overcome sexual repression.In March 2020, a few days after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, Varela appearedin a video, naked from the waist up in a dimly lit room, to chastise viewers for reacting with fear as the virus spread. After taking ayahuasca he had a vision, he explains: “I created the coronavirus.” Or rather, we all did, through our fear. The real risk is not physical, but spiritual, he said.For the company, the retreats were more important than ever. But when lockdowns made them impossible soon after, Varela turned to another idea. All staff were instructed to sell tickets to his online talks. Stuck at home, Dalia began cold-calling people, but struggled to make sales. She found little sympathy from her superiors in the company. “Whenever I brought it up, they would respond in the same way: ‘You’re not committing. You’re full of resistance. You’re sick.’”After three years of relentless work and spending about €10,000 on training courses, Dalia began to lose faith in the organisation. For one thing, she seemed stuck on an endless training cycle. “Later I realised it was because they knew I had money,” she said. “There was a clear interest in delaying my authorisation.” As Dalia’s suspicions about Inner Mastery grew, she came across ideas Varela had passed off as his own in the canon of other spiritual thinkers, from Krishnamurti to Eckhart Tolle. “You start looking into it and you realise he has taken a potpourri of things. Some of them may be quite powerful. But they are not his ideas.”As the pandemic wore on and profits took a nosedive, Varela announced that its employees had become spoiled. From now on, they would all be self-employed and pay their own social security contributions. Varela also encouraged his employees to move into the communes. Dalia considered leaving everything and joining the commune, but at the time she was looking after her elderly father. “They pressured me, saying that caring for him was a prison,” she said. Dalia no longer trusted Varela. “He said it was beneficial to your process to live in the centres, that it allowed you to devote yourself, but what it really allowed was him to charge each person €400 every month for a shared room.” Finally, she sent a message to a group chat saying she was leaving. She was told her back pay would be given in the company’s own tokens, which can only be spent on more Inner Mastery retreats.Adrián had experienced a similar moment of clarity when he finally had the opportunity to visit the company’s base in Colombia a few years earlier. Travelling to the jungle was a prize dangled in front of all employees, and the prospect of the trip had helped Adrián to ignore his increasing doubts over the company’s treatment of its staff. But when he arrived, he realised that the lush tropical jungle he had seen so many times in promotional videos was not as remote as it seemed on social media. A few metres away from where participants took ayahuasca, a busy highway abutted the property. For Adrián it was the final straw. This sleight of hand seemed to betray something fundamental about the organisation’s priorities. The company had once felt like a family to Adrián. Now, just like Dalia, he had come to think it was all about making money.As allegations against Inner Mastery became harder to ignore, police began investigating the company. Complaints against Varela had been growing for years. In 2021, a mother claimed he had brainwashed her daughter. “I know that he speaks in her ear while she is high and makes her do what he wants,”she told a TV crewafter neighbours protested outside the group’s headquarters.Varela’s business practices rebounded on other practitioners using hallucinogens. In 2022, Spanish police set up a taskforce to deal with cults and opened a hotline. After a tipoff, reportedly from a local evangelical pastor, dozens of officers stormed an isolated lodge in the mountains of northern Spain and searched for signs of “neoshamanic” cult activity. Feathers, drums and a bamboo pipe were displayed for the police camera andfour people were arrested. The next year, a judgedismissed the case, ordering that police return the seized ayahuasca to its owners. “If they had done this to Varela, who is exploiting people, I’d understand,” the group’s leadertold a Spanish newspaperafter his arrest. “But I’m just a medicine man who doesn’t care about money.”“[Inner Mastery] was a very organised operation, which stands in contrast to most other groups offering ayahuasca, which usually involve only four or five people and don’t operate outside their local areas,” said Marcos Quinteiros, a deputy inspector with the national police. “There are no precedents in Spain of an organisation like this.”In July 2023, police officers in riot gear carrying battering rams raided one of the Inner Mastery villas outside Madrid. Officers across the country simultaneously raided five other retreat centres, surprising some of their suspects as they performed ayahuasca ceremonies. Police arrested 18 people and confiscated €24,000 in cash, 1kg of mescaline and 60kg of the dark, viscous ayahuasca brew.Varela was one of those arrested. At the time, he had just been diagnosed with a brain tumour, and had been focusing his energy on making a series of documentaries that recounted his achievements and featured followers praising him effusively. He died in October 2023 as the investigation threatened to destroy the organisation he created. His 17 co-accused face charges including criminal conspiracy, crimes against public health and practising medicine without a licence. The case is still being investigated by courts ahead of trial. At the time of his death, Varela was also facing charges of sexual assault.Inner Mastery continues to advertise ayahuasca retreats across 13 countries in Europe, down from more than 40 at its peak. The company still promotes itself on social media, but its website now carries a disclaimer: “We are not a religion or a cult.” Varela is notably absent from the literature, and some retreats are advertised under alternative company names. Inner Mastery did not respond to requests for comment on its operations or to a detailed list of accusations against the company and Varela.Blow up: how half a tonne of cocaine transformed the life of an islandRead moreSlowly, over months and years, Dalia has rebuilt her life. She now sees that the more she gave to Inner Mastery, the more she lost touch with her life outside the organisation. “I’m shocked looking back at the level of self-deception,” Dalia said. “It was like a form of hypnosis where I convinced myself [Varela] knew what he was doing, and that we were part of something much bigger that was going to help awaken the world and bring about a real transformation.”One thing she does not regret, though, is using ayahuasca. She felt that its influence had helped her resolve personal difficulties that had remained after years of therapy. Dalia now works as a therapist herself, occasionally working with ayahuasca independently. Sometimes those who try it solely out of curiosity leave with little new insight, she said. But over the years, Dalia has come to believe it’s often most effective for people who are already in crisis. “I’ve seen the most radical transformations in those who are suffering most.”*Some names and identifying details have been changedListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readDrugs (Science)Drugs (Society)SpainDrugs tradeEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Written by his Republican allies in Congress and unanimously rejected by Democrats, the bill traveled an uncertain road to passage that saw multiple all-night votes in the House and Senate and negotiations that lasted until the final hours before passage. Ultimately, Republicans who had objected to its cost and contents folded, and the bill passed with just two GOP defections: Thomas Massie, a rightwing Kentucky lawmaker, and Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents a Pennsylvania district that voted for Kamala Harris in last year’s election.“We’ve waited long enough, some of us have literally been up for days now, but this day – this day – is a hugely important one in the history of our nation,” the Republican House speaker,Mike Johnson, said, just before voting began.“With one big, beautiful bill, we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before, and every American is going to benefit from that.”The legislation is expected to speed up and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcementdeportations, and will probably make Trump’s longstanding desire for a wall along the border with Mexico a reality.How Trump’s bill will supercharge mass deportations by funneling $170bn to IceRead moreIt also strikes a blow against the US government’s efforts to fight the climate crisis by phasing out tax incentives created under Joe Biden that were intended to spur investments in electric cars, wind and solar power and other green energy technologies.The bill’s centerpiece is a permanent extension of tax cuts made in 2017, during Trump’s first term, as well as the creation of new, temporary exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest that the president promised voters during last year’s campaign.The government will lose trillions of dollars in revenue from those provisions, and to offset their costs, Republicans approvedan array of cutsto Medicaid, the federal program providing health insurance coverage to poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).Those changes are expected to cost millions of people their benefits, but the bill remains expensive, with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) saying it willadd $3.3tnto the country’s debt through 2034.Massie explained his decision to vote against the bill in apost on X, writing that “it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates”.Fitzpatrick issued a statement saying “it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis” for his district and made him vote no.Democrats blasted the proposal as “one big, ugly bill” that dismantles anti-poverty programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Analyseshave shownthat high earners benefited most from Trump’s tax policies.The Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, made a last-ditch effort to halt the bill’s passage by delivering a floor speech that lasted eight hours and 44 minutes, the longest ever.“This is extraordinary. This assault on everyday Americans, assault on children, veterans, seniors, people with disabilities. It’s incredible to me, all of this in this one, big, ugly bill,” Jeffries said.“Ripping food out of the mouths of vulnerable Americans – that’s extraordinary that that’s what we’re doing, extraordinary. And all of this is being done, this unprecedented assault on everyday Americans, is being unleashed on the American people, Mr Speaker, on the most vulnerable among us, all of this is being done to provide massive tax breaks to billionaire donors. Shame on this institution. If this bill passes, that’s not America. We’re better than this.”Trump has described the bill as crucial to the success of his second term, and congressional Republicans made its passage their top priority. It was a tall task – the GOP won small majorities in both the House and Senate in last November’s election, and could afford no more than three defections in either chamber.The party’s lawmakers broadly support Trump but were divided on a host of other issues. There were lawmakers who wanted big spending cuts, rapid phase-outs of green energy incentives and an expanded deduction that would mostly benefit taxpayers in Democratic-led states. Their demands butted against others who sought to moderate the bill, but over the course of weeks, Republicans leaders managed to forge a compromise.Trump appears to have also offered some concessions to hard-line holdouts from the Republican House freedom caucus at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday and in subsequent discussions, as his advisers rushed to ensure the bill passed without returning to the Senate.The details of Trump’s concessions – possibly coming in the form of executive actions at a later date – were not immediately clear, and House freedom caucus chair Andy Harris declined to describe their discussions with Trump.“When we looked at this entire package, the significant agreements we got with the administration in the last 24 hours made this package a much, much better package,” Harris told reporters after the vote. “The agreement is with the president. If you want to know, ask the president.”The bill is only able to affect revenue, spending and the debt limit, under the rules of budget reconciliation that allowed the GOP to avoid a filibuster by Democrats in the Senate. Under Biden, Congress’s then Democratic majority had used the same procedure to pass legislation to spur the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and curb US carbon emissions.What’s in Trump’s major tax bill? Extended cuts, deportations and moreRead moreTrump’s bill allocates $45bn for Ice detention facilities, $14bn for deportation operations and billions of dollars more to hire 10,000 new agents by 2029. An additional $50bn will go towards the border wall and other fortifications.Enrollees of Medicaid and Snap will face new work requirements, and states will be forced to share part of the cost of the latter program for the first time ever. The CBO estimates the bill’s Medicaid changes could cost as many as 11.8 million peopletheir healthcare, and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecasts about 8 million people, or one in five recipients, maylose their Snap benefits.The legislation also forces changes to provider taxes, which states use to finance their share of Medicaid spending. That is expected to further increase the financial stress of hospitals in rural areas, and when the bill was in the Senate, a $50bn fund was added to support those facilities.Some in the GOP were openly nervous about the cuts to safety net programs that their constituents rely on. Thom Tillis, a senator who represents swing state North Carolina, refused to support the bill for those reasons, leading Trump to announce he would support a primary challenger when he stands for re-election next year. Tillis thenmade public his plans to retire, a potential boost for Democrats’ hopes of claiming his seat.“It is inescapable this bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made,” Tillissaid on the Senate floor.“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding’s not there any more, guys?”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsUS CongressDonald TrumpHouse of RepresentativesMike JohnsonUS SenateTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But disease has changed, and we must change with it.”The final focus, he said, would be on “a truly digital health service”, based on hi-tech diagnostic and treatment options, but also a gradually expanded NHS app, which Starmer said would be “like having a doctor in your pocket, providing you with 24-hour advice, seven days a week; an NHS that really is always there when you need it”.The plan says the NHS is “at an existential brink” after years of neglect by the Conservatives, and only Labour’s radical transformation will stop it losing support as a taxpayer-funded model of care.It says that Labour last year inherited an NHS where many people cannot get to see a GP or dentist, waiting lists have soared, staff are demoralised and outcomes from killer diseases such as cancer are worse than in other countries.“That is why the NHS now stands at an existential brink,” it says. With the ageing population creating more illness “without change, this will threaten yet worse access and outcomes – and even more will opt out and go private if they can afford to.“They will increasingly wonder why they pay so much tax for a service they do not use, eroding the principle of solidarity that has sustained the NHS. We will be condemned to a poor service for poor people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said: “The government is right about the serious problems it diagnoses in the NHS, and largely right in the vision it proposes to win back public faith. But we do not agree with the prophecy of extinction.”Although public satisfaction with theNHS had collapsed to just 21%, and patients were “dismayed” by the difficulty of accessing care, support for its founding principles – taxpayer-funded, available to all and free at the point of use – remained “high and resilient”, she added.The plan does not set out clearly how the proposed changes to the NHS’s ways of working will be implemented, Stein said. “This plan contains a litany of initiatives and the belief that they will be the NHS’s saviour, with little detail on how the ailing health service is to deliver these changes.”Speaking before Starmer, Streeting said urgent change was needed in part to see off voices calling for the current model of the NHS to be abandoned, seemingly an allusion to Reform UK, which has talked previously of a more insurance-based version.“There have always been those who whispered that the NHS is a burden, too expensive, inferior to the market, and today those voices grow louder, exploiting the crisis in our NHS in order to dismantle it,” he said.“We also know the consequences of failure. That’s why we can’t afford to fail. To succeed, we need to defeat the cynicism that says that nothing ever changes.”Reeves, making her first public appearance sinceshe was seen in tearsat prime minister’s questions in the Commons, which sparked questions about her future, spoke only briefly, saying that the government’s fiscal discipline had allowed it to give more resources to the NHS.Explore more on these topicsNHSKeir StarmerWes StreetingHealth policyHealthHospitalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I mean, here’s the burning question: what’sRightmovegoing to do?”Ofsted criticised over training manual linking autistic children to extremismRead moreRightmove and other property websites prominently display Ofsted’s headline ratings for nearby schools on their listing.After laughs from the audience, Oliver said: “It’s a serious point. Ofsted is probably one of the best-known regulators and inspectors in the world, let alone in this country.”Asked what impact the new report cards would have on house prices, Oliver said: “I don’t know but I do know that where I live … we’ve got two special measures schools right where I live, and the house prices shot up. They were both in special measures, both went outstanding, and the house prices went up £15,000 in a week. It does make a difference.“Parents obviously put a value on it.”Ofsted inspections and gradings were criticised after thesuicide of the headteacher Ruth Perry, after an Ofsted inspection downgraded her school from outstanding to inadequate. Perry’s husband told her inquest that she worried local house prices would fall as a result of the downgrade.Doing away with headline school grades and bringing in report cards was amanifesto pledge by Labourat the last general election.From November, schools and colleges inEnglandwill get ratings issued on up to 11 different areas. Each area will be given one of five grades: exemplary, strong, secure, attention needed or causing concern. But there will be no overall or summary grade.So far,headteachers and teaching unions have been unimpressedby Ofsted’s proposals, while Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is said to be monitoring the results closely.The chief inspector apologised for the rushed nature of the changes and consultations. He said: “The system was saying Ofsted needed urgent and quick reform. And so I chose to put something out that I knew would be just the beginnings, just the foundations.”Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The mess Ofsted have got themselves into is entirely of Sir Martyn Oliver’s making and it is disappointing that he has tried to pass the buck.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Many came from countries across Africa and Asia in the 1970s and 80s and were granted indefinite leave to remain by the Home Office with an ink stamp or vignette (sticker) in their passports, or a piece of paper confirming their status. This physical proof of right to remain is known as a legacy document.However, the Home Office is now encouraging everyone eligible to create an online eVisa account to replace their legacy document.

They did not feature on the Home Office’s previous immigration database – CID (Case Information Database) – nor on Atlas, CID’s replacement.The best estimate of the number involved is 200,000, which comes from a Home Officeinternal assessment (pdf)in April 2022.The Guardian repeatedly asked the Home Office if it has records relating to those 200,000 people and if it knows how many are still alive and residing in the UK, but received no response.Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors has been working with some older people with legacy documents who are only now realising they need to go online and obtain eVisas.“Individuals who were previously granted indefinite leave to remain or other long-term statuses via ink-stamped endorsements are increasingly being left behind,” he said.“Despite holding lawful status, many are now at serious risk of being treated as undocumented, simply because their physical documents are not recognised or integrated into the Home Office’s new digital eVisa platform.“This vulnerable group often includes elderly, marginalised or digitally excluded individuals, many of whom have lived in the UK for 30 to 40 years or more.“Without access to digital records or UK Visas and Immigration accounts, these individuals are effectively invisible within the current system, despite their lawful and settled status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In reality, this means many upland farmers may be incentivised to stop farming.More than 80% of UK farmers worried about climate crisis harming livelihood, study findsRead moreHe said his land use framework “envisions taking some of the least productive land out of food production, but supporting the more productive land to increase production”.Reed said this was so “you maintain outputs, or even increase outputs while increasing the space for nature. We have a limited amount of land in this country for the many demands we make of it, for food production, for housing, for energy and for nature, and we need to make sure that we are using them optimally for all of those outcomes.”Upland farms, which are labelled in the land use framework“analytical annex”as the least productive, are themost reliant on subsidiesof all farm types. Many of them would go out of business if their payments were cut or removed.The farming payments are used to incentivise nature-friendly farming, and in some cases pay farmers to take land out of production, for example to use it as wildflower meadows. This means the land could be shifted out of food production either by removing farming payments, in which case the farm could no longer profitably operate, or by being paid to take land out of production and use it for wildflowers or peatland restoration instead.Reed told Groundswell there would be “no compulsion” under the land use framework but that “it would seem odd if the [land use data] didn’t then help at least inform the way that farming budgets were allocated”.He said communities would be supported through the transition: “I grew up in the 80s, and the Thatcher government at the time destroyed the industry that my entire family worked in, and nothing was put in place. So those communities were destroyed, and one of the reasons I got involved in politics was to make sure that can’t happen again.”Reed also announced a reopening of a £150m fund that will pay farmers for actions such as wildfire prevention, hosting educational visits and storing slurry in an environmentally friendly way. From next year, farmers will also be paid under this scheme to dig ponds on their land to store water and help biodiversity.Farmers also face more upheaval as Reed announced an overhaul of the nature-friendly farming scheme. This pays farmers to do things such as leave wildflower borders for birds, plant hedgerows and reduce their use of pesticides.The nature-friendly farming programme was devised by the Conservatives after Brexit. The goal was that rather than being paid per acre, farmers should be paid for improving nature. At the spending review, it was announced the budget would be cut by an average of £100m a year between this year and 2029.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionReed said the scheme would be simplified, adding: “We need to return firmly to the principle of public money for public goods. Our reformed SFI [sustainable farming incentive] will maximise benefits for the environment, particularly around water quality and biodiversity, so we can clean up our polluted rivers, welcome wildlife back to farms and strengthen the natural foundations that are vital to sustainable food production. We will simplify the SFI and support farmers to take on packages of actions, which, when they’re done together, achieve more for nature.”Farmers have felt squeezed by the Labour government’s policies over recent months and there have been mass protests over an inheritance tax introduced on agricultural land.Defra was also recently forced into a U-turn after abruptly shutting sustainable farming incentive payments to those who were in the process of applying. After farmers threatened a judicial review, ministers reopened the schemes. There has also been a perceived lack of support over the impacts of extreme weather, with record droughts and floods having hit farmers in recent years.This year, the drought is expected to cut yields and some arable farmers have said their harvest may be reduced by up to 50%. Livestock farmers are already fearing running out of grass to feed their flocks.Reed acknowledged these difficulties and said: “I think there have been challenges along the way. I know early on, the announcements that were made around inheritance tax were difficult for the sector. I know that.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingSteve ReedFoodRewildingnewsShareReuse this content"

Against the hills of the Cairngorms national park, a herd of stags on the moorland bask in the sun.It is a spectacular landscape, attracting hikers, mountain-bikers and salmon fishers, the latter contributing anestimated £15mto Aberdeenshire’s economy.But according to Third, the river operations manager for the Dee District Salmon Fishery Board and River Dee Trust, the changing climate threatens the survival of spring salmon in the Dee’s Special Area of Conservation, a place where King Charles learned to fly-fish.View image in fullscreenSpring salmon populations in Scotland have declined steeply due to rising temperatures and changes in river flow.Photograph: Digital Vision./Getty ImagesTemperature rises on the upper tributaries, the birthplace of the spring salmon, and altered flow patterns caused by increasing winter floods, are linked to a “massive decline” in the river’s spring salmon population, Third says.Spring salmon are renowned for their athleticism, migrating thousands of kilometres to west Greenland and back, leaping up waterfalls, to return to their natal streams to spawn.“We have over 300km of streams classified as vulnerable to warming water temperatures,” says Third, holding up what he describes as a “scary map” of such rivers drawn up by the Scottish government. “We’ve had 27.5C in some. Salmon feel stress atanything over 23C.”Third, who was born in Deeside, has worked on the river for three decades. He recalls a time when chunks of ice would break off and be swept downstream. But temperatures in the Dee have increased by 1.5C over 30 years.As the yellow streaks on the map attest, many of its upper tributaries are now classified as highly vulnerable to rising temperatures. Which spells trouble ahead for the Dee – one of Scotland’s “big four” salmon rivers, those most renowned for their fishing – which has so far escaped the dramatic decline in salmon populations seen elsewhere. In Scotland,153 rivers, or 72%, have a conservation status of “poor” for salmon, while the Dee is among 31 (15%) rated as “good”.But data from the Scottish government’s longest-runningwild salmon monitoring programme,on a key tributary of the Dee called the Girnock Burn, near the Muick, has alarmed conservationists, anglers and landowners. It recordeda single, solitary female salmonreturning to spawn in 2024, the lowest number since records began, down from200 in 1966. Another tributary, the Baddock, had the fourth lowest returning females on record, just seven in total.The figures mark a “catastrophic decline” in the river’s spring salmon numbers, according to the Missing Salmon Alliance, a group of conservation and angler organisations.View image in fullscreenRegenerating saplings, part of riverbank and habitat restoration on the River Muick tributary.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAlongside other warning signs,including a 96%drop in rod catches of spring salmon from 8,000 in the 1950s to fewer than 500 today, a 20-year project known as “Save the Spring” is aiming to halt the decline.An initial five-year, £5m partnership, between the Dee District Salmon Fishery Board, a statutory body, River Dee Trust, the Atlantic Salmon Trust and the University of Stirling and UHI Inverness, has two parts, restoring and improving habitats and a controversial pilot intervention known as “conservation translocation”. The latter, based ona projectin the Bay of Fundy, in Canada,has been usedby the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland toreintroduce wildcatsto the Cairngorms to save them from extinction.The intervention will tackle the most perilous part of a salmon’s lifecycle, at sea. Currently only three in every 100 salmon return, Third says. The idea is that by intervening in this part of the lifecycle, mortality will improve.Last year, about 100 smoults, or young salmon, were caught, put in a tank and driven 200 miles (320km) to a larger seawater tank on the west coast. When they are fully grown, later this summer, they will be returned to the river.The salmon do not have the luxury of another 30 years of academic study – they are a species on the brinkSave the SpringBut the bulk of the work is tree planting to bring shade and river re-engineering, to slow and improve river flow.“The extremes of flows are one of the pressures on salmon,” says Lorraine Hawkins, river director of the Dee District Salmon Fishery Board and Trust. “They can wash juveniles and eggs out of the river.”Placing dead trees in the water alters the flow, creating ideal habitats for salmon to spawn and eggs to survive, she says.Summer is becoming drier here, which increases stress on salmon, leaving them stranded in dried-up beds.Hawkins has received callouts from the public to rescue stranded fish.Without woodland, floods and droughts can worsen, and river temperatures can rise. In the Muick, wild salmon populations, while still critically low, have shown signs of improvement after a decade of restoration, according to Save the Spring.View image in fullscreenDeer contribute to the deterioration of the habitat through over grazing, reducing tree cover along rivers.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThird points to moorland dotted with bog cotton and, aside from the saplings of alder, birch and Scots pine his colleagues have planted, few trees. The upper Dee has 8% tree cover, he says, compared with an average of37% in Europe.“The river would have had woodland in the past,” he says. “There are so many deer here, the trees don’t get peace to grow.”The deer numbers are kept up for high-paying guests to hunt on the private estates bordering the river. Balmoral and Glenmuick estate are among the project’s supporters.View image in fullscreenBaby salmon are trapped in the River Dee and transferred farther north to be grown before being reintroduced into the river to try to improve the salmon population.Photograph: riverdee.orgSave the Spring is not without its critics. Apaper published last yearsuggests salmon restoration schemes such as the Dee are based on limited scientific evidence. It also argues that since the highest mortalities are marine, river restoration is likely to have a marginal impact. Questions have also been raised about the pilot’s potential to introduce diseased fish, grown elsewhere, to a pristine river.A spokesperson for Save the Spring says it is dealing with “critically low wild salmon populations” facing the threat of extinction: “They do not have the luxury of another 30 years of academic study – they are a species on the brink.”The project is guided by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) best practice guidelines, and works with senior scientists, in consultation with experts in Atlantic salmon conservation, landscape ecology, peatland restoration, government policy and water resource management, the spokesperson says.A spokesperson for the University of Stirling added that the fish are “closely monitored” for health and welfare risks and subject to pre-transfer health checks prior to release.View image in fullscreenLorraine Hawkins, river director of the Dee District Salmon Fishery Board, with regenerating saplings. She says extreme flows can wash juveniles and eggs out of the river.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAlready, 150,00 trees have been planted along the Muick, including on a fenced-off 40-hectare site on the Balmoral estate. The shade provided, when the trees mature, can cool water temperatures by a few degrees, says Third.Something in the water: how kelp is helping Maine’s mussels boomRead moreThe target is1 million new treesby 2035, including native rowan, aspen, Scots pine, birch, willow and hawthorn. Fishery boards across Scotland have similar tree-planting programmes, to provide shade to lower water temperatures.“This is about doing something now, to build up resilience for what’s coming down the line in 10, 20 or 50 years’ time,” says Third. “The salmon will have a fighting chance.”Explore more on these topicsRiversSeascape: the state of our oceansFishScotlandClimate crisisMarine lifeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

By mid-morning the sun would beat down as they huddled in the scant shade of the van. There were no trees other than a collection of salt cedars on the lake’s north shore. But the discomfort didn’t matter when the peregrine falcons appeared, slicing through the sky. “It was hard to leave that place,” says Witt.The lake – created in 1965 as part of a system of wastewater catchment ponds for Holloman air force base – is an unlikely oasis. Other than small ponds created for livestock it is the only body of water for thousands of square kilometres in an otherwise stark landscape. However, Witt says there was always something slightly weird about the foam that would form around the edge. “But I only saw that stuff once I knew.”Few people live around here, but those that do enjoyed the lake. Online it was billed as a “free, no-frills experience” for camping. On weekends, up to 20 people could be seen pitching tents and barbecuing on the southern shore.View image in fullscreenHolloman Lake was created in the 60s and became a wildlife haven.Photograph: Jean-Luc Cartron/UNMIn 2009,plans were drawnup to construct a pavilion, beach area and nature trails to encourage more people to enjoy the area. But all that changed in 2017 when authorities discovered what was in the water.There were no other analogs that we could find for this level of contamination. The orders of magnitude were absolutely shockingChristopher WittSince then an alarming picture has been building up of the extent of the chemical contamination at Holloman Lake. Last month,research co-authored by Witt showedthe site has the highest Pfas concentration in water and plants ever recorded in peer-reviewed literature. Every part of the ecosystem is saturated in these “forever chemicals”, including the soil, algae, invertebrates, fish and reptiles.View image in fullscreenChristopher Witt holds a decoy that was used to help sample ducks for the Pfas study at Holloman Lake.Photograph: UNMPfas, which stands for ‘per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances’, are a group of thousands of human-made chemicals prized for their water, heat and grease-resistant properties. The same attributes that make them so useful in industrial and consumer products are what make them so bad when they leak into the environment, where they can persist for hundreds of years.Witt’s birdwatching spot turned into a “natural field laboratory” for understanding how forever chemicals affect ecosystems. He stopped going there for the pleasure of watching birds, and shifted to studying the area in his capacity as a professor of biology at the University of New Mexico. “Honestly, I try not to spend too much time there,” he says. “You can take up some of these Pfas compounds through skin contact, and you can breathe them in through the air and dust.”When the Pfas results came back from the lab, Witt assumed it was a mistake. “There were no other analogs that we could find for this level of contamination,” he says. “The orders of magnitude that we were dealing with were absolutely shocking. We thought we were doing something wrong with the converssion of units.”But the numbers were correct. Across 23 bird and mammal species tested, Pfas concentrations averagedtens of thousandsof parts per billion,2024 research found. For comparison, in 2019 thousands ofdairy cows in Clovis, New Mexico were culled because their milk was contaminated with less than six parts per billion.View image in fullscreenA field crew from the University of New Mexico processes samples taken from small mammals at Holloman Lake.Photograph: Jean-Luc Cartron/UNMThe main cause of contamination is thefirefighting foamsused in training exercises by the US air force at the Holloman site from about 1970. The single most contaminated individual from the 2024 study was a 1994 specimen of awhite-footed mouse, showing pollution had been high for decades.Adead killdeer chickwas found by its nest on the ground near the lake. It was sent to the lab for testing, and its tissues had the highest Pfas concentration recorded to date in a bird, according to the 2025 paper.The revelations about Pfas in the lake water triggered lawsuits from New Mexico’s Environment Department against the military. In the US there are more than9,000 active legal casesrelated to the production or release of Pfas.But for Witt and other researchers on the ground, the scientific investigation was just beginning. He describes the state of current research as a “hodgepodge of surveys here and there”, all saying that we still don’t know enough about how Pfas are moving through food webs globally, and how they could be affecting wildlife.Now, the body of evidence of the impact of Pfas on wildlife is growing.View image in fullscreenBluegill fish have been found to swim more slowly after exposure to Pfas.Photograph: Phil Degginger/AlamyIn Michigan, bluegill fish have been found toswim more slowlyafter Pfas exposure, suggesting they could be physically or neurologically impaired. Exposed black-legged kittiwakes are developingthyroid dysfunctionsand hormonal imbalances. Sea turtles in contaminated sites in Australia areproducing hatchlingswith deformed scales and health problems. American alligators in North Carolina are moresusceptible to infections, while dolphins in South Carolina are showing signs ofchronic inflammation.More than 600 species on every continent are at risk of harm, according toa mapby the Environmental Working Group (EWG) illustrating how harmful chemicals are filtering through ecosystems. When they began mapping the research, “we thought: ‘it’ll be a quick one month project’ – then you quickly realise there are hundreds and hundreds of studies,” says David Andrews, acting chief science officer at EWG. “It turned out to be a significant amount of work.”It is likely that these chemicals are an additional stressor threatening species, along with climate breakdown and habitat loss. “Nothing really escapes these chemicals – this is not something you can fly away from,” says Andrews.Health impacts in humans, such as cancers, hormonal disruption and immune system disruption, are increasingly well documented. Research shows there are parallels in wildlife. “What we see is an overlapping pattern of health harm between both humans and the wildlife species that have been studied,” says Andrews. As sampling becomes cheaper and more accessible around the globe and more testing is done, the map of Pfas in wildlife will continue to expand, he says.‘Even if we stop drinking we will be exposed’: A French region has banned tap water. Is it a warning for the rest of Europe?Read moreThe buildup of Pfas in wildlife also raises questions for those who hunt or consume wild meat. At Holloman Lake, even a single gram of duck meat would be too toxic to safely eat, based on average Pfas concentrations. Yet this is still a popular area for hunting.View image in fullscreenPfas pollution is so high in bird populations at Holloman Lake that even a gram of duck meat would be too toxic to eat.Photograph: Michael J Andersen/UNMResearchers are testing 400 ducks across the state to work out whether contaminants are jumping from hotspots such as Holloman to other wetlands. The preliminary results are “concerning”, says Witt, showing widespread contamination. That could be because ducks from sites such as Holloman are spreading it, or because there are other contaminated sites across the US, or some combination of the two. “When you are eating wild duck meat, probably anywhere in North America, you’re kind of rolling the dice,” he says.Now, instead of watching birds, Witt is blending in with hunters in camo, capturing ducks and other birds and mammals to test their bodies for Pfas. “I have really conflicted feelings about it; it’s a beautiful place, it’s so biodiverse, and yet really troubled,” says Witt. “I feel a sense of urgency to figure out what is happening to the birds that are there.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage.Explore more on these topicsPfasThe age of extinctionWildlifeHealthPollutionWaterNew MexicoBirdsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have asked for their privacy to be respected.”Lipsey entered the Lords in 1999. Lord McFall of Alcluith, the Lord Speaker, said the upper chamber extended its “condolences to the noble lord’s family and friends”.Lipsey, originally from Dorset, lived in Powys and was a patron of the Glasbury arts festival. In the 1970s, he served as a special adviser to the Labour minister and diarist Anthony Crosland and on the staff at 10 Downing Street under Callaghan, later Lord Callaghan.Lipsey also workedfor the Guardian, the Sunday Times, New Society and the Economist and co-founded the short-lived Sunday Correspondent in 1988. He was awarded a life peerage by Tony Blair in 1999.The peer was also a fan of greyhound racing, chairing the British Greyhound Racing Board, now called the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, between 2004 and 2009 and worked to get dogs rehomed at the end of their careers.Keir Starmer said: “David was loved and respected by so many. Whether it was his early years as a researcher and adviser, or his quarter of a century in the House of Lords, he worked tirelessly for what he believed in.“He will be sorely missed by all who were fortunate to know him, in parliament and beyond.

Biscuit museum’s Jaffa Cake display reignites old debateManufacturer sends pun-packed letter asking for exhibit to be removed, saying the clue to item’s status is in the nameZoe WoodConsumer affairs correspondentThu 3 Jul 2025 13.39 EDTFirst published on Thu 3 Jul 2025 13.09 EDTShareIt could be described as a storm in a teacup but the humble JaffaCakeis once again at the centre of controversy after McVitie’s asked a biscuit museum to pull the snack from a display.The manufacturer took issue with the orangey treat being showcased in a museum devoted to biscuits because, for VAT purposes anyway, it is officially a cake. This fact was settled long ago in a legal battle with the taxman.The David and Goliath-style row – which some suggested had been orchestrated by McVitie’s to boost sales – has reignited the debate.Days after the biscuit museum in Bermondsey, southLondon, unveiled the display, McVitie’s sent it a cease-and-desist-style letter requesting “the immediate removal of Jaffa Cakes from your biscuit exhibit”.However, it sought to sweeten the pill by diluting the legalese with biscuit-based puns.“We write to you today, not with crumbs of animosity, but with a full slice of firm objection,” it wrote. “Allow us to be clear: Jaffa Cakes are, in fact, cakes. Some would say the clue is in the name on the box.”Taking the biscuit: for 100 years we’ve been eating chocolate digestives wrongRead moreMcVitie’s and the biscuit museum, officially called the Peek Frean Museum, said they were yet to agree on a resolution. The museum’s curator, Gary Magold, said, “It’s a shame – we’ve had to remove the exhibition for the moment. We’re hoping we can reach an agreement.”The subtleties of the “is it a cake or biscuit?” debate have likely filled many a tea break but the tax law is clear: biscuits are zero-rated, but as soon as the makers start covering them with chocolate they attract 20% VAT. This wasat the heart of the Jaffa Cakescase, which came to a head in 1991.HM Customs & Excise (the predecessor of HMRC) said they were biscuits, and that their chocolatey topping was taxable. The manufacturer McVitie’s insisted they were cakes, which are zero-rated. It won, and those smashing orangey bits can be enjoyed tax-free.This week’s skirmish lit up social media message boards. One poster tried to shut the debate down, stating: “A biscuit goes soft when you leave it out. A cake goes hard. There’s your answer.”Others questioned whether there was a darker subtext. “They just want to hide how much the thing have [sic] shrunk – shrinkflation strikes again.”In recent years Jaffa Cake fans have faced diminishing returns. Not only has the number in the box reduced but two years ago the “cakes” shrank in size from 5.5cm to 5cm across. The orange bump became smaller, too.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryCakeBiscuitsFoodLondonManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

This has been a long-running problem. No one is surprised because this happens time and time again.“He needs to sort it out because it is an embarrassment to London and to Wimbledon – the eyes of the world are on SW19 right now.”Tennis fans complained of “sweaty armpits” on crowded trains on Thursday as the District line was beset by severe delays and part suspended for a second day due to a track fault at Tower Hill.Helen and Alex Kaufmann were late for the first match on Court 2 after it took them more than an hour to travel from West Hampstead to Southfields. “The [Southfields] platform was super busy, really crowded, really hard to get off. We probably waited as long to get off as we did on the train,” Helen said.TfL issued an apology on Thursday, saying it delivered about 75% of the planned service on Monday and Tuesday.In a joint statement with Network Rail, a spokesperson said: “We’re sorry to any District line passengers whose journeys have been affected by recent signalling issues on infrastructure shared between Network Rail and London Underground.“Over the past two days, we’ve experienced two separate track circuit failures, which are critical to the signalling system as they tell signallers where trains are on the network. A failure causes signals to default to red for safety, which reduces the number of trains we can run through the affected area.“In addition, a small fire on the track at Southfields on Tuesday led to a brief suspension of services … We are doing everything we can to minimise disruption, particularly during the Wimbledon championships, and we’d like to thank passengers for their patience and understanding.”Wimbledon bosses declined to comment. But a source said 8,000 more fans a day were expected to visit during the tournament whenexpansion plansare passed, and that “transport infrastructure was key”. They plan to expand a park-and-ride system.Simon Wright, 68,who opposes the plans, said this week’s overcrowding outside Southfields was the worst he had ever seen.“Wimbledon are telling people to not arrive by car and TfL are saying they cannot run any more trains. They cannot manage the number of people they have got at the moment. I think it’s crazy. It’s the worst that I have seen, especially because the District line has been falling over,” he said.A spokesperson for Khan said: “When there are delays on the network, TfL works at pace to restore the services to normal and minimise disruption to those travelling around our city. The mayor remains focused on delivering the reliable, world-class public transport system Londoners expect and deserve.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025LondonTfLPublic transportSadiq KhanWimbledonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

You will all be questioned on camera about how you think endangering children is ok. My homework continues.”Robinson is also charged with harassment causing fear of violence by allegedly posting a direct message on X to Dirnhuber on 5 August at 8.50am in which he said: “I’ll be knocking at your door.”He is also alleged to have posted direct messages on the same day to Dirnhuber, saying: “Let your bosses know I’m coming to all your houses,” “Okay got your address” and “We need to talk”.On 6 August, Robinson is alleged to have posted on X: “Got ya Jdirnhuber this is Jacob, he likes to locate and endanger families. Jacob and the rest of the Daily Mail journalists who were involved in endangering my children have today been located.“I look forward to hearing on camera your justification for doxxing my children’s location. I got all three of you tagged and bagged in one day.”Robinson is also alleged to have posted on 6 August at 10.50pm a direct message on X to Dirnhuber in which he said: “I’ll bring my questions to all of your doors.”A previous hearing at Westminster magistrates court heard that none of the alleged harassment contained direct threats of violence.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A small number of people fled into the sea and were rescued by local fishermen and divers.Residents and tourists were taking shelter at an indoor stadium and some had left Crete by boat, authorities said. Local media reported some homes had been damaged. An estimated 5,000 more holidaymakers left south-east Crete independently.Ierapetra’s mayor, Manolis Frangoulis, said firefighters were working to prevent flare-ups during a lull in high winds. “Thankfully no one was hurt but it’s a difficult situation,” he said.Like the rest of Crete, Ierapetra – a seaside resort with a permanent population of 23,000 – accommodates thousands of tourists in the summer. The island’s arid, uneven landscape, criss-crossed by gullies, makes it hard for firefighters to tackle blazes.A separate fire was raging in the Halkidiki region ofGreece, with 160 firefighters and 49 vehicles involved in the emergency response.View image in fullscreenA wildfire in the Halkidiki region of Greece.Photograph: Fedja Grulovic/ReutersInTurkey, thousands of people fled blazes in Cesme and Ödemiş in the western coastal province of İzmir.An elderly man died in the blaze near Ödemis, about 60 miles east of the city of İzmir, in one of three villages evacuated in the area. “The village was evacuated but an elderly, bedridden patient could not be saved,” a local MP told Turkish TV.Vathrakogiannis said the risk of destructive wildfires remained “very considerable” in July, the hottest month of the year in Greece, although the country had largely escaped the heatwave still gripping other parts of southern and centralEurope.Nearly 500 firefighters were battling wildfires in easternGermanythat severely injured two emergency workers and forced the evacuation of more than 100 people near Gohrischheide, on the border between the states of Saxony and Brandenburg.The blazes had burned through hundreds of hectares of heathland and were still not under control on Thursday, with firefighters unable to tackle outbreaks on a former military training area with unexploded ammunition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least five people have died in the heatwave inItaly, including two, aged 75 and 60, on beaches in Sardinia.Temperatures on the island, where wildfires have been raging, have exceeded 40C in recent days. In Genoa, an 85-year-old man died of heart failure in hospital. A 47-year-old construction worker died near Bologna and a 53-year-old woman died in Palermo.A measurehalting outdoor work, for example, on construction sites and farms, during the hottest part of the day has taken effect nationwide, although it is not an obligation and many people are continuing to work their normal hours.InSpain, the media reported that the two victims of a wildfire that consumed more than 5,500 hectares of mostly agricultural land in Torrefeta i Florejacs in Lleida province were aged 32 and 45, and had died of smoke inhalation.Temperatures in centralAlbaniareached 40C on Thursday, and with little rain expected until September fears are rising for local agricultural output. Serbia’s state meteorological institute also warned “extreme drought” was affecting crops.Scientists have said Europe’s heatwaves have arrived earlier than usual this year, with temperatures surging by up to 10C in some regions as warming seas encourage the formation of a “heat dome” over much of the land mass, trapping hot air.Explore more on these topicsEurope weatherExtreme weatherWildfiresGreeceEuropeTurkeyGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling also barred her from running for any political office.Kirchner, who denied all the charges against her, was sentenced tosix years in prison for corruptionin June. Due to her age, judges granted her house arrest, but with a series of restrictions, including the requirement that all visits be authorised in advance – as was the case with Lula, whose visit was approved by a judge the day before.Shortly after 1pm, Lula, 79, left the residence without speaking to reporters, greeting a few dozen supporters waiting outside before departing for the Brazilian embassy.Kirchner, who claims to have been the target of political persecution,posted photosof the meeting and wrote: “Lula was also persecuted, they also used lawfare to put him in prison, they also tried to silence him. They couldn’t. He returned with the vote of the Brazilian people and his head held high. That’s why today his visit was much more than a personal gesture: it was a political act of solidarity.”Former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández allowed to serve corruption sentence at homeRead moreEarlier in the day, he had formally received the rotating presidency of Mercosur – the regional trade bloc whose full members are Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Bolivia in the process of joining and Venezuela currently suspended – fromMilei.The near-total absence of a relationship between Lula and Milei was summed up in the closing moment of the summit: after shaking hands, Lula moved in for a hug, which Milei only registered belatedly – resulting in a stiff, uncomfortable embrace.The two, whodelivered opposing speechesat the summit and hold conflicting positions on issues ranging from climate change – which Milei denies – to the Israel-Palestine conflict, have never held private talks.Milei has in the past called Lula a “communist” and “corrupt”, and the Brazilian did not attend his inauguration.In 2024, Milei left the Mercosur summit in Paraguay early to travel to Brazil and meet Lula’s main political rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, during a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) event.Within Lula’s circle, the visit to Kirchner was seen both as a response to Milei’s gesture in 2024 and a symbolic act of solidarity, echoing the 580 days Lula spent in prison on corruption charges that were later overturned by the supreme court.While Kirchner never visited Lula in prison, he was visited in 2019 by Alberto Fernández, who went on to win that year’s presidential election with her as his running mate.Explore more on these topicsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaCristina Fernández de KirchnerArgentinaBrazilJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The juryacquittedthe 55-year-old music mogul of the most serious charges – racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking – but found him guilty on the two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.Still, this verdict marks only one chapter in Combs’s mounting legal battles. Combs, who remains incarcerated at the Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, is now awaiting sentencing and faces a growing number of civil lawsuits against him alleging sexual assault and abuse.While the guilty verdict on two counts means that Combs is likely to face prison time, it spared him the possibility of a life sentence. The outcome waswidely seenas the best outcome Combs and his legal team could have hoped for, outside of a full acquittal.The federal criminal case against Combs began after singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura – one of his former girlfriends – filed a civil lawsuit against him in 2023.In the civil suit, Ventura, who became the government’s key witness in this criminal trial,accused Combs of physical and sexual abuse, rapeand forcing her to have sex with male escorts.Combs denied the allegations, and the lawsuit wassettled within 24 hours. During the federal trial, Ventura testified that the settlement amount was $20m.Since Ventura’s 2023 lawsuit against Combs, more than 50 additional civil lawsuits have been filed against the music mogul by both men and women, accusing him of sexual assault, rape, drugging and physical violence. More lawsuits were filed as recently asthis weekandlast week.Combs has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him in the civil filings.The judgeoverseeing the case denied his request for bailfollowing Wednesday’s verdict.The judge tentatively proposed October for sentencing, though Combs’s legal team has requested an earlier date.Each of the two counts that Combs was convicted of carry maximum sentences of 10 years. The judge has discretion to impose a shorter sentence and may allow the two terms to run concurrently. The 10 months Combs has already spent in custody will also likely count toward his sentence.Outside the courthouse on Wednesday, a crowd of Combs’s supporters gathered tocelebrate the partial acquittal, chanting his name and cheering as members of his family exited the building.But while his fans rejoiced, many victims’ advocacy organizationsexpressed disappointmentin the verdict.UltraViolet, a women’s rights organization that staged a demonstration last week outsidethe trial in support of sexual assault survivors,called the verdict“not just a stain on a criminal justice system that for decades has failed to hold accountable abusers like Diddy, it’s also an indictment of a culture in which not believing women and victims of sexual assault remains endemic”.Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center and co-founder of the Time’s Up legal defense fund, issueda statementexpressing solidarity with the “courageous and inspiring survivors who chose to tell their stories, hold their abuser accountable, and seek justice”.Douglas Wigdor, an attorney for Ventura, said that “although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex-trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution”.“By coming forward with her experience,” he said, “Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.”In the wake of the verdict, several celebrities took to social media to share their reactions and support for Ventura.Singer Keshaposted on X:“Cassie, I believe you. I love you. Your strength is a beacon for every survivor.”Actress Christina Ricci called Ventura a “hero” and “an inspiration” in a message on Instagram.Singer Aubrey O’Day, who was previously signed to Combs’s Bad Boy Records label, shared a lengthy statement on her Instagram that read in part: “It is heartbreaking to witness how many lives have been impacted by their experiences with Sean Combs, only for those stories to fall short in the eyes of a jury.”Actress Rosie O’Donnell expressedoutrage online, writing: “I guess a jury just never wants to believe that a woman stays because of power and coercion- wow – they just think women stay because what? money – fame – ‘they love the abuse’ – what a fucking joke – this decision got me angry.”And actress Evan Rachel Woodalso weighed in, writingon Instagram that “there is no consent in a domestic violence relationship. Period. Once the threat of violence is there, you comply. You do not consent, it is self preservation and survival.”Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

Some families have told him that Air India officials went round to their homes and asked why they had not yet completed the forms.View image in fullscreenDebris of Air India flight 171 after the crash.Photograph: Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty ImagesNeenan claimed families were falsely told they would not receive any payments unless they completed the forms, even though airlines are required under international law to make immediate advance payments to families entitled to compensation. Families are not required to do anything more than provide proof of identity and sign a receipt.One relative, whose mother was killed in the crash, said: “The conditions where they asked us to complete the questionnaire were unacceptable, in a crowded hot corridor with unsuitable chairs and desks. There was no privacy whatsoever.“They asked us for information about dependency but there was no specifics about what they meant by that, whether financial or otherwise. I felt pressure at the time under extremely distressing circumstances following such a catastrophic loss.“Air India should have done this in a more professional and compassionate manner and asked all families to seek legal advice before proceeding. However, it was implied that if we did not complete the questionnaire and submit documents then no compensation would be paid.”Air India has said they take “such accusations incredibly seriously” because the “support and welfare of the families impacted by this tragic incident is our number one priority”.A spokesperson said the airline “sought to make the questionnaire as simple as possible to ensure compensation goes to the right person as swiftly and smoothly as possible”.“We are doing everything we possibly can to ensure that compensation is provided as quickly and smoothly as possible to families at what is an impossibly difficult time for them,” they added.“Understandably, there are some formal processes that must be followed but we are giving families all the time and flexibility they need and we want to support however we can.”The spokesperson said Air India had been making “considerable efforts to process payment of interim compensation as soon as possible, in order to meet the immediate financial needs of affected family members, with the first payments having been made within days of the accident”.Download original documentTo date, Air India has released interim compensation to 47 families, they said, with a further 55 payments shortly to be released.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Family members have been issued with a questionnaire to allow Air India to gather the information required to process compensation payments.“Air India has certainly not made any unsolicited visits to families’ homes.”In addition, the spokesperson said: “Air India provided dedicated support staff to every family. These liaison officers were able to support on any number of things from accommodation, transport, funeral arrangements or any logistics.”View image in fullscreenFamily members of a victim of the Air India plane crash, grieve during a funeral procession in Ahmedabad.Photograph: Ajit Solanki/APBut Neenan said: “The repeated story that we have heard from our clients is that families have been told by Air India that they have to complete a questionnaire to get the advance payment, forcing them to fill out this questionnaire in appalling conditions: small, crowded rooms, in intense heat with no guidance on the terms and questions within the questionnaire.“Our clients have shown us the questionnaire. It demands legally significant information using terms which have a legal definition which is not being told to families.“The forms say that Air India will use the information given to calculate compensation. They ask for apparently straightforward information but using terms that are actually very legally charged and contain a lot of nuance that you need legal training before being able to understand.“There is no question that the information being asked for could be used against families by Air India in the future,” he said. “There are two scenarios that will come out of families filling out these forms: either families get lawyers like me involved afterwards, and then we have to argue in court that the relative filled out the form without understanding the terms, and hope the judge agrees with us.“Or, which is even worse, the airline calculates compensation using information on the form, the family don’t get legal representation, and accept what I guarantee will be a significantly lower level of compensation – and that could be millions of pounds less than they are entitled to.”“We are advising our clients not to complete this form and to seek specialist legal advice,” he added. “We are shocked and appalled that Air India is seeking this information from families when they are at their most vulnerable. They should feel ashamed.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

In the years that followed, Hollywood’s sweetheart would sound different in cinemas around the world but to native audiences she would sound the same.The voice actors would gain some notoriety in their home countries, but today, their jobs are being threatened by artificial intelligence. The use of AI was a major point of dispute during the Hollywood actors’ strike in 2023, when both writers and actors expressed concern that it could undermine their roles, and fought for federal legislation to protect their work. Not long after, more than 20 voice acting guilds, associations and unions formed the United Voice Artists coalition to campaign under the slogan “Don’t steal our voices”. In Germany, home to “the Oscars of dubbing”, artists warned that their jobs were at risk with the rise of films dubbed with AI trained using their voices, without their consent.“It’s war for us,” says Patrick Kuban, a voice actor and organiser with the dubbing union Voix Off, who along with the French Union of Performing Artists started the campaign #TouchePasMaVF (“don’t touch my French version”). They want to see dubbing added to France’sl’exception culturelle, a government policy that defines cultural goods as part of national identity and needing special protection from the state.Dubbing isn’t just a case of translating a film into native languages, explains Kuban, it’s adapted “to the French humour, to include references, culture and emotion”. As a result,AIcould put an estimated 12,500 jobs at risk in France: including writers, translators, sound engineers, as well as the voice actors themselves, according to a study by the Audiens Group in 2023.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want my voice to be used to say whatever someone wants’ … a voiceover artist in a recording studio.Photograph: Edward Olive/Getty Images“Humans are able to bring to [these roles]: experience, trauma and emotion, context and background and relationships,” adds Tim Friedlander, a US-based voice actor, studio owner, musician, and president of the National Association of Voice Actors. “All of the things that we as humans connect with. You can have a voice that sounds angry, but if it doesn’t feel angry, you’re going to have a disconnect in there.”Since the introduction of sound cinema in the late 1920s and 1930s, dubbing has grown to be an industry worth more than $4.04bn (£2.96bn) globally. It was first adopted in Europe by authoritarian leaders, who wanted to remove negative references to their governments and promote their languages. Mussolini banned foreign languages in movies entirely, a policy that catalysed a preference for dubbed rather than subtitled films in the country. Today, 61% of German viewers and 54% of French ones also opt for dubbed movies, while Disney dubs their productions into more than 46 languages. But with the development of AI, who profits from dubbing could soon change.Earlier this year, the UK-based startup ElevenLabs announced plans to clone the voice of Alain Dorval – the “voix de Stallone”, who from the 1970s onwards gave voice to Sylvester Stallone in some 30 films – in a new thriller, Armor, on Amazon. At the time, contracts did not state how an actor’s voice could be re-used: including to train AI software and create synthetic voices that ultimately could replace voice actors entirely. “It’s a kind of monster,” says Kuban. “If we don’t have protection, all kinds of jobs will be lost: after the movie industry, it will be the media industry, the music industry, all the cultural industries, and a society without culture will not be very good.”When ChatGPT and ElevenLabs hit the market at the start of 2022, making AI a public-facing technology, “it was a theoretical threat, but not an immediate threat”, says Friedlander. But as the market has grown, including the release of the Israeli startup Deepdub, an AI-powered platform that offers dubbing and voiceover services for films, the problems with synthetic voice technologies have become impossible to ignore.“If you steal my voice, you are stealing my identity,” says Daniele Giuliani, who voiced Jon Snow in the Game of Thrones, and works as a dubbing director. He is the president of the Italian dubbers’ association, ANAD, which recently fought for AI clauses in national contracts to protect voice actors from the indiscriminate and unauthorised use of their voices, and to prohibit the use of those voices in machine learning and deep data mining – a proposal that’s being used as a model in Spain. “This is very serious. I don’t want my voice to be used to say whatever someone wants.”AI’s tentacles have had a global reach too. In India, where 72% of viewers prefer watching content in a different language, Sanket Mhatre, who voices Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 superhero film Green Lantern is concerned: “We’ve been signing contracts for donkey’s years now and most of these contracts have really big language about your voice being used in all perpetuity anywhere in the world,” says Mhatre. “Now with AI, signing something like this is essentially just signing away your career.”Mhatre dubs more than 70-100 Hollywood movies into Hindi each year, as well as Chinese, Spanish, French films; web series, animated shows, anime, documentaries and audiobooks. “Every single day, I retell stories from some part of the world for the people of my country in their language, in their voice. It’s special,” he says. “It’s such an inclusive exercise. In India, if you’re not somebody who speaks English, it’s very easy to be knocked down and feel inferior. But when you are able to dub this cinema into Hindi, people now understand that cinema and can discuss it.”He’s noticed a decline in the number of jobs dubbing corporate copy, training videos, and other quick turnaround information-led items, but he thinks his job is safe at the moment as it’s impossible for AI to adapt to cultural nuances or act with human emotion. “If the actor’s face is not visible on screen, or if you’re just seeing their back, in India, we might attempt to add an expression or a line to clarify the scene or provide more context.” When there are references to time travel movies in a sci-fi film, he explains, a dubber might list Bollywood titles instead.But as AI learns more from voice actors and other humans, Mhatre is aware that it is a whole lot quicker and cheaper for companies to adopt this technology rather than hire dubbing actors, translators, and sound engineers.“We need to stand against the robots,” says Kuban. “We need to use them for peaceful things, for maybe climate change or things like that, but we need to have actors on the screen.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAIFilm industryWorld cinemafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Revolutions are made by people – and those people are idealistic and messy and flawed. This is the truth at the core ofNtombizodwa Nyoni’s ambitious new play marking the 80th anniversary of theFifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester, a crucial moment in the postwar fight against colonial rule.It’s a story that’s both global and firmly rooted in the city, making it an ideal fit forManchester international festival. Set in and around the Congress, Liberation follows the people behind the movement, including veteran activists George Padmore (Eamonn Walker) and Amy Ashwood Garvey (Pamela Nomvete) and future African politicians Kwame Nkrumah (Eric Kofi Abrefa), Jomo Kenyatta (Tonderai Munyevu) and Joe Appiah (Joshua Roberts-Mensah). We see their public speeches, their private discussions and their pub-room debates.Did the liberation of Africa start in Manchester? The biting play about a pivotal, forgotten momentRead moreThere’s a fizzing tension between solidarity and idealism on the one hand and ambition and interpersonal conflict on the other. Nyoni’s script is alive to nuance and difficulty, staging knotty struggles between different genders, generations and regional loyalties, as well as prodding at complex ideas around political change and allyship. As young social worker Alma La Badie (an impassioned Leonie Elliott) observes, the Congress is a space of egos as much as principles, where righteousness coexists with hypocrisy.It’s a play that is, by its nature, all talk. Yet Nyoni and directorMonique Toukomanage to inject the proceedings with some theatricality and verve, recognising that there is no true liberation without joy. Music (composed by Ezra Collective’s Ife Ogunjobi) is central, soundtracking the jubilant entrance of Congress delegates and returning at key moments throughout. With so many people involved, some figures are inevitably given more space than others, but Nyoni deftly juggles the large ensemble of personalities and the strong cast flesh out even the smaller roles.Like the attractive interlocking hexagons of Paul Wills’s set, evoking the worker bee designs found all over Manchester, the competing aims of the Congress eventually – if only temporarily – tesselate. In many ways, Liberation is a celebration of shared struggle, but one that makes vital room for complexity.AtRoyal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreManchester international festivalRoyal ExchangeEzra CollectivereviewsShareReuse this content"

As Lorraine Baines inBack to the Future, she falls in lust with her own son, Marty McFly, a teenage time traveller from 1985 who plunges into 1955 at the wheel of a DeLorean car.Back to the Future, released 40 years ago on Thursday, is both entirely of its time and entirely timeless. It was a box office summer smash, set a benchmark for time travel movies and was quoted by everyone fromPresident Ronald ReagantoAvengers: Endgame. It is arguably a perfect film, without a duff note or a scene out of place, a fantastic parable as endlessly watchable as It’s a Wonderful Life or Groundhog Day.It also, inevitably, reflects the preoccupations of its day. An early sequence features Libyan terrorists from the era of Muammar Gaddafi, a caricature wisely dropped froma stage musical adaptation. In one scene the young George McFly turns peeping tom as he spies on Lorraine getting undressed. To some, the film’s ending equates personal fulfilment with Reagan-fuelled materialism. It caught lightning in a bottle in a way that is unrepeatable.“If you made Back to the Future in 2025 and they went back 30 years, it would be 1995 and nothing would look that different,” Thompson, 64, says by phone from a shoot in Vancouver, Canada. “The phones would be different but it wouldn’t be like the strange difference between the 80s and the 50s and how different the world was.”Bob Gale, co-writer of the screenplay, agrees everything fell into the right place at the right time, including the central partnership between young Marty (Michael J Fox) and white-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The 74-year-old says from Los Angeles: “Oh man, the film wouldn’t even be made today. We’d go into the studio and they’d say, what’s the deal with this relationship between Marty and Doc? They’d start interpreting paedophilia or something. There would be a lot of things they have problems with.”Gale had met the film’s director,Robert Zemeckis, at the USC School of Cinema in 1972 and together they sold several TV scripts to Universal Studios, caught the eye of Steven Spielberg and John Milius and collaborated on three films. The pair had always wanted to make a time travel movie but couldn’t find the right hook. Then Gale had an epiphany.“We put a time travel story on the back burner until I found my dad’s high school yearbook and boom, that was when the lightning bolt hit me and I said, ha, this would be cool: kid goes back in time and ends up in high school with his dad!”Gale and Zemeckis pitched the script more than 40 times over four years but studios found it too risky or risque. But Spielberg saw its potential and came in as executive producer. After Zemeckis scored a hit withRomancing the Stone in 1984, Universal gave the green light.The character of Doc Brown was inspired by Gale’s childhood neighbour, a photographer who showed him the “magic” of developing pictures in a darkroom, and the educational TV show Mr Wizard which demonstrated scientific principles. Then Lloyd came in and added an interpretation based on part Albert Einstein, partLeopold Stokowski.Thompson was cast as Lorraine after a successful audition. She felt that her background as a ballet and modern dancer gave her a strong awareness of the movement and physicality required to play both versions of Lorraine: one young and airy, the other middle-aged and beaten down by life.“I was perfectly poised for that character,” she says. “I understood both the dark and the light of Lorraine McFly and understood the hilarity of being super sexually attracted to your son. I thought that was frickin’ hilarious. I understood the subversive comedy of it.”Thompson has previously worked with Eric Stoltz, who was cast in the lead role of Marty at the behest of Sidney Sheinberg, a Universal executive who had nurtured Spielberg and putJawsinto production. But over weeks of filming, starting in November 1984, it became apparent that Stoltz’s serious tone was not working.Gale recalls: “He wasn’t giving us the kind of humour that we thought the character should have. He actually thought the movie turned out to be a tragedy because he ends up in a 1985 where a lot of his life is different. People can argue about that: did the memories of his new past ripple into his brain, did he remember both his lives? That’s an interesting conversation to have and it gets more interesting the more beer you drink.”A quarter of a century for Back to the FutureRead moreEventually it fell to Zemeckis to inform Stoltz thathis services were no longer required. Gale continues:“He said he thought that possibly Eric was relieved: it was not like a devastating blow to him. This is just hindsight and speculation but maybe Eric’s agents thought that it would be a good career move for him to do a movie like this that had Spielberg involved. Who knows?”Stoltz’s abrupt departure came as a shock to the rest of the cast. Thompson says: “It was horrible. He was my friend and obviously a wonderful actor. Everybody wants to think that making a movie is fun and that we’re laughing for the 14 hours we’re standing in the middle of a street somewhere.“But it’s also scary because you need to feel like you’ve made a little family for that brief amount of time. So the minute someone gets fired, you’re like, oh wait, this is a big business, this is serious, this is millions of dollars being spent.”View image in fullscreenLea Thompson and Michael J Fox in Back to the Future.Photograph: Universal/AllstarStoltz was replaced by the young Canadian actorMichael J Fox, whom Zemeckis and Gale had wanted in the first place, and several scenes had to be reshot. Fox was simultaneously working on the sitcom Family Ties so was often sleep-deprived. But his boundless charm, frazzled energy and comic timing – including ad libs – were the missing piece of the jigsaw.Thompson comments: “He is gifted but he also worked extremely hard at his shtick like the great comedians of the 20s, 30s and 40s: the falling over, the double take, the spit take, the physical comedy, the working on a bit for hours and hours like the greats, likeLaurel and Hardyand Charlie Chaplin. Michael understood that.“Being a dancer, I was fascinated and kind of weirdly repelled because it didn’t seem like the acting that we were all trying to emulate: the De Niro kind of super reality-based acting that we were in awe of in the 80s, coming out of the great films of the 70s. I feel like Eric Stoltz, who is a brilliant actor, was trying to do more of that. Michael was the face of this new acting, especially comedy acting, which was in a way a throwback and a different energy.”It was this lightness of touch that enabled Fox and Thompson to carry off moments that might otherwise have seemed weird, disturbing and oedipal. When 1950s Lorraine – who has no idea that Marty is her future son – eventually kisses him inside a car, she reports that it is like “kissing my brother” and the romantic tension dissolves, much to the audience’s relief.‘What century are we in?’: Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson talk Back to the Future at 30Read moreThompson says: “It was a difficult part and it was a very dangerous thread to put through a needle.I have to fall out of love with him just by kissing him and I remember Bob Zemeckis obsessing about that moment. It was also a hard shot to get because it was a vintage car and they couldn’t take it apart. Bob was also worried about the moment when I had to fall back in love with George [Marty’s father] after he punches Biff.“For those moments to be so important is part of the beauty of the movie. These are ‘small’ people; these are not ‘great’ people; they’re not doing ‘great’ things. These are people who live in a little tiny house in Hill Valley and to make the moments of falling out of love and falling in love so beautiful with that incredible score is fascinating.”Back to the Future was the biggest hit of the year, grossing more than $200m in the US and entering the cultural mainstream. When Doc asks Marty who is president in 1985, Marty replies Ronald Reagan and Brown says in disbelief: “Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who’s vice-president? Jerry Lewis?” Reagan,a voracious film viewer, was so amused by the joke that he made the projectionist stop and rewind it. He went on to namecheck the film and quote its line, “Where we’re going, we don’t need roads,” in his 1986State of the Union address.Thompson, whose daughters are the actorsMadelyn DeutchandZoey Deutch, was amazed by Back to the Future’s success. “But when I look at the movie, I do understand the happy accident of why it’s become the movie it’s become to generation after generation. The themes are powerful. The execution was amazing. The casting was great. The idea was brilliant. It was a perfect script. Those things don’t come together usually.”And if she had her own time machine, where would she go? “If I could be a man, I might go back to Shakespeare but as a woman you don’t want to go anywhere in time. Time has been hard on women. So for me, whenever I’m asked this question, it’s not a lighthearted answer. I can only give you a political answer.”The film ends with Doc whisking Marty and girlfriend Jennifer into the DeLorean and taking off into the sky. But Gale points out that the message “to be continued” was added only for the home video release, as a way to announce a sequel, rather than being in the original theatrical run.Back to the Future Part II, part of which takes place in 2015, brought back most of the main characters including the villain Biff Tannen, who becomes a successful businessman who opens a 27-storey casino and uses his money to gain political influence. Many viewers have drawna comparison with Donald Trump.View image in fullscreenRobert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J Fox, Neil Canton and Steven Spielberg on the set of Back to the Future.Photograph: Amblin Entertainment/Universal Pictures/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockGale explains: “Biff in the first movie is not based on Donald Trump; Biff is just an archetype bully. When Biff owns a casino, there was a Trump influence in that, absolutely. Trump had to put his name on all of his hotels and his casinos and that’s what Biff does too.“But when people say, oh, Biff was based on Donald Trump, well, no, that wasn’t the inspiration for the character. Everybody has a bully in their life and that’s who Biff was. There’s nothing that resembles Donald Trump in Biff in Part I.”Back to the Future Part III, in which Marty and Doc and thrown back to the old west, was released in 1990. A year later Fox was diagnosed withParkinson’s diseaseat the age of 29. He went public with his diagnosis in 1998 and became a prominent advocate for research and awareness. He also continued acting, with roles in shows such as The Good Wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm, and in October will publish a Back to the Future memoir entitledFuture Boy.Thompson, whose brothers both have Parkinson’s, sees Fox twice a year.“He’s endlessly inspiring. He’s very smart and he’s done the spiritual work, the psychological work on himself to not be bitter about something awful happening to him but also be honest: this sucks.”‘I hate it. It sucks. But it didn’t defeat me’: Michael J Fox on pity, Parkinson’s – and a potential cureRead moreTime’s arrow moves in one direction but Back to the Future found a way to stage a comeback. One night after seeing the Mel Brooks musical The Producers in New York, Zemeckis’s wife Leslie suggested that Back to the Future would make a good musical. Gale duly wrote the book and was a producer of the show, whichpremiered in Manchester in 2020and has since played in London, New York and around the world.Gale says: “It was total euphoria. The first time I saw the dress rehearsal with the DeLorean, before we had an audience, I went out of my mind how great it was, and then to see the audience going completely out of their minds with everything was just such a joyous validation.“I’m so blessed to have a job where I get to make people happy. That’s a great thing to be able to do and get paid for that. I don’t ever take any of this for granted. I’m having a great time and the idea that Back to the Future is still with us after all these years, as popular as it ever was, is a blessing. I think about it all the time that if we had not put Michael J Fox in the movie, you and I probably wouldn’t even be having this conversation right now.”Why, indeed, are westill talking about Back to the Futurefour decades later? “Every person in the world wonders, how did I get here, how did my parents meet? The idea that your parents were once children is staggering when you realise it when you’re about seven or eight years old.“Your parents are these godlike creatures, and they’re always saying, well, when I was your age, and you’re going, what are they talking about, how could they have ever been my age?

My mom, before she was married, was a professional musician, a violinist, and she had a nightclub act in St Louis called Maxine and Her Men.

Strawberries’Rich PelleyAs the writer and actor unveils his new detective show Bookish, he sits down for a chat about famous sleuths, the odds of a return to Royston Vasey and what it’s like working with Tom CruiseThu 3 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareMark Gatiss arrived on our screens playing a variety of grotesques in The League of Gentlemen: mysterious butcher Hilary Briss; palm-reader Mama Lazarou; the buck-toothed, mullet-sporting job-seeker Mickey Michaels; and many more. He co-founded and co-wrote the BBC comedy with Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson after meeting them at college, and has teamed up with Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat to write and cameo in numerous episodes of the Time Lord drama, before the pair created the smash-hit update of Sherlock, in which Gatiss also appeared as Holmes’s brother Mycroft, and another BBC series, Dracula. If that weren’t enough, Gatiss has also popped up in Game of Thrones, Operation Mincemeat and the last two Mission: Impossible films.Now he’s back in a new detective drama Bookish, in which he plays a crime-solving book emporium owner. We caught up to chat about why he loves the 1940s; whether there will be moreSherlock, Dracula or League of Gentlemen; and what he’d like to do with Tom Cruise.Hi, Mark. You’ve got a new show – Bookish – about a closeted bookshop owner in postwar London, who has a passion for solving crimes in his spare time. Do you secretly wish you were a postwar bookshop owner who solves crimes in his spare time?I take issue with closeted, because he is not closeted. He just has to be careful. He lives in a lavender marriage with his best friend, Trottie [played by Polly Walker from Bridgerton]. They’ve been married for 10 years; it’s an arrangement, so he’s not closeted in the traditional sense …As Gore Vidal said about people who weaponise nostalgia: “I have one word for you: dentistry.” Part of the problem with the world we live in is that people get their impression of the second world war from watching The Great Escape on Christmas Day. They’ve forgotten it was fucking horrible. But postwar is one of my favourite periods, because it’s rarely examined but gave rise to the foundations of the welfare state and the NHS. It was a time of great hope, but also great disappointment. Somewhere in there, I think, is something very interesting. The 1940s were also a fabulous time for British cinema, with Powell and Pressburger. But to answer the question: no, I wouldn’t want to live there: people were starving and the country was utterly bankrupt. But it would be interesting to visit.Detectives tend to be quitememorable individuals: from Sherlock and Poirot to, erm, Cagney and Lacey. What makes Gabriel Book unique?As a student of the genre, I’m very aware that every detective needs a “thing”. Sherlock Holmes is the paradigm, and Agatha Christie explicitly draws lines from him to create Poirot. To me, the greatest one in terms of an original idea is Miss Marple, who solves everything on a microcosmic level. A lot of that was in my head when the title popped in there: Bookish. What if he was an amateur detective bookseller and basically his shop is like an analogue computer? The answer is in there somewhere.Book is able to work with the police solving crimes because he has a special letter from Winston Churchill. Wouldn’tthe Doctor’s psychic paper – which canmagicallydisplay whatever credentialshe needs – be more useful?Doctor Whowriter Russell T Davies was asking me about Bookish. I said: “I’ve shamelessly lifted the psychic paper because the letter does exactly the same job!” All my character has to do is pat his breast pocket wherein lies the letter. Otherwise, you’d have to have endless dreary scenes of filling out forms.Your character in Bookish, who owns a bookshop, is called Gabriel Book. Erm, aren’t you supposed to be one of the greatest TV writers of our generation?It’s called nominative determinism. What’s wrong with that?We’ve previously known you best for The Leagueof Gentlemen, Sherlock and Dracula. Which is most likely to make a comeback? Or could you do a mixture ofall three at once?We all spent years answering the question, “Will The League of Gentlemen finally come back?” Before we did our specials in 2017, for a brief amazing moment, we were able to say: “Yes. The League of Gentlemeniscoming back!” Then as soon as the specials had gone out, people would ask: “Is The League of Gentlemen coming back again?” You get about five seconds of air before the question comes round again.View image in fullscreenStreets ahead … Gatiss and Polly Walker on the set of Bookish.Photograph: UKTVIt would have been brilliant to do a spin-off to Psychoville [written by and starring Shearsmith and Pemberton] within Inside No 9 with [Psychoville characters] David and Maureen. When I was a kid, I loved Star Trek as well as Doctor Who. There’s a very strange episode of Star Trek with an alien called Gary Seven. He has a shape-shifting cat who turns into this beautiful woman. I’ve only since realised that [Star Trek creator] Gene Roddenberry was trying to pilot another show within his existing show. That’s how you do it.So we could see Dracula turning up on Sherlock? Or vice versa?Wedidhave an idea for a second Dracula, but when you watch the Hammer films, they’re really just remakes of various parts of the novel. It’s a bit like Robin Hood, in that there’s really only one story. If the BBC had asked us, we would’ve written more of a Trumpian sequel, where Dracula says: “I’m a vampire, but people don’t care … ”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Steven [Moffat] and I have had an idea for a film. We pitched it to Ben [Cumberbatch, who plays Sherlock] and Martin [Freeman, who plays Watson] during lockdown, just as an excuse to have a video call and talk to someone. But it never happened.What does Benedict Cumberbatch smell like?I saw him quite recently at the theatre and he smelled of strawberries.Why don’t you just make a Sherlock but all about Sherlock’s brother Mycroft Holmes, whom you play?We’ve often talked about Professor Challenger, Conan Doyle’s other great creation. There are some great short stories – there’s a brilliant one called The Disintegration Machine – and he’s a brilliant character, but an absolutely awful man. He just hates humanity. He’s a tiny, bad-tempered, nasty but absolutely adorable professor who’s, well, challenging.View image in fullscreenBig brother is watching … Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes in Sherlock.Photograph: BBC/Hartswood FilmsOr you could do a Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and then, right at the end, he pulls off his rubber mask to reveal he’s actually Mycroft Holmes …Sweating and panting!… like in Mission: Impossible. Talking of which – you’re in the new Mission: Impossible! What does Tom Cruise smell like?I’m not sure I can remember, as we shot over two years ago. But I’d imagine: expensive aftershave.‘The show happened by accident’: cult comedy Inside No 9 shuts its doorsRead moreWhat’s Tom Cruise like?He’s a very funny man. He’s there, all the time on set. I’m not in any scenes with him inDead Reckoning Part Onebecause when we meet, Ethan Hunt is wearing a rubber mask pretending to be someone else. But I share scenes with Tom Cruise in The Final Reckoning.If you could re-film any of your previous showsbut with Tom Cruise in the main role, what would happen?Well, I’d love to have Tom Cruise in Bookish.Because … ?This is like one of those questions where, the next day, you see in the paper: “Yeah, I’d love to be James Bond, says Eddie Redmayne,” just because someone has asked him in an interview, “Would you like to be James Bond?” and he’s said, “Why not?” So yes, I’d love Tom Cruise to be in Bookish. Maybe it’ll happen.How about Cruise as Sherlock?I don’t think it’s up his street. Mind you, Robert Downey Jr is a good Holmes, and he’s not a conventional Sherlock, but he’s a brilliant actor. Tom Cruise has already done Interview With the Vampire, so I’m not sure he’d want to play Dracula. Maybe he could play Doctor Who in the big Hollywood version they always thought might happen. He’s done prosthetics before, like when he’s got big fat arms in Tropic Thunder, so I’d like him to play all the characters in The League of Gentlemen. That would stretch him.Bookish is on U&Alibi from 16 July.Explore more on these topicsMark GatissTelevisionThe League of GentlemenSherlockDoctor WhoTV crime dramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

And some of the dialogue: oof!Jack SealeThu 3 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 02.21 EDTShareMorpheus, AKA Dream, AKA the Sandman (Tom Sturridge) might be the immortal overlord of a magical netherworld and the director of all our subconscious visions, but he is not immune to relationship problems. “Ten thousand years ago, I condemned you to hell,” he says to his other half, having sensed that she is annoyed about something. “I think perhaps I should apologise.”Damn right! We’re back in the chilly, clammy grasp of The Sandman, the show that looks at the fantasy genre and says: what if we got rid of nearly all the lush landscapes, epic struggles, pointed political allegories and delicious, disgusting monsters, and replaced them with a moody bloke in a long black coat who goes around annoying everyone in a self-pitying monotone? Season two, part one – the saga concludes with another handful of episodes later this month – sees Dream attempt to grow and atone, questing first to rescue his beloved queen Nada (Deborah Oyelade), who is miffed about the whole 10-millennia-in-hades cock-up.Sorting that mess out requires Dream to negotiate for access with Lucifer herself (Gwendoline Christie, playing Satan as a weary lifer who tires of tormenting), then host a gathering of assorted netherworld freaks and legends in his maddeningly underlit dream castle. After that, he is off to attempt reunions and rapprochements with some of the family members who he has, over the course of eternity, alienated.The Sandmanreally is a curious beast. Where other, similar series centre around a hero warrior, the main guy here is more of an emo worrier, for ever standing stiffly in the shadowy corner of the frame, evading other characters’ gazes as he sulkily delivers platitudes suffused with doom and – quite literally, given the production’s apparent lighting shortage, gloom. The rhombus-jawed Sturridge is physically ideal for the role of Morpheus, with his concave cheeks and a set of eyelashes that could have someone’s eye out. But while his impeccably backcombed barnet and swishy monochrome outfits suggest he is about to break into a chorus ofEcho and the Bunnymen’s The Killing Moonat any moment – someone in the design department enjoys their 1980s pop, because they have also styled Freddie Fox’s Loki to look eerily like Billy Idol – he is, by design, never that entertaining. Even when he is turning Thor’s throbbing hammer to dust or personally granting William Shakespeare creative immortality, what could be fantastic adventures are always shuffled through stroppily as if they are tedious obligations.It just about works as an elaborate analogy for teenage disaffection – a time when you feel as if you’re acquiring some sort of awful power, but everyone becomes angry when you try to wield it, and not knowing why makes you more peevish still. When the show co-opts Greek, Norse and Christian mythologies, though, it doesn’t do much with them. The back half of this batch of episodes concerns Orpheus (Ruairi O’Connor), who in the Sandman universe is Morpheus’s son: after a rote retelling of the myth of Eurydice in the underworld, the show spends time trying to fashion a fresh spin on the tale’s coda – but the suspicion is that this was merely because it involves a talking severed head, which looks cool. A visit to a transgender acquaintance in present-day New York, meanwhile, is a story with an admirable, heartfelt moral that’s undermined by being delivered with zero dramatic subtlety.And: some of the dialogue Sturridge has to say! Oof. As for Morpheus’s appreciation of the power of storytelling – “Tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot” is the sort of non-zinger that would sound flat even if it wasn’t coming from a character who says everything in a depressed gothic whisper. And the dream-shaper’s stint as the caretaker manager of hell ends with him opining: “Hell is heaven’s reflection. They define one another. Without hell, heaven has no meaning.” A million lifetimes spent feeding off the deepest fears and desires of humanity, and he’s still cursed to sound like a failed evangelical preacher’s Instagram posts.The Sandman is not short of ideas, but it smothers them all in a fug of pretension, missing every opportunity it creates for itself. The fact that Morpheus has the ability to access humans’ dreams – to mould them and make them real – barely features. Even the comic relief of a sarcastic talking dog offers little respite: they got Steve Coogan to do the voice, but the real challenge for him would have been behind the scenes, pretending the lines he was given were funny.The Sandman is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNeil GaimanreviewsShareReuse this content"

(Period) review – a smart, funny return to her hedonistic hot-mess persona(Kesha Records)After a long legal battle, the pop star’s sixth album harks back to her 2010s era, with a buffet of pop styles and only rare hints of her highly-publicised traumaAlexis PetridisThu 3 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 11.06 EDTShareKesha Sebert has described her sixth album . (referred to hereafter as Period) as “the first album I’ve made where I felt truly free”. It comes accompanied by a lengthy world tour, advertised by a photo in which the singer expresses her freedom – in what you have to say is a very Kesha-like manner – by riding a jetski while topless. Long-term observers of her turbulent career may note that this doesn’t seem so different from the way she framed her third album, 2017’s Rainbow, which she described at the time as “truly saving my life”, and featured her on the cover naked and was accompanied by a tour called Fuck the World.View image in fullscreenKesha: . (Period)Photograph: APBut it would be remiss to deny her the ability to make a similar point again. Rainbow was released at the height of her legal battle with her former producer “Dr” Luke Gottwald. Kesha had accused him of sexual assault and other allegations, which he denied, resulting in a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Although alternative producers were found to work on Rainbow, she was still legally obliged to release the album – and its two successors – on Gottwald’s Kemosabe label. The tworeached a settlement in 2023, her contract with Kemosabe expired shortly afterwards, and Period is now released on her own label.While Rainbow and its immediate follow-ups regularly mined the legal disputes and resulting trauma for lyrical inspiration – a dramatic shift from the screw-you hedonism that powered her big hits in the early 2010s – Period signals a fresh start by, more or less, bringing back the Kesha who boasted about brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel’s and took to the stage accompanied by dancers dressed as giant penises. Only the piano ballad closer Cathedral seems entirely rooted in recent events – “Life was so lethal … I died in the hell so I could start living again”. Elsewhere, the occasional hint of something dark in the author’s past (“I earned the right to be like this”) is drowned out by the sound of Kesha reverting to type in no uncertain terms: “take me to the sex shop”, “bartender pour me up some damn fluid”, “I like chaos, dripping head to toe”, “gimme gimme gimme all the boys”.And who can blame her? No one wants to be defined by trauma, and she’s doubtless keen to assert that the original Kesha persona was more to do with her than the svengali-like producer who discovered her.Furthermore, it’s a weirdly timely return. In 2010, Kesha’s hot mess persona made her an outlier, albeit an outlier whose debut single TiK ToK sold 14m digital copies worldwide. The critic Simon Reynolds smartly noted that if the era’s predominant female star Lady Gaga saw her work as high-concept art-pop in a lineage that included David Bowie and Roxy Music, Kesha was more like their glam-era rival Alice Cooper. Fifteen years on, we live in a pop world at least partly defined by Charli xcx’s last album. Perpetually half-cut and lusty, open about her messy failings (“I like the bizarre type, the lowlife … God, I love a hopeless bastard,” she sings of her taste in men on Red Flag), Kesha could make a fair claim to be a godmother of Brat. Certainly, you couldn’t accuse her of jumping on a latter-day trend, just as Period’s diversion into vogue-ish country-pop, Yippee-Ki-Yay, seems less craven than it might. Kesha has done past work in that area – from her 2013 Pitbull collaboration Timber to her duet with Dolly Parton on Rainbow.Yippee-Ki-Yay’s country-facing sound sits among a buffet of current pop styles: there’s synthy, 80s-leaning pop-rock you could imagine Taylor Swift singing on Delusional and Too Hard, and mid-tempo disco on Love Forever, while the spectre of hyperpop haunts the warp-speed Boy Crazy and Hudson Mohawke turns up glitchy Auto-Tune-heavy electro on Glow. It’s an album clearly intended to re-establish Kesha at the heart of pop, which means there’s no room for the appealing weirdness of her 2023 single Eat the Acid, and it’s only on the closing Cathedral that her voice really shifts into the full-throttle roar she unleashed covering T Rex’s Children of the Revolution at 2022’s Taylor Hawkins tribute concert.‘I would walk in and just cry for two hours’: Kesha on cats, court cases, and the dangers of ‘toxic positivity’Read moreThat said, the songs are all really strong, filled with smart little twists and drops, and funny, self-referential lines: “You’re on TikTok / I’m the fucking OG.” You get the sense of the massed ranks of collaborators – including everyone from regular Father John Misty foil Jonathan Wilson to Madison Love, who counts Blackpink and Addison Rae among her songwriting clients – really getting behind her to make Period a success. Kesha, meanwhile, plays the part of Kesha 1.0 to perfection: for all the lurid lyrical excesses, it never feels as if she’s trying too hard. And why would it: she’s returning to a role she originated.This week Alexis listened toLathe of Heaven – AuroraCognitive dissonance: Lathe of Heaven look weirdly like a new wave of British heavy metal band, but Aurora’s sound is equal parts smeary shoegazing and epic early 80s synth-pop.

I Found My Smile Again (1996)For an artist no one could describe as prolific, D’Angelo has contributed a surprising number of exclusive songs to films. Good songs too, as evidenced by this, from the Space Jam soundtrack: a fine, funky, faintly Stevie Wonder-ish, mid-tempo example of his initial retro-yet-somehow-modern approach to soul.19. Another Life (2014)Questlovecompared D’Angelo’s third album Black Messiah to the Beach Boys’ Smile. More people heard Sly and the Family Stone’s There’s a Riot Goin’ On in its murky, moody sound, but Another Life was a relatively bright closer, a lovely hybrid of vintage Chicago and Philadelphia soul, decorated with sitar.18. Heaven Must Be Like This (1998)D’Angelo is better known as a songwriter than an interpreter of others’ material, but – quite aside from demonstrating his exquisite taste in vintage soul – his version of the Ohio Players’ 1974 slow jam is magnificent: live-sounding, respectful, but not too cowed by the original to prevent the singer injecting his own identity.View image in fullscreenD’Angelo (front row, centre), with musicians including Pino Palladino (back row, left) and Questlove (back row, centre) in 2000.Photograph: Lionel Flusin/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images17. Alright (1995)D’Angelo’s debut was the album for which the term neosoul was literally invented (as a marketing tool), but it offered more than merely harking back to a golden era. Alright is resolutely a product of the mid-90s – the harmonies are lush, but they’re set against a crackly sampled rhythm and subjected to dub-like echo.16. The Charade (2014)D’Angelo made his love for Prince explicit early on – covering She’s Always in My Hair – and his spirit hangs over The Charade, both melodically and in its hybrid rock-influenced style. But the sound is too smeared, distorted and strange to count as homage; its lyrics about the “systematic maze” of racism are glowering and powerful.15. The Line (2000)D’Angelo’s second album Voodoo took four years to make. Collaborator Questlove described the sessions as a “left of centre Black music renaissance”, but there’s a potent note-to-self quality about The Line’s lyrics, as if D’Angelo is urging himself to get the album done: “I’m gonna stick to my guns, I’m gonna put my finger on the trigger, I’m gonna pull it”.14. Unshaken (2018)The most recent D’Angelo track – released seven years ago! – was brooding, atmospheric and produced by U2 collaborator Daniel Lanois. It’s understated but fabulous, carrying a hint of swampy New Orleans soul in its rhythm. If he can come up with something this good for a video game soundtrack, what might a fourth album sound like?13. Africa (2000)Inspired by the birth of D’Angelo’s son – and co-written with his then-partner, the lateAngie Stone– Africa meditates on fatherhood and Black consciousness. It’s resolute lyrically but low-key, introspective and somehow fragile musically, its electric piano sounding fractured over the rumbling funk of Questlove’s drums. The overall effect is really moving.12. Till It’s Done (Tutu) (2014)The perfect example of what one critic called the “controlled chaos” of Black Messiah with funk so slippery the constituent elements feel as if they’re on the verge of sliding out of sync entirely. D’Angelo laments the state of the world in falsetto: “Tragedy flows unbound and there’s no place to run.”View image in fullscreenUnruffled falsetto … D’Angelo performing in 1996.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images11. One Mo’Gin (2000)The loverman side of Voodoo later gave D’Angelo pause – he was deeply uncomfortable with his sex-symbol status – but it’s pretty irresistible on this cliche-free slow jam. The vocals are reverb-free and mixed forward, as if he’s singingveryclose to you, the music moves drowsily along, the whole thing sounds like it’s dripping with sweat.10. Smooth (1995)From the opening torrent of dextrous jazz guitar to the bumping hip-hop beat (from Chubb Rock’s 1992 track The Big Man) via the meandering keyboard lines that suggest a band jamming live and the fine, but unshowy vocal, Smooth defines the new route for R&B laid out on D’Angelo’s debut. It’s also just agreatsong.9. Sugah Daddy (2014)If Black Messiah is the 21st-century There’s a Riot Goin’ On, maybe Sugah Daddy is its goofy Spaced Cowboy moment, its Princely lubriciousness undercut by its quirky tap-dancing rhythm, sudden key changes and warped swing-era evoking horns and backing vocals. The main piano and bass groove, meanwhile, is utterly, joyfully contagious.8. Devil’s Pie (1998)A collaboration with producer DJ Premier (who originally intended its beat to go to fleetingly famous rapper Canibus), Devil’s Pie is also liberally sprinkled with magic by an uncredited J Dilla. Its attack on hip-hop materialism is stripped-back, bass-heavy and strafed with vintage electronics (sampled from Pierre Henry). Idiosyncratic and marvellous.7. Cruisin’ (1995)Thegreat D’Angelo cover. Smokey Robinson’s original 1979 quiet-storm-classic is an incredible track but this version might be even better: a touch faster, a little more raw, the lush orchestration set over echoey funk. And D’Angelo’s unruffled falsetto may be the best vocal he’s ever recorded.6. Send It On (2000)Around Voodoo’s release, D’Angelo described modern R&B as “a joke”. The ensuing album was his alternative, “the natural progression of soul”, a description that fits Send It On perfectly: over the sample loops and elastic bass, the lovely song at its centre could easily have been sung by Otis Redding or Sam Cooke.5. Lady (1995)When it comes to D’Angelo’s biggest hit, take your pick from the original – a slow jam with a killer bassline courtesy of Raphael Saadiq – or the DJ Premier mix which is more hip-hop facing, with a guest verse from Nas-affiliated rapper AZ. Both are superb, carrying a faint undercurrent of darkness alongside declarations of love.4. Spanish Joint (2000)At the heart of Voodoo’s sound is incredible, virtuosic live-in-the-studio playing by D’Angelo and his fellow Soulquarians. It never sounds more incredible than the intricate, writhing groove of Spanish Joint: constantly shifting, always funky, the perfect backdrop for D’Angelo’s vocals (and the Afrobeat-influenced horns) to glide around.View image in fullscreen‘A faint undercurrent of darkness alongside declarations of love.’Photograph: Gregory Harris3. Really Love (2014)A slow-burning dream of a song, its gorgeous, cyclical melody stunningly orchestrated and decorated with flamenco guitar: an arrangement so imaginative it makes you realise how unimaginative most pop arrangements are. The mush-mouthed vocal adds an odd sense of intimacy, as if you’re hearing D’Angelo singing to himself.2. Untitled (How Does It Feel?) (2000)Untitled’s video was simple – a naked D’Angelo singing direct to camera – and perhaps too effective. Subsequent attention from female fans disconcerted the singer into derailing his own career. But the song itself is amazing, a rule-breaking Prince-inspired bedroom ballad that slowly builds to an astonishing psychedelic climax.1. Brown Sugar (1995)D’Angelo’s catalogue might be slender, but it’s rich, so much so that it feels almost unfair to pick his debut single as his best song. Doing so doesn’t imply that it was all downhill from there – all of his albums are equally good – but there’s no getting around the fact that Brown Sugar is a spectacularly great track. An ode to marijuana disguised as a love song, you could work out the real meaning just from its heady sound – like mid-70s Roy Ayers in a fog of smoke, plus snapping beats, ultra-cool organ, disorientating murmuring voices and a vocal with the rhythm of a rapper’s flow.Explore more on these topicsRankedD'AngeloSoulR&BPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lawrence – who goes by his first name only – said he couldn’t speak to any old bandmates. Furthermore, there could be no anecdotes or use of the word “just”. Asked what is wrong with “just”, Lawrence tells him: “I just don’t like it.”A simultaneously entertaining and melancholic account of an overlooked musician, Street-Level Superstar depicts the sixtysomething Lawrence as a pallid eccentric who passes his time walking around London, who lives on liquorice and milky tea and is fearful of cheese – “We know that in nature if something smells, it is dangerous to eat.” We learn that Lawrence hasn’t had a girlfriend for years. Reflecting on sex, he says: “I was a two-minute wonder. They’re not missing much.”Yet there is a reason why Hodgkinson, who is also our narrator, chose to spend time trudging the streets with this oddball figure. It’s because he is convinced of Lawrence’s musical genius – as is Lawrence himself – even if the rest of the world appears immune. And while Hodgkinson can’t resist mining his intractability for laughs, his book is underpinned by empathy and a laudable lack of judgment.Most music biographies follow familiar trajectories of failure followed by triumph and redemption. But this is a rare tale of a promising career undermined by bad luck, self-sabotage and the fruitless quest for a hit. The audiobook also includes a wonderfully warm Q&A between author and subject, where Lawrence reflects on his fantasy as a youth that he was living in the film of his life.Available via Nine Eight Books, 10hr 44 minFurther listeningRomantic ComedyCurtis Sittenfeld, Penguin Audio, 9hr 5minSally, a divorced comedy writer practised in skewering celebrities, catches the eye of a pop star who is known for only dating models.

Under his stewardship, Condé’s roster of glossy publications – titles such as Vogue, GQ and Glamour – broadened to include Architectural Digest, a revived Vanity Fair and the New Yorker. Newhouse spent big in pursuit of clout, and his company’s extravagant approach to expenses became the stuff of legend. Condé positioned itself as a gatekeeper of high-end living but, as Michael Grynbaum explains in Empire of the Elite, its success in the 80s and 90s was down to its willingness to embrace “low” culture.Condé brought pop stars, television personalities and tabloid intrigue into the highbrow fold, reconstituting cultural capital to fit the sensibilities of an emerging yuppie class with little interest in ballet or opera. Several moments stand out, in retrospect: GQ’s 1984 profile of Donald Trump, which paved the way for The Art of the Deal; Madonna’s 1989 debut on the cover of Vogue; and the New Yorker’s coverage of the OJ Simpson trial in 1994. Tina Brown, appointed editor of the New Yorker in 1992 after a decade at Vanity Fair, said she wanted “to make the sexy serious and the serious sexy”. Purists bemoaned what they saw as a slide into vulgar sensationalism, but Grynbaum maintains Brown “wasn’t so much dumbing down the New Yorker as expanding the universe to which it applied its smarts”.One journalist believes she missed out on an editorship because she gauchely ate asparagus with cutlery rather than by handThat expansiveness was key to Condé’s mission, and it succeeded so comprehensively that today we take it for granted. Anna Wintour’s Vogue would “elevate the idea of street-style fashion, and presage the industry of stylists and celebrity brand ambassadors that have come to dominate lifestyle media”, and GQ’s preppy, “proto-Patrick Bateman materialism” popularised “the metrosexuality, dandyism and male self-care that have since saturated the culture”.The glory started to fade in the 21st century. The company’s acquisitive ethos looked out of touch after the 2008 crash (“Condé’s metier was privilege, and privilege had become a dirty word”), and its underwhelming record on race came under scrutiny with the advent of Black Lives Matter. Social media democratised the means of cultural curation, undercutting the authority of established taste-makers. The book ends on a wistful note as Grynbaum contemplates the decline of print media, and the end of an era of plenty.A similar sentiment is expressed in the poignant title of a recent memoir by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter,When the Going Was Good. Like Brown’sThe Vanity Fair Diaries(2017) before it, Carter’s memoir offers a vivid, first-hand glimpse of the Condé social whirl. Both books have been praised for their anecdotal brio, and criticised for their namedropping smugness. It’s a trade-off. Conversely, Empire of the Elite is a sober affair – an unflustered, chronological account of half a century’s comings-and-goings – but has the merit of relative objectivity. The author, a correspondent by trade, keeps his focus on events and his opinions largely to himself; he neither grates nor delights.Gossip junkies and vicarious bon vivants will have more fun with Carter, but Empire of the Elite is a lucid introduction to this rarefied milieu and the people who inhabited it. It sounds like an exhausting world to navigate, “a land of unspoken codes … The proper knotting of an ascot; the angle of a tie bar; how you dressed, how you spoke, where you went, who you knew – these considerations mattered deeply.” Grynbaum quotes one journalist who believes she missed out on an editorship because, during the interview lunch, she gauchely ate asparagus with cutlery rather than by hand.Tellingly, several of the key players in the Condé story were outsiders: Newhouse, who was Jewish, felt excluded from the Waspy top echelons of US society; Alex Liberman, the veteran editorial director who took Newhouse under his wing and schooled him in urbanity, had been a refugee from Soviet Russia; Carter was a pilot’s son from Toronto. These arrivistes understood status anxiety, and astutely monetised it, offering readers an empowering sense of in-group membership for the modest price of a magazine subscription. And, because the United States is a nation built on clambering ambition, it worked.Empire of the Elite: Inside Condé Nast, the Media Dynasty That Reshaped the World by Michael M Grynbaum is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

Over and Over (and Over Again) is set in a club, to a soundtrack of house, drum’n’bass and dubstep, but it’s not exactly a feelgood bop-along, it’s more nuanced, more thoughtful and a bit less fun than that.Candoco are a long-running integrated company with disabled and non-disabled dancers. We’re told at the outset that anyone can take a break when they need to and that means the audience and also the dancers, especially one who is currently dealing with pain. This is not a forum for pushing through pain, they say. Like so many things Candoco have done, that’s a quietly revolutionary statement, when pushing through pain is usually seen as a given for dancers.View image in fullscreen‘Rest as an act of resistance’ … Annie Edwards in Over and Over (and Over Again).Photograph: Hugo GlendinningThroughout the show, parallels are drawn between the life of the club and the lives of the performers, with projected titles: struggle, desire, solidarity. There’s a section labelled “chill-out”, with the dancers all cuddled together on a beanbag and a definition flashes up on the backdrop: “rest as an act of resistance”. There is a lot of gentle resistance happening here, resistance to expectations, the sense of doing things on your own terms. Often there’s not that much happening at all. The dancing feels as much for the dancers as the audience, although there’s pleasure watching Annie Edwards as the beats of the music pulse around her body, or the wild streak of the always excellent Temitope Ajose.The show doesn’t quite work as a rousing call to the dancefloor, but it has some stand-out scenes, such as Maiya Leeke becoming a human disco ball as the spotlight reflects off her mirrored top, arms flung wide, soaking up the vocalist’s insistent lyric: “I want to feel everything!” It captures that paradox of the dancefloor, when you’re completely in your body, in the moment, yet melted into the music, the self having dissolved. When the lights in the club come up, one lone dancer is left behind. James Olivo warms up into a churning, exploratory solo that finally digs deep. It’s a real moment of finding yourself on the dancefloor, with not a disco light in sight.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 4 JulyExplore more on these topicsDanceCandoco Dance CompanyClub cultureDisabilityTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

As they reunite, here are their finest appearancesMichael HoganThu 3 Jul 2025 05.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 05.17 EDTShareThe music. The merch. The mad-for-it media coverage. What’s the story? Well, you’d have to be a caveman with his Stone Island parka hood up not to have noticed thatOasisare back.Estranged brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher have finally ended their insults-flying feud, buried theBritpophatchet and got their era-defining band back together. This Friday, the siblings will take to the stage together for the first time in 16 years. Their feverishly awaited reunion tour kicks off in Cardiff, before swaggering off on a sold-out, 41-date world tour.What better excuse for a celebration of the group’s best ever TV appearances? From chaotic interviews to classic performances, tragic vigils to comedy moments, we rewind 12 times that Oasis rocked our screens and raised our bushy eyebrows. Let’s have it!In the beginning was The Word(March 1994)View image in fullscreenOasis on The Word.Photograph: Channel 4Introduced by presenter Mark Lamarr – nowthere’sa blast from the past – the band made their swaggeringly confident TV debut on Channel 4’s post-pub yoof TV fixture, The Word. Liam kept his coat on and wielded a Super 8 camera during an electrifying rendition of Supersonic, which made the nation sit up and take notice. At the after-show party, Noel ripped the piss out of every Londoner he met, while Liam took a dancer back to his hotel. Oasis had arrived.Mud for it (June 1995)The band madetheir Glastonbury debut the previous year, when Liam strode on to the NME stage and asked the crowd: “Are you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?” After a stratospheric ascent, they returned to Worthy Farm 12 months later as Pyramid headliners. This was the infamous year when Liam partied with an off-the-leash Robbie Williams, who appeared on stage during Shakermaker and hailed the weekend as “the start of my new life”. Noel was less kind, dismissing his brother’s new mate as “the fat dancer from Take That”. A typically pugilistic set saw Liam challenge the front row to a fight. With Pulp headlining the next night, this was peak Britpop.I’m outta mime(August 1995)View image in fullscreenNoel Gallagher mimes on Top of the Pops.Photograph: BBCThe infamous “battle of Britpop” erupted when arch-rivals Blur moved their single Country House’s release to the same day Oasis launched Roll With It. The subsequent chart battle became headline news, but Oasis didn’t take the hype entirely seriously. When the band were forced to mime on Top of the Pops, the Gallaghers mockingly switched roles. Liam pretended to play guitar as Noel half-heartedly lip-synced lead vocals, while shaking his brother’s trademark tambourine. Bandmates Guigsy and Bonehead found it hilarious when Liam faked the guitar solo.Confidence is a preference (February 1996)At the height of their feud with Blur, Oasis got one up on their rivals by scooping a hat-trick of gongs at the Brit awards. During a typically chaotic acceptance speech, Liam and Noel taunted Damon Albarn and co with a karaoke version of Parklife, singing “Marmite” and “Shitelife” over the chorus. Liam told host Chris Evans that he wasn’t hard enough to remove them from the stage, before miming shoving the trophy up his backside. You don’t get that at the Oscars.MTV unloved (August 1996)View image in fullscreenNoel Gallagher performs on MTV Unplugged.Photograph: MTVRiding high after their landmark Knebworth gigs,Oasis were due to play a pared-down acoustic set for MTV Unplugged. Liam pulled out on the day, citing illness. There were rumours he’d been out on a two-day booze bender and his brother claimed he’d turned up to rehearsals “absolutely shit-faced”. Noel announced on stage: “Liam ain’t gonna be with us because he’s got a sore throat, so you’re stuck with the ugly four.” Their 12-song set, with Noel singing his own lyrics, turned into a triumph. A miraculously recovered Liam watched from the balcony, swigging beer, slow hand-clapping and heckling, while Noel told him to “shut up”. The New York Times described it as “the entire Shakespearean rivalry of the Gallaghers, condensed into a single performance”.Kevin & Perry go mad for it (January 1997)On Harry Enfield and Chums, Kevin the Teenager was paid a visit by best mate Perry (Kathy Burke), just back from a trip to Manchester where he’d fallen under the influence of a certain band. He monkey-walked into the kitchen in a sheepskin coat and John Lennon sunglasses, swigging from a bottle of Oasis fruit drink (see what they did there?). “Result, sorted, top, mad for it,” said Perry, before promising to “Beat up a couple of cockney bastards.” To this day, many can’t see Liam Gallagher without picturing Burke’s impersonation. When the vintage sketch went viral recently, she tweeted: “Very nice to see this doing the rounds again. Lots of requests us to revive Kevin and Perry since the Oasis announcement. It’s not gonna happen. Mainly because I’m now 60 and Harry is 108 but thanks ever so for the love.”Rock’n’Royle stars (September 1998)When Noel was approached about using an Oasis song as the theme for a sitcom about a working-class Manchester family, he suggested Married With Children from Definitely Maybe. He was confused when the more melancholic Half the World Away, originally a B-side, was picked by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash instead. When he watched the BBC gem for the first time, it all made sense. Noel now says he doesn’t think of Half the World Away as an Oasis song but rather as The Royle Family theme tune. When Aherne died in 2016, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds paid tribute by adding it to their live sets.Mum might say(February 2000)Noel was in the middle of a CD:UK chat with the fresh-faced Ant and Dec when his phone rang. Seeing it was his mother, Peggy, he answered the call and told her: “All right, Mam. I’m on the telly with Ant and Dec.” He then passed the phone to Dec, saying: “It’s my mum. Do you want to say hello to her?” Dec advised Peggy to set her video for Saturday morning. When she asked after Ant, he joked: “He’s here next to us, looking as ugly as ever.” Noel took the phone back and said goodbye to his mum, before resuming the interview. Well played, son.Mourning glory(May 2017)In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing, Oasis ballad Don’t Look Back in Anger became the city’s unofficial anthem. As a crowd gathered in St Ann’s Square and observed a minute’s silence for the 22 people killed, one woman spontaneously began singing it solo. Gradually hundreds of mourners joined in. The singer, Lydia Bernsmeier-Rullow, said the moment “gave her shivers”. Noel happened to be watching the TV news, admitting he felt a mixture of grief, pride and awe at the power of music to bring people together.Definitely my tea (September 2017)BBC Three docuseries Backstage Pass followed Liam as he headed to Lollapalooza in Paris to play a solo set. It went viral whenhe made a cuppa backstage,in the process drawing an analogy for the decline of the music industry. “Money’s too tight to mention, so I gotta do it myself,” he grumbled in a kitchenette. “Nobody buys records these days. In the 90s, I had about four people doing it. A little geezer’s doing the kettle. Our kid. Some other little cunt doing that. And some other little fucking idiot doing that. Nowadays you’ve got to do it yourself because these fucking little smartarses download tunes for nish. And they wonder why there’s no real rock’n’roll stars around any more.” Pass the biscuits.Bacon roll with it (November 2020)The Gallaghers’ encounters with Jonathan Ross were always entertaining. But our prize goes to Wossy’s 2020 interview with the younger sibling, quizzing Liam on his provocative quotes to see if he could remember who he was insulting. “He looks like a fucking balloon with a Weetabix crushed on top”? Liam guessed Noel. It was, in fact, Wayne Rooney. “I’ve had more fun with a tin of sardines”? That one was Noel. “I got told off for throwing stones at his windows, pissed-up, asking him to chuck down some bacon rolls”? Jamie Oliver. “They look like they’ve got nits and eat lentil soup with their sleeves rolled up.” Yep, Mumford & Sons. “I am a bit of a twat,” concluded Liam with an unrepentant shrug.The Ticketmasterplan(August 2024)When TalkTV anchor David Bull went over to correspondent Caroline Feraday via live video link for a discussion of the upcoming US Presidential election, she was too busy trying to buy Oasis tickets. Tapping away at her laptop and holding her credit card, the multitasking journalist said: “This couldn’t have been worse timing. I’m 36th in the queue, so if I suddenly stop talking, deal with it … I’m in, I’m in. Wait a minute … Talk among yourselves and let me get the tickets.” Feraday stressed that she was a genuine fan, recalling seeing the band at Knebworth. Bull replied: “As lovely as this is, what’s it got to do with American news?”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionOasisBritpopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just beneath the stereo was a Reader’s Digest atlas. “Anytime we put on a record, I’d get out the atlas,” Saunder recalls. “It was like a gateway to the world – a way to dream, explore and let your mind wander.”Decades later, music and maps have come together again, this time in a coffee table book: Maps onVinyl, a world-first survey of the cartographic influence on album sleeve design; an atlas of album cover maps. It’s the book most music fans – and map-makers – never knew they needed.View image in fullscreenMore than 415 records are featured in Maps on Vinyl: An Atlas of Album Cover Maps.Illustration: Damien SaunderSaunder is a cartographer by trade. Formerly director of cartography at National Geographic and head of cartography at Apple (“I can’t talk about what we do there,” he says), he also helped develop a system for “mapping” tennis matches using ball-tracking technology, which in turn led to him working with Grand Slammers including Roger Federer.‘When you use a Walkman all the memories come back’: the people still in love with old techRead moreBut music and album cover design have always been passions. While he was studying typography at the ArtCenter College of Design in the US, a lecturer recommended looking at album covers for inspiration. “That’s when I wondered: have maps influenced album cover design? Turns out, they have – though strangely, it hasn’t been studied in cartographic academia. So, I dove in.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe project became a four-year labour of love: 32,000 words and a collection of more than 415 vinyl records – some of them deeply obscure, some celebrated.Artists with sleeves in the collection include Oasis, Coldplay, Talking Heads, Devo, Bob Marley, XTC, MC5, Queen, New Order, James Brown and Weezer. Others you will not have heard of unless you’re into Belgian speedcore.View image in fullscreenLittle Creatures by Talking Heads features cover art by Howard Finster and design by Tibor Kalman.Photograph: Damien SaunderSome major names in the design and graphics world are there, too: Peter Saville (New Order etc), Curtis McNair (Motown’s in-house designer), Neville Garrick (Bob Marley’s art director), Roger Dean (maker of fantasy worlds for the covers of Yes and Asia LPs) and Pedro Bell (Funkadelic, etc).Saunder collected physical copies of each record and photographed all the sleeves himself. That was one job he grossly underestimated, he says. “I set up a light room in our lounge, photographed each one, made sure the white and black colours appeared as they should, cleaned them, colour-corrected them – three to four tasks per cover … times 415 covers. I pushed through, but I definitely had some moments of doubt.”Then there was the research. Where possible, Saunder tracked down the designer responsible for each sleeve design to ask them how their concept came about and what it means.View image in fullscreenThe Equatorial Stars by Fripp & Eno, with sleeve design by Brian Eno and Hugh O’Donnell.Photograph: Damien SaunderThe selection criteria for the book was strict: no landscape paintings; no satellite photography. “A map had to be an abstraction of a geographic form – real or fictitious – and show spatial relationships. That distinction helped narrow the collection.”While maps are often celebrated for their beauty, they can also contain layers of meaning, says Saunder. “Even the most basic shapes of countries can draw out a lot of feelings – positive and negative.”The reasons for using maps on album sleeves vary. Some reflect origins – the country or city a band or artist comes from – while others are more aspirational. Peter Barrett’s sleeve design for the UK pressing of Madonna’s 1983 album Borderline, featuring conjoined maps of New York and London, speaks of a star about to make it in the UK. (“Did Madonna sign off on it? I don’t know,” says Saunder. “Is she into maps?

I didn’t sign up to live in a botanical experimentI’ve lived with my flatmate Cleo for four years now. She wasn’t into plants to begin with. Now she’s obsessed. She’s always cloning plants, trying to grow something new. That would be fine if it was contained to her room, but it’s everywhere. Every surface has something sprouting on it. There are leaves in plastic containers in our living room, small stems in old Gü dessert pots in the bathroom, plants in nursery pots on every kitchen surface.Plants are not the issue. I love plants in our flat – they’re gorgeous. It’s more the constant propagation: the jars, the clippings, the mess …I didn’t sign up to live in a botanical experiment. One time I knocked over a jar with a baby stem in our kitchen while cooking, so I refilled it with fresh water. But Cleo got so mad. She said I’d tipped out the “hormone-rich water” and that I’d slowed down the growing process. But I didn’t know any of this. If she’d placed the plant out of the way, it wouldn’t have happened.I feel like a guest in a trendy houseplant shop – one that never shifts enough plantsI feel like a guest in a trendy houseplant shop – one that doesn’t shift enough plants. Cleo has started listing some on Facebook Marketplace and giving them to friends, but we’re still surrounded. There must be over 40 plants in our flat, and our flat is small.There’s also the mess of repotting. We don’t have a garden so Cleo does everything indoors, and drops soil everywhere. I’ve stepped on perlite barefoot and it hurt. The shower can also become a makeshift bath for Cleo’s plants, and I don’t love the leaves and soil that are often left behind. The sink was also constantly blocked from her rinsing out compost trays. To be fair to Cleo, that doesn’t happen as often since I bought it up.There are good sides to Cleo’s green fingers. I do love having our own herb garden – Cleo makes sure there is always basil and thyme on the windowsill for us to pick. And I love a hanging pothos or orchid as much as the next person. But I need my counter space back.The defence: CleoIt’s not just a hobby, I’ve created an ecosystem of calm in ourcity home. Plus,I make good moneyJade complains about having plant clippings on every surface, but I’d argue she benefits greatly from the oxygen-rich atmosphere I’ve curated. Plants clean the air, reduce anxiety and look lovely. My propagation habit is not just a hobby, it’s an ecosystem of calm in our big-city home.Coming back from work and misting a monstera is so relaxing. Propagating plants is my favourite thing, and I don’t want to stop. It’s grounding. I have asked Jade to water my plants when I’ve been away, and she always says how much she enjoys it, how it helps calm her down. I know she’d miss them if they were gone.A friend said our flat felt like ‘a healing centre’. Jade calls it a jungleYes, sometimes I repot things in the kitchen, but I always clean up after. I don’t always catch every speck of soil, but we have a good hoover, so I vacuum it whenever I see it.I’ve become even more interested in propagating recently, as I’ve realised that I can make a bit of money if I do it properly. People pay a lot for new plants in pristine condition, and it could be a nice little side hustle. So yes, there is a small invasion of jars and plastic boxes on windowsills, but what else do we use the windowsills for? I think it’s a creative use of space. Our landlord said the flat has never looked more lived-in. Last week, a friend said our flat felt like a “healing centre”. That was a big compliment, but Jade calls our flat a jungle.When she poured out the water from one of the jars, I was annoyed, because I was trying to make that plant sprout roots. I’d told her you’re supposed to keep the same water as it is filled with hormones. Jade wasn’t that apologetic and it took longer than usual for that plant to grow.I could ease up on the clippings, but I’m still refining my technique. Also, as it’s summer, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, because now is peak growing time. I only got into propagating earlier this year, so it’s been a bit of a shock for Jade to see how quickly things have expanded.But it won’t be for ever. She just needs to be a little bit more patient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

So-called objective arguments on oxygen and mental health don’t fly if the plants are more of a nuisance than a relief.Maitri, 37Jade no longer feels comfortable in her own home, so it’s clear a line has been crossed. Cleo calls Jade unapologetic, yet seems blase about how her hobby is completely taking over their shared space. They need to establish some ground rules and plant-free zones.Eric, 32I definitely see how Cleo’s green thumb benefits Jade, but Jade didn’t sign up to live in a garden nursery. Perhaps Cleo could look into an allotment and they could agree on a fixed number of plants/cuttings in the flat at any given time.Cesario, 36The reality is the majority of big city flats are humid and stuffy – perfect for plant propagation, but also insects, rodents and mould. A few plants would be fine, but a windowsill full of yogurt pots? If Cleo wants to continue, she needs a more efficient process (a vertical hydroponic system, perhaps), or to keep her plants to her room.Gul, 18Plants are lovely, but when you live in a shared space you can’t commandeer every surface – especially when you’re not cleaning up thoroughly. Cleo needs to keep her hobby to her bedroom – she can invest in a shelf unit and grow light.Sarah, 45Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, should Cleo stem her hobby?The poll closes on Wednesday 9 July at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe askedwhether Georgia should stop kissing her boyfriend after kissing the cat72%said yes – Georgia is guilty28%said no – Georgia is innocentExplore more on these topicsGardening adviceYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Apart from a short period in early adulthood when accommodation didn’t really come with gardening responsibilities, I’ve been mowing my own lawn through the summer months for decades.I’ve managed to sometimes wrap that into my professional work, not as a gardener but as a product reviewer. I’ve tested and written about plenty of lawnmowers in recent years, and have picked up a thing or two about what makes a good one. Few things are quite as satisfying as being paid to test a mower on your own lawn on a sunny Friday afternoon, knowing that you’re simultaneously ticking off one of your weekend chores.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach mower was tested on different height settings.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianA new patio was being laid in my back garden, so when the lawnmowers arrived at the front door, I gazed in despair at the builders’ yard of cement mixers, sand piles and pallets of slabs that were occupying my intended testing zone. Fortunately, the builders moved out as the last mower arrived, leaving a patchy and challenging space on which to test the mowers, with plenty of longer grass in places and bare earth in others.I assigned each mower a zone and tested them first with a relatively high setting to deal with longer grass, then took them down to 40mm or so. I find this is about right for mowing my slightly lumpy lawn without grounding the blade on its undulations.I also tested how long the mowers could run by mounting them on a makeshift rig, bypassing their safety features with a bootlace (don’t try this at home), and timing how long it took for the batteries to expire. I performed a similar test on the chargers to see how long the batteries took to charge. The mower with a cable was plugged into a power meter so I could see how much power it drew from the mains.I also measured how noisy they were with the freeDecibel X appon my smartphone, and noted any special mower features, such as the size of the grass box and how well they cut to the edges.All of the five mowers tested were loaned by the manufacturers, and we expect them to be returned after testing. Any that aren’t collected will be donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best electric lawnmowers in 2025View image in fullscreenRoll up, roll up! The contenders for the best lawnmower title.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBestoverall and best cordless lawnmower:MakitaDLM432PT2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£415 at Alan Wadkins ToolStore£461.70 at AmazonYou’re more likely to know Makita for its power tools than its garden equipment, but this cordless lawnmower slots into the range well, coming with two 18V 5Ah batteries that work in parallel, and a large charging unit that can refill them both at the same time.Why we love itThe best thing about it is the large cutting blade of 43cm. In practical terms, that means you can spend less time mowing, as each time you traverse your lawn, it cuts a wider strip than the other mowers we’ve tested. The downside is that it’s a bit heavier – there’s simply more steel involved.When it came to cutting, the mower powered through the jobs I set it, whether it was the longer grass of an initial first cut, or simply strimming a week’s growth off the top of the lawn. I found it easy to move around, and selecting the cutting height (from 20 to 75mm) was easily done with the clearly labelled lever.The two batteries lasted for more than 57 minutes during my test, which was the longest lasting of all the battery-powered mowers in this group. It only took 51 minutes for the large, fan-cooled charger to take them back to full power.It’s a shame that …the join between the grass box and the rear of the mower is a bit finicky, the manufacturer’s warranty is only a year, and the fan-cooled charger makes a bit of a racket.Cutting width:43cmCutting height:20-75mmWeight:15.6kgGrass capacity:40lCorded/cordless:cordlessBattery life/charge time:57mins 25secs/51mins 44secsSpare batteries available:yesWarranty:one yearBest budget lawnmower:Einhell GC-EM 1600/37View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£130 at Argos£136.95 at B&QIf the other lawnmowers in this group look a bit pricey, it’s worth considering a corded model. Without the added cost of batteries and chargers, corded mowers such as the Einhell GC-EM 1600/37 are much more affordable.Why we love itThe main thing to love about the Einhell GC-EM 1600/37 is its price. It’s half the price of the most affordable battery mower tested here. It doesn’t have the same build quality that you might expect from a more expensive unit, but we can live with that considering the low price.Without batteries to faff about with, the mower is really easy to use. Once you’ve plugged it into an extension lead (which you’ll almost certainly need in any size of garden, despite the included 10m lead), you just press the start button and hold down the cutoff lever. The height of the cut can be adjusted between 20 and 60mm using a sturdy gear-stick-like notched lever, and its large rear wheels make it easy to manoeuvre.I found the quality of the cutting to be absolutely fine, and easily on a par with the cuts I saw from more expensive mowers. It also doesn’t suffer from a drop in power after being used for a time. Battery mowers tend to experience a steady drop in power as their batteries are drained.It’s a shame that …mowing with a trailing cable is trickier than using a cordless model because you have to keep moving the cable around to ensure you don’t mow over it.Cutting width:37cmCutting height:20-60mmWeight:11.8kgGrass capacity:38lCorded/cordless:cordedCable length:10mWarranty:3 yearsThe best secateurs to save you time and effort when pruning your garden, testedRead moreBestvalue cordless lawnmowerand bestfor small gardens:Worx WG737EView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£259.99 at B&Q£259.99 at AmazonThe Worx WG737E is phenomenal value for money. Despite being the most affordable of the battery mowers, there’s little to distinguish the quality of its cutting from its more expensive rivals.Why we love itI was impressed with the Worx WG737E. Although it won’t win any design awards, plenty of thought has gone into its core functionality, including an easy-to-see charge indicator that most rivals haven’t bothered with.Its 37cm cutting blade is smaller than the Makita’s, which makes this more suitable for smaller gardens, though its 40-litre grass box is the same size, so you won’t have to empty it more often. The blade extends out as far as the outer edges of the wheels, so it’s good for cutting right up to the edges of your lawn, and it did a great job at slicing through the grass in my garden.It’s also the only mower in this group that comes with a mulching accessory – a plastic insert that slots into the back of the mower and stops the cut grass from escaping the cutting area. The trimmings are left on the ground and can help feed and nourish the lawn, though you will end up with grass clippings on your shoes if you cross the lawn soon after mowing. Other mowers offer this as an accessory, but this is the only model we tested to come with one in the box.It’s a shame that …batteries took more than four hours to recharge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It has a single arm, hinged from a sturdy metal clip, so getting it from stowed to ready for action can be done in a matter of seconds. Unscrewing the handle bolts on all the others isn’t an enormous chore, but this is markedly better.I also liked the grass collection box because it has a chute that extends out of the box and down into the mower’s internals. When you remove the box, this is already holding all the grass that usually spills out, which normally you’d have to pick up and chuck into the box yourself before carrying it over to the compost.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found the starting process more awkward than on the other mowers, and it didn’t wheel around as smoothly, particularly at the end of a line.Cutting width:37cm;cutting height:20-70mm;weight:16.3kg;grass capacity:40l;corded/cordless:cordless;battery life/charge time:43mins 3secs/2hrs 35mins 26secs;spare batteries available:yes;warranty:5 yearsBosch AdvancedRotak 36V-40-650View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£510 at Argos£439.99 at AmazonBest for:infrequent emptying and a quieter mowWith a 50-litre grass box, the Bosch AdvancedRotak 36V-40-650 offers you the fewest trips to the compost bin, with 25% more grass clipping space than its rivals. It can also leave your grass longer than the others, with an option to leave it at 80mm, though I suspect most people will prefer a shorter cut. When testing the noise levels of the mowers, this was the quietest, only showing 70dB of sound pressure on the Decibel X app, while the noisiest in the group (the Einhell GC-EM 1600/37) measured 78dB.On the downside, it’s also the most expensive of the mowers here. I didn’t get on well with the safety cutoff feature, which uses buttons instead of a bar. There are four of these to choose from, distributed across the handlebar in different locations and at different angles, but they aren’t as easy to keep hold of as the handlebar levers on the other mowers.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive, and I wasn’t fond of the way the handle extends or the cutoff buttons on the handlebar.Cutting width:40cm;cutting height:25-80mm;weight:16.7kg;grass capacity:50l;corded/cordless:cordless;battery life/charge time:55mins 11secs/2hrs 4mins 2secs;spare batteries available:yes;warranty:2 yearsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianWhat are the different types of lawnmower?Broadly speaking, there are two types of lawnmower: cylinder and rotary.Cylinder mowersuse a set of long blades attached to a cylindrical frame, which is rolled over the lawn to slice the top off the grass as it goes.Rotary mowersare now more common and use a rotating blade that spins around underneath the mower, like an upside down helicopter blade, slicing the grass as it goes. Rotary mowers may have wheels to keep them above the grass, or may create a cushion of air underneath them, like a hovercraft. The latter type is known as a hover mower, and is particularly useful if you need to manoeuvre around a lot of tricky areas, such as around trees.Mowers tend to be powered by either petrol or electricity, with the latter using either batteries (cordless) or plugged in to a domestic power supply (corded). The engines on petrol mowers tend to be quite heavy and will often drive the mower forwards as well as spinning the blades. Electric mowers are more likely to save their power for spinning the blades and require the user to push the mower around manually.Howto make your lawnmower last longerPetrol lawnmowers benefit from annual servicing, just like your car. If you’re mechanically minded, you can do this yourself; otherwise, there are plenty of mechanics and mower servicing companies around that will do it for you.All types of mower can benefit from being wiped down with a damp cloth after they’ve mown the lawn to take off any loose clippings, which helps keep the blades rust-free and keeps them from clogging up with dried grass. Take care around the blades, particularly the sharp edges.During the winter, it’s worth having your mower blades sharpened, ready for spring. Check your mower’s manual to see if it can be removed and taken to a high-street sharpener, or get it included in an annual service.Can you rent a lawnmower?Yes. Not everyone needs to own a lawnmower, particularly if you don’t intend to mow that often. Leaving the grass to grow longer and cutting less frequently provides a better environment for wildlife, including pollinating insects. Those with smaller gardens and little space to store bulky machinery can also benefit from renting a mower every now and then.There are plenty of tool hire services, such asHSSandSpeedy Hire, that operate across the country. Most of these nationwide services tend to rent out heavier-duty petrol mowers, best suited to larger gardens and bigger jobs. Prices start at about £35 a day.If you live in the Greater London area, you can rent the Stihl RMA 339 lawnmower fromLibrary of Thingsfor £15 a day and pick it up from a central storage area. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a similar service that operates elsewhere (please let us know if you know of one). If you think you’ll mow the lawn once a week from mid-March to mid-October, which is at least 30 weeks, then it’ll cost £450 for the year. If you haven’t got anywhere to store a mower or are thinking of cutting less frequently, then using a rental service could work to your advantage.For even better value, you could also hire a mower from an owner who lends their equipment out.Fat Llamafacilitates this, taking a cut of the fee for bringing people together. Mowers typically cost about £10/day or £40/week. It operates across the country, though there tends to be more choice and availability in higher-populated areas.Andy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

More times a week than I feel comfortable disclosing here, I’d trundle down to the Tesco Express in Durham to score a bottle ofPlaza Centro proseccofor the sublime price of £5.50 (it’s now a princely £7). While many other wine writers’ careers begin with a unicorn bottle from a relative’s cellar, I’m proud to say that mine started here.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Why am I telling you this? Well, not only did I feel cool sipping my fizz from a plastic flute while my friends drank rum and orange juice mixed and swigged direct from the carton, but I also loved prosecco. Today, however, I’m more indifferent, which is not to say that prosecco has got any worse or changed in any way over time. But I have. When I was an 18-year-old concerned with getting as trollied as possible in the least amount of time and at little cost, I was drawn to sweetness, as many of us are when we’re younger, and most supermarket prosecco is rather sweet – even the confusingly named “extra dry” category allows for 12-17g sugar per litre.Nowadays, however, I crave acidity, salinity and all the punchy savoury flavours I can get. And, fortunately, there is so much Italian sparkling wine out there that isn’t prosecco. Nigh on every region in Italy has its own take. The Trento DOC, which, like prosecco, is in the north-east, producesmetodo classicowines from chardonnay and pinot nero (pinot noir), which are made using the champagne method with a secondary fermentation in the bottle (prosecco, on the other hand, is produced usingthe charmat, or tank, method). They can command fairly high prices, but they can still be had in your local supermercato for far less than champers.Then there’s moscato d’Asti, an off-dry, frizzante wine with a low ABV and a nose that leans towards bouquets of flowers and gentle stone fruit such as peach and apricot. I especially like it in cocktails for which you’d normally use prosecco: pornstar martini, bellini, any spritz you fancy. Franciacorta, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly popular, and also employs the metodo classico makeup of pinot nero and chardonnay. Moving down to Emilia-Romagna, you’ll find the previously-out-of-vogue-but-now-really-quite-cool lambrusco, which takes many forms and colours; the one you’re most likely to find in the UK is a deep currant colour with a vibrant effervescence.

It was the beginning of our second long summer stay in my partner’s grandparents’ house in Gela, a city on the south coast. The previous year had been the first time in many years that the house had been opened up and (thanks to the practical skills of another cousin) made comfortable and pretty much fully functional. Not functional enough, though, to cope with being closed up for another eight months, so when we arrived in 2016 the oven, fridge and washing machine all had problems getting going. So much so that we replaced two of them, but decided to do all we could for the cooker. Also, because it really was and is an extension of my partner’s grandmother Sara, who (I’ve been told) would have hated me turning her into a caricature.We called a man who gave the 1970s cooker a thorough service and, after replacing the gas tubes and valves, gave it the all-clear, while making it plain that this was almost certainly a last reprieve. He left saying that while we should make the most of it, we shouldn’t make too many demands of it. Being June, and in a small house in the middle of an industrial city, demanding things from a gas ring, never mind an oven, was not a priority. So we used the oven only occasionally, and when we did only very early in the day, to make various things, including a few recipes for this column and the first incarnation of this week’s recipe,le scacce ragusane.Typical of Ragusa, which is about 70km from Gela, scacce means squashed, and refers to the way the dough is wrapped and squashed around a rich filling of tomato, onion and cheese. The traditional cheese isragusano, a firm cow’s milk cheese (part of thepastafilatastretched-curd cheese family) made in the provinces of Ragusa and Syracuse, and just as effective and tasty as cheddar, scamorza and provola. There is also no reason you couldn’t add a few anchovies to the tomato mix, too.In much the same way as a pop tart, the filling will be molten hot for quite some time, so leave them to cool a bit before biting into them,orleave to cool completely before stacking and wrapping up in a clean tea towel to take on a picnic. When they are unpacked, they can be eaten whole, Cornish pasty-style, or cut into thick slices.Folded flatbreads with tomato, onion and cheese (scacce)Makes410g dried yeast, or 20g fresh yeast50ml tepid milk1 pinchsugar500g durum wheat or plain flourOlive oilSalt400g ripe tomatoes2 large onions, peeled and sliced1 pinch dried oregano200g ragusano, or cheddar, grated or cut into small cubesStart on the dough by mixing the yeast with the milk and a pinch of sugar, then leave it to wake up for 10 minutes. Add the flour, 220ml water, two tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt, and bring everything together into a soft dough. Knead, then cover and leave to rest for two hours, or until doubled in size.Peel the tomatoes by plunging them first into boiling water for two minutes and then into cold water, so the skins pull away easily. Quarter the tomatoes, scoop out the seeds and cut the flesh into slender arcs.In a pan on a low heat, soften the onions in olive oil with a pinch of salt, then add the tomatoes and oregano, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the mixture is rich and thick.Cut the dough into four equal pieces, then, working on a lightly oiled surface, roll and press each quarter into a roughly 20cm x 30cm rectangle. Spread some of the tomato mix in the centre of each piece and leave clear a border all around the edge – 5cm at the long sides and 2cm at the top and bottom. Sprinkle over a quarter of the cheese, then bring in the long sides to cover the filling. Fold in half like a book, then pinch the top and bottom edges like a pop tart.Lift on to a baking tray, brush with oil and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 40 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool before wrapping.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPastryBakingSnacksPieCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

Is not caring about looks ‘giving up’?If ‘giving up’ doesn’t sit right, try thinking about it as getting something back: time, money, energyEach month, Ask Ugly columnist Jessica DeFinoanswers a reader question about beauty cultureJessica DeFinoThu 3 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 13.43 EDTShareHi Ugly,I recently chatted with a middle-aged co-worker about her friend who is unhappy being single and thinks she should lose weight. As Gen X women growing up in the 1980s, our biggest concern was weight and calorie counting to control it (now we can add wrinkles, yellow teeth and odd body hair to the list).When I (flippantly?) suggested encouraging the friend to accept her body as it is, my co-worker said, “Well she can’t just give up!”Giving up – that’s another thing we Gen X women have always tried to avoid. Like looking at our moms in sweatpants and no makeup and thinking they weren’t trying to be beautiful any more. My question: are there other words to describe acceptance of your looks as they are, at any age, or are we just truly “giving up”?– Gen AcceptanceOne reason talk of “giving up” leaves a bad taste in the mouth, writes psychoanalyst Adam Phillips in his bookOn Giving Up, is that it “is felt to be an ominous foreshadowing of, or reminder of, the ultimate giving up that is suicide, or just the milder version of living a kind of death-in-life”.In other words: your co-worker unconsciously believes that a woman who gives up dieting might as well be dead.Forgive me (and Phillips – and, indirectly, Freud, the father of psychoanalysis) for being dramatic. But I think it’s true! Maybe doubly true when it comes to physical beauty, which has long been framed as less ornamental thanessential, particularly for women and gender non-conforming people. We often think of beauty as a declaration of self, a means of survival, a signifier of societal worth. It increases our economic and social potential. It opens doors and buys grace; it affords access and attention.To fall short of it, conversely, is to edge toward a kind of cultural erasure.Naturally, when one’s appearance is rewarded and/or punished like this, it starts to seem as important as life itself. Or more important. Consider a quote froma 2024 Washington Post storyon the renewed popularity of tanning beds, known to heighten users’ risk of skin cancer: “I’d rather die hot than live ugly.”(A rebuttal, if I may.)This conflation of beauty and life comes up quite a few times in your question, albeit in less extreme terms. You categorize weight loss and stray hairs as some of your “biggest concerns”. You recall worrying about your mother not wearing makeup – which only makes sense if makeup is a symbol of something more. (The will to carry on, maybe?) Your co-worker implies that giving up onthinnessmust mean giving up ondating,which must mean giving up onlove,which, well – why bother going on, then?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should I start dyeing it again?Read moreThis is a bit absurd. (The unconscious is nothing if notirrational!) “The daunting association” of giving up, Phillips writes, “has stopped us being able to think about the milder, more instructive, more promising givings up,” of which there are many.Like giving up on maintaining beauty standards, for example.The pursuit of an unrealistic, often unhealthy and ever-shifting appearance ideal is something that paradoxically “anaesthetizes” us to life, as Phillips might say, even as we think of it as offeringmorelife (or more opportunity). Skipping meals to lose weight can deprive the body of nutrients it needs to function properly. Getting Botox to look younger can“alter the way [the] brain interprets and processes other people’s emotions”. Self-surveilling can train us to prioritize how we look over how we feel.“In order to feel alive one might have to give up, say, one’s habitual tactics and techniques for deadening oneself,” Phillips writes.In this sense, “giving up” is exactly the phrase you’re looking for, Gen Acceptance. Give up, you know,starving. Give up vitamin deficiencies. Give up calorie-counting, step-counting, mirror-staring. Give up sucking in and Spanx-shaped skin indentations. Give up middle-aged men who demand someone do any of the above in exchange for happy hour apps at Applebee’s.More from Jessica DeFino’sAsk Ugly:My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneHow should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?I want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayIf “giving up” still doesn’t sit right, try recontextualizing it as getting something back: time, money, energy, brain space, health –life,one might say.I’m not saying it’s easy. Giving up can prompt “very real suffering”, as Phillips puts it. Quitting involves reassessing what we value, and this can get more painful with age. Maybe that’s why your co-worker is so resistant to the idea of her friend accepting her body as-is. It might force her to ask herself: could she do the same?Shouldshe? If so, what does that say about how she’s lived thus far? Did she waste her one wild and precious existence thinking about dressing-on-the-side salads? Who is she if she’s not thin, or at least trying to be?But if your co-worker isn’t interested in reconsidering her beliefs, I’d give up trying to convince her. Because sometimes, giving up is good.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

But can it always be a get-out-jail-free card?Alaina DemopoulosThu 3 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 13.37 EDTShareDr Melissa Shepard has a problem with managing her time. She had always been a high achiever, making it through medical school to become a psychiatrist and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. But no matter how hard she worked, she struggled with one of life’s simplest expectations: being on time.“I really felt like I could just not crack the code,” Shepard said. “I worried: am I just an asshole? Is that why I’m always late? No matter how hard I wanted to be on time, it was a struggle.”When Shepard learned about time blindness as a symptom of ADHD, which she has, it all clicked. Russell Barkley, a former clinical psychologist and expert on ADHD, coined the term in 1997 to describe what he calls “the serious problem people with ADHD have with governing their behavior relative to time intervals and the passage of time more generally”. Time blindness can be a symptom of ADHD or other conditions such as anxiety or autism spectrum disorder.My hours seem to slip away. How can I manage my time better?Read moreShepard now frequently talks about time blindness and other mental health struggles onTikTok, where she has 1.5m followers. The term has become something of a buzzword in certain corners of the video-sharing app, with some pointing to its legitimacy as a symptom of a medically recognized disorder to explain why they can’t get out of the door in the morning. Others use it to vent about their “chronically late” friends. You know the type: you say “let’s have lunch at 1pm” but make the reservation closer to 2pm, because you’ve learned to factor in their perpetual tardiness.Everyone has their slow days, but some TikTokers argue that people who are habitually 30 or 45 minutes late are claiming time blindness when in reality they’re being inconsiderate. As one person posted in avideoliked over 125,000 times: “I think that being chronically late is a character flaw, and I think that it’s disrespectful across the board … I know people are like, ‘time blindness’ – no, you need to figure out how to be on time for things.”Some people are bad planners. But others, like Shepard, do live with time blindness. “We all sort of have this internal clock that we use to estimate how much time has passed,” Shepard said, “but people with ADHD tend to not have as good of an internal clock.”On social media, those who have time blindness share examples of their inability to gauge how long a task might take. For instance, one womancreateda timetable for waiting for freshly brewed coffee to cool down, so she doesn’t burn herself. (At 30 seconds: “very hot - ouch!” One minute: “Hot but could drink if urgent.” One minute 30 seconds: “Ideal drinking temp.”)Dr David W Goodman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, clarified that time blindness as a symptom of ADHD or other conditions refers to a difficulty with the perception of the passage of time. He said it is different than poor time management, or when someone can successfully perceive how long it takes to do something but fails to plan accordingly. (So-called “time optimists”, or people who constantly underestimate how long it takes to get somewhere or complete a task, fall into the latter category.)The popularity of the phrase does seem to point to the proliferation of “therapy speak”, or how psychobabble has made its way into the mainstream to excuse poor behavior with fancy-sounding clinical explanations. Could “time blindness” be a get-out-of-jail-free card for anyone strolling into work 45 minutes late, toting an iced coffee?According to the Attention Deficit Disorder Association, it is possible for people with ADHD toreceive disability accommodationsat work via the Americans With Disabilities Act, provided they have proper documentation of their condition from a medical provider. Shepard also noted that the rise of remote or flexible work has eased the strain people with time blindness feel, since it eliminates the need for a traditional commute.You have to make a decision: is time blindness an explanation or an excuse?Melissa ShepardStill, one TikTok user sparked a mini-meltdown on the app in 2023 aftersuggestingthat employers should allow for disability accommodations for people with time blindness. “They exist actually!” one user commented. “They’re called watches and clocks and alarms.”On Reddit, professors have voiced frustrations that more universities are allowing students extra time to get to class or submit assignments due to time blindness. “Any student, regardless of ability, who does not learn what they need to do to show up and turn work in, is not prepared for a job in most fields,” onewroteon r/Professors in 2022. “We are setting these students up for failure.”Shepard has written accommodation letters for people with time blindness, but she’ll also work with those patients on strategies to help them be more prompt. Many are common-sense solutions, such as setting alarms in the morning to denote it’s time to start a new task (wake up, brush teeth, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast).Some are less obvious: Shepard said that people with time blindness do better working with old-fashioned, analog clocks that have hands, as it’s easier to physically see the passage of time that way.Goodman said it’s “cloudy” whether or not time blindness constitutes a disability for which someone should get accommodations at work or school. “You really do need to have a formal diagnosis in which that would fit,” he said. “Not just that you didn’t plan or anticipate. You have to make a decision: is time blindness an explanation or an excuse?”Explore more on these topicsMental healthAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderPsychologyHealthTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I thought that my profession was to blame (I work, however unfittingly, in finance) but have come to appreciate that I am sensitive to many kinds of environmental stressors.It has been difficult to navigate the world since the diagnosis. At first I was ecstatic, finding many of my life’s complexities could be easily answered by a natural neurodivergence, but have since found the world to be even more confusing, especially where relationship dynamics are concerned. Some people I have told about my diagnosis have started to baby me slightly. Whereas before the diagnosis I might have struggled along in certain social situations, feeling myself a little bit slow off the mark, or bored, now I am starting to notice a pronounced sense of my “otherness”, which is quite scary.Do you have any advice on how to keep things in proportion after receiving news that can force you to look at life through a completely different lens?I’m a ‘trad wife’ in a happy marriage. How can I get my friends to accept me for who I am? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:What do we learn when we get a diagnosis? You say to a doctor I have experiences A through F. They say, ah, it sounds like you have condition X. And you say interesting, what’s condition X? And they say well one important hallmark of condition X is where you have experiences A through F. A diagnosis can be so helpful and so emancipatory, but it doesn’t necessarily leave us knowing what causes or explains our experiences. In lots of mental health diagnoses, we still don’t know those things. Nor do we learnthat we experience the world a particular way –we already knew that. Much of the force of the discovery is learning that the experience isn’t universal, that medicine has needed to categorise them so they can be helped, explained, accommodated, and so on.Many of us feel the duality you describe after a diagnosis: understood, since we can finally name the patterns, but isolated, since we learn those names at the cost of learning they’re unusual. It feels like good news and bad news at the same time.You mentioned the pronounced sense of otherness. Like being on the outside of a fishbowl looking in.One response is to resist that: othered from whom? Lots of people learn as adults that they’re autistic, or have ADHD, or both; lots of people find new ways of understanding their mental experiences. As a result, there’s a lot more understanding of these things than maybe ever before. That’s not to say you have to take up residence in communities of the literally like-minded. It’s just to say that when you meet new people, it may be that their experiences are not so different to yours. We never know what’s happening in other people’s minds; if it’s otherness we’re worried about we may be in the company of more others than we realise.I just turned 40 and my life is not what I hoped for. How can I make it better for myself? | Leading questionsRead moreAnother response, though, is to allow that feeling of otherness. Similarity is helpful for connection, it’s true. To that extent, it’s frightening to learn that we’re not so similar to others. Thatwillmake some things harder. But similarity isn’t the only way to connect. You can feel reverence, awe, cherishment, for things that aren’t much like you at all. Indeed, being in front of things unlike you can make you more aware of and reverent towards the contrasts in yourself. We feel this all the time with the natural world: lots of people feel deep love for, feel most themselves around, the ocean, the night sky, an animal. It’s not because they seem the same as us.All that is to say: it can be precisely by standing in contrast, and not similarity, that you can simultaneously appreciate what is true of othersandwhat is true of you. There’s a kind of connection available here based on a true vision of each other, not just on being similar.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsNeurodiversityLeading questionsAutismAustralian lifestyleAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take sex toys, Lee Parkinson says. He co-hosts the highly popularTwo Mr Ps in a Pod(Cast)with his brother Adam – they both work in primary schools – and their inboxes are bursting with stories from teachers of X-rated show-and-tells.“You would not believe,” Lee says.“Inundated,” Adam nods. “Honestly, a variety of objects.” There was the child who brought in the Harry Potter wand that wasn’t. “And the kid was like: ‘I tried to get it working but it just kept buzzing.’” Then there was the child whose pretend hearing aid turned out to be a cock ring. And the second world war gas mask that was “a full-on, PVC gimp mask”, Lee adds. Adam, who works as a higher learning teaching assistant, recalls a timewhen one pupil proudly showedhim his end-of-year gift for the class teacher: a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. “He’d taken it off his mum’s nightstand.”The Parkinsons’ latest book, How to Survive the School Year, is a portrait of the alarmingly highrates of embarrassing incidents in the classroom and beyond. Anecdotes sent in by their audience of teachers and parents shows that sports days are a hotspot for comical mishaps. Adam once split his trousers playing football with the kids, and had to deliver his big presentation on behaviour later that day in a pair of rugby shorts.The brothers – I want to call them boys, because all their riffs and ribbing seem to summon their childhood selves to the minature table we are sitting at in Adam’s classroom in Walkden, Greater Manchester – happily bat stories to and fro.In publicity material, Adam is the one who pulls silly faces, while Lee does his best to look sensible but fun. In person, the dynamic is more nuanced. Lee, at 40, is the eldest of three (middle brother Ryan works in sales) and the original Mr P. He coined the name when he launched his ICT (information and communications technology) training business in 2013,which he combines withteaching a Year 4 class part-time at another nearby primary, and a platform to coach teachers in the use of AI to reduce their admin.View image in fullscreenSwings and roundabouts … the teachers are all too aware of the highs and lows of the profession.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianLee very much wears the long trousers, metaphorically and literally. Today he has helped himself to the only adult chair in Adam’s classroom (“He took my teacher’s chair!”). Adam, 36, is wearing shorts, having returned victorious from a tri-golf tournament with his Year 6s – he’s still clutching the trophy – and fidgets in a tiny plastic seat. They’re constantly in competition mode, and still vie for the position of “number one son”. (Lee is now on top, having been awarded an MBE last month.)Adam is known as The Other Mr P, which you’d think might put him at a disadvantage. He blurted it out when he was introducing himself on the very first podcast, and the name stuck.So he othered himself? “I don’t mind, because Lee worked tirelessly for five, six years before we started,” he says. “And this whole thing has led to a life that I never thought possible.”Back in 2018, the Mr Ps were on holiday in Florida, sipping beer in a hot tub after a day in one of the parks, sharing stories from their classrooms. “We were just trying to outdo each other with the most ridiculous thing that’s happened in our schools,” Lee says. “I thought: ‘We should sit down and record these. Do a podcast’.”‘The impact has been profound’: the headteacher bringing play back to the classroomRead moreAdam had never heard of a podcast but later he came up with the name over dinner in Buffalo Wild Wings in Kissimmee, Florida. Lee bought the microphones as soon as they got home, and the podcast took off. During lockdown, it became a sort of communal staffroom for teachers who were estranged from colleagues, working remotely, or supervising the children of key workers. Now Two Mr Ps in a Pod(Cast) has had 7.5m downloads, and in October the brothers take their Let That Be a Lesson … tour to venues from Edinburgh to Exeter.But while their three books (the previous two being Put a Wet Paper Towel On It and This Is Your Own Time You’re Wasting) are full of things going comically wrong, increasingly the Parkinsons receive messages from teachers about things goingseriouslywrong. Burnout, workload and behaviour are the recurrent issues.“The number one reason for teachers leaving the profession is workload,” Lee says. Although he believes “that’s going to get overtaken by behaviour … There is a growing number of cases where teachers and senior leaders are being verbally, or in some cases physically, assaulted by parents. And there’s the online trolling – parents openly being negative about teachers online.”Lee is hyper-alert to attacks on teachers. We meet in the midst of a heatwave and the fan is going full pelt. Lee enters into a tirade against “the person who designed primary schools and decided to make it too cold in winter and the surface of the sun when we get a bit of nice weather. What was the mindset? Why do you want to stitch us up as teachers?” Even summer term, with its fetes and sports days, dupes staff with “a false sense of security”. Truth is, they’re behind on the curriculum having crammed for SATs, an exam which Lee thinks has “no bearing on children’s academic development other than an understanding that life’s not fair and most of the important things in your existence will be decided by idiots like Michael Gove”.He is especially exercised aboutOfsted.“It is, in my opinion, one of the main reasons we’ve got 40,000 teachers leaving the profession a year ... Ofsted say they raise standards and improve lives. Well, they were found to be contributing to the death of a teacher,” Lee says, referring toRuth Perry, the head whose death by suicidewas linked by the coroner to her school’s Ofsted inspection. “So you can’t say they improved lives. She wasn’t the first and she won’t be the last unless things drastically change.”He has had teachers contact him with similar stories. “Why create a framework that makes teachers’ workflow go through the roof exponentially, plunging them into this boiling pot of stress and worry?”View image in fullscreenMain goal … the brothers highlight the increasing stresses that teachers are put under.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianChanges to Ofsted inspections are due to be published in September, butthe proposals have already been met with opposition. “I think they’re not capable of reforming themselves. What we need is a working party of people outside Ofsted, working with Ofsted to make necessary changes.” This sounds like a job he might enjoy. “I’d have a discussion,” he says. “But I don’t think they’d want to hear from me.”Lee didn’t always feel like this. He started teaching in 2007, “straight from uni”. He’d just turned 22. Labour’s Sure Start programme was in full swing. “He loved it,” Adam says. “And I loved the thought of doing what he was doing.” At the time, Adam had been going “from job to job”: Next, Co-op, Iceland, Odeon cinema, six months of data handling atOfsted(“I didn’t know what Ofsted was when I worked there. If I had, I would have messed up all the things!”) and volunteering as a rugby coach in a primary school.One day, his aunt, a children and families officer, asked him to volunteer one-to-one with a child who was struggling with his behaviour, and in isolation out of class. “I struck up a real bond with him. I absolutely fell in love with working in a school.”It’s fair to say that Adam was able to relate. Of the three brothers, he was the one who their parents were always being called in to school to discuss. Mostly for wrestling with other children and making rude gestures. He was diagnosed with ADHD at the end of primary school. “I was medicated through secondary school,” he says. “It helped me massively.” He would take his meds each morning, then button his blazer. “And I’d look in the mirror, because I knew the saying,Looking smart’s halfway to being smart, and I swear I was a different child.”Adam points to Lee, and the empty space between them, which has acquired the identity of their middle brother. “They were a lot more able in terms of the work than I was. And I don’t mind admitting that. I’ve donewell, I think, with what I’ve got – to get to where I am.”“My mum and dad always say, if he’d been the first, they’d never have had another kid,” Lee offers.“Oh, he loves this!” Adam says, feigning indignation – or perhaps not feigning. His legs are bouncing wildly in that tiny chair. In the way of the best family joshing, it’s both good-natured and close to the bone. You get the feeling they can – and often do – go on for hours.“Are they not Mum and Dad’s words?” Lee asks.“MBE! This guy!” Adam shrieks.“I’m just relaying information,” Lee says, leaning back in his teacher chair with a wink.“What was the card you got on Father’s Day for Dad?” Adam says.“From your number one son?”“No! It wasn’t!” Adam’s voice rises in triumph. “It was, ‘Sometimes you just get it right first time.’”For a moment, it seems as if they never left home. They’ve always been close and more alike than Ryan. “We like spicy food. He hates spicy food. We were always drinking blackcurrant squash, but he’d have orange,” Adam says.View image in fullscreen‘Mum and dad always say, if he’d been the first, they’d never have had another kid.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianBoth Mr Ps are parents themselves. Lee has 14-year-old triplets and a 21-year-old stepson. Adam has a daughter, nine, and a six-year-old son.Increasingly, he has posted about his experience as what he calls “a Send dad [special educational needs and disabilities] … Because it took me a long time to accept what the situation was, and learn,” he says. After his son was diagnosed with autism, “I would say I grieved for the life I expected. I worried if he would ever make friends, be invited to parties, or join a sports team.”Adam’s son’s diagnosis has led him to reflect on his own. “Sometimes autism and ADHD really clash.” While his son enjoys being read the same story repeatedly, Adam finds the repetition challenging. “The last thing I ever want to do is not be there for my son and not give him what he needs,” he says. He has started to wonder whether taking “tablets again would help me … relax a bit more. I’m a bit of an overthinker. I do struggle with that.”His son has an education, health and care plan (EHCP) and attends special school, having left mainstream education when the one-to-one care his EHCP legally entitled him to had to be shared with other children who needed support but didn’t have EHCPs.I’m worried my autistic son is going to struggle socially in his new schoolRead moreThe schools minister has recentlyrefused to rule out replacing EHCPs, which have become fraught with problems, since the number has risen by 140% in the past 10 years while councils run deficits. Should they be scrapped? “There’s got to be a legally binding document to ensure children get the education they deserve,” Lee says. “But is the current system working? No. Do education, care and health have to be rolled up or can there be a separate education plan? Are we able to create something that can make mainstream a lot more inclusive?”The Parkinsons speak every day. Do they ever get sick of each other? “He’s like my fifth child,” Lee says. “Adam can be one of the funniest people on the planet. There’s times I think: how do you function as an adult?”“I feel I bring his silly side out,” Adam says. “And at times he brings my serious side out, and we complement each other. But you couldn’t have two me’s because … Well, I wouldn’t know how to plug a mic in.”For all the jokes, they have had days where they’ve gone home and cried. Adam has worked in a number of schools, including in Manchester.“There are days when you’re driving home, thinking, wow, that was a really hard, sad day. I’ve worked with teachers who have been hit or kicked … I’ve had all the children crying. And that’s the saddest thing for me. Because for a lot of children, if they have a tough home life, this is their escape, their solitude.”“We’re faced with the biggest retention crisis we’ve ever seen for what should be the best job in the world,” Lee says. But he wouldn’t recommend teaching to his children. “Your job as a parent is to protect your kids. I feel like the current education system can break people – the expectations put on teachers, where you’re expected to do more with less, and you’re constantly made to feel like a failure, and you’re under this incredible pressure and the sort of compassion fatigue teachers feel, working in a system that no matter what you do, no matter how many hours you dedicate – you are still seeing the system fail some children.”But sometimes a teacher will message them or come up to them – this happened to Adam at the tri-golf tournament earlier – and tell them that the podcast has kept them going, or brought them back to teaching, because, Adam says, “we shine a light on the amazing things and the hilarious things”.“It’s a real privilege to have quite a big impact on a profession that is so special,” Lee says. What they really want is for teaching to be “respected and valued by everyone”.How to Survive the School Year: An Essential Guide for Stressed-Out Grownups is published by HarperCollins (£16.99).

Now I’m confused.DiagnosisMisting is a common practice intended to increase humidity, replicating the rainforest environments from where many of our houseplants originate. While this is beneficial, misting is not a one-spray-fits-all solution.Houseplant clinic: my peace lily’s roots are escapingRead morePrescriptionIf your houseplant thrives in high humidity (such as ferns, calatheas and peace lilies), gently misting its leaves with room-temperature water can promote healthy growth. However, for plants from dry habitats, such as cacti and succulents, misting can lead to problems such as fungal diseases and leaf rot. Instead, to safely increase humidity for only some plants, pebble trays filled with water beneath pots, grouping plants or a humidifier nearby are all excellent ways to increase ambient humidity in a localised way.PreventionTake time to research your plants’ requirements.

Her family just wants her homeDonna Kashanian, 64 and a community service volunteer, arrived in 1978 on a student visa and has no criminal recordMarina DunbarThu 3 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 13.43 EDTShareKaitlynn Milne says her mother is usually always up first thing in the morning, hours before the rest of the family. She enjoys being productive in the quiet hours around sunrise. It’s an especially optimal time to do yard work, when the rest of her New Orleans neighborhood still sleeps and she can count on peacefully completing chores.Gardening and rearranging the shed is how an average morning would go for Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother, wife, home cook, parent-teacher association (PTA) member and lifelong community service volunteer.“She always says: ‘I’ve already done most of my day before y’all even wake up,’ complaining at us,” said Kaitlynn, 32. It was always done with love, she says, as her mother adores taking care of others and would wake up every morning excited to do just that.But the morning of Sunday, 22 June, didn’t go like every other morning. In the early hours, while her husband, Russell Milne, slept inside the house, Kashanian was approached in her yard by plainclothes men who identified themselves as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents.She was quickly arrested without her family being told anything. They only found out after a neighbor who happened to be awake witnessed the arrest and notified them.According to the neighbor, Kashanian was handcuffed before being taken away by multiple agents, details Kashanian herself was later able to confirm to her family. Her arrest involved three unmarked cars, including one that appeared to be a lookout, which her neighbor and family believe had been watching for a moment when Kashanian was outside and alone.“Had the neighbors not walked out at the same time they were pushing her into the car, we would not have known she was taken,” said Russell.Kashanian was able to call her family about an hour later, when she relayed to them what had happened and where she was. Ice officers told her that she was being taken to a holding center in Mississippi, before eventually being transferred back to a detention center in Louisiana. After that Sunday morning call, her husband and daughter didn’t hear from her again until Tuesday.She remains in Ice custody in Basile, Louisiana, despite having no criminal record.The timing of Kashanian’s detention was just hours after US airstrikes in Iran, a move that has coincided with the ramping-up ofdeportations of Iraniansby the Trump administration. It also comes amid a nationwide crackdown by Ice, which has seen tens of thousands of immigrants detained, often by masked agents, plunged many communities into fear and outraged civil liberties advocates.View image in fullscreenDonna Kashanian, at her wedding to Russell Milne.Photograph: Family of Donna KashanianKashanian arrived in the US in 1978 on a student visa and has lived in the country ever since. She later applied for asylum, citing fears of persecution due to her father’s ties to the US-backed Shah of Iran.Her asylum request was ultimately denied, but she was granted a stay of removal on the condition she comply with immigration requirements, a condition her family says she always met. Kashanian was so careful about regularly attending her meetings with immigration officials that she once checked in from South Carolina during Hurricane Katrina.Despite having to juggle constant immigration checks, Kashanian remained devoted to community service work. She volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, helping rebuild homes after Katrina. She worked with Nola Tree Project, a local non-profit that replants trees after disasters. She served on a PTA, volunteering at her daughter’s elementary school, middle school and high school.“She was constantly around,” said Kaitlynn. “She was constantly helping with upkeep of the schools. She was always there, always helping the teachers and custodial staff, anything to be supportive. Everyone knew Kaitlynn’s mom.”She also found the time to become a skilled home cook. HerYouTube channel, titled Mandonna in the Kitchen, is dedicated to sharing her favorite Persian recipes with aspiring cooks.According to her daughter and husband, Kashanian is an optimist who is almost impossible to upset. But there is one thing that never fails to unsettle her, and that’s improperly cooked rice.Mandonna ‘Donna’ Kashanian demonstrating how to properly cook Persian rice on her YouTube channel.Now that she has been moved to a facility in Louisiana, her family has been able to set up a line of communication, speaking to her once a day. But she is given a limited amount of time to call or message, so communication is restricted. She says she has still not been assigned a case worker.“She’s in pretty good spirits,” said Russell. “She’s more worried about us, and about the lack of communication she’s getting about her situation. They’re not really giving her any information, and that’s what’s scary.”Russell and Kaitlynn have been working tirelessly to find legal help, but it has been challenging due in part to the complexity of Donna’s case, with some of her documents seeming to have been lost over decades of changing hands in the immigration offices.View image in fullscreenDonna Kashanian (right) with her husband, Russell, and daughter, Kaitlynn.Photograph: Family of Donna KashanianBut the other big challenge is the limited availability of immigration lawyers. As theTrump administrationhas escalated the number of Ice arrests, there is a shortage of legal counsel for immigrants and their families to go to for help.“We have been on the phone nonstop from 8am to 10pm almost every day the last week trying to find help, and it’s proving difficult because all the immigration lawyers are all dealing with everyone else’s crises as well,” said Kaitlynn. “So far, we haven’t gotten a lot of optimistic responses.”Like her mother, Kaitlynn remains in good spirits despite the constant obstacles, staying focused on helping someone else who currently needs it. But there is one moment in her show of resilience when her voice falters, as she recalls a memory from her childhood when her mother created a French book section in her New Orleans elementary school library.“I had forgotten that until just now,” Kaitlynn said, through tears. “Because there were no French books in the library. She organized that and got it together and painted this little tiny nook.”Russell says the focus currently is just to get his wife out of detention. “We’re working on a grassroots campaign and a letter-writing campaign on her behalf, that will hopefully be able to at least gain her release from the detention center,” he said.“After that, we can move forward with next steps through the immigration offices,” he added. “But right now, just getting her home is the challenge.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationIranTrump administrationUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It can be presented as chiming in with the view of many voters that politics today does not work and that all governments simply do what benefits themselves.The government’s failure to forge a constructive relationship with its backbenchLabourMPs lies at the heart of its need for the last-minute revisions of its proposals, but a recharging of that relationship could well resonate with the electorate.For voters, it is the way that they see their representative that has the most significance. Each MP has the difficult task of balancing their responsibilities to their constituents, their party and their consciences. To accept all this publicly is part and parcel of a democracy and can help rekindle a healthy interest and involvement in the political process.Michael MeadowcroftLeedsYour article refers to a “week of chaos”. While you are right that the progress of the welfare bill has been a “bruising affair”, it is also the very essence of parliamentary democracy that an assertive legislature should amend government proposals for legislation. Rather than deriding the weakness of the government, as with the Brexit saga and the assisted dying bill, should we perhaps be applauding the strength of a parliament which has for too long been controlled by an overpowerful executive?Michael BartletFrome, SomersetYou quote Keir Starmer’s gratitude to “our chief of staff, without whom none of us would be sitting around this cabinet table”. May I, through your pages, remind the prime minister that it wasn’t Morgan McSweeney who put Labour in power, it was the millions of people who voted for Labour candidates last year, and that none of us voted to make the sick and vulnerable worse off.Shareen CampbellSwindon, WiltshireYour editorial (2 July) warns that “the rebellion over Pip is unlikely to be the last such confrontation, especially if Downing Street doesn’t learn the right lessons”. In reality, the government failed to learn the lesson from the smaller rebellion over keeping the Tories’ two-child benefit cap.Seven Labour MPshad the whip removed as a result – including the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell – which suited Keir Starmer’s ongoing assault on leftwing Labour MPs.This time round, however, the rebellion was too big to use the same threat, even though it was rumoured that Morgan McSweeney wanted to make examples of increasing numbers of MPs until the rebellion backed down. When all Keir Starmer and McSweeney have is a hammer to smash the left, every rebel MP looks like Jeremy Corbyn.Derrick CameronStoke-on-TrentJohn Crace may be right in describing Marie Tidball MP as making the speech of the day in the welfare debate (The politics sketch, 1 July). But he is wrong in suggesting that she was the only visibly disabled MP in the house.

However, whether the Glastonbury incident constituted a criminal offence or not, her lumping together of Bob Vylan and Lucy Connolly is a case of intellectual apples and pears.During last year’s riots, people were actually attacking and attempting to burn alive asylum seekers in hotels. No one is in a position to attack theIsraelDefense Forces, who are the ones allegedly committing war crimes – eg burning and blasting people to death in cafes populated by students on the shores of the Mediterranean – and a military force that our own government is still giving arms and intelligence assistance to.But I do take her point about how the criminalisation of these incidents sets 50% of the population against the other 50% – and I’ve probably just proved her point.Desmond HewittMarlborough, WiltshireMarina Hyde is right. If this is still supposed to be a liberal democracy we must be very reluctant to lock people up for what they say, however hateful and offensive we find it. It is tragic that progressives have conceded the cause of free speech to their reactionary rivals, whose insincerity is breathtaking.Jonathan AllumAmersham, BuckinghamshireEphraim Mirvis, the UK’s chief rabbi, said Bob Vylan’s appearance at Glastonbury was a “national shame” (Allies of BBC chief Tim Davie fear latest controversy may damage his leadership, 1 July). I think that the Israeli government’s treatment of the people of Gaza is a national shame for Israel. To echo Owen Jones (1 July), all the people getting aerated over Bob Vylan and not over the senseless, barbaric killing of civilians in Gaza have become detached from reality. Let’s call it what it is – genocide.

Surveys of young people’s attitudes published in the Lancet in2021and2024reveal that this is a material factor in considering whether to have children for between 38% and 52% of respondents.Given that anxiety can either transform into purposeful action or malign and perverse despair if left to fester unaddressed, the curriculum review due to report in the autumn should integrate climate education across all subjects so that all our students understand the nature of the crisis and the debates about what we can do about it.Anything less will leave them stranded with a Holocene education in an Anthropocene world.Paul AtkinNational Education Union Climate Change NetworkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Donkeys suffer at every stage – from capture and transport to brutal slaughter. With China’s donkey population depleted, the industry has turned to other countries in the global south.Despite its scale, this cruel trade remains largely unregulated and invisible, and it is women and girls who suffer most. For many, donkeys are much more than animals – they are co-workers and companions. When a donkey is stolen, household income can fall by 73%. In one Kenyan region, over 90% of women have experienced donkey theft. Children – especially girls – are taken out of school to do the “donkey work”.Every shocking statistic and voice of anguish in our reportStolen Donkeys, Stolen Futuresis evidence that the donkey skin trade is undermining progress towards UN sustainable development goals of gender equality and poverty reduction.It is not only African donkeys that face an existential threat from the skin trade. InBrazil, the donkey population has dropped by 94% in the past 30 years, from 1.37 million in 1996 to around 78,000 in 2025. But there is hope. Legislators in Brazil have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect their donkeys when a bill banning their slaughter goes to its national congress.At thePan-African Donkey Conference in Côte d’Ivoirelast month, leaders across the continent called for coordinated action to protect donkeys and the communities they support. We must remember that this isn’t just about banning the skin trade for the sake of livelihoods – it’s about creating a better world for donkeys. These intelligent, sentient beings deserve respect, compassion and protection.Marianne SteeleCEO, The Donkey Sanctuary, Sidmouth, DevonExplore more on these topicsWomen's rights and gender equalityAnimal welfareAnimalsUnited NationsGlobalisationAfricaBrazillettersShareReuse this content"

Just one is fromSouth Sudan.The supreme court’s order on Thursday came after the court’s conservative majority last month decided that immigration officials can quickly deport people to countries to which they have no connection. That order paused a district judge’s earlier ruling that immigrants being sent to third countries must first be given an opportunity to prove they would face torture, persecution or death if they were sent there.Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the eight men and executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said the eight men could “face perilous conditions, and potentially immediate detention, upon arrival”.Two liberal justices dissented – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – by saying the ruling gives the government special treatment. “What the government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,” Sotomayor wrote.“Today’s order clarifies only one thing: Other litigants must follow the rules, but the administration has the Supreme Court on speed dial,” she added.The Trump administration has been seeking deals with various countries to accept deportees that the US government cannot quickly send back to their homelands.The eight men awaiting deportation to South Sudan have all been convicted of serious crimes, which the Trump administration has emphasized in justifying their banishment. Many had either finished or were close to finishing serving sentences, and had “orders of removal” directing them to leave the US.Some, like Tuan Thanh Phan – who came to the United States from Vietnam as a child and was convicted of killing someone in a gang altercation when he was 18 – had already planned to return to his home country after serving his sentence.Instead, the US government first told these men that they would be deported to SouthAfrica, and they were asked to sign documents acknowledging their deportation. They refused, and their case came before judge Brian E Murphy of the district of Massachusetts, who ruled that the government must provide “written notice” to any immigrant facing deportation to a third country, and give them an opportunity to voice a “reasonable fear” of torture.The men were told instead that they were being deported to South Sudan. The government did not provide Murphy with immediate information about where the men were, and where they were being sent. Eventually, their flight landed in Camp Lemonnier, an American military base in Djibouti.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents worked 12-hour shifts guarding the men. In a sworn court declaration, an official described illness among the detainees and government agents, inadequate medical care, risks of malaria and worry about attacks from militants in Yemen.In May, the Trump administration asked the supreme court to intervene and allow the government to deport the men to South Sudan.They sought agreements with several countries to house immigrants if authorities could not quickly send them back to their homelands.The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationSouth SudanAfricaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The elephant was hit and wounded by the gunshots. The guides were unable to prevent the elephant’s attack and both women died at the scene, police said.It happened at the South Luangwa national park in eastern Zambia, about 600km (370 miles) from the capital, Lusaka.Female elephants are very protective of their calves and can respond aggressively to what they perceive as threats.Last year,two American tourists were killedin separate encounters with elephants in different parts of Zambia.

That includes taking “urgent and effective” actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions based on the best available science, to adapt, to cooperate internationally, and to guard against the threat of climate disinformation.The inquiry was instigated byColombiaand Chile, which in 2023 asked what legal responsibilities states have to tackle climate change and to stop them breaching people’s human rights.The Costa Rica-based court received hundreds of submissions and held a series of hearings last year in Barbados and the Brazilian cities of Brasília and Manaus.EU may allow carbon credits from developing countries to count towards climate goalsRead moreA wide variety of states and regional bodies, academics and civil society groups – as well as individual victims of climate breakdown themselves – were allowed to participate.“The evidence we have seen and received during the hearing and written submissions shows that there is no margin for indifference,” López said.“Success depends on all of us.”The IACHR’s founding purpose is to interpret and apply the American convention on human rights, a treaty ratified by members of the Organization of American States (OAS). But its newly published opinion takes into account a broad range of national, regional and international laws and principles. And it affirms that the findings not just apply only to signatories of the convention but to all 35 members of the OAS, which includes the US and Canada.The court affirmed the right to a healthy environment, and said for the first time that this includes the right to a stable climate.This means states have legal obligations to regulate emissions from public and private organisations.The court says all businesses have a responsibility not to harm human rights but those that have emitted huge volumes of greenhouse gas emissions in the past or present have a particular responsibility “due to the risk created by their activities”. It singles out the exploration, extraction, transportation and processing of fossil fuels, cement manufacturing and agro-industry.States must set tougher requirements for such sectors, it says, suggesting changes to business operating conditions, taxation, contributions to just transition plans and strategies, investment in education, adaptation measures and addressing loss and damage. If companies do not comply, it suggests the polluting activities should stop and states consider demanding compensation for the harm caused to the climate.It adds that states should pass laws so that transnational corporations and conglomerates can be fully held to account for the emissions of their subsidiaries.States also have a duty to ensure a fair transition to a cleaner society, and must ensure that this does not in itself involve breaching human rights, for example, when mining for critical minerals needed for electric vehicles.“This is not just about the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” said Marcella Ribeiro, a senior human rights and environment attorney for the Asociación Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente (Aida), an environmental law organisation that works in Latin America. “This is an opportunity for a structural transformation that will correct historical inequality and protect people and ecosystems.”The IACHR also recognised the rights of nature and states have a duty to restore damage to ecosystems caused by climate change.Luisa Gómez, senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law, said the court made a “critical connection” between the effects of the climate crisis on the rights of people and ecosystems, and how those responsible for guaranteeing those rights should react. “It sends a clear message that impunity in climate matters can no longer be tolerated.”The inter-American court of human rights is the second of four top courts to publish an advisory opinion on climate change.The first court to publish its opinion, the international tribunal for the law of the sea, concluded last year that greenhouse gases are pollutants that are wrecking the marine environment, andstates have a legal responsibility to control them.The international court of justice held hearings on its own opinion last December and is expected to publish in the coming months. Meanwhile, the African court on human and people’s rights has only just begun the process.These documents are technically nonbinding but are considered authoritative because they summarise existing law. And they are expected to be used in future litigation and political negotiations.Viviana Krsticevic, executive director of the Centre for Justice and International Law, a human rights NGO which supported Colombia and Chile’s request for the advisory opinion, said the new opinion gives a “very rich roadmap” for responding to the climate emergency across society, including setting a series of standards for national climate strategies that could be very important for the forthcomingCop30 in Brazil.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentGreenhouse gas emissionsColombiaChileAmericasCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling also barred her from running for any political office.Kirchner, who denied all the charges against her, was sentenced tosix years in prison for corruptionin June. Due to her age, judges granted her house arrest, but with a series of restrictions, including the requirement that all visits be authorised in advance – as was the case with Lula, whose visit was approved by a judge the day before.Shortly after 1pm, Lula, 79, left the residence without speaking to reporters, greeting a few dozen supporters waiting outside before departing for the Brazilian embassy.Kirchner, who claims to have been the target of political persecution,posted photosof the meeting and wrote: “Lula was also persecuted, they also used lawfare to put him in prison, they also tried to silence him. They couldn’t. He returned with the vote of the Brazilian people and his head held high. That’s why today his visit was much more than a personal gesture: it was a political act of solidarity.”Former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández allowed to serve corruption sentence at homeRead moreEarlier in the day, he had formally received the rotating presidency of Mercosur – the regional trade bloc whose full members are Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Bolivia in the process of joining and Venezuela currently suspended – fromMilei.The near-total absence of a relationship between Lula and Milei was summed up in the closing moment of the summit: after shaking hands, Lula moved in for a hug, which Milei only registered belatedly – resulting in a stiff, uncomfortable embrace.The two, whodelivered opposing speechesat the summit and hold conflicting positions on issues ranging from climate change – which Milei denies – to the Israel-Palestine conflict, have never held private talks.Milei has in the past called Lula a “communist” and “corrupt”, and the Brazilian did not attend his inauguration.In 2024, Milei left the Mercosur summit in Paraguay early to travel to Brazil and meet Lula’s main political rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, during a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) event.Within Lula’s circle, the visit to Kirchner was seen both as a response to Milei’s gesture in 2024 and a symbolic act of solidarity, echoing the 580 days Lula spent in prison on corruption charges that were later overturned by the supreme court.While Kirchner never visited Lula in prison, he was visited in 2019 by Alberto Fernández, who went on to win that year’s presidential election with her as his running mate.Explore more on these topicsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaCristina Fernández de KirchnerArgentinaBrazilJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Modi accepted the invitation from therecently appointed prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who has longstanding diplomatic ties with India.India and Trinidad and Tobago share a diplomatic relationship stretching back decades and anchored in the legacy of Indian indentureship.Announcing the decision to honour Modi with the prestigiousOrder of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago(ORTT) during his visit, the government described it as “a tribute of the nation’s appreciation for prime minister Modi’s outstanding contribution to the development of Trinidad and Tobago; and service to the region and wider international community”.But on Wednesday the Anjuman Sunnat-ul-Jamaat Association (ASJA) said it planned to write to the prime minister’s office and the Indian high commission to express concern over the honour being extended to a political leader they say has a widely criticised human rights record.In a statement signed by general secretary Rahimool Hosein, the ASJA said it has “deep and principled concern” about the state’s legitimisation of a figure they believe has emboldened religious intolerance in India and targeted the Muslim minority. “We cannot ignore Mr Modi’s political legacy and its ramifications for Muslim communities globally,” the organisation said.The ASJA referenced the revocation of Kashmir’s special status, and the 2002 Gujarat riots, during which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time, though the Indian supreme courtcleared him of wrongdoing in 2022. The ASJA also pointed to continuingcriticism from international human rights groups.While some Muslim communities and human rights advocates have criticised Modi’s policies, he has also received state honours from several Muslim-majority countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.The ASJA said it welcomed opportunities for interfaith dialogue but were “compelled to clarify that interfaith dialogue requires more than polite diplomacy, it necessitates justice, truth, and accountability”.About 35% to 40% of Trinidad and Tobago’s population is of Indian descent, one of the largest and most prominent Indo-diasporic communities in the Caribbean. Most trace their roots to theapproximately 143,000 indentured workersbrought from India between 1845 and 1917 to work on sugar estates after the abolition of slavery.Leaders from the Indo-Trinidadian Hindu population have welcomed Modi’s visit. “This moment means something profound,” said Dr Devant Maharaj, a former UNC government minister and former executive member of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha (SDMS), Trinidad and Tobago’s largest Hindu organisation.Describing Modi as a “hero”, Maharaj said: “It is not just about politics or diplomacy. It is about the reawakening of a people who were once scattered but never severed. For Indo-Trinidadian Hindus, Modi’s India feels like a karmic realignment – a mother remembering her children, and the children looking homeward with both awe and affirmation.”Under Modi’s leadership, India has sought to deepen ties with the Caribbean. Earlier this year, he visited theoil-rich Caribbean nation of Guyana, where he met with President Mohamed Irfaan Ali and other leaders from theCaribbeanCommunity (Caricom), an intergovernmental organisation of 15 Caribbean nations, at a Caricom-India Summit.Onsocial media, there have been mixed reactions to the visit, with some people supporting diplomatic ties and others questioning the logic behind the ORTT honour.Modi’s trip to Trinidad and Tobago is said to be a part of a broader diplomatic tour spanning Africa and theAmericas. After departing Port of Spain on 4 July, the prime minister will travel to Argentina, Brazil and Namibia.The Guardian has contacted Persad-Bissessar’s office for comment and the Indian high commission in Trinidad and Tobago.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoIndiaAmericasSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

They were confined to metal bunk beds with no mattresses.Ábrego García’s testimony is one of the first detailed insights the world has into the conditions inside Cecot, a megaprison that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people.His lawyers say he lost 31 pounds during his first two weeks of confinement. Later, they write, he and four others were transferred to a different part of the prison “where they were photographed with mattresses and better food–photos that appeared to be staged to document improved conditions”.The filings also note that officials within the prison acknowledged that Ábrego García was not a gang member, and that his tattoos did not indicate a gang affiliation. “Prison officials explicitly acknowledged that plaintiff Ábrego García’s tattoos were not gang-related, telling him ‘your tattoos are fine,’” per the filing, and they kept him in a cell separate from those accused of gang membership.The prison officials, however, threatened to move Ábrego García into a cell with gang members whom officials said “would ‘tear’ him apart”.Cooperating witness against Kilmar Ábrego García to be spared deportationRead moreÁbrego García is currently in federal custody in Nashville. The Trump administration brought him back from El Salvador after initially claiming it was powerless to do so. The US justice department wants him to stand trial onhuman-smuggling charges. The administration has also accused him of being a member of the street gang MS-13, and Donald Trump has claimed that Ábrego García’s tattoos indicate that he belonged to the gang.Ábrego García has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify the administration’s mistake in deporting him after the fact.On Sunday , a Tennessee judge ordered his release while his criminal case plays out, but prosecutors said US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) would take Ábrego García into custody if that were to happen and he would be deported before he was given the chance to stand trial.A justice department lawyer, Jonathan Guynn, also told a federal judge in Maryland that the administration would deport Ábrego García not to El Salvador but to another, third country – contradicting statements from attorney general Pam Bondi that he would be sent to El Salvador.Amid the confusion, Ábrego García’s lawyers requested that their client remain in criminal custody, fearing that if he were released, he would be deported. Upcoming hearings in both Maryland and Tennessee will help decide whether Ábrego García will be able to remain in the US and be released from jail.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaEl SalvadorTrump administrationUS immigrationLaw (US)AmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

All passengers were Indonesian, the transport ministry said.Teams of rescuers, including from the navy and police, were scouring the waters for the missing but their efforts have been hampered by strong currents and winds. Waves reached up to 2 metres (6.5ft) high overnight.So far, 35 survivors have been found, the East Java rescue agency said.Nanang Sigit, the head of Surabaya search and rescue, said: “The condition of this ship is fully submerged, so there is a possibility that there are people inside the ferry. But right now we are focusing on the surface of the water first.”A helicopter and 15 boats were deployed in the search, assisted by local fishers. Many of those rescued were unconscious after being in the rough waters for hours, Rama Samtama Putra, the chief of the Banyuwangi police force, said.Survivors were taken to nearby medical facilities including Jembrana regional hospital in Bali.Supardi, a survivor from the ferry, told Associated Press from hospital: “When the ferry started to tilt, I initially intended to jump into the sea, but the ship quickly sank, so I did not jump any more but sank with the water entering the ship, maybe about 7 metres deep, so I immediately climbed up to the top.”He and three other people grouped together in the water and used lifejackets to say afloat, he said.Another survivor, Eka Toniansyah, told reporters at a Bali hospital the ferry “tilted and immediately sank”. His father died in the disaster, he said.Authorities are investigating the cause of the sinking. Survivors told rescuers there appeared to be a leak in the engine room of the ferry. The Indonesian cabinet secretary, Teddy Indra Wijaya, said the cause was bad weather.The president of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, who was on a trip to Saudi Arabia, ordered an immediate emergency response, Teddy said in a statement.The ship, which departed from East Java province’s Banyuwangi port, sent a distress call at 11.20pm on Wednesday and sank 15 minutes later.The boat was carrying 53 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as 22 vehicles, the national search and rescue agency said. It had a capacity of 67 people and 25 vehicles, according to Indonesia’s transport ministry.Ferries are a common mode of transport in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands. However, there are longstanding concerns over safety standards, including a lack of safety equipment or the overloading of vessels.Last month, a ferry capsized off Bali after it was hit by a strong wave. All 89 people onboard were rescued.Additional reporting by Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

His answers meandered for minutes, peppered with personal anecdotes and laughs.Journalists were told in advance that the format was deliberately chosen to remove any sense of grandeur or power hierarchy.2.Building bridges after martial law chaosLee was swept into the presidency after Yoon’sill-fated martial law attempt, which triggered what Lee called a “national crisis” and badly shook public faith in government. Lee did not mention Yoon’s name once throughout the two-hour session.Lee repeatedly emphasised cooperation across party lines to restore economic stability rather than continuing the polarisation so characteristic of Korean politics. He mentioned fears of secret recordings during unofficial meetings with the opposition, so deep was the distrust between sides.When asked about concerns over weak oversight given that his party controls both the presidency and the national assembly with a supermajority, Lee acknowledged the political reality. “This is precisely the people’s choice,” he said.3.‘Very difficult’ talks ahead on Trump tariffsWith the US tariff suspensionto expireon 9 July, Lee was candid about the challenges ahead. “The tariff negotiations are very difficult, that’s certain,” he said. “We need to create mutually beneficial, truly reciprocal results, but so far both sides haven’t clearly sorted out exactly what they want.”He admitted: “I cannot guarantee we can finish by the 8th.”South Korea’s automotive sector, which exported $34.7bn (£25.4bn)worth of vehiclesto the US last year, faces one of the biggest threats from potential 25% tariffs, while steelalready faces50%. The country’s lucrativesemiconductor industryis also vulnerable.4.Diplomacy and deterrence on North KoreaDrawing on his experience as a lawyer who handled marital conflicts, he compared inter-Korean relations to feuding couples whose problems had spiralled out of control. His solution? “I used to tell them to try switching roles. Usually people who did this came to understand each other.“Misunderstanding breeds misunderstanding, conflict breeds conflict, distrust breeds distrust, hatred breeds hatred, so what was originally a small difference becomes unmanageable.“Even during war, diplomacy continues,” Lee said. “Completely cutting off dialogue is really foolish.” But Lee also emphasised maintaining strong defence, promising continued military modernisation within the South Korea-US alliance framework.He spoke of creating a “virtuous cycle of peace”, citing how North Koreaquickly respondedwhen Seoul haltedcross-border loudspeaker broadcasts, but offered few specifics about how to achieve this when pressed.5.Cutting the working weekWhen discussing plans to reduce South Korea’s working weekto 4.5 days, he recalled his childhoodworking in a factoryduring dire poverty: “Initially we didn’t rest at all for a whole month. Then they let us rest once a month … then twice a month … then once a week.” Such changes take time, he suggested when asked when the plans could realistically be implemented.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaLee Jae MyungYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificTrump tariffskey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

The quakes were all recorded as 1 or higher on the 7-point Japanese seismic intensity scale, which is used to describe the level of shaking, with 7 being the strongest. A lower 5 is considered powerful enough to alarm people and force them to hold on to something stable.Tokara village said on its website that residents were tired as they had been unable to sleep. “It feels like it’s always shaking,” one resident told the regional broadcaster MBC. “It’s very scary to even fall asleep.”Another said: “It’s not clear when all this will end. I should think about whether to evacuate my kids.”Official data shows that the number of daily quakes peaked at 183 on 23 June, then declined to 15 on 26 June and 16 on 27 June. But the number rose again to 34 on 28 June and 98 on 29 June. On 30 June, 62 quakes were recorded.A similar period of intense seismic activity in the Tokara area was seen in September 2023, when 346 earthquakes were recorded, according to the meteorological agency.Seven of the 12 remote Tokara Islands are inhabited, with about 700 residents in total.Experts say the unusual topography of the area around the Tokara islands makes it easier for pressure to build below the seabed that is then relieved in the form of earthquakes.Japan is one of the world’smost seismically active countries, sitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific “ring of fire”.The archipelago, home to about 125 million people, experiences about 1,500 tremors a year and accounts for about 18% of the world’s earthquakes. The vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth at which they strike.Nearly 600 people died after amassive earthquake hit the Noto Peninsulain central Japan on New Year’s Day in 2024. In March 2011, more than 18,000 people died after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered apowerful tsunamithat wrecked large parts of the coastline in north-east Japan. The quake also triggered a triple meltdown at theFukushimanuclear power plant.Japan’s government this week said that more needed to be done to prepare for a possible “megaquake” that experts believe has a strong chance of striking the Pacific coast in the next three decades.Although it is impossible to predict when, exactly, an earthquake will occur, a government panel in January marginally increased the probability of a major jolt in theNankai Troughin the next 30 years to between 75% and 82%.According to a revised government estimate in March, a megaquake in the region accompanied by a tsunami could kill as many as 298,000 people and cause damage worth up to $2tn.Explore more on these topicsJapanEarthquakesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It had beencalling on the government to make its role permanentfor some time.In its new role, it would be able to make representations, provide advice to government and question ministers. Ministers and government departments, in turn, would be required to consult with the assembly on laws and policies that are “specifically directed to First Peoples”.The update said the proposed body would “sit within our existing parliamentary and democratic structures” and “will not have veto power on policy or legislation”, noting such a power “does not exist under Victoria’s parliamentary system.​”The assembly would also be responsible for confirming Aboriginality and would take control of the government’s Aboriginal Community Infrastructure Program, the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll and the organisation of important events, such as Naidoc Week.It would make statutory appointments for designated First Peoples’ seats on government boards and entities, such as on the Heritage Council of Victoria, and continue the truth-telling work ofYoorrook Justice Commission, including by capturing stories and retaining an archive of this information to support the education of the broader public.Among the100 recommendations in the commission’s final report, tabled in parliament on Tuesday, was one making the assembly permanent and giving it decision-making powers.Under its new role, the assembly would become a statutory corporation and would be required to legislate its ongoing public reporting, election processes, participatory governance and cultural oversight from elders.It would also be subject to oversight bodies including Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, the Victorian auditor general’s office and the ombudsman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A referendum that same year to alter the constitution to create federal voice to parliament failed, with 60% of Australians voting no.Earlier this week, the opposition leader, Brad Battin, said his party would not support the move to make the assembly permanent, noting it had withdrawn support for the treaty process after the referendum result.But the Greens, Animal Justice party and Legalise Cannabis have told Guardian Australia they support the assembly having a permanent role, though they are yet to see the detail of the bill. This would give the government the numbers it needs for the bill to pass the upper house.Further negotiations on the treaty – Australia’s first with First Nations people – continue.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansVictorian politicsVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

It can be an expression of our joy, frustration – a show of power.”A celebration of the Levantine folk dance forms part ofDabke and Tatreez, an Artists for Peace event showing at the Sydney Opera House on Sunday.There, Halawa will play the riq – one of the world’s oldest instruments.It is “like a tambourine but it’s especially for Arabic music,” Palestinian musician Seraj Jelda says.View image in fullscreen‘What this means to me … is that I am seen and heard and accepted here in Australia’: Derek Halawa at rehearsals.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianJelda, who played with the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music inGazabefore fleeing Israel’s bombardment for Australia a year ago, will play the riq and oud on Sunday.He’s one of an ensemble of 10 artists performing at the event, which brings together musicians and dancers with Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Indonesian and Cypriot heritage.“It means a lot because we are delivering our culture, our songs,” Jelda says.‘A window of understanding’From the routine of harvest, joys of weddings and honouring of family matriarchs to being forced to leave a homeland, the event’s repertoire is “a journey through people’s lives”, Halawa says.Most pieces come from beforethe 1948 Nakba– “how our grandfathers, and our ancient people, [were] singing their songs,” Jelda says.“Once they want to collect vegetables and fruits and olives … they start singing these songs. Once they want to get married, they sing these songs for the groom and for the bride.“Some songs will talk about the Nakba and how songs are transferred from cultural and happy songs to songs that talk about Palestine and how it was occupied and our land was stolen.”Halawa says Sunday’s show is “a window of understanding” into the Levant culture.4:58From Gaza to Bankstown, these Palestinian musicians are protesting via performance – video“What this means to me … is that I am seen and heard and accepted here in Australia, with the background and the culture that I bring with me,” the Palestinian, Syrian and Turkish musician says. He has lived in Australia for 12 years.“The language of storytelling and music is so universal that it’s compelling, and having that as our medium of conversing with Australia is important.”AsIsrael continues its bombardment of Gaza– which hasdestroyed cultural heritage sitesacross the strip – Halawa says the performance becomes “more than just sharing of culture and understanding and music”.“It’s a plea for connection,” he says. “It also means that it’s part of our contribution as performers to lifting the injustice.”It has made Halawa reflect on “what these songs actually mean”.View image in fullscreenMusicians Majdi Jelda and Ayşe Göknur Shanal.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianA song telling the story of a person leaving home, for example, wields the meaning “that it’s not about the taste of the food as much as the togetherness, the caring and connection with the land and with one another, endurance as a collective thing”.“Now that I need to convey its content and its spirit, it led me to really rethink these stories and what they mean and what the original authors were thinking and experiencing that potentially led to them writing these stories.”The Opera House event is a work of cultural preservation, Ayşe Göknur Shanal says.Music is “one of the most important mediums in expressing culture and identity and heritage and tradition”.“There are songs for celebration, for grief, lamenting,” the Turkish-Cypriot Australian curator and opera singer says. “You dance in anger, and you dance in love and passion and celebration.”Shanal felt a sense of urgency to perform.“I feel like the complacency of the arts industry and sector has propelled the urgency in me,” she says.‘It’s unfeasible to run this model much longer’: is this the end of the Australian regional tour?Read more“The silence has propelled the urgency in me. We are proponents of arts and culture and heritage and history … and to see Palestinian music being absent from the musical vernacular and landscape frustrated me.“So many mosques and churches [are] being bombed in Gaza and elsewhere – that’s destroying heritage and history and culture. We are trying to protect and preserve, as opposed to what’s happening, which is destroy, erase.”Jelda says: “Sometimes it is sad for us to play music and do happy things [when] our families and friends [are] in Gaza facing a difficult time.“But it is [also] like a happy moment, because we are delivering something for them, making people know what’s happening in Palestine and Gaza.”Dabke and Tatreezis showing Sunday 6 July at 8pm at the Sydney Opera HouseExplore more on these topicsAustralian musicGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Culture and structure must evolve together.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA candidate pool model would be similar to the “A-list” of candidates for preselectionsintroduced in Britain’s Conservative partyby the former prime minister David Cameron.Cameron put a freeze on candidate selection and introduced a priority list, with half of the list to be female and a large number to be from minority backgrounds.At Wednesday’s meeting the council did not settle on a model for change or next steps but participants said there was majority support for quotas and other significant changes.The NSW Young Liberals have called for a candidate pool model and reiterated their support for it at their last meeting in May, after the federal election.Before this week’s meeting, Walker said there would be an “open discussion” of quotas.Those in the meeting said a majority of the participants, diverse in age, were in favour of quotas, with only a few speaking against them.One senior party member said there was “no rush” to put forward a model.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A small number of people fled into the sea and were rescued by local fishermen and divers.Residents and tourists were taking shelter at an indoor stadium and some had left Crete by boat, authorities said. Local media reported some homes had been damaged. An estimated 5,000 more holidaymakers left south-east Crete independently.Ierapetra’s mayor, Manolis Frangoulis, said firefighters were working to prevent flare-ups during a lull in high winds. “Thankfully no one was hurt but it’s a difficult situation,” he said.Like the rest of Crete, Ierapetra – a seaside resort with a permanent population of 23,000 – accommodates thousands of tourists in the summer. The island’s arid, uneven landscape, criss-crossed by gullies, makes it hard for firefighters to tackle blazes.A separate fire was raging in the Halkidiki region ofGreece, with 160 firefighters and 49 vehicles involved in the emergency response.View image in fullscreenA wildfire in the Halkidiki region of Greece.Photograph: Fedja Grulovic/ReutersInTurkey, thousands of people fled blazes in Cesme and Ödemiş in the western coastal province of İzmir.An elderly man died in the blaze near Ödemis, about 60 miles east of the city of İzmir, in one of three villages evacuated in the area. “The village was evacuated but an elderly, bedridden patient could not be saved,” a local MP told Turkish TV.Vathrakogiannis said the risk of destructive wildfires remained “very considerable” in July, the hottest month of the year in Greece, although the country had largely escaped the heatwave still gripping other parts of southern and centralEurope.Nearly 500 firefighters were battling wildfires in easternGermanythat severely injured two emergency workers and forced the evacuation of more than 100 people near Gohrischheide, on the border between the states of Saxony and Brandenburg.The blazes had burned through hundreds of hectares of heathland and were still not under control on Thursday, with firefighters unable to tackle outbreaks on a former military training area with unexploded ammunition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least five people have died in the heatwave inItaly, including two, aged 75 and 60, on beaches in Sardinia.Temperatures on the island, where wildfires have been raging, have exceeded 40C in recent days. In Genoa, an 85-year-old man died of heart failure in hospital. A 47-year-old construction worker died near Bologna and a 53-year-old woman died in Palermo.A measurehalting outdoor work, for example, on construction sites and farms, during the hottest part of the day has taken effect nationwide, although it is not an obligation and many people are continuing to work their normal hours.InSpain, the media reported that the two victims of a wildfire that consumed more than 5,500 hectares of mostly agricultural land in Torrefeta i Florejacs in Lleida province were aged 32 and 45, and had died of smoke inhalation.Temperatures in centralAlbaniareached 40C on Thursday, and with little rain expected until September fears are rising for local agricultural output. Serbia’s state meteorological institute also warned “extreme drought” was affecting crops.Scientists have said Europe’s heatwaves have arrived earlier than usual this year, with temperatures surging by up to 10C in some regions as warming seas encourage the formation of a “heat dome” over much of the land mass, trapping hot air.Explore more on these topicsEurope weatherExtreme weatherWildfiresGreeceEuropeTurkeyGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "15.43 EDTSummaryVladimir Putin didn’t make any shift in Moscow’s position during a call with Donald Trumpthat lasted over an hour.Kremlin aideYuri Ushakovsaid Moscow wants a negotiated end to the Ukraine war but would not step back from its original goals. He told reporters: “Our president also said that Russia will achieve the goals it has set: that is, the elimination of the well-known root causes that led to the current state of affairs, to the current acute confrontation, and Russia will not back down from these goals.” Ushakov also said that while Russia was open to continuing to speak with the US, any peace negotiations needed to occur between Moscow and Kyiv. There’s been no word from the White House so we don’t yet know what Trump made of the call, but if and when we get that it’ll be covered over on ourUS politics blog.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyyopenly spoke about “doubts about continuedUSsupport forEurope”as he repeated his call to “strengthen our cooperation and coordination” through theEU,Nato, and in bilateral relations (he said today he wants Ukraineto join the EU, which Denmarkthrew itself behind). He explicitly said thatUkraineneeds theUSand there will area where theUSsupport is essentially irreplaceable, but it’s clear this is a source of growing concern for him. He is due to talk toDonaldTrumptomorrow, so they will no doubt discuss the US military weapons deliveries pause.Zelenskyyalso made it clear that he remained supportive of theUSpresident’s efforts to bring about a lasting peace and hinted that “a meeting at the level of leaders” would be needed to conclude any talks.French president Emmanuel Macron said he wanted a EU-US trade deal “as soon as possible, with the lowest tariffs possible”, as a Washington-set deadline looms to reach an accord. His comments come as the EU’s trade chief,Maroš Šefčovič,is in Washington DC for talks with the US administration amid hopes that a framework deal can be struck ahead of the next week’s deadline to avoid punishing 50% tariffs. The US secretary of treasuryScott Bessentoffered a rather cryptic answeron the progress of talks with the EU saying only: “We will see what we can do.”Prime minister Mette Frederiksen said Denmark has to “steerEuropesafely through one of the most challenging times in our history”atthe inauguration ceremony for the Danish presidency of the EU in Aarhus. In a hard-hitting speech she wasclear about Denmark’s prioritieswith security, supporting Ukraine, and migration.Awildfire fanned by gale-force winds forced the evacuation of more than 1,500 people on the Greek island of Crete, officials said, as large swathes of continental Europe baked in a punishingearly summer heatwavelinked to at least nine deaths. About 230 firefighters, along with 46 vehicles and helicopters, werebattling the blazetoday after it broke out 24 hours earlier nearIerapetraon the south-east coast of the country’s largest island, threatening to engulf houses and hotels.Two wildfires that began overnight near the western Turkish resort of Izmir were raging out of control today, fuelled by high winds, officials said. Locals in at least five districts in the two areas were evacuated as a precaution but there were no immediate reports of injuries.It comes asEurope continues to face extreme heat, withSpain,Italy,Austria,Hungary,Slovakia,PolandandCroatiaall experiencing temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius today. In Italy, the fierce heat over the last week has beenlinked to at least five deaths, with two people, aged 75 and 60, dying on beaches in Sardinia. Italy’s health ministry placed 18 major cities on maximum ‘red’ alert for heat today, including Rome, Milan, Turin, Bologna, Genoa and Palermo, meaning the heat is so intense that it poses a risk for young and healthy people too.Due to the climate emergency,Italian seas have reached temperatures above 20C even at depths of 40 metres, according to areport released yesterday by Greenpeace. Across the Mediterranean, 2024 marked the hottest year on record for average sea temperature in the basin, with a mean value of 21.16C.Serbian police detained 79 protesterslate last night in a crackdown on street demonstrators calling for a snap electionand an end of the 12-year rule ofAleksandar Vučićand his Serbian Progressive Party.

A captured Russian marine said he had witnessed thekilling of two other PoWsa month earlier in the same sector.The Russian unit participated in the failed attempt to take Kyiv in spring 2022, and was then involved in the repeated offensives at Vuhledar in 2023 in the south-east corner of the frontline, before being redeployed to fight off Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk province.View image in fullscreenDestroyed apartment blocks in Vuhledar, where the 155th Marine Brigade was involved in repeated offensives.Photograph: Oleg Petrasyuk/EPAGudkov is one of at least 10 Russian major generals or lieutenant generals to have been killed in the war so far. Some of the attacks appear carefully planned by Ukraine, though on the evidence so far the hit on Gudkov looks opportunistic.Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military’s chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit, waskilled after a bomb detonated outside his apartmentin December. Ukraine’s SBU security service claimed responsibility for the operation.In April, Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the general staff of the Russian armed forces,died after a car explodedin the town of Balashikha outside Moscow in April. Though Ukraine did not say it was behind this attack, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, praised the country’s foreign intelligence for the killing of top Russian military figures.An explosion on Thursday also killed Manolis Pilavov, a former mayor of the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Russian authorities said. Pilavov ran the city’s administration for nine years after it was separated from Ukraine in 2014 and was wanted by Kyiv for violating the integrity of the country.Across Ukraine, three people were reported killed and 34 injured in Russian air attacks in different parts of the country on Thursday. Ukraine’s air force said 52 Shahed and dummy drones were launched by Moscow’s forces, with it successfully intercepting or jamming 40 of them.Earlier this week, it emerged that the US hadpaused the delivery of Patriot air defence missile interceptorsand other precision weapons to Ukraine amid concerns about the level of its stockpiles. Trump said last month that Patriot missiles had been given to Israel to help it defend itself from Iran.The US president and Zelenskyy were expected to discuss the issue on Friday,the Financial Timesreported. Zelenskyy said on Wednesday: “One way or another, we must ensure protection for our people.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She declined to specify the nature of his conviction.The man received a negative decision on an asylum claim in April and had been awaiting a response on another decision.Since thefall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, several European governments have called for the return of Syrian refugees who fled to Europe after the crushing of rebellion and outbreak of civil war that drove 12 million people from their homes, including 6 million abroad.Austria, which hosts 100,000 Syrians, called for the “orderly repatriation and deportation to Syria” of refugees theday after the dictator was ousted.Separately, Germany’s interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, revealed his government was seeking an agreement with Syria’s new Islamist government to deport criminals of Syrian nationality. Germany has given refuge to nearly one million Syrians since 2015.Germany resumed flying convicted criminals of Afghan nationality to their home country in August, after pausing deportations following the Taliban’s takeover three years earlier.Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Thursday that migrants who commit serious crimes should be expelled fromEurope, without making reference to any specific country. In a press conference to mark the start of Denmark’s six-month EU presidency, she described the current asylum system as “broken” with the consequences of “uncontrolled migration” visible in European societies.Migrants “who commit serious crimes and do not respect our values and way of life – I don’t think they have a place in Europe. And they should be expelled.” She added: “We need new solutions that will lower the influx of migrants to Europe”.Denmarkrevoked the residency statusof some Syrians as early as 2021, when it deemed parts of the war-torn country safe to return to.Nearly 10 years after the peak of the 2015-16 migration crisis, when 1.3 million people sought refuge in Europe, the EU has moved to tighten up its asylum and migration rules.The European Commission also proposed faster procedures for returning people with no right to stay in the EU to their countries of origin, including the possibility of creating offshore “return hubs” outside Europe.Speaking alongside the Danish prime minister, Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, said she hoped to see progress on the returns proposals and another to create a common list of safe countries , which would allow fast-tracked asylum procedures – and potentially faster refusals, during Denmark’s six months of chairing EU council meetings.In ajoint statement this week, 52 rights groups, including Amnesty International and the Danish Refugee Council, said the proposals risked “seriously undermining people’s access to fair and full asylum procedures in Europe”. The groups also raised concerns about potential human rights violations in offshore return hubs.Explore more on these topicsAustriaRefugeesSyriaBashar al-AssadEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The newspaper said the number of gatecrashers to the event was such that officers from the local unit of Italy’s anti-terrorism squad, Digos, were called to the island.The newspaper also alleged a vintage Dolce & Gabbana-designed dress, either worn by the bride or wedding guest Ivanka Trump, was torn and caught fire during another party.The Bezos wedding was a study in disingenuous billionaire behavior | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreSources familiar with the situation confirmed that a dress had gone missing but denied it was stolen. It is unclear where the dress disappeared and when. The couple lodged at the seven-star Aman hotel, where the bride’s wedding outfits were reportedly kept under close watch.The sources stressed that no legal complaint about the missing dress had been made to police, with the expectation being that the garment would eventually “turn up”. They also denied the report that a dress caught fire and that the celebrations had been infiltrated by gatecrashers.The nuptials, which are said to have cost between €40m and €48m (£34m-£41m), reportedly included everything from pyjama and foam parties to elegant dinners and a Great Gatsby-themed event.But on almost every canal, alleyway and square, there were protests against the wedding, with anti-Bezos campaigners arguing that the celebrations risked turningVeniceinto a playground for the rich, bringing nothing but strife for ordinary residents. The location of the main reception party on Saturday had to be changed at the last-minute because of threats by protesters to fill the canals with inflatable crocodiles in order to prevent the 200 or so wedding guests, who included Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Kim Kardashian, from arriving.The guests arrived in Venice on super-yachts and more than 90 private jets.As Friday night’s party got into full swing, a green laser was used to spell out the slogan ‘No Kings, No Bezos’ on the bell tower in St Mark’s Square. Another stunt involved activists floating a lifesize mannequin of Bezos along the Grand Canal, clinging to an Amazon box while holding fake dollars.The Venice mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, dismissed the protesters as “shameful” and said the Bezos-Sánchez union would fill Venetian coffers.View image in fullscreenA green laser was used to spell out ‘No Kings, No Bezos’ on the bell tower in St Mark’s Square in protest at the wedding.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APThe couple have now moved on to Taormina.

Instead, some political leaders have embraced the couple.“Jeff and Lauren, we welcome you with open arms,” said Matteo Francilia, mayor of Furci Siculo, a small town near Messina. “Leave behind the beautiful lagoon with its absurd complaints! Here in Furci Siculo you’ll find sun, sea and genuine people, who would welcome you with open arms.”It’s not the first time Bezos’s 127-metre super-yacht has sailed to Sicily.

On Tuesday night and Wednesday the toll was higher, they said. Casualties includedMarwan al-Sultan,a cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, who died in an airstrike that also killed his wife and five children.In all, about 300 people may have been killed this week and thousands more injured, according to the officials.Despite the new wave of violence in Gaza, hopes of a ceasefire have risen after Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday thatIsraelhad accepted the terms of a potential deal with Hamas. The deal would involve a 60-day initial pause in hostilities, a part withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of some of the hostages still held by Hamas.Israel’s security cabinet was scheduled to meet on Thursday night to decide whether to move swiftly towards an agreement withHamasor order further military escalation.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, is due to fly on Sunday to Washington for talks with Trump and senior US officials. They are expected to discuss a ceasefire, the recent war between Israel and Iran, and possibilities for ambitious regional agreements.Earlier this week, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, described “positive signs” for a ceasefire and the energy minister, Eli Cohen, told the news website Ynet that there was “definitely readiness to advance a deal”.Hamas is expected to give an initial response to the ceasefire proposals on Friday but the group is split. The political leadership outsideGaza, mainly based in Qatar and Istanbul, favours a ceasefire but those in the territory itself want to continue to fight, sources close to the movement said.A previous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March when Israel reneged on a promise to move to a second phase of talks.Since then, almost 6,500 people have been killed in Gaza in successive waves of Israeli airstrikes, shelling and clashes between Israeli troops and remaining Hamas militants.Map showing latest evacuation areas in GazaThough the total blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel has now been partly lifted, only very limited supplies are reaching the most vulnerable in the territory, who are threatened by famine.The casualties on Thursday included dozens of Palestinians attempting to get humanitarian aid, with five people killed by Israeli fire on their way to sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a new and secretive private organisation supported by the US and Israel that began in May to distribute basic food parcels from four hubs protected by Israeli forces.About 45 Palestinians seeking aid were killed elsewhere in the territory, reportedly by Israeli fire, Palestinian officials said. Hundreds have been killed in recent weeks while gathered in huge crowds around looted trucks and convoys brought into Gaza by the UN.Israel’s military acknowledged on Monday that Palestinian civilians had been harmed seeking aid and that its forces had been issued with new instructions after what it called “lessons learned”.The wave of intense attacks of recent days appears to be designed to put pressure on Hamas in negotiations. Its focus has been the north of Gaza, where the militant Islamist organisation remains entrenched, though much weakened.In Gaza City on Thursday, 12 people were killed and many injured in a strike on the Mustafa Hafez school, which shelters displaced persons, in al-Rimal neighbourhood, said Mohammad al-Mughayyir, a civil defence official.Footage filmed by local journalists showed children wandering through the charred, bombed-out shelter as piles of burnt debris smouldered.1:36Footage shows aftermath of deadly Israeli strike on Gaza school turned shelter – videoCrowds of mourners gathered at al-Shifa hospital, where men and women wept over the bodies of the dead.“We have no life left. Let them just annihilate us so we can finally rest,” said one woman who lost relatives in the strike and did not give her name.“There’s nothing left for us. My two daughters are gone – and now my niece along with her six children and her husband were burned to death,” she said.The Israeli military said it had targeted a key Hamas militant operating in the school, regretted any harm to “uninvolved individuals” and took steps to minimise such harm.Analysts said Israel’s success in its short war with Iran last month had reinforced the political position of Netanyahu, who is now less reliant on the support of far-right coalition partners who oppose any deal with Hamas. Polls show the Israeli public wants to end the war and bring the remaining hostages home.Egyptian and Israeli officials briefed on the talks said the new proposal called for Hamas to release 10 of the 50 hostages still held in Gaza – eight on the first day and two on the final day. In return, Israel would withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza, allow a big increase in aid into the territory and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.A regional diplomat briefed on the talks said there was now a “big opportunity” to reach an agreement. “The indications we’re getting are people are ready,” he said.There also appears to be agreement over the delivery of aid in Gaza, with the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent likely to lead the humanitarian effort but the GHF also continuing to operate. The new deal would lead to Gaza being governed by a group of qualified Palestinians without political affiliations once a ceasefire is reached.However, big gaps remain. Israel wants the disarmament of Hamas and the exile of its Gaza-based leadership, while Hamas wants a guarantee of a permanent end to hostilities.The war in Gaza was triggered by an attack into southern Israel in October 2023 during which Hamas-led militants killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,012 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaHamasPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Albanese, an Italian legal scholar who has been the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories since 2022, first referred to the Israeli offensive inGazaas a genocide in January 2024.The international court of justice (ICJ) is weighing the charge of genocide against Israel but Albanese has argued that the evidence of genocide is overwhelming and pointed out that the court issued preliminary measures last year recognising the possibility of genocide in Gaza, triggering universal responsibility to prevent it.Israel has largely ignored the ICJ’s calls on it to take steps to mitigate the toll on Palestinian civilians and disputed the court’s jurisdiction.Albanese said there was no reason to wait for an ICJ judgment, which she said was only being delayed by the long queue of cases the court has to judge.“I have investigated it day by day for 630 days and, frankly, after five months I could tell you that it was genocide. You don’t need a scientist to establish what is genocide. You just need to connect the dots,” she told the Guardian.“Israel has [committed] acts that are recognised as genocidal, like acts of killing nearly 60,000 people, probably more, creation of conditions of life calculated to destroy, destruction of 80% of the homes and no water, no food.”According to the Gaza health ministry, more than 56,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which was triggered in October 2023 when a Hamas attack killed 1,200 Israelis. Many experts have said the real death toll in Gazacould be much higheras many Palestinians are missing and believed to be buried under the rubble.The special rapporteur’s report is titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide” and looks at international corporate involvement in supplying weapons and supplying heavy machinery used to raze Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza and the West Bank, agricultural companies selling produce from illegal settlements, and investment firms helping fund the war.View image in fullscreenFrancesca Albanese: ‘You don’t need a scientist to establish what is genocide.’Photograph: Ida Marie Odgaard/Reuters“While political leaders and governments shirk their obligations, far too many corporate entities have profited from Israel’s economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and, now, genocide,” the report says.“The complicity exposed by this report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives.”The report says the Israeli military has benefited from “the largest ever defence procurement programme” for the F-35 fighter jet, made by Lockheed Martin with the involvement of more than 1,600 other manufacturers and eight states. It says Israel was the first to fly the warplane in “beast mode”, carrying 18,000lb of bombs at a time.On Monday the UK’s high court ruled that Britain’s export of parts for the F-35 to Israelwas lawfulon the grounds that a court should not intervene in a sensitive political issue that was best left to ministers and parliament, even though it said UK-made parts could be used in the “commission of a serious violation of international humanitarian law in the conflict in Gaza”.A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said: “Foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. Discussions about those sales are best addressed by the US government.”The Trump administration has been enthusiastically supportive of Israel in the Gaza war. On its website, Lockheed Martin says it is “proud of the significant role it has fulfilled in the security of the state of Israel”.The US technology firm Palantir comes under particular criticism in the Albanese report for its close partnership with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), with which the company agreed a strategic partnership for Palantir to assist its “war-related missions”.Palantir, whose software allows automated decision-making on the battlefield, has denied any involvement in the IDF’s Lavender or Gospel programmes for identifying targets in Gaza.Palantir did not respond to a request for comment but has said in response to earlier allegations: “We have no relationship to these programmes and their use but are proud to support Israeli defence and national security missions in other programmes and contexts.” It said it took a variety of methods to “mitigate against human rights risk in our work”.The Albanese report also criticises heavy equipment manufacturers such as Volvo for allegedly supplying heavy machinery used in mass demolitions of homes, mosques and infrastructure in Gaza and the West Bank.“These companies have continued supplying the Israeli market despite abundant evidence of Israel’s criminal use of this machinery and repeated calls from human rights groups to sever ties,” Albanese says in the report. “Passive suppliers become deliberate contributors to a system of displacement.”Volvo said much of the equipment being used had been acquired on the secondhand market, over which it had no influence. The Sweden-based company has an agreement with an Israeli company, Merkavim, to assemble buses on Volvo chassis.A Volvo spokesperson said the agreement included a requirement that “Merkavim shall comply with applicable laws and regulations and the Volvo Group supply partner code of conduct, which includes specific human rights requirements.”Albanese pointed to an ICJ advisory opinion last year that said Israel’s continued presence in the occupied territories was unlawful and that Merkavim was on a UN database of companies operating on the West Bank.“So the due diligence that is imposed on Volvo is to withdraw immediately from the partnership that it has with companies that are on the database and with Israel,” she said.The report notes that Israel has helped pay for the war and consequent deep budget deficits by selling treasury bonds. By buying them, the report argues, international finance has helped keep the war going.“Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade,” it says.It names asset management firms including Pimco (owned by the German-based financial services company Allianz) and Vanguard as major buyers of Israeli treasury bonds.Pimco declined to comment. A spokesperson for Vanguard said the company “maintains robust policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and sanctions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes adhering to laws that may require specific investment restrictions in companies that are sanctioned for human rights abuses.”The report also points to the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, for having increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32% since October 2023.On Monday, Norway’s biggest pension fund, KLP, announced it would no longer do business with two companies – the Oshkosh Corporation in the US and ThyssenKrupp in Germany – because they sell equipment to the Israeli military that could be being used in Gaza. Neither company is named in the UN report.Oshkosh did not reply to a request for comment. A ThyssenKrupp spokesperson said the company “conducts its deliveries exclusively on the basis of lawful authorisations and in strict compliance with the foreign and security policy guidelines of the Federal Republic of Germany. The German government is involved in the process from the outset, with preliminary inquiries submitted before any project begins.”KLP is a separate entity from GPFG but they are closely associated and reportedly share their environmental, social and governance analyses of investments around the world.A GPFG spokesperson said: “The market value of our investments in Israel has increased but this is not because we have increased our ownership – the market value has increased due to returns.” They added that its investments were overseen by a council of ethics appointed by Norway’s ministry of finance, which has excluded some firms because of “serious violations”.“As a responsible investor, we monitor our investments and expect companies to conduct enhanced due diligence in situations of war and conflict,” the spokesperson said.Albanese’s report points to precedents in holding corporations legally accountable for human rights abuses they enable, including the prosecution of leading German industrialists at the Nuremberg tribunal after the second world war, in what was known as the IG Farben trial.Another example cited is the South African truth and reconciliation commission, which took the country’s big companies to task for their involvement in apartheid.The UN published its own benchmarks in 2011, in its guiding principles on business and human rights, which said corporations had a responsibility to do due diligence to ensure they were not infringing human rights and to take steps to address harmful effects of their business.In her recommendations, Albanese calls for sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel, and urges the international criminal court “and national judiciaries to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate entities for their part in the commission of international crimes and laundering of the proceeds from those crimes”.This article was amended on 3 July 2025. An earlier version described Volvo as a Chinese-owned company; however, while Volvo Cars is Chinese-owned, the wider Volvo Group has no majority shareholders.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Russia’s foreign affairs ministry also confirmed the news to the Tass news agency.The move comes shortly after Gul Hassan, a Taliban diplomat, assumed the role of Kabul’s ambassador to Moscow.Moscow has taken steps to normalise relations with the Taliban government, removing its designation as a “terrorist organisation” in April and inviting representatives to official events.Russia was the first country to open a business representative office in Kabul after the Taliban takeover, and has announced plans to use Afghanistan as a transit hub for gas heading to south-east Asia.In July 2024, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, called the Taliban “allies in the fight against terrorism”.Only Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates recognised the Taliban during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.This time, multiple other states, including China and Pakistan, have accepted Taliban ambassadors in their capitals, but have not officially recognised Afghanistan as an Islamic emirate.However, their restrictions on women and girls – barring them from education and squeezing them from public life – have been key sticking points for other nations.The Taliban authorities have keenly sought international recognition and investment, as the country recovers from four decades of war, including the Soviet invasion from 1979 to 1989.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaRussiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

It focused on inquiries for typical first-time buyer properties, that is those with a maximum of two bedrooms.It revealed that number two on its “city hotspots” list wasEdinburgh, followed by three locations in England: Doncaster, Liverpool and Plymouth.Its findings provide fresh evidence that the pandemic-fuelled “exodus from the city” – or at least the fantasies that millions harboured aboutrelocating to a coastal or rural area– was, statistically speaking, something of a blip.Areas that estate agents were naming as property hotspots in 2020 included the fishing village of Port Isaac in Cornwall, the seaside towns of Margate in Kent and Clevedon in north Somerset, and Canford Cliffs, a suburb of Poole in Dorset.Rightmove issued a list in January 2022 ofthe 10 most popular homebuyer search hotspotsfor the previous year, all of which were either villages or located near the sea. Rhos-on-Sea, a small seaside town near Colwyn Bay in north Wales, topped the list.Fast-forward to today and the property website said that while more potential first-time buyers were looking to move to cities, the number contemplating popular coastal areas was “completely flat compared with 10 years ago”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall first-time buyer demand in the capital is down by 7% versus 10 years ago. That is thought to be in large part because of the capital’s higher property prices, which have locked many out of the housing market.First-time buyer demand in Dundee jumped by 176% over the period. On the banks of the River Tay, the city has developed a reputation asa vibrant arts and culture hubin recent years. It is also said to have more urban green space per head of population than anywhere else in the UK.Much of its popularity with would-be first-time buyers is also likely to be down to its relatively affordable housing.Official data issued last monthshowed that the average price paid by first-time buyers was just under £121,000 in April this year, compared with £156,800 for Scotland as a whole and £223,400 across Great Britain.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketPropertyReal estateDundeeScotlandDoncasterLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

While Corbyn has long hinted at plans to establish a more organised vehicle for leftwing and pro-Palestinian campaigning, he has so far avoided confirming any formal structure or leadership arrangements.Corbyn, 76, has not committed to the project becoming a party, or endorsed any specific leadership roles. The Guardian understands he was frustrated by Sultana’s unilateral announcement, which some regard as premature and potentially counterproductive.So far, he has confined his public comments to cautious remarks about the group “coming together” and “offering an alternative”, without outlining further details.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme this week, he confirmed talks were under way but did not rule out other possibilities. “That grouping [of independents] will come together, there will be an alternative,” he said.Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, is reluctant to take on the title of leader – as consistent with his preference for collective decision-making – and is believed to think that imposing a hierarchy too soon would risk fragmenting the already fragile coalition he spent months encouraging to work together.Sultana was first elected in December 2019 and has sat in the Commons as an independent MP since September last year, having had theLabourwhip removed after voting to abolish the two-child benefit cap.In a statement at the time, she said she would “do it again” and accused the government of seeking to make disabled people suffer.Corbyn led Labour from 2015 to 2020 before he was suspended over his response to the party’s antisemitism report. He retained his Islington North seat last year as an independent candidate.The Independent Alliance includes four other independent MPs who all beat Labour candidates and MPs over the party’s position on Gaza. The group has the same number of MPs – five – as Reform UK and the Democratic Unionist party, and more than the Green party and Plaid Cymru (four each).In her full statement, Sultana added: “A year ago I was suspended by the Labour party for voting to abolish the two-child benefit cap and lift 400,000 children out of poverty. I’d do it again.“I voted against scrapping winter fuel payments for pensioners. I’d do it again. Now, the government wants to make disabled people suffer; they just can’t decide how much.”After a year studying Starmer, I can tell you that he is at once a very kind man and a ruthless one | Anushka AsthanaRead moreThe move could dismantle the left-of-centre vote and present a headache for Starmer, who has repositioned Labour in the political centre.Corbyn’s group includes Shockat Adam, the MP for Leicester South; Ayoub Khan, the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr; Adnan Hussain, the MP for Blackburn; and Iqbal Mohamed, the MP for Dewsbury and Batley.Before Sultana’s statement, Corbyn had said any new party would focus on poverty, inequality and a foreign policy “based on peace rather than war”. Asked if he would lead the party, he said: “I’m here to work – I’m here to serve the people in the way I’ve always tried to do.“The Alliance group of MPs has worked very hard and very well together over the past year in parliament, and we’re coming up to our first anniversary.”Last September,Corbyn addressed a meetingto prepare for a leftwing political partynamed Collectivewhich was also attended by the former Unite general secretary Len McCluskey and a number of former independent candidates.Key figures in the group said they hoped the party would act as an incubator for future leaders who could replace Corbyn as a figurehead of the left, and aim to contest seats at the next general election.At the private meeting, founders said they would begin drawing up democratic structures for a new party to launch.A source close to Corbyn said his attendance was not an official endorsement and that he had attended the meeting to “listen to and share a variety of views about the way forward for the left”.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It clarified that “these persons who have arrived in Europe are neither members of the CRC nor formally affiliated”.The statement added that the CRC would be launching a “European public relations campaign to share its vision of reparations with political stakeholders and the general public”.Caricom is also combining efforts with the African Union to advocate for reparations.The issue of reparations for transatlantic slavery has been heating up over the last year, dominating headlines in October when the British prime minister, Keir Starmer,resisted pressure from member statesto include reparations on the agenda at the Commonwealth summit.Pressure is intensifying from different sections of the global reparations movement on European countries involved in the kidnap, trafficking, forced labour, torture and sexual exploitation of millions of enslaved African peoples over a 300-year period.Caribbean leaders have remained resolute in their pursuitof justice, with Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, stressing the importance of a face-to-face discussion on the issue and the prime minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, pointing to “legal avenues … if the negotiations fail”.In June it emerged that Jamaica was seeking legal remedy, asking King Charles, who remains the island’s head of state, to use his authority to request legal advice from the judicial committee of the London-based privy council, the final court of appeal for UK overseas territories and some Commonwealth countries, on whether the forced transport of Africans to Jamaica was lawful, if it constituted a crime against humanity, and whether Britain was under obligation to provide a remedy to Jamaica for slavery and its enduring consequences.Responding to questions about whether King Charles is obliged to honour Jamaica’s request, the deputy chair of the country’s National Reparations Council, Bert Samuels, said if King Charles,who is part of the monarchy that benefited from slavery, refuses to refer the issue or if the privy council does not come back giving “positive recognition to the three questions” there would be a global “avalanche of criticism” of Britain.He added thatthe toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol in 2020 anti-racism protests was evidence of“an across-the-board rejection for the celebration of the slave trade, no matter how long ago it was”.Samuels added that Jamaica may take the matter to the international courts if it fails to get justice in Britain’s legal system.Explore more on these topicsReparations and reparative justiceJamaicaBarbadosBahamasEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been unable for a decade now to provide the rapid access – to GPs, A&E care, surgery, ambulances and mental health support – which people need and used to get.Normalisation of anxiety-inducing, frightening and sometimes fatal delay has produced a less tangible, but also dangerous, crisis: of public satisfaction, born of a profound loss of trust that theNHSwill be there for them or their loved ones when they need it.Barelyone in five people in Britain are happy with the NHS. Polling by Ipsos this week, just before the NHS’s 77th birthday on Saturday, found that about 60% of voters have seen little improvement in it during Labour’s first year in office.Twelve key takeaways from Labour’s 10-year NHS planRead moreAbout the same proportion do not expect things to be much better by the time of the next election in 2029. It is hyperbole to say, as the plan does, that “the NHS now stands at an existential brink”. The dissatisfaction with access problems is acute – but behind it lies enduring public support for the service itself.However, it is no wonder Keir Starmer andWes Streetinghave acknowledged the seriousness of the patient’s condition and diagnosed radical surgery. It is blindingly obvious that, as the plan says, “the status quo is no longer an option”.The authors of the 168-page document have produced a serious, detailed and impressive piece of work.It is unsparing in describing the many failings that mean the NHS is not just often frustrating for patients to use but also ill-equipped to deal with the relentless demand for care created by an ageing, growing and increasingly unhealthy population, which is unlikely to fall soon. It also charts a new course for a service so indispensable that it is part of the nation’s DNA.Labour’s repeated claim that the Conservatives had left the NHS “broken” helped win them last year’s general election. And it has allowed the party during its time in government to blame the service’s every dysfunction – staff shortages, overcrowded hospitals, inadequate mental health care – on its predecessors.But that time is over.The planimplicitly acknowledges that this narrative, a frequent refrain by Streeting, is no longer enough. After a year in power, this is Labour’s prescription for how it will nurse the patient back to health.This – progress on delivering the planned transformation – is now a legitimate yardstick by which to judge Labour’s stewardship of the nation’s most treasured institution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But its key objectives – “three big shifts” in the NHS’s modus operandi, from analogue to digital, treatment to prevention and hospital to community-based care – are familiar.They have been the stuff of previous NHS plans, and multiple inquiries, for decades – much promised, but rarely delivered.For example, the planned network of new “neighbourhood health centres”, with teams of health professionals and patient-friendly long opening hours, are very similar to the“Darzi centres” proposed by the last Labour administration, of which few actually opened.Streeting does not pretend that the job of transformation will be easy. But there is a daunting array of obstacles to overcome.Will money needed to temporarily “double run” old and new services during the transition be found? Will staff used to working in hospitals prove willing to switch to community settings?Will the gamble on technology pay off? Will the plan’s failure to include big shifts to improve public health – such as mandatory reformulation of food or minimum unit pricing of alcohol – mean that the tidal wave of often-avoidable illness continues to outrun the NHS’s ability to treat it?And will the decision to shed half of NHS England’s 15,300 staff during its merger with the Department of Health and Social Care mean that Streeting does not have enough progress-chasers to ensure his tablets of stone are yielding real change?But the greatest risk Streeting faces is time. Alan Milburn, health secretary under Tony Blair and now Streeting’s chief adviser, admitted later that the 2000 NHS plan bought him time to rescue the service from the derelict state his predecessors had left it in.But the often snail-like pace of previous NHS reforms suggests that, despite Labour having four more years in power, even that may not be enough for this plan to produce real, tangible benefits – changes to waiting times and the convenience of interacting with the NHS that patients notice.Voters keen to see “our NHS” restored and improved may need to temper their expectations of rapid change, and ministers may have to do so too.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealth policyLabourWes StreetingDoctorsHospitalsEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

If that bet doesn’t pay off the NHS could face an even larger staffing crisis.”By 2028 the app will let patients access a new single patient record containing details of previous interactions with the NHS such as tests, operations and outpatient appointments.The prime minister, Keir Starmer, told an audience of frontline staff in east London: “Look at your phones, look at your apps — because what you see on that screen is that entire industries have reorganised around apps. Retail, transport, finance, weather — you name it. Why can’t we do that with health?”He said: “We will transform the NHS app so it becomes an indispensable part of life for everyone. It will become, as technology develops, like having a doctor in your pocket, providing you with 24-hour advice, seven days a week.”The NHS’s embrace of tech to tackle its ills will also involve AI taking notes during GPs’ and hospital doctors’ consultations with patients and use generative AI to create the first draft of care plans, in an effort to give clinicians more time with the sick.In a move designed to drive up standards of care, patients will be able to see the data underpinning the rankings of hospital league tables, which will be published for the first time this summer – such as waiting times, how patients have rated particular services, and details of their clinical outcomes – and use it to choose the NHS trust where they will have their next treatment.Expanding the role of technology to help the NHS “could be a real gamechanger”, said Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have a lot more work to do and we will do it.“But let’s be under no illusions. Because of the fair choices we made, the tough Labour decisions we made, the future already looks better for our NHS.”The plan makes clear that in future, the more prevention-focused NHS will operate on the basis that “care should happen as locally as it can; [be] digitally by default; in a patient’s home if possible; in a neighbourhood health centre when needed; [and] in a hospital if necessary”.Over the next few years, billions of pounds of NHS funding will be taken away from hospitals and used to create a network of new one-stop-shop-style neighbourhood health centres “in every community” offering a range of services, including diagnostic tests and mental health support. However, it is unclear how many there will be or when they will open.Dr Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of theHealthFoundation, warned that even Labour’s cash injection would not be enough to fulfil its pledge to “get the NHS back on its feet”.“Making the plan happen with the resources on offer will be tough,” she said, given that the average 2.8% rise in the NHS’s budget from 2026 to 2029 was well below its historical average of 3.7%.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyWes StreetingNHSHospitalsPublic services policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s mean, brutal’: Trump bill to cause most harm to America’s poorestPresident embraces Robin-Hood-in-reverse policies to benefit wealthiest and hurt those earning under $50,000Steven GreenhouseThu 3 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 13.55 EDTShareLast November, Donald Trumpmade a solemn vowto all Americans: “Every citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.” Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean pain for millions.Trump has pushed to enact the Republicanbudget bill, which would make significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the 30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a year.Even as Trump and Republican lawmakers are rushing to cut over $1.4tn in health and food assistance for non-affluent Americans, Trump continues to pressure Congress to extend over $3tn in tax cuts that disproportionately help the wealthy and corporations.Trump has embraced these Robin-Hood-in-reverse policies, even though it was votersearning less than $50,000a year who delivered victory to him last November. They favored him over Kamala Harris by 50% to 48%, according to exit polls, while Trump and Harris tied among voters earning $50,000 or more a year.Several social policy experts said Trump has engaged in hypocrisy at best and betrayal at worst when it comes to the working-class and blue-collar Americans he promised to fight for. Speaking about the Republicans’ “big, beautiful” budget bill, Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said: “Who’s getting hit, who’s bearing the cost? It’s people with low and middle incomes, people that the president and many Republican policymakers promised to serve and support in the last election.”View image in fullscreenMike Johnson talks to reporters in Washington on Wednesday.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe budget bill would mean a net financial loss for the bottom 30% of American households by income – after factoring in its tax provisions and cuts in benefits. The House bill would hit the lowest-earning 10% of Americans hardest: for them, it would meana painful $1,600 cutin income on average (a 3.9% drop), according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). At the same time, the Trump-backed bill would be a boon to wealthy households – it would mean a $12,000 increase in net income, on average, for households in the top 10%, those earning above $692,000 a year. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the top 0.1% – those with income over $3.3m – wouldreceive tax cuts of $103,500on average.The CBO says the income of the bottom10% tops off at $22,868(before factoring in government transfers). The second lowest decile earns from $22,868 to $43,137; the third decile earns up to $55,628; and the fourth up to $68,601.The Yale Budget Lab found that the bottom 20% of US households would see their incomesdrop by 2.9%on average over the next decade, and the second lowest quintile – moderate-income households – would suffer a 0.4% loss of income on average. But the richest 20% would see their incomes rise by 2.3%. Those in the top 1% would see theirincomes climb by $29,585on average.Trump is demanding these big tax cuts for the rich even though the CBO says the budget bill will increase thefederal debt by $3.3tn– a move that will push up interest rates and make mortgages and home-buying more expensive.According to the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning thinktank, the $121bn tax cuts that would go just to the richest 1% next year aresignificantly more than all the tax cutsthat would go to the bottom 60% of Americans in terms of income.The poorest 20% of Americans would receive just 1% of the bill’s tax cuts next year, while the highest earning 5% would receive 44% of the cuts.Last week, Trump urged lawmakers to enact the bill, saying: “There are hundreds of things in there.It is so good.” At a news conference, the president said the more than $1tn in Medicaid and food assistance cuts wouldn’t hurt anyone.“Itwon’t affect anybody,” he said. “It is just fraud, waste and abuse.”But Parrott took a sharply different view: “The bill stands alone historically for its unique upside-down mix of large tax cuts for the top, deep cuts that affect low- and middle-income people, and massive increases in deficits and debt.”John Ricco, the Yale Budget Lab’s associate director of policy analysis, said: “It’s unambiguous that low- and moderate-income Americans will be worse off on average under the budget bill, and that’s principally because the cuts in Medicaid and Snap [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] would by definition fall most heavily on these groups,” Ricco said.Jeanne Lambrew, the Century Foundation’s director of health policy reform, estimates that at least 16 million Americans will lose health coverage because of the budget bill – refuting White House claims that“no one will losecoverage”. Lambrew said the bill would cause amore than 50% increasein the number of uninsured nationwide, to nearly 45 million people.What’s more, the Trump-backed plan sharply reduces Affordable Care Act subsidies, and that will force millions of Americans to either drop coverage or pay far more for coverage. Millions of Americans will find it harder to obtain healthcare, with many forced to take on far more medical debt.While Trump and many Republicans say the Medicaid cuts are all about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse”, Lambrew calculates that a mere 3.5% of the $1tn in healthcare cuts come from cutting waste and abuse. “What Trump has been saying is, ‘We’re not cutting Medicaid. We’re just cutting fraud.’ That’s gaslighting.” Lambrew said.Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, sent the Senate a letter thatharshly criticized the budget bill. “As Pope Leo XIV recently stated, it is the responsibility of politicians to promote and protect the common good, including by working to overcome great wealth inequality,” he wrote. “This bill does not answer this call. It takes from the poor to give to the wealthy.”According to aQuinnipiac University poll, only 27% of registered voters support the GOP budget bill, while 53% oppose it. AFox News pollfound that 38% support the bill, while 59% oppose it.The House bill’s deep cuts in food benefits will cause7 million people, including over 2 million children, to lose food aidor have their food aid cut significantly. The Trump-supported bill also makes sharp cuts in Pell grant awards. The Center for American Progress says this means4.4 million studentsfrom low- and moderate-income families could lose some or all of their federal grant aid.In another blow to Americans earning under $50,000, Trump pushed to have the budget billeliminate the “Low-Income HomeEnergy Assistance Program”, which, as one website put it,“keeps poor people from freezingto death at home”. Killing the program would end heating subsidies for 6 million Americans, but so far congressional Republicans have spared the program and not bowed to Trump on this.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump wears a USA hat as he steps off Air Force One in Amsterdam in June.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersIn another blow to blue-collar Americans, the bill would undo much of Joe Biden’s efforts to speed the creation of clean-energy industries, and that could puthundreds of thousands of potential jobsat risk, many of them factory jobs.“In this bill, folks in Congress went out of their way not to give anything to low-income people,” said Chuck Marr, vice-president for federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. He noted that in previous tax cut bills that favored the rich, GOP lawmakers made sure to include some sweeteners for low- and moderate-income Americans.“But in this bill,” Marr said, “folks in Congress said: no, we’re going to go after these people. They’re going after healthcare and food, and these are the people who are also going to get hammered by Trump’s tariffs.” Lower-income people spend a higher percentage of their income on goods.“This bill is a major shift,” Marr added. “They’re taking away from poor people and working-class people and channeling it to very high-income people. I think it’s punitive. It’s harsh. It’s mean, brutal.”Trump’s tariffs would also hit less affluent Americans hardest.One study foundthat Trump’s planned tariffs would cause the bottom 20% of households to pay up to 5.5% of their income toward tariff-caused higher prices. That’s more than two and a half times the percentage that those in the top 20% would pay (2.1% of income).Trump has repeatedly boasted that the bill contains several provisions he championed to help working-class Americans. At a White House event to promote the bill, he pointed to a DoorDash driver from Wisconsin who was on hand to help make his case that the “no tax on tips” provision would help workers.But tax experts say that provision will help only a tiny fraction of those earning under $50,000. Only 4% of workersin the bottom half by income are in tipped jobs. Moreover, nearly two-fifths of tipped workers are already earning so little that they don’t pay federal income taxes.“Given how the current income tax system works, this provision will provide little or no benefit to those workers,” said Ricco. “Those workers tend to have low incomes, and the US system doesn’t basically tax their incomes, and this won’t offer them any additional tax reduction.” In other words, the server making $100,000 a year at a high-end restaurant will benefit substantially from no tax on tips, while the hotel housekeeper or 20-hour-a-week waiter at a diner making $25,000 a year will be helped little or not at all.As for Trump’s much-ballyhooed “no tax on overtime” provision, that, too, will do little for those earning under $50,000, Ricco said. “That provision is really geared to middle- and upper-middle groups,” he said. “People in the bottom 50% aren’t paying much income tax, and so no tax on overtime wouldn’t benefit them much. People in the bottom 40%, they’re often in a precarious employment situation. They’re generally not working 45 or 50 hours a week.”Ricco estimated that for Americans in the bottom 40% by income, the no tax on overtime provision will mean “less than a $10 tax cut per year”. “It’s essentially a rounding error,” he said.It’s the harshest bill we’ve ever seen since budget deficits became an issueChuck MarrRepublicans boast that increasing the child-tax credit will help millions of struggling families – the House bill would increase that credit, now $2,000, to $2,500, while the Senate raises it to $2,200. Under current law, one in four children – about 17 million – are ineligible to qualify for the full $2,000 credit because their family’s income is too low to qualify for the full credit. A two-parent family with two children needs toearn over $48,000to obtain the full credit.Under the House bill, a single parent with two children who earns $16,000 a year would get no additional tax credit, while a married couple withtwo kids and a $400,000 incomewould see their tax credit jump by $1,000.With their eagerness to cut the social safety net, Republicans seem to be treating millions of Americans who earn less than $50,000 as undeserving takers. “People earning under $50,000 are major targets of the Republican agenda. Their health coverage is targeted. Their food security is targeted,” said Marr. “They are left out of key provisions expanding tax cuts, like the child tax credit. They are most at risk from the Republican tariffs. They’ll be hurt across the board.”Marr said the budget bill treats “these people very harshly”.“It’s the harshest bill we’ve ever seen since budget deficits became an issue 40 years ago,” he said. “This is the first bill that simultaneously targets programs for poor people and working-class people to pay for it, and then takes that money to pay for tax cuts for very wealthy people. It makes poor and working-class people worse off. That’s not been done before.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyUS politicsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Negotiators will only accept this, however, in exchange for an extension in talks and possible concessions on a 25% car tariff, which is hurting the German car industry, sources said.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, hinted a deal was possible after meetingthe EU’s trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, on Thursday morning in Washington.“We’ll see what we can do with the EU,” he told reporters at a wider briefing on treasury matters, declaring on the eve of 4 July celebrations that the US was “going to see a lot more trade deals”.The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, are scheduled to continue talks withŠefčovičon Thursday afternoon. EU ambassadors are expected to be briefed on the talks on Friday.Bessent said Greer would be “working diligently over the weekend” with European officials.Trump hasthreatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU goods from 9 Julyunless the two sides reach a deal. Most EU goods already face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts and 50% on steel and aluminium.The push for a narrowly focused UK-style agreement in principle comes days after the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, reiterated his calls for a quick deal. “It is better to achieve a quick and simple solution than a lengthy and complicated one that remains in the negotiation stage for months,” he said in Berlin.Merz said a quick deal was needed “to remove the burden of tariffs on our businesses, which are far too high”, and that the current talks were “not about a minutely detailed trade deal” but “the quick resolution of a tariff dispute”.Šefčovič was seeking a standstill clause to provide “guarantees that the US can stand over” that there would be no imposition of new tariffs in any extension period, said one politician with knowledge of the talks.One EU diplomat said they expected a deal “if not this week then before Wednesday”, because it was “in everybody’s interest”.“It will be very high level, but enough for Trump to declare victory,” said one source. Some believe a deal could even be struck this week, giving the US president a significant announcement on 4 July Independence Day celebrations on Friday.Talks between the EU and the US have been taking place since early April when Trump imposed tariffs on 60-plus countries in a theatrical “liberation day” presentation. He hasconcluded a formal dealwith only one of those countries, the UK, although heclaims to have struck agreements with Vietnam and China.One source said the EU delegation that flew to Washington for talks in April was handed a “massive tome” on US “grievances, country by country”. “There were about 30 pages on the EU alone,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And as far as I’m informed, there are only two countries so far worldwide that have concluded with an agreement in principle.”Others said Trump’s frustration lay with the approach of a European institution used to dealing with 27 member states and the minute detail of regulation.They also indicated that the US’s latest proposal – sent to EU leaders last Wednesday – “did not include any details on … concessions from the US side”.In a briefing to EU ambassadors this week, von der Leyen’s chief of staff, Bjoern Seibert, and the director general of the commission’s trade department, Sabine Weyand, told member states the US wanted deals on four areas including tariffs.The other three issues were strategically important sectors such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, economic purchases such as oil and gas, and non-trade barriers including tech, food and car regulation, all red lines for the EU.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsUS foreign policyEuropeTariffsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead,3,000 more jobs were added in June compared with May, according to new job figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The unemployment rate actually decreased to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May.Job gains were seen in state government and healthcare, which saw increases of 47,000 and 39,000 jobs, respectively. Meanwhile, federal government job losses continued, with another 7,000 roles down in June, as theTrump administrationcontinues to cut jobs. The total job loss in the federal government has been 69,000 since January.Though thepresident’s tariffshave rocked the US stock market, which has seen a dramatic rebound after dipping down 15% in the spring, economists have been worrying that the labor market has just been slower to show sensitivity to the tariffs.New data had shown employers showing signs of hesitancy. The payroll firm ADP found that the private sectorlost 33,000 jobsin June, far below the 100,000 increase that was expected, and the first decrease since March 2023.The dip in job openings does no necessarily mean companies are laying off more workers; rather, they are creating fewer new positions.“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, in a statement.John Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs, said the American economy was “breaking more to the positive” than many expected after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs in early April.“TheUS economyis surprisingly resilient, both in terms of consumer spend [and] the labor dynamic,” Waldron told reporters on Thursday. “And just general economic economic activity is stronger than one might have guessed if you were sitting here on April 3, projecting what the tariff policy would deliver.”Data from BLSthat measures job openings and turnoversin the labor market found that while job openings had climbed in May, to its highest level since November, the vast majority of openings were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry. Economists with Citigroup said the spike in new jobs could be temporary as companies opened new positions in response to Trump’s crackdown onimmigrants, fearing that immigrant employees could lose work permits.The White House has spent the last few months downplaying the impact tariffs have on the domestic economy, despite anxiety from consumers and businesses over the impact tariffs have on prices.The deadline for Trump’s 90-day pause on some of his highest tariffs is scheduled to expire next week, as the White House tries to broker deals with dozens of countries that could face high tariffs.Federal Reserve chair blames Trump’s tariffs for preventing interest rate cutsRead moreThe White House announced on Tuesday adeal with Vietnam, whose products were scheduled to face a 46% tariff. The country agreed to a 20% tariff rate, with no tariffs placed on US exports. The deal with Vietnam follows deals Trump has made with the UK and China, but there are dozens of other countries whose exports could face high tariffs without a deal.Amid economic uncertainty, Trump has tried to pass blame on to the Federal Reserve and its chair,Jerome Powell. On Monday, Trumpsent an open letterto Powell demanding that the Fed lower interest rates.“He’s costing us a fortune because he keeps the rate way up,” Trump wrote on social media.Powell, in turn, has said that the Fed has not lowered interest rates because of economic uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs.“In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,” Powell said. “Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.”Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataEconomicsUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationTariffsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The 28-year-old father of three, who married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, 11 days earlier, was killed alongside his brother André Silva when the Lamborghini they were travelling in veered off a road.Jota and the 25-year-old Silva died at about 12.40am local time on Thursday in the province of Zamora. The cause of the accident has not been confirmed but Spain’s Civil Guard said it believed the car had sustained a puncture while overtaking, causing the driver to lose control. The Lamborghini burst into flames and firefighters had to extinguish a blaze in the surrounding vegetation caused by the accident. The wreckage of the vehicle was visible by the side of the A-52 near Cernadilla on Thursday. The brothers’ funeral will be on Saturday morning in the Gondomar area of Porto where they grew up.Senseless death of Diogo Jota will not stop us celebrating what he brought life | Barney RonayRead moreLiverpool said they were devastated and their former manager Jürgen Klopp, who signed Jota from Wolves, posted on Instagram that he was heartbroken. Klopp, a religious man, wrote: “This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose! But I can’t see it!” Liverpool’s head coach, Arne Slot, said Jota was “a loved one to all of us” and “the essence of what a Liverpool player should be”. Slot added: “The last time we spoke, I congratulated Diogo on winning the Nations League and wished him luck for his forthcoming wedding. In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this.”Tributes were paid from across the football spectrum to Jota and Silva, a professional footballer with the second-tier Portuguese club Penafiel. Cristiano Ronaldo said the death “doesn’t make any sense. Just now we were together in the national team, just now you were married. To your family, to your wife, your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them. R.I.P Diogo and André.

The Liverpool legend Sir Kenny Dalglish said: “Football is not important at this sad time. You feel helpless, knowing there’s so little we can do to ease the pain for his wife of just two weeks, his three beautiful children.” Darwin Núñez, Dominic Szoboszlai and Harvey Elliott were among the Liverpool players to post tributes. Elliott described the forward as “humble, hardworking, kind, and always there for anyone that needed anything”. The Liverpool squad are due to report back for pre-season training early next week and are scheduled to play their first friendly at Preston on Sunday 13 July.Jota joined Liverpool for £41m in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club. A superb finisher, known as “Jota the slotter” by Liverpool fans, he won the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup with Liverpool and the 2018 Championship title with Wolves. He was also a two-time winner of the Nations League withPortugal. His last game was the Nations League final penalty shootout victory over Spain on 8 June. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: “Just three weeks ago, I had the honour of presenting Diogo Jota with a medal after the Uefa Nations League final – a moment of joy, pride, and celebration that will now for ever be burned in memory with sorrow.”A map showing the location of the car crashJota, who scored 14 goals in 49 Portugal appearances, was an immensely popular figure in the Liverpool dressing room. “Liverpool Football Club are devastated by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota,” said a club statement that also requested “the privacy of Diogo and André’s family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss. We will continue to provide them with our full support.”Liverpool have opened a book of condolence that can be signed at Anfield until Sunday, along with a digital version.

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), he had been living in the US unlawfully and posed a significant threat to public safety.Nonetheless, just five days before his arrest, Chávez Jr was allowed to participate in a heavily promoted boxing match against the YouTuber-turned-fighter Jake Paul in Anaheim. The fight promoter claimed that the match which Chávez Jrlostto Paul proved to be the highest-grossing boxing event ever held at Anaheim’s Honda Center, with one outlet estimating it generated more than $1.5m in gate revenue.Chávez Jr first entered the US legally on a six-month tourist visa in August 2023. He later filed for permanent residency in April 2024, citing marriage to a US citizen. That application raised alarms within federal agencies due to what officials described as “multiple fraudulent statements” and connections to the Sinaloa cartel, a powerful drug-trafficking organization labeled a foreign terrorist group by the Trump administration.His arrest comes amid mounting political tension over the Biden administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Internal DHS documents reportedly showed that although Chávez was flagged as an “egregious public safety threat” in December 2024, his removal was not prioritized. In January 2025, despite those warnings, Chávez was allowed re-entry into the country at the San Ysidro port of entry in California under a discretionary parole process.“This Sinaloa Cartel affiliate with an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition, and explosives was arrested by Ice,” said the DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a sharply worded statement. “It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and come back into our country.”Federal officials allege Chávez Jr has longstanding ties to organized crime. In Mexico, he is wanted on charges of weapons trafficking and manufacturing explosives without authorization. In the United States, he has a criminal record dating back more than a decade. He was convicted of DUI in California in 2012, and more recently, in January 2024, he was convicted of illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacturing or importing a short-barreled rifle.The boxer has struggled with substance abuse and legal trouble throughout his career. Once seen as a rising star in Mexican boxing, who held the WorldBoxingCouncil’s version of the middleweight title from 2011 through 2012, his in-ring performances in recent years have been overshadowed by repeated arrests, erratic behavior and suspensions.Chávez’s wife – through whom he filed for a green card – has also drawn scrutiny. DHS officials say she was previously in a relationship with one of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons, though she has not been charged with any crime.Chávez is currently in Ice custody and will be processed for expedited removal. A spokesperson for his legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The arrest highlights ongoing friction between immigration enforcement priorities and public safety concerns.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But for now it is patience, not power, that’s his defining traitMichael Venutolo-MantovaniThu 3 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 08.29 EDTShareMatteo Jorgenson is big. Not in the way Dexter Lawrence or Chet Holmgren are big. Not in the sense that most American athletes are considered big. But in the world of professional cycling, Matteo Jorgenson is big. In fact, cycling might be one of the only sports in which a man who stands 6ft 4in (1.93m) and weighs around 70kg (154lbs) is consideredbig.With broad shoulders and a wide chest that can act like a sail in the wind, Jorgenson is the kind of size that usually rules riders out of contention for Grand Tours such as theTour de Franceor the Giro d’Italia. Why? Because Grand Tours are won in the mountains, and big riders don’t climb.But Matteo Jorgenson can climb – because even though he’s tall, he’s still remarkably light for his size. His body is a rare blend of long limbs, powerful legs and low weight. It’s a build that allows him to soar up Alpine and Pyrenean slopes with the speed and elegance of his Visma–Lease a Bike teammate Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time Tour winner, who at 5ft 9in and about 57kg (125lbs) is one of the finest climbers on earth.And when you can climb, people always seem to ask the same question: when is Matteo Jorgenson going for GC?That’s cycling shorthand for general classification – in other words, when is Jorgenson going to try to win the Tour de France? It could also mean the Giro or the Vuelta a España, the other two three-week Grand Tours.GC means targeting the overall standings: the yellow jersey in the Tour, pink in the Giro, red in the Vuelta.Most riders who stand 6ft 3in and weigh 70kg don’t get asked this question, because most riders that size don’t stand a chance at GC: they can’t climb. Bigger riders tend to aim for sprint stages or specialize in the Classics, one-day races like the Tour of Flanders or Paris-Roubaix, where weight and strength help on the brutal cobbled roads of northern Europe.But Jorgenson might just have the legs to win a Grand Tour. He proved as much last year, finishing eighth overall in the Tour de France.For now, riding alongside arguably one of the greatest GC riders of all time in Vingegaard, it’s unlikely Jorgenson will get the chance to lead Visma at the Tour. Instead, he will ride in service of Vingegaard as a domestique – a rider who supports the team leader – while hunting for stage wins where possible.So why not go for GC at the Giro or the Vuelta, and potentially become just the second American to win the former and the third to win the latter?Because, according to Jorgenson, it’s not quite time yet.Matteo Jorgenson may be known for his size. But patience might become his defining trait.Jorgenson grew up racing bikes in his native Boise, Idaho. When he was six, his parents enrolled him and his brother in a local cycling club called Byrds: the Boise Young Rider Development Squad. The idea wasn’t to create elite racers, but simply to get the kids outside and active.But racing stuck. By eight, Jorgenson was competing in mountain bike and cyclocross events – off-road races somewhere between mountain biking and road cycling. By nine, he was travelling as far as Oregon to race in his first cyclocross national championships. Within a year, he was also racing on the road.By 14, Jorgenson knew that if he was going to become a professional, he’d need to specialize. When an opportunity came to join Hot Tubes, the most successful US junior development team, he committed fully to road racing.At 16, after domestic success, Jorgenson travelled with the US national team to race in Belgium, the heartland of road cycling.“I was really dogshit in Europe,” Jorgenson tells me from Sierra Nevada, Spain, where he’s at altitude training camp with Visma, preparing for the Tour de France.Despite being humbled in Belgium, he wasn’t discouraged. He knew his European peers had been racing tight packs on narrow roads for years, while he was still new to it all.In hindsight, that trip was pivotal.“If I’d stayed in the US, I would have thought I was a really good bike racer,” he says. “I could win nationals in the US and then go to Belgium and get dropped in the first 20 minutes.”Over the next few years, he raced domestically with Hot Tubes and in Europe with the US under-23 team, hoping to sign for a WorldTour team, the top level of global professional cycling.At 19, Jorgenson joined the development team of Van Rysel–AG2R La Mondiale, relocating to Chambéry in the French Alps. He lived with 12 French riders and enrolled in full-time French language classes.After placing fourth in a small French stage race, the Ronde de l’Isard, he signed with Spain’s Movistar: the oldest team in the WorldTour. At just 20, he was racing Strade Bianche, Milan–San Remo, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the cobbled Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad – the same roads where, just a few years earlier, he’d been dropped early.In 2021, he made his Grand Tour debut at the Giro. In 2022, he rode his first Tour de France.But it was in the 2023 Tour where Jorgenson announced himself to the wider sporting world. On stage nine, he launched a solo breakaway some 40km from the finish. He hit the base of the Puy de Dôme – a mythical mountain climb unseen in the Tour since 1988 – with a near one-minute lead.View image in fullscreenIn 2021, Matteo Jorgenson made his Grand Tour debut at the Giro. In 2022, he rode his first Tour de France.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesSpectators were banned on the final climb, which lies inside a national park. The silence was eerie. Then his radio cut out. Alone, with no encouragement or strategy coming from the team car, Jorgenson pushed on.But anyone who knows cycling knew what was coming: he would be caught.And he was, just 500 meters from the line. Then a second rider passed. Then a third. In the space of a few pedal strokes, Jorgenson went from would-be Tour stage winner to missing the podium entirely.“I left that stage hugely disappointed and pretty sick of the sport,” he says. “It’s not a happy memory at all for me.”Still, fans love heroic attacks. Even in defeat, Jorgenson had made his name.Soon after, he announced a move from Movistar to Dutch powerhouse Visma–Lease a Bike (then Jumbo-Visma), who would go on to win all three Grand Tours that year, a historic clean sweep.Despite joining a team stacked with stars, Jorgenson was drawn to Visma’s obsession with data, tech and marginal gains.“I wasn’t looking for the team with the most opportunities,” he says. “I was looking for the team that would give me the best structure to get the most out of myself. The most technological, the most motivated to progress. I’d been searching for what Visma had for years.”The results came quickly. In 2024, Jorgenson won the eight-stage Paris–Nice, followed by the one-day Dwars door Vlaanderen. He placed second in the Critérium du Dauphiné – often seen as a Tour warm-up – finished eighth in the Tour itself, and ninth in the Olympic road race. This year, he defended his Paris–Nice title and placed in the top 10 at the E3 Saxo Classic.Which brings us back to that question: will Matteo Jorgenson chase GC?With Vingegaard still recovering from injury, Visma entered 2024 without a clear leader for the Giro. The team offered Jorgenson the chance to lead. Despite last year’s Tour top 10, he declined.“I really wanted to do another Tour supporting Jonas first,” he says. The team also encouraged him to hunt stage wins for himself. “But the top 10 in the Tour last year showed me that I am capable of competing for a GC. Trying to win a Grand Tour is one of my ambitions now. But it’s a project that may take me many years to get there.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025US sportsCyclingTour de FranceGiro d'ItaliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Late last summer, the United States men’s national team went out and hired the most qualified manager it could find. The one with the most impressive coaching resume by far of anyone US Soccer had ever employed on the men’s side. The most expensive, certainly. By a multiple. The man brought in to arrest the tailspin the USMNT had slowly slipped into after the 2022 World Cup. To finally unlock that elusive next level. To help a golden generation, or at least a shiny one, come good at last. To salvage something, anything, from a World Cup played mostly on home soil a year from now. Not to squander it all.And what shouldMauricio Pochettinoadd to the US national team’s brew of aptitudes and attitudes but pluck and grit? The very same underdog mentality, the ferocity and fitness, that had once taken the US from global laughingstocks to merely unembarrassing and then to internationally competitiveness.Diego Luna double fires US past Guatemala and into Gold Cup finalRead moreThat sort of mindset had a ceiling, it was decided a decade and a half or so ago. And the Yanks kept on bumping their heads into it. So they hired Jürgen Klinsmann to sprinkle his fairy dust over the team, except he didn’t understand how to execute his own lofty plans and dismantled the team’s mentality-monster culture in the process. And then Gregg Berhalter brought it back for a bit, only to misplace it again.That was still more or less the shape the US was in three weeks ago. A mirthless two-loss debacle at the Concacaf Nations League in March. Two more defeats to Turkey and Switzerland, both playing at three-quarters speed, in early June. The Americans were underdogs again. Long shots. A soccer community mumbled to itself about those 10 regulars lost to rest and injuries and the Club World Cup.Since then, something elemental has been reclaimed. The USMNT are competitive again, proud again. By going back to basics.They ground outa 2-1 semi-final result against Guatemalain St Louis on Wednesday, courtesy of Diego Luna’s 15-minute brace, to reach Sunday’s Gold Cup final with Mexico in Houston on Sunday – a record 13th appearance in the regional title game.In the broad assessment of Pochettino’s time in charge of the US – likely following the World Cup when he’ll probably go chase after some other project, as is the wont of the most sought-after managers – Sunday’s penalty shoot-out win over Costa Rica in the quarterfinal will likely loom large. The Americans prevailedin a feisty game, matching the intensity of an opponent intent on making a slugfest out of the bout, showing some personality at long last.On Tuesday, Pochettino elaborated on just how much he appreciated the urgency with which his team had rallied around Malik Tillman that day. The American attacking linchpin was taunted by some of hisTicoopponents after missing a penalty, whereupon a big scuffle broke out involving the entire US team. “It’s the whole group,” Pochettino said, clearly delighted that the press conference had landed on the merits of a good scuffle. “It’s the keeper [Matt Freese] also, because he ran 100 meters to be in the fight. That was amazing. That means something. For me, I’m Argentino – we love to fight – that means a lot.“That means that we are connected, that we care about my teammates,” Pochettino continued. “That needs to be natural between them. We can select 26 players, but to be a team is a different thing.”He liked, the Argentine said, that after four weeks together, team meals were lively. That the three tables the USMNT eats at have an energy sparking between them that makes them feel like one. Or something. “That is a spontaneous situation that you cannot force, you cannot push,” said Pochettino.The long and short of it is the Americans are a team again.View image in fullscreenDiego Luna of the United States celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Guatemala during the first half of Wednesday’s game.Photograph: Kyle Rivas/Getty ImagesCertainly, there is sophistication at work in their run to the Gold Cup final as well. This incarnation of the USMNT is increasingly well-drilled in its defensive organization and attacking patterns. A team that was inexperienced and unfamiliar a month ago moves as a unit, shifts shapes in transition, zings the ball around cleanly. Within a clear structure, there is room for Tillman and Luna to express themselves, to roam and to assert their influence both creatively and as the team’s high pressers. The Americans have scored some wonderfully well worked goals in this tournament.The victory over Guatemala made for a strange sort of game. The US were utterly dominant early and ran out to a quick 2-0 lead, only to spend the rest of the game defending it increasingly frantically against the world’s 106th-ranked team, getting outshot 20-12.Before a heavily pro-Guatemalan crowd at Energizer Park in St Louis, one of the spiritual homes of the American game, Guatemala played in their first Gold Cup semi-final in 29 years. They turned up with a roster that was domestically based but for six players active in the US and Canada and one each in Romania and Moldova. These were not pedigreed players, yet their countrymen in the stands roared for a second successive upset, afterLos Chapinesdispatched Canada on penalties in the last round.“Today, I need to tell you, it was like to play in Guatemala, in Tegucigalpa,” said Pochettino. “And that was good for our players, because it was an atmosphere we didn’t expect.”In the fourth minute, Luca de la Torre shot from outside the box, following a long, crisp American buildup. Luna snuck ahead of his marker, José Rosales, snagged the rebound and then tucked it past Kenderson Navarro. Ten minutes later, Luna ran at the box, beat his man with a stepover and located a crack of space and time to rip his shot past Navarro at the near post.From that point, Guatemala would be the aggressors, forcing several strong saves by Freese and seeing a goal disallowed as it put ever more attackers on the field. In the 80th minute, 18-year-old Olger Escobar found some room in the American area and finally beat Freese to narrow the score, provoking a furious final assault. Few things in soccer are quite as dangerous as an unchained team, playing for the equalizer with absolutely nothing to lose.Still the US held on, avoiding the penalty lottery that nearly undid them in the previous round, collecting just enough clearances and disrupted Guatemalan attacks to see out the clock. Perhaps there was something slightly undignified in clinging on against a team that, on paper, ought not be a threat. The other interpretation is that it was a sign of growth.“It’s the grit, it’s the determination that we’ve been lacking, to be honest,” Luna told Fox. “It’s fighting to the end, every ball, every moment.”Presently, it’s no use arguing with the USMNT’s pint-sized scrapper. For he has come to embody its new ethos.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

But Jota’s footballing talent, heart and will should be cherished, amid the griefThu 3 Jul 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 15.28 EDTShareBad moon, bad times and a river that will be overflowing for some time yet. It is impossible not to feel a deep sense of pain, sadness and shared heartbreak at news of the sudden death of Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva in a car crash in Spain. Jota was 28, father to three young children and a husband to his long-term partner, whom he married 11 days before his death.Things that happen in sport are often described, with due dramatic licence, as tragedies. This is not a sports story. But it is the most terrible human tragedy. Those who have suffered similarly can empathise. But it is above all a private horror, an event that will alter the lives of family and friends for ever.And yet it is of course a sport story too, and for good, warm, vital reasons, because Jota was blessed with the talent, heart and will that qualified him to live the extraordinary public life of a modern-day elite footballer. Within that nexus he was able to do so with the grace, humour and commitment that made him a beloved teammate and fan favourite, and also a fine public sporting figure, an athlete who poured energy, life and love into providing moments of uplift and connection in the shirts ofLiverpool, Wolves, Porto, Portugal and his first club, Paços de Ferreira.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota scores for Porto in their Champions League match against Leicester in December 2016.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesThere is no sensible response when someone dies so young, with an entire second human life as father and husband still to be lived. But at a time when footballers are present constantly in our lives, when to exist in that form is to carry a distinct kind of responsibility – one players such as Jota gladly assume – his death will be a source of much public grief too.Everybody liked Diogo Jota. Those who saw him progress from his Porto neighbourhood of Gondomar felt a huge sense of pride. Liverpool supporters cherished his presence, his intelligence and his hunger for the team. Three years ago he got the song his contributions deserved:He’s a lad fromPortugal/Better than Figo don’t you know, to the tune of Argentina’s 2014 World Cup final hymn, which is in turn derived and football-ised from Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Bad Moon Rising.And even in the immediate shock there is a huge amount to remember and be glad of in the life of Diogo José Teixeira da Silva, the Portuguese word for the letter J added early on as a footballing nickname. He came through at Paços de Ferreira to the north-east of his home city. Atlético Madrid signed him and loaned him to Porto and then Wolves, which became permanent in 2018.He settled instantly in Wolverhampton,hanging out at the Aromas de Portugal cafein the city centre, welcoming his first child, playing a bit of training-ground cricket, always ready to meet local people, and even revealing at one point that he’d grown up with a soft spot for Everton in the David Moyes years, because they were “relentless”.Nobody was ever going to hold that against Jota at Anfield. Have you met this guy? Too nice, too smart, too much of an all-round mensch.He signed in September 2020and set off like a train, scoring seven goals in his first 10 games and adding speed, drive and expert finishing to that mid-Klopp team.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota (left) with his then Wolves teammates Rúben Neves outside the Aromas De Portugal cafe in September 2018.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianOverall, and we must now sayfinally, Jota played 182 matches for Liverpool in a revolving folk‑hero frontline that also featured Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino, Divock Origi, Luis Díaz, Cody Gakpo and Darwin Núñez. Even within that extended cast he was distinct, notable for his intelligence, movement and commitment to the team cause. He made 49 appearances for Portugal and played the last 15 minutes ofthe Nations League final victoryfour weeks ago, which would turn out to be his last game of football.And now we have this, a full stop. Why does it seem quite so shocking, even from a distance, even beyond the fans who watched him in the flesh or on some fast-cut remote stream? Perhaps because Jota had that lightness about him, the kind of footballer who barely seems to leave a dent in the grass, who, for all the tactical match-smarts seems still to be playing the same endless teenage game, just in the way he moved and twirled into space.Perhaps because he was a notably intelligent forward, one of those players where you feel you know them just by watching them, every run and pass part of some high-speed internal monologue.Nothing will ease the private grief. There is no script for moments like theseProbably it has something to do with the way we observe sports people now generally, something to do with the way the game has become more remote, the connection coming in other ways, through the figures on the screen, the way they move and react, a strange kind of public-private intimacy.Plus, of course, this is just such a violent interruption. It makes no sense. Youth is a finite quality. But young, smart, beautiful, nice people are supposed to live for ever. Whereas in reality it is perhaps a blessing this doesn’t happen more often. Professional athletes live hugely intense, fast‑paced lives of constant travel and change. Rishabh Pant, who batted on Wednesday for India at Edgbaston, was lucky to escape with his life after a horrific car crash in Uttarakhand in December 2022,and is additionally cherishedfor every day he gets to keep on doing this.2:27Diogo Jota, Liverpool and Portugal footballer, dies aged 28 – videoJota will now be cherished instead as a vivid and indelible memory. He always spoke really well, which was part of that feeling of intimacy. After scoringa late winner against Tottenhamtwo years ago there was a notably lucid TV interview in which he gave an insight into his own connection to the moment after Liverpool had been pegged back late on.“I remember Robbo [Andy Robertson] telling me to go on because we normally play that long ball – to go on and believe, and you could feel that was already a good sign. We did that, we won the second ball, we played back, we played again in behind and I could intercept a pass and score the winner. It was amazing.“It doesn’t require too much thinking. I think the moment there that I believed I could intercept was key because I started running in behind and I saw their full-back could pass the ball back. That was the key moment for me and then it was just: ‘Make sure you control it right and you hit the target,’ and hopefully it’s in – and it was!”View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota scores Liverpool’s winner in April 2023 after Tottenham had come back to level from 3-0 down.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesJota also mentioned his song that day, which was sung relentlessly around Anfield at full-time, a coronational moment in a career that had begun in the hush of Covid.“In my first season I scored a few winners as well, late, but there was no crowd and everybody was telling me: ‘You should see it if this was full,’ the feeling, and I could feel that tonight. It was something special that I will remember for ever.”The reverse is of course now true. Anfield will remember Diogo Jota for ever. Nothing will ease the private grief. There is no script for moments like these. But for what it’s worth that song and the feeling behind it will provide its own fond, rolling Viking funeral in the years to come.Explore more on these topicsFootballLiverpoolPortugal (World news)Portugal (Football)Wolverhampton WandererscommentShareReuse this content"

They may not have shared a dressing room with Jota or his equally mourned brother, André Silva, but that cannot minimise the fact two members of their nation’s tightly-knit footballing family had been taken away in devastating circumstances.It took guts and no little honour to show up and keep running, probing, scrapping, hunting for moments to take pride in while their opponents left no doubt that they are runaway favourites for this competition. Spain should be lauded, too, for resisting any temptation to go easy, starting at a rattling pace and completing a thoroughly professional job. In their case that often means administering a sound beating and there is no escaping that they delivered one here.Arianna Caruso’s stunner earns Italy opening Euro 2025 win against BelgiumRead moreThey settled for five, Cristina Martín-Prieto adding late gloss, and could strike further fear into their rivals by giving a brief runout to Aitana Bonmatí. But the night’s awful context was always hanging, the heartbreaking fate of Portugal’s lost star a visual presence in the form of placards held among the fans. “You took the name of Portugal beyond borders,” read a tribute hung from the upper tier of the west stand. “Now it is our turn to raise your name.”Francisco Neto, the Portugal manager, did that himself after the match. He explained that he had coached Jota during a spell as assistant coach of the men’s under-19 side; the pair had remained on warm terms and Jota, true to every account of his personality, had taken a close interest in the fortunes of the women’s team.“Today is a really sad day because two of us lost their lives so young,” Neto said. “It’s not a good day. If we had the chance to change everything, of course we would.“Diogo followed our team because he loved the country. We kept in contact. When we would cross the room and see the men’s team, I would talk with him and he always knew our results. He knew the team, the players, and this is the culture we have in Portugal.”Jota embodied Portugal’s roaming, joyful, acutely accomplished football spirit. It is a matter of time before their women’s team, hoping for a first knockout spot this summer, produces heroes with his staying power. The Barcelona forward Kika Nazareth, a safe bet to be among them, was not deemed fit enough to start but would have been hard pressed to shift the dial. Even before tragedy visited them, opening their tournament against Spain looked the tallest of orders.View image in fullscreenVicky López slides in at the back post to double Spain’s lead in the seventh minute.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesThe improving condition of Bonmatí, who had caused widespread concern by contracting viral meningitis, bodes well for Spain although she requires handling with care. They should be able to ramp up without her, although this became a welcome opportunity to taper down. Montse Tomé’s team had scored 11 times in two Nations League ties against Portugal in April; here they were two up within seven minutes and, in mid-20s heat, could run through the hits when it suited thereafter.It took under 90 seconds for Esther González, found by a raking pass from the left-back Olga Carmona, to tame the ball smartly before improvising a deft finish past Pereira. The second quickly followed, Mariona Caldentey snaking a tantalising low cross from the other side and seeing the 18-year-old Vicky López convert at full stretch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They hung in admirably, Pereira saving from González and twice from Clàudia Pina. Between those chances Alexia Putellas sidefooted wide, but she would join in four minutes before half-time after a shimmy past Diana Gomes. González quickly doubled her tally, Pina’s cross striking the far post and presenting the simplest finish. It was no slight on Portugal that the favourites were impossible to subdue.The livewire Jessica Silva, among the players who made tributes to Jota on Instagram, symbolised Portugal’s appetite to persist. After the interval she tried to catch Adriana Nanclares out and then, blazing past Laia Aleixandri, forced a booking. A goal would have raised the roof and it almost came when Ana Capeta jabbed over. In the end Martín-Prieto had the last word but only one figure had, in truth, dominated thoughts all day.Portugal had been backed fabulously, their contingent largely culled from an extensive émigré community, and faced their most vocal bank of supporters together after the final whistle. They lined up behind a banner printed with “Thank you for everything, Diogo Jota”, the two groups acknowledging one another for an extended spell. They will never need telling to elevate his memory.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arianna Caruso’s spectacular first-half goal proved the difference in a close encounter against a well-organised Belgium.With the game evenly matched, it was one that required just a moment of quality. Caruso is Italy’s puppet-master, pulling the strings with ease from the heart of the midfield. Her goal was an example of what Italy can do when they are at their best.Belgium v Italy: Women’s Euro 2025 – liveRead moreWith space opening up, Caruso broke forward and collected Lucia Di Guglielmo’s pinpoint pass into her feet on the edge of the penalty area. The finish was exquisite, a curling shot past the helpless Lisa Lichtfus.The beauty of the goal was matched only by the majesty of the Swiss Alps that surrounded the scenic Stade de Tourbillon. This promised to be an intriguing encounter with both knowing how important a victory would be.Italy have been on a journey under Andrea Soncin since he took over the reins in September 2023. TheAzzurrehave undergone somewhat of a regeneration since. A technical and creative side, they beat Germany in December and recently finished second in their Nations League campaign.Soncin opted to change shape, moving to a back three of Martina Lenzini, Cecilia Salvai, Elena Linari in an attempt to control Belgium’s counterattacking potency. They were dealt a blow earlier in the week when the forward Chiara Beccari was ruled out of the tournament with a thigh injury but they are certainly not short of attacking talent. Leading the line was their captain and centurion, Cristiana Girelli. The 35-year-old striker continues to prove that age is but a number, finishing as top scorer in the Serie A Femminile this past season and now appearing in her fourth European Championship.Coming up against Belgium, however, has traditionally proven to be a hurdle for the Italians. Elisabet Gunnarsdóttir’s side have had some eye-catching results themselves in recent months – their3-2 victory over Englandin April was a highlight – and have enjoyed the better head-to-head record against the Italians in recent years. Euro 2022, in particular, would have been fresh in the memory when they edged past Italy in the group stage to reach the quarter-finals. They have their own talismanic forward in Tessa Wullaert, who drives her side forward with her energy and instinctive eye for goal.There was a sombre feeling before the game as players and fans stood inmemory of the Portugal and Liverpool player Diogo Jotaand his brother André Silva, who died in a car crash in the early hours of Thursday morning. It is news that has shaken the football world and was the first of four games where a minute’s silence will be held in tribute over the next two days.View image in fullscreenLucia Di Guglielmo (left) and Hannah Eurlings battle for possession with the Swiss Alps in view.Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/APFrom the first whistle, the game was tight and highly competitive, characterised by strong organisation and challenges. Belgium started the better, controlling possession. As predicted, they were at their best when they were able to break forward on transition, using the pace of Wullaert and the full-back Jill Janssens in particular. The pair had the Red Flames’ best opportunities in the first half; both misfired with agonising inaccuracy. Justine Vanhaevermaet’s physical presence was disrupting Italy in the middle of the park and as the BBC’s Vicki Sparks commented, she “towered over the Italians much like the mountains of Sion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The breakthrough came at the perfect time, a minute before the break, to take the wind out of their opponents’ sails.The second half was a scrappy affair as the play became littered with interruptions. Lichtfus made two important saves to ensure the deficit remained narrow, denying Girelli a clever back-heeled finish before getting a glove to Michela Cambiaghi’s effort.Italy finished the stronger and were able to see out an important three points before a meeting with Portugal.

With their European Championship Group D opener against France approaching on Saturday evening why shouldn’t the Lionesses head coach be calm? Wiegman has, after all, reached four major tournament finals in a row.However, she does acknowledge she has changed since taking over England four years ago, and there are far fewer rules in camp almost three years after she guided the Lionesses to theirfirst major trophy at Euro 2022: “My values won’t change but I have to adapt to new situations and figure out: ‘OK, what’s best for the team now?’Jorge Vilda, pay disputes and incredible talent on show – Wafcon 2024 about to start a year lateRead more“When I came in [2021], everyone was wearing jewellery and watches and I said: ‘No, we can’t wear jewellery. We measure everything and I want you to take off your earrings and things like that,’ so they did. [But] I actually hate rules. We are here to perform and be at our best, and if you use your common sense then you make the right decisions. We want to set standards, but I think coaching is also about giving players responsibility – help players make their own decisions.”For that reason, she does not enforce a seating plan for mealtimes, nor ask her players to rotate who they spend time with: “I don’t do that. When I was a school teacher I would do those things, but now it’s so intense, the players travel so much, playing at the highest level, they need to find some space away where they can just sit with who they want to. That headspace and relaxation, that’s good for the team.”Wiegman also allows her players to have free choice in their use of social media, though many avoid it amida rise in online abuse.“Yes, there is a concern,” Wiegman says. “Of course players, especially this generation, want to share what they’re doing, but you can’t control how the outside world responds. [The FA communication officers] have really been supportive to the team and the individuals about that. With the team we make principles of how to use social media [but] I would never say: ‘You’re not allowed to use social media’, because that’s not how I work.“I stay, a lot, out of the media and the socials. So I don’t [read] everything that comes. Everyone will have a different opinion and that’s OK too. I know what we’re working on. I know what the team is about. I work with them every single day, so I know what’s really going on in our bubble.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman believes in giving her players responsibility to make their own decisions.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAA constant of Wiegman’s tenure has been to maintain her players’ privacy within the camp. That was never more apparent than earlier this summer with Mary Earps’ and Fran Kirby’ssudden international retirementsand Millie Bright’s withdrawal from Euros contention. Wiegman declined to share details of their private conversations. During that camp, the manager’s approach to her players was described as direct, even blunt at times, but she says: “What I try to do is give them as much information as possible.“The players call that direct, but do not confuse that with being blunt. I am not blunt – well, I hope not. I am trying to be honest and clear about things to give them context. I am actually very caring and that’s often not very helpful in this job. I want to take care of people but I have a job where I have to make hard decisions.“I think I learned a little bit here with England, too. Sometimes in England we can be a little bit [Wiegman gestures to illustrate skirting around a difficult subject]. Yes, you do! So sometimes I’m like: ‘OK, is this really the message?

But that’s not typical English, is it? But I really like it. It’s in the English culture.“I really like the culture [in England]. It’s such a massive sport culture in England. And in the Netherlands, it’s also a sport culture, but here, at every corner, the whole day on TV, for example, there’s sports, either football or rugby or cricket. And if that’s not there, then there’s something else, but there’s always sports and football is so in society.”The feeling from her bosses in England is clearly mutual, with the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, saying only last week thathe could see “no scenario”where he would not want Wiegman to stay in charge, regardless of how the Lionesses perform at this tournament. She is under contract until 2027’s World Cup. Would she like to stay even longer?“I’m now really focusing on this tournament,” she replies. “I don’t want to look any further [than her contract length]. You never know what happens in life. Things can change quickly and in your personal life, too. So I just feel that I just love to work with this team. I love to work in England with the FA and I hope that stays for a little bit longer.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were 108 minutes on the clock at the Bank of America Stadium – not taking into account the lengthy weather delay – when theChelseamidfielder won possession in Benfica’s half, found Cole Palmer and surged forward.Palmer advanced towards a back-pedalling, understaffed defence. He waited for support before finding the overlapping Caicedo. Benfica, tiring with 10 men, were defeated by Caicedo’s power. The 23-year-old shot, Anatoliy Trubin made a mess of his save and the ball squirmed loose to Christopher Nkunku to score the goal thatsent Enzo Maresca’s side into the quarter-finalsof the Club World Cup.Estêvão will try to beat Chelsea at the Club World Cup – and then join themRead moreOne problem, though: Caicedo will be serving a one-game ban when Chelsea meetPalmeirasin Philadelphia on Friday night. One momentary lapse of judgment could prove costly. Caicedo had to be smarter when he questioned a refereeing decision in the second half against Benfica. He took his protest too far and received a booking for dissent, leaving Maresca with a dilemma.Caicedo is Chelsea’s midfield linchpin – nobody mocks his £115m fee now – and his absence is significant. The Ecuadorian started every Premier League game last season, becoming the first Chelsea player to do so since César Azpilicueta in the 2018-19 campaign, and his durability is not in doubt.Stretch it out and he has not been forced to miss a game since illness kept him out of a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Christmas Eve in 2023. Before that, the only other times when he has not started in the league were as a late substitute during a 4-1 defeat to Newcastle in November 2023 after returning late from international duty and when unavailable for a goalless draw against Bournemouth in September 2023.It has become common to see Caicedo run off an injury after coming off worse in a 50-50 challenge. He needed treatment on a blow to his knee against Benfica but still played on. No wonder Maresca has leant so heavily on him. The head coach does not like to go into key games without the former Brighton midfielder.There was no question of Maresca resting Caicedo in the league when he was one yellow card away from a two-match ban during last season’s run-in. Caicedo was trusted to stay out of trouble, even though he plays on the edge and is never shy to go in hard when the ball is there to be won.But indiscipline has cost him in the United States. Chelsea, who have added João Pedro to their squad aftersigning the forward from Brighton, have to react. Caicedo plays when it matters. Maresca rested him in the Carabao Cup and in easy Conference League games but never when the stakes were high. After all, Caicedo started and scored in theConference League final victory over Real Betis. Being given a breather against Espérance last week is irrelevant given that Caicedo has started three of four games at the Club World Cup.Caicedo’s importance is vast. His long-term cover is Dário Essugo, who hasjust joined from Sporting. Essugo is inexperienced and has only made two substitute appearances for his new side. It would be a huge gamble for Maresca to select the combative 20-year-old against Palmeiras.View image in fullscreenDário Essugo (left) has made only two substitute appearances for Chelsea so it would be gamble to field the combative 20-year-old against Palmeiras.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPAMaresca is likely to find other ways to compensate for losing his best tackler. It is frustrating given that the Benfica game was the first time Caicedo, Roméo Lavia and Enzo Fernández had started together in midfield since the opening weekend of last season. The likeliest solution seems to be shifting Fernández into a deeper role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no replacement for Lavia’s control and ability to conduct play. Chelsea need him to be ready for his fourth start of the tournament. Essugo is raw. Andrey Santos is viewed as a No 8 and is learning Maresca’s style. Reece James impressed at right-back against Benfica but struggled in central midfield when Chelsealost to Flamengoin Philadelphia during the group stage.That was a bad afternoon. Nicolas Jackson was sent off – the striker has completed a two-game ban – and Chelsea failed to cope with Flamengo’s flair, adventure and passion. At least they face Palmeiras knowing not to underestimate Brazilian opposition.Palmeiras remain unbeaten and will be backed by a large following at Lincoln Financial Field. They have tried to calm the hype around Estêvão, the exciting young winger whojoins Chelsea after the tournament. Their manager, Abel Ferreira, has won 10 trophies during his five years in the job, developed young talent and turned down lucrative offers from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia because of his desire to make Palmeiras world champions for the first time.Chelsea will have to be at their best. There has been talk of a favourable route to the final – they avoided a last-16 tie against Bayern Munich and were expected to face Manchester City in the last four, only forAl-Hilal to shock Pep Guardiola’s side– but there is no room for complacency against Palmeiras. It is arepeat of the 2022 final, when Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea collected the final trophy of the Roman Abramovich era by beating Ferreira’s punchy Palmeiras side in extra time, and it will not be easy without Caicedo.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025ChelseaPalmeirasClub World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Xabi Alonso had been in charge at Real Madrid for just two games when he said that the Uruguayan reminded him of his former partner in the Liverpool midfield. “ I haven’t seen many players with his physical performance,” he said. “I’m very happy to be coaching him. Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”Coming from Alonso, it was quite the compliment. There was always something special between him and the Liverpool captain. Gerrard described the Spaniard as “pure quality, a class act on the pitch and a gentlemen off it,” and was “devastated” at his departure, writing: “I missed you every day from the moment you left.” Alonso said that Gerrard was the better player, the man with whom he won the European Cup, scoring six minutes apart, and shared the Istanbul kiss that inspired endless fan fiction;the man he once called “my hero, my mate”.Gonzalo García downs Juventus to send Real Madrid to Club World Cup quartersRead moreIn truth, it is also not entirely new. Valverde is 26 now, no unknown kid, and there has always been something of Gerrard about him which didn’t go unnoticed. He is the player to whom Toni Kroos gave his No 8 shirt and that Carlo Ancelotti described as the most important in the team, a man whose only flaw was that he was too humble. In 2022, Ancelotti promised to tear up his licence if the Uruguayan didn’t score at least 10, and he didn’t have find a new profession. But as Alonso builds a new Madrid, a structure and system to make sense of it all, the early signs are that Valverde may be more Gerrard than ever, guided by a manager and former player who grasps that better than anyone.“Fede can play anywhere,” Alonso said, but getting it right also means recognising the things he cannotdo, and in that too there are parallels with Gerrard. At Liverpool, it was about the balance: Javier Mascherano and Alonso did the things Gerrard couldn’t, allowing him to do the things he could. His game was not about positioning, controlling the timing, the flow; in that sense, Alonso always understood, Gerrard wasn’t a great midfielder. But release him and he was as good as it gets. “Physically, technically, being able to make special moments,” Alonso said.“Alonso used to allow me to play as a No 10, so I could get more shots on goal, more goals, more assists,” Gerrard recalled in an interview in 2023. “Gerrard’s an idol, a star, an incredible player with those diagonal passes, the shooting, busting through with the ball. I could spend 24 hours watching him,” Valverde told the Guardian two years before that. And to listen to Madrid’s new coach is to hear a similar process being repeated; what he did for Gerrard as a player, can he do for Valverde as a coach? It is something he appears willing to try, encouraged to do so by qualities and by limitations too, a realism to go with the fondness.View image in fullscreenSteven Gerrard (centre) and Xabi Alonso pulled the strings in a Liverpool midfield that won the Champions League.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesAt times it can seem like Valverde has four lungs and, Ancelotti always said, everyone else benefited from him. The only person that didn’t benefit from Valverde, it sometimes seemed, was Valverde, the coach asking him to be a bit more arrogant sometimes. He played much of last season at right-back, and he was good at it too. Better in fact than in the position that had seemed to be saved for him: he had taken Kroos’s shirt, but could not emulate his game. Now that deep midfield position is a starting point, not a place to play.One of the most intriguing lines in Alonso’s opening press conference as Madrid manager was the statement thatJude Bellingham was a midfielder, not a forward. Alonso mentioned the need for “efficiency” in the Englishman’s game, to create parameters within which to play after two seasons –the first, spectacular year in particular– where he was about arriving in the area, scoring.Now, at least to start with at thisClub World Cup, both tournament and testing ground, the roles have been inverted. Bellingham is controlled, Valverde released. It is early still but habits are being formed, history repeating itself, Liverpool offering a model for Madrid.“I see Fede in many places, like I did with Steven,” Alonso said. “But given the shape we have and the balance we need, starting from that slightly deeper position, from the second line, that double No 6, he can arrive [in the other area]. He has that ability to accelerate through, to go through lines very easily and in 30 metres, be there [in shooting positions].skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know his qualities, we know that his best virtue is not receiving back to goal and turning but to see the game in front of him and, starting from a bit deeper [than a forward], arrive. He has scored twice and he has that ability to accelerate and get close to the area.”It is early still and the sample size is small, but no midfielder here has had more touches in the opposition area than Valverde. He is getting twice as many as he did last season: from 1.4 per game in the league and 0.7 per game in the Champions League to 3.6 per game here. Only four players have more shots, and they are all strikers. Against Juventus, Valverde took aim six times. Only Juventus keeper Michele Di Gregorio prevented him from scoring. “I’m even doing overhead kicks now,” Valverde joked after the game. “Before I didn’t; I didn’t even know how.”“I’m happy, I’m enjoying this. I am trying to make the most of every minute, giving all my energy until my body can’t give any more, like today when I asked to come off.”It was the 90th minute when he finally made way, and under the stands at the Hard Rock Stadium, a familiar name came up again. Your manager is talking about you like the player he admired most, he was told. “I’m happy; when someone like Xabi Alonso talks about you like that, it’s an honour, it makes you proud, and it encourages you to keep working,” Valverde said. “But in the end, I’m Fede Valverde, a Uruguayan who plays forReal Madridand is fulfilling a dream.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridClub World CupClub World Cup 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Tottenham have also moved to secure their new head coach with the Englishman Martin Ho signing a three-year deal.The Swede Jeglertz is currently in charge of the Denmark women’s national side and will remain with them for the tournament. Denmark’s Group C campaign gets under way on Friday, just 23 hours after Manchester City confirmed his appointment.The 53-year-old succeeds Gareth Taylor, who was sacked in March, just five days before the club’s appearance in last season’s League Cup final. The Guardian reported on 4 June that Jeglertz was close to agreeing a deal to move to the WSL side, who finished fourth in the table last term.He is a former European champion as a coach, when in charge of the Swedish club Umeå, in 2004. “Manchester City is one of the biggest clubs in the world,” Jeglertz said. “There is so much talent in this group. One of my key things is to continue the job that’s been done and take it to the next level.“I will do everything I can to take this to the next level and make sure we can play attractive and winning football.”Manchester City WomenDirector of Football, Therese Sjögran, added: “Andrée brings a wealth of experience at the top of the game as well as a real hunger to drive Manchester City forward. He really impressed us with his attitude and ambition, and the way he sees the game aligns perfectly with our own vision.We wish him luck at the Euros this summer with Denmark and are all very excited to see what impact he can make in our bright future.”Ho, meanwhile, has been in charge of the Norwegian club Brann’s women’s team for two years, since leaving his role as the assistant coach at Manchester United women in July 2023.The 35-year-old is Spurs’s replacement for Robert Vilahamn, whowas sackedin June after the club finished second from bottom in the WSL last term.He leaves Brann second in the Norwegian top flight midway through their 2025 season, after a second-placed finish last year. He took Brann to the 2023-24 Women’s Champions League quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by the eventual champions, Barcelona, which was the furthest a Norwegian side have progressed in the competition.Ho had spent three and a half years at United, initially working with the under-21s in the second half of the 2019-20 season alongside the now Bristol City head coach, Charlotte Healy. Ho then moved up to be Casey Stoney’s assistant with the first team in July 2020 and, after Marc Skinner replaced Stoney as head coach in 2021, he spent two years as Skinner’s No 2, including a second-placed finish in the WSL in 2023.Born and raised in Mossley Hill in Liverpool, Ho had spells at Everton – as assistant manager – and at Liverpool, where he was the under-21 women’s team’s head coach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s the feeling for Australia at the moment, as normal programming followed normal programming: top order failure, middle order digging the team out of a hole, a score that shouldn’t be enough against a proper batting side but might well be enough against a vulnerable one. As the second Test against West Indies began on the small island of Grenada on Thursday, a reasonable start of 47 without loss abruptly became 50-3, and 110-5, before finally recovering to 286 all out, on a hot tropical day when occasional rain bursts created short delays, and bad light prevented a late tilt against West Indies’ top order.Steve Smith returns for second West Indies Test after quick recovery from finger injuryRead moreGiven how rarely the Grenada National Stadium is used, the surface was an unknown quantity. West Indies picked a fifth quick, Australia shrugged and picked the same four bowlers they would choose for St Moritz ice cricket if the chance came up. Dry, patchy, straw coloured, that pitch initially looked the sort where a couple of batters in need of a score could cash in. The pace looked slow, attempted bouncers barely reached the waist. Sam Konstas laid into the first of those he received, Usman Khawaja soon followed with some pulled boundaries of his own.But the one advantage for the bowlers was a little Dukes swing. After bringing up his 6,000th Test run, Khawaja’s struggles against pace continued, inswing from Alzarri Joseph nailing him on the back pad for 16. New inclusion Anderson Phillip doesn’t push the speed gun like his teammates, but had the ball moving both ways through the air, and four balls later had Konstas trying an ill-advised, lavish drive and coughing up the edge for 25.The collapse became 3-3 when Steve Smith was undone by an absence of bounce. Not normally a player who would look to hook early in an innings, he didn’t get the length for that shot from Alzarri Joseph, more a length you’d expect him to drop off the hip for a single. Instead Smith went cross-bat, up and under, looking to lift it for six. And instead of fine leg throwing back the ball for one run, Phillip held the catch just inside the rope. Returning from injury as the man to bolster the batting, Smith walked off after six balls with his trademark look of confusion.It feels as though Travis Head is always walking in at three for bugger all, and the numbers confirm that the struggle is real. When batting at five or lower, Head has been called on with the score at 60 or less in 29 innings out of 89, basically a third of his hits. In the last 18 months it rises to nearly half the time, 10 innings out of 22. He often makes runs in those situations, an absolver of top-order sins. This time he did half that job, 29 out of the next 60, a man with shade of Boony teaming up with the two-metre brigade of Cameron Green and Beau Webster.Konstas, Khawaja, and Green form Australia’s main concerns of the moment, and none were allayed on the day. Green’s score of 26 was useful, but pushing hard at the ball undid him again, twice over. Five balls before lunch his mistimed drive at Jayden Seales was dropped at cover, and instead of navigating to the break, he went again and was caught at gully.So with Head caught behind off a lifter after the break, it was over to Australia’s two firewalls once again, Webster and Alex Carey, with 60 and 63 in contrasting styles. Carey was happy to counter aggressively, carving behind point. Webster took his time, partly by choice and partly forced to by disciplined bowling. West Indies stuck to their task, prising out Carey then the tail, pushing Webster to take the chance of a second run and end up short. Joseph finished with 4-61 while the other four quicks shared the rest of the wickets around.The end came with dusk settling over the seaside ground, and an hour before a richly pastel sunset. In his 100th Test, Kraigg Braithwaite would have been relieved that all that was required of him that evening was a walk to the middle, soaking up some applause, before the umpires told him he could walk back off again. With no nasty late burst, the examination will wait until the clear light of morning. Not that daylight helped Australia’s first session much. With the visitors repeating their program from Barbados, it’s up to West Indies to offer something new to watch.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

And I think that’s the beauty of the team that we have, and the players we have and the belief they have in how they want to play the game.“There’s still three days of cricket left. There’s a lot of cricket to go. And I think on a fast-scoring ground you never know what can happen sort of stuff.

Draper, the new hope of British men’s tennis, had come into these championships with expectations that he would leave his mark. Instead he was taught a grand slam lesson by the veteran Marin Cilic and leaves Wimbledon with fresh lessons to take on board in his burgeoning career.There has been distinct excitement at Draper’s prospects in SW19 this summer after his heady ascent up the rankings and victory at Indian Wells in the spring. That this was only his fourthWimbledonappearance and that none of his previous outings had gone beyond the second round was not given much weight. But perhaps a lack of experience told here, at least in how Draper managed the match, while the 36-year-old Cilic, a Wimbledon finalist in 2017, revelled in his own on-court Indian summer.Wimbledon 2025: Draper crashes out against Cilic, Sinner v Vukic – liveRead more“It makes me think that Andy’s achievement of what he did, winning here twice, was just unbelievable,” Draper said, having collected his thoughts after the 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 reverse. “I wasn’t going out there thinking I was under so much pressure. I just didn’t play good enough today. I lost to a better player. I wasn’t able to find the level I wanted.”It seems, too, fair to imagine there’s an element of deflection in that answer. Part of Murray’s great triumph was to rise above the clamour of expectation that met him every time he set foot in the All England Club. And Draper did look tight in the match, particularly the opening two sets. But there were other obvious factors: he points to a struggle to find his feet on grass, and then there was the form of Cilic.View image in fullscreenMarin Cilic closes in to play a forehand against Jack Draper. The victor has come back from injury and said: ‘To play in front of this crowd and against Jack is incredible.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe Croat’s strength of serve is well known and his whipped forehand a deadly weapon. What was less clear was how able he would be to summon those powers after more than two years out of the game dealing with a knee injury that required two rounds of surgery. An omen was to be found in Nottingham last month, when the 36-year-old won the grass-court tournament and became the oldest winner ever of an ATP Challenger event (usurping Murray). Here he looked a player who had emerged fully from rehabilitation, and was the more mobile player on court.Speaking in front of the crowds on Court One, Cilic described his emotions as “just incredible”. Coming back from the place he was in two years ago “I can’t even describe” he said. “It has been a long journey but I never lost any doubt. It was a long and testing period, plus a huge challenge for me in this part of my career to come back and play at this level. To play in front of this crowd and against Jack is incredible, so thanks everyone for your great sportsmanship.”The dynamic of the first set had seen Cilic leading the rallies and Draper in dogged pursuit of the ball. It had allowed the 23-year-old to stay in the game, but he was leaving himself little room for error. At 4-3 Draper fell 0-40 down on his serve but somehow clawed his way back. At 5-4, however, Cilic tore into Draper again, got to three break points again, and this time converted with a backhand return winner off an anaemic second serve.The Briton’s head was down, he appeared to be in his own thoughts and the second set slipped away from him quickly. “You run out of time,” was how he put it. “The match is going so quick, the points are going by so quickly. I feel like every ball is on my feet on the returns and on the serves, you’re not really getting a look.” By the time he was 4-2 down in the second set Draper was railing against the umpires and the narrow calls dictated by Wimbledon’s AI, a service he thinks “isn’t 100% correct”. It didn’t look good.In the third set Draper reset. The energy returned and with it some execution. Game on, or at least it felt that way. Cilic was not paying attention to the narrative, however. After ceding the third set, he stayed calm in the fourth and summoned again the power and placement that had served him so well. With the match reaching a decisive point at 5-4, he stepped forward on to Draper’s serve once more. He missed a drop shot inches from the net on the first point but did not let it rock him and while Draper struggled to find his rhythm, Cilic found the lines and the corners. At 30-40 a limp forehand from Draper failed to clear the cord and that was that.“I think in some ways it’s a good thing,” Draper said of defeat. “It highlighted a lot of areas of my game which I need to continue to improve on if I want to be consistently a top player and going deep in these slams. Everyone is a great player [here] and you’re going to come unstuck if you’re not good enough.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Marin CilicJack DraperWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But at Wimbledon, where she has made the quarter-finals only once and where grass-court nous is still a work in progress,Iga Swiateksomehow seems to go about her business almost unnoticed. If she loses early, it’s quickly shaken off; if she goes deep, it’s bonus territory and a sign that all is well in her world.On Thursday, the Pole, seeded eighth after dropping down the rankings in the first half of this year, shrugged off a poor end to the first set to beat the American Caty McNally 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 for a place in the third round. Ranked 208 but in the draw on a protected ranking after a long time off due to elbow surgery, McNally chipped and charged and came forward with purpose as she pinched the first set from 4-1 down. But Swiatek steadied the ship quickly and dominated the second and third sets for another morale‑boosting victory.Wimbledon diary: Tarvet’s prize money mystery and Bear Grylls in the boxRead moreHaving struggled in the first part of the clay season, Swiatek started to find her game at Roland Garros, where she has won the title four times. Defeatby Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finalshurt but she reached her first grass-court final in Bad Homburg and she is just the third woman this century, after Amélie Mauresmo and Serena Williams, to make the third round or better at 22 or more slams. Against McNally, she did not panic when the first set slipped away and in the end she was a comfortable winner.“I started well so I knew my game was there,” Swiatek said, explaining how she turned things around. “I just needed to use it, to be more intense and more accurate with my preparation. I’m happy I was able to do it.”There is a lot about grass-court tennis that Swiatek has yet to master. Though her volleys are technically sound, the transition from the baseline to the net is often tentative, still moving backwards at times to let the ball bounce when a smash would be easier. But when her serve is working smoothly, as it was for the most part against McNally, she is still very hard to beat.View image in fullscreenThe 2022 champion Elena Rybakina is safely through to the third round.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockSwiatek and McNally know each other well, having won the junior doubles title together at Roland Garros in 2018. Swiatek won the juniorWimbledontitle that year, but lost to McNally in the semis in Paris, a defeat she described on Thursday as “one of the most heartbreaking of my junior career”. The two women embraced fondly at the net and Swiatek was delighted to see her on court again. “I’m happy she’s back,” she said. “For sure she’s got the game to do well.”Next up for Swiatek is Danielle Collins, the hard-hitting American who handed her a painful defeat on clay in Rome last time out. Win that, and she’s likely to find herself up against Elena Rybakina,the 2022 champion, who eased past Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-1.The defending champion, Barbora Krejcikova, was made to work before beating Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, setting up a clash with the 10th seed, Emma Navarro, a quarter-finalist here last year. The No 7 seed, Mirra Andreeva, in the same section of the draw, beat Lucia Bronzetti 6-1, 7-6 (4). “In the beginning I felt like I was playing great, taking the ball early, playing aggressive, but in the second set she also started to play better and I got a little bit nervous,” the Russian said. “I’m just super-happy that I managed to push myself to fight until the end.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisWimbledonIga SwiateknewsShareReuse this content"

If Fluminense beat Al-Hilal in Orlando on Friday and Palmeiras get the better of Chelsea a few hours later in Philadelphia, one of them will make it to the final. Chelsea have already been embarrassed by one Brazilian side at the tournament – they weretrounced 3-1 by Flamengo a fortnight agoin the group stage – but they are still favourites to beat Palmeiras in the quarter-finals.The English side came out on top when the teams metin the final of the Club World Cup three years ago, winning 2-1 thanks to a 117th-minute penalty converted by Kai Havertz. At that point, a young prodigy known as “Messinho”, or little Messi, was taking his first steps in the Palmeiras academy having joined from Cruzeiro. When the teams meet again on Friday night, Estêvão Willian will be the central focus. The 18-year-old is inextricably linked to both clubs, having turned professional at one before agreeing to join the other in a deal that could be worth up to £52m.Having signed a deal to join Chelsea a year ago, Estêvão travelled to theClub World Cupknowing that Palmeiras’ last game in the United States would also be his last before he crosses the Atlantic. The teenager has admitted that he has struggled to focus on the task at hand. “It’s very difficult,” he said. “It’s a dream that I’m going to fulfil, but knowing that I have to focus here, that I have to work, it’s not easy. The closer it gets, the anxiety hits. I’m trying to focus as much as possible, and leave well, through the front door, knowing that I gave my best for Palmeiras.”In an era when players are media trained into mumbling tedious and unrevealing soundbites, this was a welcome and rare example of a high-profile player being vulnerable and speaking his mind. Unsurprisingly, however, in another sign of the times, he was criticised for admitting that his mind might be elsewhere, which forced thePalmeirasmanager to leap to his defence.“It’s normal,” said Abel Ferreira. “What distinguishes us from the animals? Feelings and emotions. It’s normal to be nervous, normal for a boy to have a dream. He’s so pure and such a young lad. To be 18 and say what he feels is normal but a large part [of the media and fans] slaughtered him. That’s what you do to players. That’s what sells, the blood. You make money one way and we make money another.”View image in fullscreenEstêvão takes a corner for Palmeiras in their 1-0 win against Botafogo in the last 16.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThere is a perception in Brazil that Estêvão has not delivered for Palmeiras in his very limited time in the first team and could leave the club still not having bossed a big game – especially when compared to Endrick, the last phenom to emerge at the São Paulo club. Popular Brazilian pundit Paulo Vinicius Coelho, widely known as PVC, points out that, whereas Endrick lifted two Brazilian league titles and scored the goal that won the title in 2023 before joining Real Madrid, Estêvão is still waiting for a game that defines his time at Palmeiras.“If Estêvão goes toChelseawithout deciding the game, we are used to hearing that he doesn’t score against the rivals in the biggest matches,” says PVC. “He scores against Cuiabá, against Juventude, against small clubs, but he doesn’t score against Santos, Corinthians, São Paulo, Flamengo, Botafogo, Porto, Al-Ahly, Inter Miami, or Chelsea. Playing against Chelsea is very important. Where is his mind? He needs to work on his mentality. If he fails on Saturday, many Palmeiras fans will say he didn’t have his head in the game.”PVC is quick to add that Estêvão is “the most intelligent player at Palmeiras” and that “when it comes to his skills, nobody argues about that”. Henrique Rojas, a lifelong matchgoing Palmeiras fan, agrees and adds that he is “by far the most skilled” player that has come through the academy in decades.“He has speed, dribbling and spatial intelligence that is above average – but he’s still only 18 and still needs to improve a lot,” says Rojas. “He needs to get stronger physically and improve his finishing. These are the reasons he hasn’t really shone in the big games yet – in addition to the fact that he became the country’s biggest name in one year and has been heavily marked ever since. But he’s a good kid, he’s never slacked off and has a bright future. As this is his last tournament before leaving, he is anxious. Both Abel and the squad are shielding him from criticism and he will have another chance to show his best.”Even if Estêvão can work some magic, there is no doubt that Chelsea are the favourites. “Palmeiras are not in the best form,” says PVC. “They were better two months ago than they are today. Beating a big rival in a big game is the key to kicking on, and they need to prove themselves.” Rojas agrees. “Although Chelsea are inconsistent under Maresca, they are the favourites,” he says. “Just look at the players’ values ​​and the fact they are in the most powerful league in the world. It’s 60/40 for Chelsea, but that’s the beauty of cup games – one detail changes everything.”Al-Hilal’s win over Manchester City lays bare strength of Saudi ArabiaRead moreIf Palmeiras pull off their heist of the century so far, Ferreira will face even more jokes about how his team defies the odds so often. The manager – whose rousing team talks and press conferences are something to behold – has been teased by rival fans about the dark arts he must practise to pull off so many shocks.“Rivals joke that he ‘sacrifices animals’ and has a ‘pact with the devil’ because Palmeiras have managed to mount comebacks in many games that seemed lost,” says Rojas. “But the truth is that to limit him to just a motivational coach is nonsense. Abel has changed the team in so many ways and different moments that it is impossible not to respect him. He is one of the greatest coaches in the club’s history, if not the greatest, and he achieved all this in just five years. He decides everything related to football at the club and he is a rare unanimous choice for a fanbase that is always dissatisfied. He is a kind of Simeone at Atlético Madrid.“Some fans criticise his ‘inventions’ – such as playing with double full-backs or persisting with players in bad form – but every coach has that. Palmeiras have offered him another contract until the end of 2027 and, deep down, no Palmeiras fan wants him to leave. The passion between Abel and Palmeiras is one of the most beautiful things that has ever happened and we will always be by his side.”View image in fullscreenEstêvão preparing to face Inter Miami in the group stage.Photograph: Héctor Vivas/FIFA/Getty ImagesPalmeiras fans know they cannot stop Estêvão from leaving but they worry that Chelsea is not the “ideal destination” for the youngster. “Chelsea are a team with many ups and downs,” says Rojas. “They are signing a lot of young players but they fire coaches and lack experienced players who can help players like Estêvão in their day-to-day life. All this without mentioning the difference of living in another country and facing a harsh winter. He is a person, not a machine. Perhaps the Spanish league or a team like Arsenal would be more natural for him.”PVC also has “doubts” about Chelsea. “Chelsea bought three young Brazilian players before: Deivid Washington who went back to Santos; Ângelo, who went to Strasbourg; and André Santos, who returned from Strasbourg to Chelsea but he has only played a few minutes in the Club World Cup. Estêvão is too young for a club that is in a new phase. I don’t think it’s the best decision, but young Brazilian players always want to go to Europe as quickly as possible.”This is an article byTom SandersonExplore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Yellow and Green footballClub World CupChelseaPalmeirasUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After beating Ireland 4–0 in back-to-back friendlies, theydefeated an experienced Canada side 3–0in Washington, bringing their 2025 record to 8-0-2 while continuing to field youthful lineups full of emerging talent.Emma Hayes’ return to Audi Field came nearly one year to the day since they drew 0–0 with Costa Rica in their final tune-up before going onto win Olympic gold in Paris. Since then, the four-time world champions have turned their focus to the 2027 World Cup. Hayes has worked diligently to build the depth and cohesion needed to challenge for the title.As of this window, Hayes has capped 24 new players during her tenure and started 36 different players in 2025 alone. With European-based players rested (with the exception of Naomi Girma), and key Olympic contributors absent due to pregnancy or injury, Hayes continued to hand out valuable experience. Here are the biggest winners and losers from this summer’s international window.WinnersSam CoffeyCoffey made her 38th appearance against Canada and, while she’s no newcomer, few players have cemented their importance to the team quite like her. After the win, Hayes noted Coffey was “in the form of her life” and praised her drive to improve. Speaking to the media, Coffey said she would have preferred at least one more goal to “really seal it”. Hayes on her mentality: “She is always, always wanting to improve her game. It never ends. It’s never enough. She’d sit and watch film permanently if she could.”After scoring in Wednesday’s victory, the Portland Thorns defensive midfielder now has three goals in five matches – level with Cat Macario and just behind forwards Lynn Biyendolo and Ally Sentnor among the team’s top scorers.Claire HuttonSpeaking of defensive midfielders scoring goals: Hutton rose to head home Rose Lavelle’s perfectly placed corner in the 36th minute, notching her first goal for the US in just her sixth appearance. The 19-year-old has shown clear progress, translating her strong form with the first-place Kansas City Current to the international stage. Slotting in near-seamlessly alongside Coffey, Hutton has offered glimpses of a dynamic midfield partnership for the future.Rose LavelleLavelle returned to the USWNT for the first time in 2025 during this window and wasted no time reminding everyone of her quality. Starting the first and third matches, she was as deft and creative as ever in midfield. Lavelle scored and assisted against Ireland in her first game back, nearly scored off the bench in the second and was arguably the best player on the pitch against Canada. Hayes said: “She’s unique in the world game. There aren’t many players like Rose Lavelle, and I genuinely think there is another level for her to reach with our team.”View image in fullscreenRose Lavelle of the United States celebrates scoring during the second half against Ireland last month in Colorado.Photograph: Ray Bahner/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty ImagesAvery Patterson and Lilly RealeBeyond Arsenal’s Emily Fox, the full-back spots remain among the most contested in Hayes’ squad. Twenty-one-year-old Gotham left-back Lilly Reale and 23-year-old Houston Dash right-back Avery Patterson – both converted full-backs with versatility – each earned two starts this window and made a strong case for long-term inclusion.Reale, making just her second senior appearance against Canada, limited the influence of veterans such as Janine Beckie while combining well with Alyssa Thompson down the flank. Hayes on Reale: “I think Lilly Reale is showing steady progression. It’s great to have a left-footer as an option on that side. She’s strong defensively, tough to get behind.”Patterson, in her sixth cap, helped contain players like Ashley Lawrence and also provided a threat going forward, scoring in her first start of the window and providing an assist against Canada. Hayes said of the pair: “I think they’re at a similar level. Avery’s better going forward; Lilly’s better going backwards naturally. But they’re both fast learners, and they’re both adaptable.”Alyssa ThompsonA word here for Thompson, whose pace and skill on the left wing made an impact in every match she played. The 20-year-old Angel City winger showed moments of individual brilliance, scoring her second international goal against Ireland in Colorado and adding a third in the next match off the bench. Though she didn’t score against Canada, she remained a constant threat – her positioning and energy keeping her firmly in the mix amid a crowded field of elite forwards.LosersJane Campbell and Casey MurphyAnother unsettled position in Hayes’ squad is goalkeeper, which has been vacant since Alyssa Naeher’s retirement. Manchester United’s Phallon Tullis-Joyce has emerged as a likely No 1, following a clean-sheet debut against Brazil in April. With Tullis-Joyce resting alongside other European-based players, Hayes rotated her depth options this window and found promise in Seattle Reign’s Claudia Dickey and Utah Royals’ Mandy McGlynn.Dickey started the first and third matches and made several solid stops against Canada, including a late save. McGlynn featured in the second game and held her own, though Ireland didn’t offer many tests. Meanwhile, Campbell and Murphy may now need exceptional league performances to claw their way back into the conversation.The doubtersHayes has been measured in her assessments, methodical in her team-building, and realistic about the road ahead. After beating Canada 3–0, she stressed that the team “hasn’t done anything yet”. That’s true, but over the past year, confidence and experience have spread across a broader pool of talent. There’s still work to be done, but Wednesday’s dominant performance was a compelling reminder that this is a team quietly assembling the tools required to contend for the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

For the past couple of years, the Saudi Pro League had been dismissed as a destination for the old, greedy, unambitious or all three. On Tuesday, European football woke up to be faced with a new side of Saudi Arabian football as Al-Hilal celebrated a4-3 win over Manchester Cityto go through to the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup.If a member of the European elite being turned over by a team that had previously been little-known on the world stage was what the competition needed then this was it.In-form Foden and sluggish Dias – what did we learn from City’s Club World Cup? | Jamie JacksonRead moreCity may point to mitigating circumstances but not all was perfect in the Saudi camp, either.Al-Hilalarrived in the United States on the back of a long and disappointing season. After dominating the SPL the previous year, setting a world-record winning streak of 34 games along the way, the Riyadh giants were very much second-best to the eventual champions, Al-Ittihad.Neymar left in January and there were major frustration that the club did not sign someone of a similar stature as a replacement. Aleksandar Mitrovic, scorer of almost a goal a gamesince arriving from Fulham, is injured. Salem Al-Dawsari, their best player, is also absent. Since last August, Al-Hilal have played almost the same number of games as City and were without a coach for the final stages of the campaign, appointing Simone Inzaghi just before the Club World Cup started.City fans rightly point to a history before the big-money poured in from Abu Dhabi in 2008. The same is true of Al-Hilal before Riyadh’s Public Investment Fund took over the club – along with the three other biggest teams in the country – in the summer of 2023. They had been champions of Asia four times and Saudi Arabia 19, both records. Also, they reached the final of the 2022Club World Cup, losing 5-3 to Real Madrid after giving Chelsea a good game in the previous edition.Al-Hilal never have been minnows, and they have certainly strengthened in the past couple of years. Yassine Bounou in goal, defenders Kalidou Koulibaly and João Cancelo, as well as Rúben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in midfield, are good enough to shine in any league. Of the two teams it is also worth noting that City have imported more. Phil Foden was the only Englishman to take to the pitch in Orlando for the Premier League side, while eight Saudi Arabians featured for the winners.View image in fullscreenAl-Hilal strengthened their defence with Kalidou Koulibaly, who scored against Manchester City.Photograph: Richard Dole/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe win has gone down well in Asia given it was the first time a team from the world’s biggest continent has beaten the world’s best at this level. Al-Hilal’s success stands in sharp contrast to the performance of the other three sides from the Asian Football Confederation, all of whom were eliminated with a game of the group stage still to play.Their combined record was one win, eight defeats, six goals scored and 27 conceded. Al Ain managed a victory but were thrashed in their opening two games. Urawa Reds of Japan lost all three of their games. Ulsan HD – accompanied by officials from all of South Korea’s professional clubs – came and went without anybody really noticing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few in Riyadh will care, especially now Al-Hilal have a path to the Club World Cup final and, maybe, a rematch with Madrid. They were plucky outsiders going into the encounter three years ago, just happy to play such an illustrious opponent. That would not be the case now.Whatever happens, Al-Hilal will always have their win over City. It serves as a reminder that the world game is truly that. It could also mean that the next time a big-name player swaps one of the big clubs in the big European leagues for Saudi Arabia, the talk will be less about greed, ambition and the rest, and a little more about whether he can help close the gap with Europe, one that no longer appears as wide as first thought.Explore more on these topicsAl-HilalClub World Cup 2025Club World CupSaudi Arabia and sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 19-year-old midfielder was ready.Hutton headed home her first international goal, and the Americans easily dispatched Canada 3-0 in a friendly Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. Sam Coffey and Yazmeen Ryan also scored.Emma Hayes: ‘As for managing England one day, I’ll never say never’Read more“Set pieces are something we focus on. It’s what we talk about,” Hutton said. “At the international level, it’s what sets teams apart, especially in big tournaments. So being able to get my head on Rose’s perfect ball there was just amazing. Hoping for more in the future.”The Americans have won five straight friendlies by a combined score of 18-0 since their 2-1 loss to Brazil in early April. The 19-year-old Hutton was making her sixth appearance for the national team, and her goal in the 36th minute gave the US a 2-0 lead.“It’s just amazing. To wear this jersey, wear this badge, it weighs a lot. I know the history behind it,” said Hutton, who plays for the Kansas City Current. “We talked about the US legacy this past week. Just knowing that I get to be a part of it, it means the world to me.”US coachEmma Hayesgave many of her Europe-based options a break for this stretch of three games in seven days, which also included two 4-0 wins over Ireland. That left opportunities for less experienced players like Hutton.“As I’ve said many times, I’m all about improving the whole ecosystem. I think more opportunities for more players with the national team will improve the NWSL,” Hayes said. “Because it gives players hope and belief that if they perform, that they’re going to get an opportunity.”The US opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Lavelle delivered a free kick into the penalty area from near the left sideline. Canada’s Janine Sonis tried to head clear, but the ball fell to Avery Patterson and then bounced to Coffey about nine yards from the goal.Both Coffey and Patterson stabbed at the ball, and both appeared to make contact with it. It went straight into the net. Coffey was credited with the goal and Patterson with an assist.View image in fullscreenYazmeen Ryan of the United States celebrates her goal with team-mates during the second half.Photograph: Brad Smith/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images“I will give her full credit for that. I did not touch it at all,” Patterson said, not entirely believably. “I laid it up for her on a platter.”Claudia Dickey, who also shut out Ireland in her international debut last Thursday, stopped a shot from in close by Canada’s Jordyn Huitema shortly after Coffey’s goal. But the Americans created far more chances.Canada coach Casey Stoney called her team’s performance “inexcusable” and said her players’ fitness wasn’t good enough.“A lack of commitment and desire, which is not this team,” she said. “Losing draws, losing 50-50s, not getting up to the ball, not pressing – it’s not good enough. I’m not going to hide away from it.”Lavelle received a standing ovation when she was subbed out around the midway point of the second half. The crowd also gave a big cheer when Tara McKeown – who plays locally for the Washington Spirit – came on as a late sub for the US. McKeown assisted on Ryan’s goal in the 89th minute.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsEmma HayesCanada women's football teamFriendliesWomen's footballShareReuse this content"

Pentangeli is suddenly reminded of his oath of omerta, the code of silence. He recants on the spot, saying that he just told the FBI “what they wanted to hear”.On 25 June, Emil Bove, Donald Trump’s former personal attorney, whom he had named associate deputy attorney general, and now after five months seeks to elevate as a federal judge on the US third circuit court of appeals, appeared before the Senate judiciary committee for his confirmation hearing. He faced, at least potentially, a far-ranging inquiry into his checkered career.There were charges of abusive behavior as an assistant US attorney. There was his role as enforcer of the alleged extortion of New York City Mayor Eric Adams to cooperate in the Trump administration’s migrant roundups in exchange for dropping the federal corruption case against him. There was Bove’s dismissal of FBI agents and prosecutors who investigated the January 6 insurrection. And there was more.On the eve of the hearing, the committee received a shocking letter from a whistleblower, a Department of Justice attorney, who claimed that Bove said, in response to a federal court ruling against the administration’s immigration deportation policy: “DoJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such order.”The supreme court is cracking down on judges – and letting Trump run wild | Steven GreenhouseRead moreSenator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the committee chairperson, the ancient mariner of the right wing at 91 years old, gaveled the session to order by invoking new rules never before used with a nominee in a confirmation hearing. Instead of opening the questioning to examine the nominee’s past, he would thwart it. Grassleyannouncedthat Bove would be shielded by the “deliberative-process privilege and attorney-client privilege” from “an intense opposition campaign by my Democratic colleagues and by their media allies”. This was the unique imposition of a code of omerta.“My understanding is that Congress has never accepted the constitutional validity of either such privilege,” objected Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. “This witness has no right to invoke that privilege,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. But Grassley stonewalled.Prominently seated in the audience behind Bove were the US attorney general,Pam Bondi, and the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. Never before had such top officials been present at a confirmation hearing for a judicial nominee. The federal government through the justice department would inevitably appear in cases before his court. The attorney general and her deputy created an immediate perception of conflict of interest, an ethical travesty.But Bondi and Blanche were not there to silence Bove. They were there to intimidate the Republican senators. If there were any dissenters among them, they knew that they would suffer retribution. “Their being here is for one reason – to whip the Republicans into shape,”saidBlumenthal. “To make sure that they toe the line. They are watching.”The rise of Emil Bove is the story of how a lawyer from the ranks associated himself with Donald Trump, proved his unswerving loyalty to become a made man, and has been richly rewarded with a nomination for a lifetime federal judgeship, presumably to continue his service. In his opening statement, Bove said: “I want to be clear about one thing up front: there is a wildly inaccurate caricature of me in the mainstream media. I’m not anybody’s henchman. I’m not an enforcer.”The rise of Emil Bove is the story of a lawyer associating himself with Trump, proving his unswerving loyalty and being richly rewardedBove began his career as a paralegal and then a prosecutor in the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York. He was known for his attention to detail, relentlessness and sharp elbows. Seeking a promotion to supervisor, a group of defense attorneys including some who had been prosecutors in his office wrote a letter claiming he had “deployed questionable tactics, including threatening defendants with increasingly severe charges the lawyers believed he couldn’t prove”, according toPolitico. Bove posted the letter in his office to display his contempt. He was denied the promotion, but eventually received it.As a supervisor, Bove was known as angry, belittling and difficult. He developed an abrasive relationship with FBI agents. After complaints, an executive committee in the US attorney’s office investigated and suggested he be demoted. He pleaded he would exercise more self-control and was allowed to remain in his post. “You are aware of this inquiry and their recommendation?” Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Bove aboutthe incident. Bove replied: “As well as the fact that I was not removed.”In 2021, in the prosecution of an individual accused of evading sanctions on Iran, a team Bove supervised as the unit chief won a jury verdict. But then the US attorney’s office discovered the case was “marred by repeated failures to disclose exculpatory evidence and misuse of search-warrant returns” by the prosecutors handling the case,according to the judge. Declaring that “errors and ethical lapses in this case are pervasive”, she vacated the verdict and dismissed the charges as well as chastising those prosecutors for falling short of their “constitutional and ethical obligations” in “this unfortunate chapter” and criticizing Bove for providing sufficient supervision to prevent those failures.Bove became a private attorney, joining the law firm of Todd Blanche, whom Trump hired in 2023 to defend him in the New York case involving his payment of hush-money to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. Blanche brought Bove along as his second chair. The qualities that made him a black sheep in the US attorney’s office recommended him to Blanche and his client. In Bove’s questioning of David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer, about his payments to women in his “catch-and-kill” scheme to protect Trump, Bove twicebotchedthe presentation of evidence, was admonished by the judge and apologized. Trump was convicted of 34 felonies of financial fraud to subvert an election.Upon Trump’s election, he appointed Bove as acting deputy attorney general and then associate deputy once Todd Blanche was confirmed as deputy, reuniting the law partners, both Trump defense attorneys now resuming that role in an official capacity.On 31 January, Bove sent two memos, thefirstfiring dozens of justice department prosecutors and thesecondfiring FBI agents who had worked on the cases of January 6 insurrectionists, whom Trump pardoned on his inauguration day. Bove quoted Trump that their convictions were “a grave national injustice”. He also had his own history of conflict with fellow prosecutors and FBI agents.Asked about his actions by Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, Bove presented himself as even-handed. “I did and continue to condemn unlawful behavior, particularly violence against law enforcement,” hesaid. “At the same time, I condemn heavy-handed and unnecessary tactics by prosecutors and agents.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The code of omerta was working to frustrate questioning.Bove also deflected questions about his central role in the dropping of charges against Eric Adams. The acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, Danielle Sassoon, had resigned in protest, writing in aletterthat Bove’s memo directing her to dismiss the charges had “nothing to do with the strength of the case”. She noted that in the meeting to fix “what amounted to a quid pro quo … Mr Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting’s conclusion.”Questioned about the Adams scandal, Bove denied any wrongdoing. Senator John A Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, played his helpmate. HeaskedBove to “swear to your higher being” that there was no quid pro quo. “Absolutely not,” Bove said. “Do you swear on your higher being?” “On every bone in my body,” Bove replied. Hallelujah!Then Bove was asked about the letter sent by former justice department lawyer Erez Reuveni alleging that Bove planned the defiance of court rulings against the administration’s deportation policy. “I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” Bove said.Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, repeatedly asked him if it was true he had said “fuck you” as his suggested plan of action against adverse court decisions. Bove hemmed and hawed, and finally said: “I don’t recall.” Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, remarked: “I am hoping more evidence is going to come out that shows that you lied before this committee.”Grassley, however, succeeded in protecting Bove. Bondi and Blanche stared down the Republican senators whose majority can put Bove on the bench. He is Trump’s model appointment of what he wants in a judge. In announcing his nomination, Trumptweeted: “Emil Bove will never let you down!”In another scene in The Godfather, Virgil “The Turk” Sollozzo, another Mafia boss, comes to Vito Corleone, offering a deal to cut him in on the narcotics trade. “I need, Don Corleone,” he says, “those judges that you carry in your pockets like so many nickels and dimes.” It was an offer that the Godfather refused.

He has unashamedlyflashed an apparent Nazi salute;encouragedrightwing extremists in Germany and elsewhere;falsely claimedthere is a “genocide” in South Africaagainst white farmers; callouslycelebrated the dismantling of USAID, whose shuttering will lead tothe deaths of millions, according to a study published in the Lancet this week; andincreased misinformation and empowered extremistson his Twitter/X platform while advancing his sham “I am a free speech absolutist” claims. And so much more.So the news that Donald Trump “will take a look” at deporting his billionaire former “first buddy” Musk has many smirking and shrugging: “Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.”I like a good comeuppance, but this doesn’t please me at all. It sends a chill down the spine. It is the use of law enforcement agencies as a tool to chill debate, to silence disagreement and dissent, and to punish political opposition. Democracy isdimming fastin the United States, but threats to deport US citizens for disagreeing with the governing administration’s policies are the domain of authoritarian regimes such asBelarusorCameroon.Ice is cracking down on Trump’s own supporters. Will they change their minds? | Tayo BeroRead moreComing just hours after his officialsraised the possibilityof stripping Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral candidate for New York who was naturalised in 2018, of his US citizenship, Trump’s threat should have all of America – a country of immigrants – appalled, afraid and up in arms. As theGuardian reportedon Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, appeared to pave the way for an investigation into Mamdani’s status after Andy Ogles, a rightwing Republican congressman for Tennessee, called for his citizenship to be revoked on the grounds that he might have concealed his support for “terrorism” during the naturalization process. Trump has branded Mamdani “a pure communist” and said “we don’t need a communist in this country”.Mamdani has not broken any laws. His sin? Running for office.In his threats against Mamdani and Musk, the president comes across like the notorious Republican senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. McCarthy was, according to the Harvard law dean Ervin Griswold, “judge, jury, prosecutor, castigator, and press agent, all in one”. Trump’s threats to Musk and Mamdani are a departure from the administration’s modus operandi of targeting foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian organizing on US college campuses. It is now targeting people it disagrees with on any issue. The threats are not based on any generally applicable laws but on the whim of the president or other administration leaders. It is an escalation of the assault on civil liberties using government entities to arbitrarily investigate and potentially punish critics.Over the past four weeks Musk’s sin has been to vehemently oppose Trump’ssweeping spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination”. Musk is of course not concerned about the bill’sslashing of health insurance, food stamps and other aid for the poor, but that it does not slash enough and that its cuts to green energy tax credits maycost his company, Tesla, about $1.2bn.But Musk is a US citizen with the right to oppose a piece of legislation without threats from the highest office in the land and the fear of deportation. When Musk poured$288m of his moneyinto Trump and other Republicans’ 2024 candidacies, no one raised a hand to question his credentials as an American. Instead, the administration gave him therun of the White Houseincluding midnight ice cream binges and a job asa glorified bean counterat the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge).The Guardian view on Trump and deportation protests: the king of confected emergencies | EditorialRead moreThe hypocrisy and the corruption embedded within Trump’s deportation threats is mind-boggling but unsurprising given his track record. The consequence, like the McCarthyism of the 1950s, is a climate of fear and a chilling of political discourse and action. Proud Americans who arrived here recently, such as Mamdani, are fearful of running for office, of speaking their minds in true American tradition, despite having the same responsibilities and privileges as every other American conferred on them. Trump’s threat does to Musk what it does to every immigrant: it shuts them up, it holds over their head the possibility of made-up charges and deportation to El Salvador or some other country.Musk and his like were chortling when the Columbia University activistMahmoud Khalilwas cruelly detained for months. It is in the nature of those who like to tweet about freedom but do not think about it deeply enough, such as Musk, to not realize that their silence when the rights of a Khalil or a Mamdani are trampled upon will come back to haunt them. The Republican rump is silent today as Musk is threatened with deportation, just as it has been when masked men have come for Khalil and others who dared exercise their first amendment rights.There will be silence when they come for theRepublicans. That’s because we will all be gone by then, after no one else said a thing.Justice Malala is a political commentator and author of The Plot To Save South Africa: The Week Mandela Averted Civil War and Forged a New NationExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniUS immigrationRepublicansTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

His place in history is now clear. His rise, like that of a reawakened left, indicated that America was ready to move on from its long era of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. In office, Trump has blocked the exits by doubling down on both.The first of those slurs, neoliberalism, refers to the commitment across the political spectrum to use government to protect markets and their hierarchies, rather than to moderate or undo them. The second, neoconservatism, is epitomized by a belligerent and militaristic foreign policy. The domestic policy bill now making its way through Congress, with its payoff to the rich and punishment of the poor, is a monument to neoliberalism; theIranstrike a revival of neoconservatism.Don’t count on the Iran-Israel ceasefire lasting. What Netanyahu really wants is a forever war | Simon TisdallRead moreUp to now, uncertainty about Trump’s place in history has prevailed, in part because he has done little and dithered so much. From before he took office, apocalyptic premonition of the doom he might bring reigned supreme. Everyone assumed that the Trump era was going to be different, disagreeing only about the exact shape of the horror. On the right, some projected their hopes for transformation on the president, anticipating a different future, wishcasting without knowing whether (or when) their leader would side with them.Now, with his bill and his bombing, Trump has confirmed beyond any doubt that he is a man of a familiar past instead. Though the damage that neoliberalism and neoconservatism wrought helped make Trump’s charlatanry a credible choice for millions, the man himself stands for the eternal return of those very same policies. Trump’s appeal to the working class and more measured rhetoric about war from the start of his political career suggested that he might renege on these two dominant creeds from the beltway “swamp”. He renewed them both instead.This is where Trump’s ultimate significance so clearly lies: in continuity, not change. He busted a lot of norms from the first in 2017. Cries of abnormalcy and authoritarianism arose before there was evidence to back them – and evidence has accumulated through both terms. Charlottesville and January 6 in the first – intimations of deeper reservoirs of hate that could come out of American woodwork, with Trump coyly pandering to the mobs – were preludes to both mass and targeted immigration roundups in this term, reminiscent of classical fascism.Yet climactically, and when it mattered most, Trump has chosen to walk in lockstep with the dead consensus in domestic and foreign policy of the past half-century – not merely among conservatives, but among many liberals. Americans do best when the rich do best of all, with the poor punished for crime and sloth: that has long been our outlook. And the country must go it alone with military force, in order to back our interests or principles or both, Americans have long presumed.Trump is far more a politician of American continuity with the past 50 years than many originally feared (or hoped)Neoliberalism and neoconservatism each has more complexity than this – but, leaning into both, Trump has shown in recent weeks they are not much more complicated either. And if so, Trump is far more a politician of American continuity with the past 50 years than many originally feared (or hoped).The “beautiful” domestic policy bill is one of the morally ugliest in American history. Making Trump’s signature tax cuts from his first term permanent requires both draconian cuts to programs (Medicaid for the poor, worst of all) and piling up even more debt for future generations to figure out. It turns out that Ronald Reagan and the Democrats who followed him in lowering taxation and “reforming” welfare (including by imposing work requirements, as this bill does) were not in another world from Trump. He is in theirs. Revealingly, the main trouble that Trump faced in getting the obscenity of a bill passed – and that he still faces in the House – is convincing Republicans who claim to hate deficit spending so much to rationalize even greater cuts to welfare.On the world stage, Trump has longed for the recognition of a Nobel peace prize. But the deals he thinks will deserve it have proved elusive. In Israel/Palestine, the ceasefire he helped force has broken down and the civilian toll has worsened. In Ukraine, the considerable distance between the warring parties has meant that Trump has not managed to either antagonize or lure either to come to terms. Unlike during his first four years, his Iran intervention means that, rather than bringing peace, exacerbating war is his foreign policy legacy for now.Squandering the inclinations of his base and outraging many more lukewarm supporters sick of foreign entanglements, it was a surprise that he acted with the reckless militarism that was once American common sense. He is no doubt open to any deals that come his way – apparently thinking that Canada or Greenland should clamor to be annexed. But it was foolish in response to the early rhetoric of his second term to expect Trump to revert to expansionist war by sending troops. But in sending B-2 bombers on so escalatory a mission to Iran, he clarified his support for war – incurring risks like no other presidents have taken. If the peace he wants to brag about doesn’t materialize, he is not above a dose of coercive violence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Where populist Republicans have had to grit their teeth and support a neoliberal bill – so much for the working-class party they promised – it was even more spectacular that neoconservatives overcame the hatred for Trump that had helped them launder their former reputations for catastrophic warmongering.With neocon scion Bill Kristol in the lead, after the Iran strike they fawned over the man whom they had spent years castigating as irresponsible, or malignant, or both. No wonder: Trump, far from acting as an isolationist or realist, was executing one of the longest-held and longest-denied neoconservative fantasies: that bombing Iran’s nuclear program off the map would work, and might have the fringe benefit of causing the regime to fall. It remains a fantasy. But Trump’s place in history is now defined by that fantasy more than by any other foreign policy choice he has made so far.Like in his first term, when he ordered the assassination in Iraq of Iranian general and terror master Qassem Suleimani in 2020, Trump’s strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities was illegal. But as the saying goes, Trump’s escalatory and risky use of bunker-busting munitions to wipe Fordow and other sites off the map was worse than a crime; it was a mistake. At best, it elicited a face-saving attack from Iran so that it could come to the negotiating table with a nuclear program to continue in the future; at worst, it will prompt Iran to intensify its efforts to achieve the weapon. And while Israel has certainly set back Iran’s regional designs and capacity for sponsoring terror, there are no signs the regime will relent in its policies.With hopes that he might stand for restraint shredded, it is likelier that a lackey will find a place onMount Rushmorethan that Trump will get the call from Oslo he badly wants. But like the politicians whose faces are already carved in the granite of South Dakota, Trump is a man of the past – and never more clearly than in recent weeks, as America continues to look for someone to liberate it from the zombie neoliberalism and neoconservatism that still define their disastrous present and president.Samuel Moyn is the Kent professor of law and history at Yale University, where he also serves as head of Grace Hopper CollegeExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS domestic policyUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsIranMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Still, the jury – and Diddy’s jubilant supporters – sided with their alleged abuserThu 3 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 11.12 EDTShareSean Combs, the musician variously known as “Diddy”, “Puffy”, “P Diddy” and “Love”, made a conspicuous scene in the courtroom when the verdict was read. He put his hands into a prayer gesture and mouthed “thank you” to the jurors, and pumped his fist in the air. A federal jury in New York on Wednesday had acquitted Combs on federal charges of sex-trafficking women, finding him guilty only on lesser charges of transporting the male prostitutes he allegedly forced the women to have sex with across state lines. The mixed verdict was seen as a triumph for Combs, who faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted on trafficking and conspiracy charges. Outside, jubilant supporters of Combs – which have in recent weeks included the provocative rapper Kanye West – erupted into celebration. Some reportedly poured baby oil on each other and yelled: “It’s not Rico, it’s FREAKO.”Those triumphant chants were references tothe organized group sex encounters that women – including two who testified as witnesses for federal prosecutors – have described as rapes. The women – two ex-partners of Combs’s, the singer Cassie Ventura and another alleged victim known as “Jane” – told the court repeatedly over the course of an eight-week trial that they were coerced into participating in the encounters, which Combs called “freak-offs”, with violence, drugs, coercive financial arrangements and threats. The encounters were filmed by Combs, and the videos were shown to the jury; in addition to the testimony of the women and the videos of what they say were their assaults, jurors were also shown security footage of asavage beatingCombs inflicted on Ventura in a hotel hallway following one such party in 2016, and heard from a hotel security guard who says that Combs paid him $100,000 to destroy video evidence of his conduct.Why did it take a humiliating video for us to believe Cassie’s claims about Diddy? | Moira DoneganRead moreEven according to the version of events that Combs himself has admitted to, the musician is abusive, cruel, manipulative and violent toward women. He has admitted both to using drugs and to beating Ventura. But the charges he faced in the federal trial that stretched the length of two months in New York hinged on whether the women’s participation in the group sex parties was consensual. They said it wasn’t; Combs says it was. As they so often do in sexual assault cases, the jury sided with the man.It is almost banal, by now, to observe that we are in the midst of a #MeToo backlash, and that the brief span – now nearly a decade behind us – when men were held momentarily accountable for their sexual abuse and exploitation of women has been replaced with a sadistic and gruesomely triumphant restoration of the status quo ante, with powerful men afforded impunity for sexual violence against women, with their supporters and fans taking vicarious pleasure in their consequence-free demonstrations of male status, and with the misogynist collective contempt of women who come forward now becoming a centerpiece of online communities and celebrity media alike. In a piece on #MeToo backlash, the writer Jamie Hood referred to the ebb of collective outrage over sexual violence as a kind of “moral lethargy”. But in the chanting men outside the federal courthouse on Wednesday, I see something darker and more energetic, something that is not indifferent to men’s sexual entitlement and the suffering they inflict on women with it, but actively in thrall to it. Those who oppose sexual abuse, it seems, lack all conviction. Those who support it are full of passionate intensity.Outside the small circle of feminist solidarity, it turns out, no one is much moved by rape victims’ painIt is true that part of the cause for Combs’s acquittal lies in a problem that predates #MeToo and therefore cannot be blamed on its backlash: the epistemic difficulties of abusive relationships. Abuse by men of their female partners is frequently psychologically baroque, employing tactics of humiliation, coercion, gaslighting and shamelessly opportunistic exploitation of the tendency, shared by many women and especially the young ones, to esteem themselves unworthy and broken, and to look to men to be their saviors. Such dynamics tend to produce conflicting testimony from the victims, who might say loving or forgiving things to their abusers while the relationship is ongoing that are used against them later by abuse apologists, misogynists and defense attorneys. In the Combs case, the defense team could point to text messages their client exchanged with the women in which they expressed affection and desire. To the jury, these outweighed the texts in which they said they felt forced into the encounters, tried to avoid them, or were reminded by Combs when he demanded sex that he was paying their rent.But it is worth dwelling, I think, on what the women at the center of this case endured in order to try to make their alleged abuse recognized by the law. Ventura and Jane were subjected to grueling testimony about what they say were tremendously dark experiences. Strangers were shown videos of them having sex; Ventura was beaten, and a video of her beating went viral. The defense, meanwhile, has not been chastened by any supposed post-#MeToo cultural taboos against victim-blaming or slut-shaming. In cross-examination, the women were humiliated with lines of questioning meant to portray them as gold diggers and sluts. Intimate harms they endured, physically and emotionally, were picked over by a national audience. And after all that, the jury still sided with the man they say trafficked and abused them.Diddy’s lawyers are banking on the ‘mutual abuse’ defence. Newsflash: it’s not a thing | Tayo BeroRead moreIt is a central tenet of feminist politics that the unspeakability of sexual abuse is part of what allows it to thrive. In the second wave, activists formed “consciousness raising” circles, in which women would discuss the function of sexism in their own lives; the idea was that only by naming and articulating the violence and indignity they were subjected to could women be prepared to change it.#MeToo functioned on a similar principle: the idea was that women, by telling their stories, could find solidarity with one another. And maybe they have: one can hope, desperately, that wherever they are, Ventura and Jane are surrounded by women who are angry for them. But in #MeToo, women’s storytelling had a second task.Women, it was thought, in telling their stories, could not only find solidarity with one another, but could change the minds of the reflexively misogynist world, could convince the institutions and cultures and communities that had long dismissed and mocked us to instead take our side, see us with compassion and deliver us justice.That part turned out to be naive. Outside the small circle of feminist solidarity, it turns out, no one is much moved by rape victims’ pain. Instead, audiences tend to dismiss these women: to resent their displays of woundedness, to be annoyed by their demands for accountability. They want the women of #MeToo to shut up. If verdicts like this are any indication, maybe we should.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsOpinion#MeToo movementRape and sexual assaultGenderWomenLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Instead, tell voters that taxes must rise – and be clear about the good that will doThu 3 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 12.50 EDTShareRachel Reeves will not be sacked, because she is unsackable. The ever-hysterical bond markets just confirmed that by spinning out of control over her tears, then restoring previous rates as soon as Keir Starmer’s serial interviewsconfirmed heartfelt supportafter she was seen to be crying during PMQs. Quite right. Joined at the hip, her tough fiscal policy is his. History shows that prime ministers rarely last after sacking their chancellors.The question for both, and all ofLabour, is: what next? Every management guru and motivational speaker will tell you that mistakes don’t matter – the key to success is what you learn and how adroitly you change. Labour has four long years ahead and, most important of all, a stonking great majority. They are the masters so long as they don’t frighten the bond markets that ejected Liz Truss and forced Donald Trump’s handbrake tariff U-turn.A change of direction is forced on Starmer and Reeves by circumstances mostly not of their making. Every month that passes reconfirms their dire inheritance and the harsh global economic climate. The Bank of England, wrong so often, delays rate cuts and unwinds quantitative easing at a damagingly faster rate than other central banks, harming public finances, as my colleague Randeep Rameshpointed out.Everyone knows tax rises are inevitable in the October budget: £6bn lost because of U-turns on disability benefits and winter fuel allowance is only a trivial rounding error in about£1.3tn of spending. How will they do it?Let’s hope the government has learned that fiddling with tiny tax rises causes maximum outrage for minimum gain. It’s dead right to challenge such things as farmers and family businesses escaping inheritance tax, or the well-off getting winter fuel allowances that might be used, according to the Spectator, for buying thebest possible bottle of wine. But confronting older people, disabled people, farmers and small business lobbies with no overarching explanation was political suicide. The only tax rise commanding wide public support is removing VAT relief from private schools to spend on state schools (though you would never guess it from Tory press outrage).Minor taxes have gigantic coverage and wide public awareness, while big spending in tens of billions passes people by, a one-day announcement vanishing into the political ether. Bad comms, some Labour people grumble. Maybe so – but the real lack of messaging comes from the top. Yes, we know about the “non-negotiable” iron straitjacket and other mean, tough things, but we hear a lot less about purpose, hope, what George HW Bush dismissed sneerily as “the vision thing” (he was a one-term president). Yet you can detect Labour’s priorities when it actually spends taxpayers’ money on the good stuff.It’s time to remind citizens that their taxes go to things everyone values most – a strongNHS, good schools, safe streets, green energy, public places and parks to be proud of, and, of course, defence. The things that really matter can only be bought through taxation. Let’s hear that speech a hundred times from every minister; taxes will rise anyway, so get on the front foot and remind people that taxes are not a “burden”, but the price of civilisation. Britain has paid too little for too long compared with similar countries, and it shows in comparatively worse growth and services. Tell people we are not a high-tax country at all.Bad politics would be trying to sneak through tax rises unexplained, something that would be bound to fail. The Sunak-Hunt government lied through its teeth, promised things it never funded, pencilled in imaginary spending cuts for the future and introduced the unaffordable 4p national insurance cuts bribe that never paid off.Labour has no choice but honesty, after suffering the biggestdip in popularityof any newly elected UK government in 40 years. YouGov finds the greatest reason for defection is “broken promises or not delivering”. Here’s the irony: keeping its tax promises is its greatest risk for non-delivery. But for the best examination of how well or badly Labour’s first year has really gone, look at Full Fact’s thoroughanalysis of 62 manifesto pledges. I expected gloom, but was surprised at how relatively positive this diagnosis was. Most of Labour’s best outcomes will take years, such as building homes and huge sustainable energy projects. An impatient public may not wait, but the emphasis on long-term investment, green energy, housing, transport and defence is a brave endeavour.A blizzard of policies is emerging from months of reviews. Angela Rayner’s announcement this week that her£39bn social and affordable homes programmewould have at least 60% for social rent, was widely welcomed. Employment policy now relies, as it always should have done, on encouraging support from newly trained work coaches, not punishing benefit cuts, as did Labour’s successful 1997 New Deal.Thursday saw the10-year NHS plan, with its emphasis on prioritising community over hospital treatment, prevention before sickness, and the white heat of IT technology to drag the NHS into the 21st century. I spent time last week with Wes Streeting, when he spoke of gross health inequality in Blackpool, England’s worst area forpoverty and sickness, before visiting Whitegate health centre in the town, the kind of specialist health centre every neighbourhood needs. More of these are needed in hard-pressed places. But poverty is not for the NHS to solve. The child poverty taskforce led by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson has to restore faith in Labour’s prime purpose to give all children fair life chances.It so happens that Starmer’s first year in power on Saturday falls exactly on the 80th anniversary of Clement Attlee’s election in 1945. Times were far harder, debt far higher, but look what can be done, driving on regardless.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now that he’s gone, I don’t know how to miss himThu 3 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 18.56 EDTShareWhen the woman from the pet crematorium asked what to put on the plaque, I had a single thought.Rupert,I told her,who ate a live mouse. The mouse had been inside the house. We had a full army chasing it – me, the kids, a herd of cats – but it had escaped our clutches for a full 30 minutes until, to my horror and delight, I turned just in time to see a scaly tail slip between my dog’s jaws.I’ve always wondered how long a mouse could live in a dog’s digestive tract. Too long, probably. Rupert lay down for a long time after that.In the 14 years I lived with my dog, I learned exactly one thing about him: he loved to eat stuff that could kill him. I once planted a pair of camellia trees in pots under my window, only to come back at the end of the day to find them devoured to their roots. An emergency vet visit revealed an entire tray of sausages not even chewed. He ate dark chocolate, including foil. He once ate a packet of crayons and literally shat out a rainbow. His iron stomach was undefeated to the end.All of this is true. But it’s also all I knew of him. And now that he’s gone, I don’t know how to miss him.Our obsession with spoiling pets has gone too far: your dog doesn’t care if its collar is from Burberry | Van BadhamRead moreI didn’t have dogs growing up. We were cat people. But movies and books and the general population led me to believe that a dog was a guaranteed soulmate: a shadow who would not leave your side for a moment. A dog would miss you every second of every day. It would relish in your joy and comfort you in sadness. It would protect, honour, cherish and adore you.Rupert did none of this. He had no interest in people. Never – not once – did he come to me for attention. If I tried to walk him, he refused to leave the house. He flunked out of puppy school, didn’t respond to his name and couldn’t be trusted with smaller, food-sized dogs. If he couldn’t eat it or sleep on it, it simply did not exist.I tried hard to get to know him. He hated baths. When he knew food was coming, he stamped his front paws like an excited child. He was allergic to cats and would sometimes sneeze so violently he slammed his enormous skull into the floor.He was incomprehensibly handsome. He was black and soft like a bear, with small, wide-set ears and a white mane. He had one brown eye (glaucoma took the other one). If you parted the black fur on top of his head, it was inexplicably ginger underneath. On the odd occasion he was seen in public, people would cross the street to call him beautiful and he would give them absolutely nothing in return.At the end of his life, Ru was completely deaf, mostly blind and rapidly deteriorating. But when the vet asked if his behaviour was changing I had to concede that no, it was the same as ever: deep sleep punctuated by eating something revolting.View image in fullscreen‘He was black and soft like a bear, with small, wide-set ears and a white mane’I don’t think Rupert disliked me. I’m not sure he knew I even lived here. The only time I ever saw him acknowledge another living creature wasduring my other dog’s cancer treatment, when she was away in surgery. On those days, he would lie by the front door and cry softly, sometimes long into the night. She does the same for him now. Just waiting.He died in the middle of the night. We all went with him to the small room. It was 3am. He had been barking nonstop for six hours and I knew – finally, something I understood about him – that this was the end.Loyal, cute and $50,000: we would do anything for our pets. But what if we can’t afford it?Read moreIn the last minutes I lay on the lino floor with my face in his fur and asked him what he remembered. Did he remember sleeping under my feet when we drove home for the first time? Did he remember getting a steak with a candle for his birthdays? Did he remember when he ate a live mouse? And then the barking stopped, and when I sat up he was sleeping with his paws stretched out in front of him, the way he did when he was a baby.Later in the day, flowers arrived at our house. Heartfelt cards shared in our grief.“You’ve lost your shadow,” people said, but that wasn’t true. Rupert never reduced himself to being my shadow. He was a dog. To anthropomorphise him was to undermine the simple, canine way he looked at the world. Eat. Sleep. Eat again, but grosser.“They leave such a big hole,” people said, but he hasn’t. It’s a very small hole, actually: a specific corner of the kitchen, underneath the window, where he slept so aggressively soundly that the tiles eventually cracked right off.I bought new vases. I lined up the bouquets on the mantelpiece. I struggled to understand how my stinky, slovenly dog fit into this picturesque sadness. Then I noticed all the flowers were dog-safe. No daffodils, azaleas or lilies of the valley. I stood in front of this display of canine sorrow and realised: he was there. The one thing I knew about him.“Thank you for the flowers,” I told my friends. “Rupert would have loved to eat them.”Explore more on these topicsDogsOpinionPetscommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve heard it time and again.The former Labour leaderNeil Kinnockdescribed how Starmer was among the first to turn up on his doorstep after he lost his beloved wife, Glenys. “You don’t have time for this; you’ve got a party to lead,” Kinnock told him.Then there was the former employee who started crying over a cup of coffee as she recounted to me how warm her boss had been when she lost a loved one.The lawyerParvais Jabbar, who has been a close friend of the PM’s for almost 30 years since they started working together to oppose the death penalty around the world, offered the same opinion. “On a personal level, Keir is the opposite of ruthless,” he said.But on a political level?Having spoken to more than 100 sources for my paperbackTaken As Red, which tracks Starmer’s career from the moment he arrived in Westminster as a backbench MP through shadow cabinet roles to becoming Labour leader and then his first year as prime minister, I discovered his willingness to be politically ruthless, especially when it came to fixing things that had gone wrong. And right now it feels as if things have gone very wrong for the prime minister.On the eve of the anniversary of his first year in power, Starmer has not just suffered a humiliating climbdown over flagship reforms. His party is alsotrailing Reform UKin the polls and his personal popularity has spiralled down.Ben Walker at Britain Elects has compared Starmer’s position with those of his predecessors through their first year and showed that his-33 approval rating, 339 days into the role, was six points lower than Rishi Sunak’s (-27) at the same point and 77 points below Tony Blair’s (+44).Although some of the problems have little to do with the Treasury (such as a failure to plan across government, or thefreebiegate scandal), a number have emerged directly from No 11 Downing Street, including policies on winter fuel payments, inheritance tax changes for farmers and now welfare.That is why the sight of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,visibly upsetduring yesterday’s prime minister’s questions, and Starmer’s failure to fully back her in the moment (although his team later did), are leading people to ask how the prime minister will act in the face of declining popularity. Could he sack Reeves? Or his chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney?I know from studying Starmer that he is certainly capable of being ruthless. To that end, surely no one is safe.Don’t forget that he actually moved McSweeney on once before. After Labour’s disastrous loss in the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, thekey strategist was redeployedfrom Starmer’s chief of staff to campaign director. And he wasn’t the only one. McSweeney’s successor,Sam White, found his period in charge also brought to an early end, as did the next in line,Sue Gray.They are far from the only examples of Starmer’s willingness to take harsh action for political reasons. Take the phone call he made only 20 minutes after becoming Labour leader.Jennie Formby, who had been general secretary for Labour for two years, had wanted to discuss how she and Starmer would work together in the coming weeks. We won’t, Starmer told her. One of her allies told me there was shock. Pushing out Formby, who had been unwell with cancer, was without precedent, they said, pointing out it took Jeremy Corbyn three years to replace the previous general secretary.But after the controversies under Corbyn, including an antisemitism crisis, Starmer wanted to overhaul the party and did not hesitate when it came tosacking his leadership rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and thenremoving Corbyn himself. Starmer also forced through rule changes which meant that those on the most leftwing flank of the party would struggle to ever again reach the ballot for leadership.So I don’t doubt that Starmer could act now if he felt it were necessary. Arguably there was a streak of ruthlessness in his decision to tell his biographer Tom Baldwin that he “deeply regrets” using the term “island of strangers” in a recent speech.As for McSweeney, there are rumours of vulnerability, suggesting that he could be replaced by someone such as Liz Lloyd, Tony Blair’s former deputy chief of staff who joined Starmer’s administration last November as director of policy. But it’s worth remembering that Starmer credits McSweeney with last year’s election victory and for turning things around when he hit tough times in the past.Would he really move against Reeves? In this case, there is definitely a different dynamic from those he has acted against in the past. Starmer has liked and trusted Reeves since a breakfast shortly before he became leader. And surely this has been their joint project, in which the most controversial decisions being blamed on the Treasury could also be laid at No 10’s door.After the welfare vote debacle, this much is clear: Starmer must change. Labour MPs will demand it | Rafael BehrRead moreSources tell me that the PM trusted his chancellor so completely over means-testing winter fuel payments that he nodded through the proposal based on the figures alone. As for welfare, senior figures under Starmer have known for weeks that it was going to be a major problem.When it comes to this threatened rebellion that was unprecedented in scale, many blame the prime minister himself for failing to reach out personally to his own backbenchers and persuade them to remain loyal. Rebuilding relations with backbenchers is going to be key for Starmer if he is to recover.For some close to Starmer, his loyalty to Reeves has been “frustrating”. I don’t doubt that it has wobbled and that he would be prepared to act. But he must also know that removing a chancellor carries the risk of turning all the ire towards him. As ever, he’ll deliberate and weigh the options very carefully. He is ruthless, that we know – but far from reckless.Anushka Asthana is the US editor for Channel 4 News and author ofTaken As Red: The Truth About Starmer’s LabourExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourRachel ReevesPMQscommentShareReuse this content"

None of the Israelis I spoke to were willing to publicly name these horrorsThu 3 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 07.13 EDTShareIt has been less than two months since my niece Juri – a bright, giggling six-year-old – was killed inGaza. We buried her while her sister recovered from her injuries and her father tried to walk again on shattered legs. Just a week ago, I was struck by another unbearable loss. My 16-year-old nephew Ali was killed: a drone-fired rocket tore through him and six members of our extended family while they were sitting outside the last house we had left – the only one that hadn’t yet been reduced to dust.Ali was split in two. That’s not a metaphor: it’s literally what the rocket did to his body. A child trying to escape the stifling heat inside a home without electricity, without water, without safety. A child whose only crime was sitting on a plastic chair in a corridor with his uncles – men in their 60s – trying to breathe, trying to live, trying to find a sliver of comfort in a place where even comfort has become a threat.Why were they killed? They were not fighters. They had no weapons. They were not hiding. They were not “human shields”. They were not even moving. Just sitting quietly, maybe sipping tea, maybe just sweating and waiting for the night breeze. And then – a drone. A rocket. A flash. A crater. A silence that never ends. There is no “mistake” here. No misfire. The drone did not guess. It hovered. It watched. It picked its target. It aimed. And it hit. Directly.And still there will be no headlines. No outrage, no press conferences, no candlelit vigils in western capitals, no hashtags, no questions asked. But I want to tell you something else. Even after all the horror inflicted on my family by Israel – the killings, the starvation, the loss – I said yes to an invitation to attend a peace conference in Paris. It was part of a series of gatherings leading up to a major summit that was meant to take place in New York, where President Emmanuel Macron had promised to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state.Not long after the Paris meeting, the New York conference was quietly postponed. No explanation. No urgency. As if peace – like everything else in our lives – could be delayed indefinitely. Still, I went to Paris. I went even though I was warned there would be supporters of the Israeli governmentin the room.I didn’t flinch.I will go anywhere and speak to anyone if it means stopping the mass killing of my people.I went not for revenge but for hope. I sat in a room with Israeli participants who said they wanted peace, just like I did. But something was off. While we all spoke of peace, only I seemed willing to speak of death. None of the Israelis I spoke to would acknowledge the genocide in Gaza. At best, a few admitted that Israel was committing war crimes – but not genocide. This, in spite of the overwhelming consensus amonginternational organisations,Israeli academicsandgenocide scholarsthat what is happening in Gaza amounts to a genocide.A couple approached me quietly and, in whispers, confessed that, yes, what was happening was indeed a genocide. But they said it like a secret. A thing too dangerous to say aloud. As if the truth was a weapon that might ruin the prospect of peace.We spoke of peace in abstract terms. Big, sweeping, beautiful ideas about coexistence and shared futures. But no one wanted to confront the blood-soaked ground beneath us. No one wanted to talk about starving children. Or the drone that tore through my nephew’s body. Or the silence that follows the screams. Even some fellow Palestinians – from other parts of Palestine – didn’t want to acknowledge the ongoing massacre in Gaza. I felt extremely alone. I felt like an obstacle. Like I was too raw, too inconvenient, too real. Everyone else was busy building bridges while I was still trying tokeep my family alive.In the Jabalia refugee camp, my sister has reached breaking point. What will it take to stop this nightmare? | Ahmed NajarRead moreAt one point, an Israeli woman asked me: “Wouldn’t it be better if Gazans left for a while, until Gaza is rebuilt?” She said it as if exile was neutral.As if 1948hadn’t happened. As if we hadn’t learned that when Palestinians leave, they’re not allowed to return. I told her: perhaps in theory, if people could leave temporarily and come back, then maybe. I even said: “Perhaps they could stay in the Negev desert [in southern Israel] and return when Gaza is rebuilt.” She stormed out. “You don’t want peace,” she told me.But amid all of this, I also spoke with another Israeli woman – kind, thoughtful and honest – who told me that she had been directly impacted by the 7 October attack. She didn’t hide her pain. “We are the minority in Israel,” she said to me. “Most people are much more anti-Palestinian.” I believed her. And I appreciated her willingness to talk. But even she – someone who truly seemed to want peace – couldn’t bring herself to call what’s happening in Gaza a genocide.And that left me wondering: if this is the small minority of Israelis who believe in coexistence, and even they cannot confront what is happening in Gaza, what hope do we really have? If those who say they want peace cannot even recognise our suffering, what kind of peace are we talking about?I don’t know whether that conference left me hopeless about peace or whether it taught me something essential: that peace between Palestinians and Israelis will require unimaginable courage. The kind that doesn’t flinch from reality or hide behind lofty words while people are being buried under concrete and fire.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead morePeace will require Palestinians to be willing to speak about their pain and still see the humanity of those who inflicted it. And it will require Israelis who are brave enough to confront what their government has done, and continues to do, in their name. There will be no real peace until both sides can stand face to face and say: “We were wrong. We were complicit. And we choose something better.”Ali was killed after I returned from Paris, where I’d sat in the room and tried to build bridges. I’d told people about my niece Juri and begged them to see our pain – and now Ali too is gone. But something inside me has shifted. Not into rage but into resolve. Peace cannot be built on silence or denial. It cannot be built while Palestinians are treated as disposable. It begins with justice, truth and a political solution that guarantees the rights of Palestinians to live in freedom, in dignity and with self-determination. And at the very least, it must begin with the most basic right of all: the right to stay alive.Ahmed Najar is a financial and political analyst as well as a playwrightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The corporations would asset-strip our brains, but we can take back controlThu 3 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 06.41 EDTShareAyoung woman I met recently remarked that it was not so much the existence of pure evil that drove her berserk, but rather people or institutions with the capacity to do good who instead ended up damaging humanity. Her musing made me think ofKarl Marx, whose quarrel with capitalism was precisely that – not so much that it was exploitative but that it dehumanised and alienated usdespitebeing such a progressive force.Preceding social systems might have been more oppressive or exploitative than capitalism. However, only under capitalism have humans been so fully alienated from our products and environment, so divorced from our labour, so robbed of even a modicum of control over what we think and do. Capitalism, especially after it shifted into itstechnofeudal phase, turned us all into some version of Caliban or Shylock – monads in an archipelago of isolated selves whose quality of life is inversely related to the abundance of gizmos our newfangled machinery produces.This week, alongside a host of other politicians, writers and thinkers, I will be speaking at theMarxism 2025 festivalin London, and one of the questions that occupies me is the way in which young people today clearly feel this alienation Marx identified. But the backlash against immigrants and identity politics – not to mention the algorithmic distortion of their voices – paralyses them. Here Marx can re-enter with advice on how to overcome this paralysis – good advice that lies buried under the sands of time.Take the argument that minorities living in the west should assimilate lest we end up a society of strangers. When Marx was 25, he read a book by Otto Bauer, a thinker he respected, making the case that to qualify for citizenship, German Jews should renounce Judaism.Marx was livid. Though the young Marx had no time for Judaism, indeed for any religion, his passionate demolition of Bauer’s argument is a sight for sore eyes: “Does the standpoint ofpoliticalemancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion? … Just as the stateevangelizeswhen … it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, so the Jewacts politicallywhen, although a Jew, he demands civic rights.”The trick that Marx is teaching us here is how to combine a commitment to the religious freedom of Jews, Muslims, Christians etc with the wholesale rejection of the presumption that, in a class society, the state can represent the general interest. Yes, Jews, Muslims, people of faiths that we may not share – or even much like – must be emancipated immediately. Yes, women, black people and LGBTQ+ people must be granted equal rights well before any socialist revolution appears on the horizon. But freedom will take a lot more than that.Shifting to the topic of immigrant workers suppressing the wages of local workers, another minefield for today’s younger people, a letter Marx sent in 1870 to two associates in New York City offers brilliant clues on how to deal not only with the Nigel Farages of the world but also with some leftists who have bitten the anti-immigration bait.In his letter, Marx fully acknowledges that American and English employers were purposely exploiting cheap Irish immigrant labour, pitting them against native-born workers and weakening labour solidarity. But for Marx it was self-defeating for trade unions to turn against the Irish immigrants and espouse anti-immigration narratives. No, the solution was never to banish immigrant workers but to organise them. And if the problem is the weakness of the unions, or fiscal austerity, then the solution can never be to scapegoat immigrant workers.Speaking of trade unions, Marx also has some splendid advice for them. Yes, it is crucial to boost wages to reduce worker exploitation. But let us not fall for the fantasy of fair wages. The only way to render the workplace fair is to do away with an irrational system based on the strict separation of those who work but do not own and the tiny minority who own but do not work.In his words: “Trade unions work well as centres of resistance against the encroachments of capital. [But] [t]hey fail generally from limiting themselves to a guerrilla war against the effects of the existing system, instead of also trying to change it.”‘Capitalism is dead. Now we have something much worse’: Yanis Varoufakis on extremism, Starmer, and the tyranny of big techRead moreChange it into what? A new corporate structure based on the principle of one-employee-one-share-one vote – the kind of agenda that can truly inspire youngsters who crave freedom both from statism and from corporations driven by the bottom lines of private equity firms or an absent owner who may not even know he or she owns part of the firm they work for.Last, Marx’s freshness shines through when we try to make sense of the technofeudal world that big tech, along with big finance and our states, has surreptitiously encased us in. To understand why this is a form of technofeudalism, something much worse than surveillance capitalism, we need to think as Marx would have of our smartphones, tablets etc. To see them as a mutation of capital – or “cloud capital” – that directly modifies our behaviour. To grasp how mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs created a world where, while privatisation and private equity asset-strip all physical wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains.Only through Marx’s lens can we truly get it: that to own our minds individually, we must own cloud capital collectively.Yanis Varoufakis is the leader of MeRA25, a former finance minister and author ofTechnofeudalism: What Killed CapitalismExplore more on these topicsKarl MarxOpinionYanis VaroufakisImmigration and asylumEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

That takes courageThu 3 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 09.53 EDTShareAvery unusual thing happened at the weekend, an event so outlandish, so vanishingly rare, that even in these times of general chaos and disorder it deserves our attention: someone prominent joined the tiny cohort of people willing to publicly criticise Oprah. I’m not talking about an attack from the right. Donald Trump and his Maga cronies routinely go after Oprah Winfrey as (feel free to laugh) a lefty agitator. I’m talking about the actor Rosie O’Donnell, on Instagram,calling outAmerica’s queen for showing up at the Jeff Bezos wedding.Of course, criticising someone for throwing in their lot with Bezos shouldn’t be in the least controversial. The gross parade of wedding guests attending his marriage to Lauren Sánchez in Venice last weekend looked like a catwalk of shame. There was Leonardo DiCaprio,hiding his face with his hat(we still see you!), in the company of his positively geriatric 27-year-old girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti. There were the Kardashians, not hiding their faces. There was Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. And there, accompanied by her lady-in-waiting, Gayle King, who walked several paces behind her as is proper, was Oprah Winfrey.Why shouldn’t Oprah go to the wedding ofJeff Bezosand Lauren Sánchez? It’s a big splashy event that, given the chance, wouldn’t any of us have gone to as well? (Honestly? Probably.) Still, we hold Oprah to higher standards. It’s Oprah, for god sake, the woman we grew up adoring, who burst through so many ceilings, who Tina Fey correctly cast as a god-like figure in that episode of 30 Rock (where her character, Liz Lemon, took too many pills, got on a flight, and hallucinated that Oprah was sitting next to her in club class). In that scene, Fey did what we would all do if encountering Oprah while our inhibitions were lowered: she sniffed Oprah’s hair, told her she loved her and went on a deranged monologue that included the phrases “I eat emotionally” and “I saw your show about following your fear and it inspired me to wear shorts to work”.And it’s not only love that staunches our criticism of Oprah. We also fear her. It has been the case for years now that the quickest and most effective way for a screen personality to curb press criticism is to launch a book group, guaranteeing that every hack touting a book – which is every hack in existence – nurtures a tiny flame of hope they will be chosen and whisked away from all this. Who among us has a bad word to say about Sarah Jessica Parker (hello!), or Reese Witherspoon (hi!), or the apex predator of celebrity book groups, the original and best, Oprah.2:21Celebrities and protesters converge on Venice for Bezos and Sánchez wedding – videoLikewise: who can forget the cautionary tale of what happened to Jonathan Franzen in 2001 when he expressed doubt that being selected for Oprah’s Book Club was the best thing ever to have happened to him? Granted, Franzen’s criticism was graceless. (He suggested Oprah’s picks were a bit low-brow.) But his broader point about TV consuming literary culture was given no credence whatsoever. This was a few years before James Frey’s makey-uppy memoir was exposed,and Oprah’s book club brand briefly damaged. Instead, Franzen was burned alive for his remarks, not least by Joyce Carol Oates, whose novel, We Were the Mulvaneys, was chosen by Oprah that season and who told me at the time: “Jonathan Franzen perceives the Oprah book readers as mainly women, and he would prefer a male readership.” Brutal.Anyway, back to Rosie O’Donnell, an icon in her own right who is now living in Ireland after making good on her threat to leave the US if Trump was elected. “Is Oprah friends with Jeff Bezos,” she asked rhetoricallyon Instagramin the wake of the wedding. “Really? How is that possible? He treats his employees with disdain. By any metric he is not a nice man.”That was it. Doesn’t look like much, but it was seismic given the general timorousness around Oprah. And this despite years of evidence that a woman who was once a trailblazer for good has drifted into murkier waters, from her promotion ofshonky showbiz medic, Dr Oz, to her enabling of crankslikeJenny McCarthy, and the power of positive thinkingpseudoscience ofRhonda Byrne, to showing up at the wedding of one of the world’s richest men, who begrudges his minimum wage workers their pee breaks.Congrats to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez on the wedding – and to Venice for running them out of town | Emma BrockesRead moreGoing back further, you can even take issue with the aspirational tone of Oprah’s original brand, the only sustained critique of which I’ve read is by Janice Peck, an academic at the University of Colorado, who wrote a book called The Age of Oprah in which she questioned whether the media titan’s dare-to-dream ethos was so apolitical as to skew heavily rightwing. Per Oprah’s narrative, said Peck, “she was poor and living in sackcloth someplace and then becameOprah Winfreyand everything in between and the whole historical context, all the conditions that made it possible for her to succeed, disappear. The American dream is based on that notion of: if you just put your mind to it.”I understand this point, although I also think there’s room for dare-to-dream cheerleading alongside rigorous, data-supported policy platforms. But whichever way you see these things, the bottom line is we should be able to criticise Oprah, right? This should not be hard. And yet as I type this, now, I have a small knot of dread in my stomach. Oh, god. I’ve done the wrong thing, haven’t I. Oprah! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it! I still love you!

But unless Starmer can articulate an idea of the Britain he wants, the public – and his party – may desert himThu 3 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 05.33 EDTShareThere will be no birthday candles in Downing Street this week. Nor should there be. Twelve months after Labour’s landslide election win on 4 July 2024, Keir Starmer’s government has capped a year in office with a week of political dishevelment and ineptitude. The welfare reform bill itself isnow a meaningless shell. The Labour party is united only in its frustrations.The welfare rebellion was not a bolt from the blue. Instead, it provides the keystone to an arc of earlier blunders. It poses urgent issues about professional incompetence in Labour’s Westminster machine. It embodies what is not working in the way Starmer’s top-down party does politics more generally. This will not be the end of it, as the furore over Rachel Reeves’s tears at a raucous prime minister’s questions seems to confirm. Things can’t go on like this.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer’s past 12 months have been riddled with avoidable errors.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAMore specifically, the welfare bill poses the question of how the Labour party now negotiates its commitment to the truly poor with the concerns of the much larger number of voters who are not poor. Tuesday’s divisions showed that pitting one against the other is merely destructive. Yet Labour has not developed a plan to reconcile the two more sensibly. It will need to learn fast from this shock. The fact remains that Labour can only ever win and retain power if it is more than just the party of the poor.The MPs’ revolt turbocharges other questions that were already dominating politics, long before this week, but which the welfare row embodied. First, how on earth did Starmer’s Labour manage to squander so much support so fast and decisively after winning its 174-seat Commons majority in 2024? And, second, what can Labour do about it in the time that remains?The two are umbilically connected. But the second question is the one that matters more. Retrieving a dire situation means focusing on the future, not apologising for the past. Labour has to reverse its losses to have any hope of winning the second election victory on which Starmer once banked, but which now seems an unrealisably distant dream.To do this nevertheless requires understanding of what has gone so badly. The past 12 months have been riddled with avoidable errors, tin-eared moments and, above all, have been painfully marked by an absence of vision and even competence. Anthony Seldon, doyen of historians of Downing Street, saysno prime minister since 1945has begun as badly as Starmer. The polling figures bear this out.This is a crisis. Don’t bullshit about it. Don’t take refuge in blaming the media. It won’t do, either, to harp on about the unfairness of partisan attacks from Labour’s rivals. Nor is there much value in stressing the immense difficulties that have undoubtedly faced Starmer: attempting to govern amid war in Europe, the Trump counter-revolution, global migration pressures and a seemingly embedded economic stagnation. These are truths. They define the real context of the government’s task. But they cannot be excuses.It should have been obvious on day one, even with a vast majority and the Tory party on its knees, that Labour’s 2024 performance wasn’t the triumph it sometimes felt like.Only 34% of the votescast last year were for Labour. But only 60% of Britons voted at all. So Starmer’s parliamentary supremacy was conferred by a mere 20% of the country, and by fewer than 10 million voters. Right from the start he needed to broaden his coalition, to pay far more attention to building trust across the nation.This required more than triangulating Nigel Farage or the striking of attitudes. The underlying truth about Labour’s relationship with the nation is that four out of five Britons were unconvinced by the party, even after the shambles of the Johnson-Truss-Sunak years. Today, that doubting majority is even larger. In anaverage of polls, Labour now stands on 23%. One in three of its already low total of 2024 voters have gone elsewhere. It was always a loveless landslide. It is now in grave danger of being an unwanted one.It is true that other prime ministers have got themselves into difficulties, lost byelections, faced parliamentary revolts and had bad press in their first year. Within months of winning power in 1979, Margaret Thatcher came under open attack from members of her own cabinet over economic policy, something that has not yet happened to Starmer. Tony Blair faced a 47-MP revolt on lone parent benefit in his year one in 1997, almost identical to Starmer’s 49-MP rebellion on Tuesday. Both recovered to win landslides at the next general elections.Why should Starmer not do the same? One reason is because trust in government and politics is now far lower than in the past. Starmer is an analogue prime minister in a digital age. Another is that it was always extremely clear what both Thatcher and Blair were aiming to achieve in government. Each had a project – Thatcher to roll back the state and the trade unions, Blair to modernise Britain’s economy and place in the world. Voters knew what they were getting. What, though, is Starmer’s project? What is the destination he aims to reach?Answering this question is the most important task facing Starmer today. In the most famous sentence Charles de Gaulle ever penned, at the start of the war memoirs he wrote in the 1950s, he said: “All my life, I have had a certain idea of France.” As his biographer Julian Jackson makes clear, De Gaulle’s “certain idea” was not always consistent, and was never a fully articulated programme – more a stance than a doctrine. But De Gaulle’s idea had very clear features, which millions of French voters understood and often approved of. He stood for a distinct French historical identity, for France’s political independence, for its grandeur and for its social cohesion.Whether Starmer has a certain idea of Britain, let alone has held that idea all his life, is hard to know.His recent interviewwith his biographer Tom Baldwin suggests not. The interview is oddly naive. It is full of regrets and admissions of bad judgment but has little sense of history or people. Yet the need for Starmer to tell an uplifting story to Britons about Britain is at least as important as his need to solve some of his more specific policy problems.Starmer is a bit like a ship’s captain who, faced with rough weather and heavy seas, ploughs on without telling the passengers and crew why. He may in fact be doing the right thing for the ship of state. Calmer seas may perhaps await. The voyage may eventually prove prosperous. But whether the problem is his failure to explain, a lack of basic seagoing skills, or just a stubborn overconfidence, the result right now is very different – an unhappy Labour ship, and even a mutinous one.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourGeneral election 2024commentShareReuse this content"

International aeroplane travel messes with your head at the best of times, warping the clock and largely cocooning you from earthly happenings. But taking off into that communications black hole with my family in other parts of the air amid atmospherics that seemed decidedly pre-possible global conflagration was especially discombobulating.Thewhat ifs were endless and imponderable. It’s time for us all to be home with the dogs at our feet and the kettle on, I kept telling myself. Just get us all home where it’s safe.Looking out of the aircraft window I’d never been so pleased to see the blue-green Australian continental edge and to then pass 10,000 metres over its hazy ochre interior snaked through with waterways and dotted with dry lake beds.These last few years especially, despite the vacuity and cheap partisanship of so much that passes for local civic discourse and debate, Australia’s geographic fortune – and the blind luck of being born here – has never seemed more pronounced. So much so that it can be tempting to breathe a sigh of relief on reaching the shores of home and then to keep looking away from the world’s pain and peril.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThere is an entrenched Australian historical denial that has harboured a national penchanttolook awayfrom our nation’sgenocidal crimesagainst the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.

To Ukraine’s siege by a despotic Russia. To the missiles and drones exploding across the Middle East. To the galloping transformation of America into autocracy and the erosion of freedoms at its foundational heart. The temptation back here can be to turn away.

But accompanying the guilt is a sense of helplessness – a powerlessness to change the world so that the men (it’s mostly men) responsible for the inhumanity and pain might be reined in or ousted from positions of power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But after 1992, with the release of Quentin Tarantino’s sensationally tense and violent crime movie Reservoir Dogs, the feelgood mood around that song forever darkened. That was down to an unforgettably scary performance by Michael Madsen,who has diedat the age of 67.Stuck in the Middle, with its lyrics about being “so scared in case I fall off my chair”, was to be always associated with the image of Madsen, whom Tarantino made an icon of indie American movies, with his boxy black suit, sinister, ruined handsomeness and powerful physique running to fat, playing tough guy Vic Vega, AKA Mr Blonde. He grooved back and forth across the room, in front of a terrified undercover cop tied to a chair, dancing to that Stealers Wheel number, holding his straight razor, which he had removed from his boot – smirkingly preparing to torture the cop (that is, torture him further) by cutting off his ear.Michael Madsen, star of Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Donnie Brasco, dies aged 67Read moreHis Mr Blonde is a nasty piece of work, really without the ironising or humanising touches that Tarantino and co-writer Roger Avary speckle over the rest of the crew; Madsen brought beef and heft to the role and added ballast to the picture, making sure we realise that this was not a collection of snarky suit-wearing hipsters and standup comedians, but serious criminals.View image in fullscreenMadsen in The Hateful Eight.Photograph: Allstar/Weinstein CompanyMichael Madsen – a life in picturesRead moreMadsen was to become a repertory player for Tarantino, though turning down the Vincent Vega role in Pulp Fiction (supposedly the brother of his Dogs character; Tarantino once considered bringing them together for a prequel called Double V Vega). Famously, the part went to John Travolta, Madsen having committed himself to Lawrence Kasdan’s Wyatt Earp, playing Wyatt’s brother Virgil. Perhaps this was serendipitous for Tarantino, because Madsen was a born supporting player. In Kill Bill: Vols 1 and 2, he played the oafish trailer-trash Budd, brother of David Carradine’s intimidating Bill, a one-time member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who has neglected his warrior vocation and run to seed, having to Bill’s horror even pawned his priceless samurai sword. In Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, he was the creepy and taciturn loner Joe, slouching in the corner of the roadhouse where most of the action is set.Aside from the Tarantino appearances, Madsen played formidable wiseguy Sonny Black in Mike Newell’s Donnie Brasco, deeply suspicious (as in Dogs) of a suspected cop, the pretty-boy newcomer Johnny Depp, sensing that something about him is off – and he himself played a cop (though a ruthless one) in Lee Tamahori’s Mulholland Falls.View image in fullscreenMadsen in Donnie Brasco.Photograph: Tristar/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn fact, Madsen was to make a living out of playing tough guys in a whole raft of forgettable pictures, sometimes with hardly more than a cameo. Perhaps Madsen could have had a different career – he did after all effectively apprentice as an actor with John Malkovich at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre Company; his wryly self-aware and self-satirising movie BeingMichael Madsenis a nod to Being John Malkovich. Madsen’s mother, Elaine Madsen, was an award-winning documentary film-maker and sister Virginia Madsen is Oscar-nominated for her performance in Alexander Payne’s Sideways. But Michael Madsen found himself typecast in violent roles, despite having played a heartfelt, gentler role in Free Willy, and the broodingly intense poet Tom Baker, Jim Morrison’s friend, in Oliver Stone’s The Doors and he showed tender gallantry as Susan Sarandon’s boyfriend in Ridley Scott’s Thelma & Louise.Tarantino unlocked one very powerful side to Madsen – but he had more, and it was sad that somehow he couldn’t show them as much as he wanted. But what natural charisma and presence.Explore more on these topicsMichael MadsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I binged Zombie Flesh Eaters and Slaughtered Vomit Dolls to find outThe ‘obscene’ movies once banned in the UK are now mostly freely available. Are these tales of cannibals and the undead antiquated schlock or genuinely repellent?Stuart HeritageThu 3 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 12.32 EDTShareLater this month, the cult film service Arrow will do something that would once have plunged the UK into screaming fits of utter chaos. That’s right, it’s going to stream Zombie Flesh Eaters.The film comes with a tremendously confusing backstory. In Italy, George A Romero’s Dawn of the Dead was recut by Dario Argento and retitled Zombi. Zombi, no relation to Bambi, was such a success that a sequel was commissioned, using the script of an unmade movie entitled Nightmare Island. This film became Zombi 2. In the UK, Zombi 2 was renamed Zombie Flesh Eaters. And then it was banned.Look at the head on that! Bottoms up to a pint of 28 Years Later beerRead moreThis was largely down to the campaign waged against so-called “video nasties” in the early 1980s. Driven by newspaper front pages screaming things like “BAN VIDEO SADISM NOW”, police officers began conducting raids on video shops, confiscating anything they saw as breaching the Obscene Publications Act.The confiscations felt arbitrary (in Slough, officers seized Dolly Parton’s The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, under the impression it was pornography), but eventually 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the act. Zombie Flesh Eaters was one of them. And now its unimaginable horrors are available to stream, uncut and in pin-sharp 4K.In truth, it’s been around for a while. Around the turn of the century, the BBFC loosened its regulations, and the banned films began to trickle out. Not all of them – 1969’s Nazi sex film Love Camp 7 is still routinely refused a certificate, as is the thematically similar Gestapo’s Last Orgy – but Zombie Flesh Eaters has been available to legally watch uncut for two decades now.View image in fullscreenMore fleshed out … Cannibal Holocaust.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveWhich means that I probably should have watched it by now. After all, if you grew up in the 80s and 90s like I did, nothing gave a movie more cachet than being banned. All these films had a too-hot-for-TV thrill to them; if you weren’t allowed to watch them, they had to be good. And yet I never got around to watching Zombie Flesh Eaters.Turns out I didn’t need to bother. Not because the Thatcher government was right and the film has turned me into a depraved subversive, but because it lumbers on for ever, grinding through endless overlong, overacted dialogue scenes that go nowhere and do nothing. Admittedly there are hints of gleeful gore here and there. In one scene a woman’s eyeball is impaled, and there’s a tremendous underwater sequence with a zombie, a topless woman and what appears to be an actual live shark. Maybe there was some religious outrage that has lost its impact over the years (OK, a zombie does get its head caved in with a crucifix), but otherwise it contains nothing that wouldn’t be found in a workaday Game of Thrones episode.Would it get banned today? Unlikely. In an age where Damien Leone can release threeTerrifiermovies (where, variously, a man is chainsawed to death through his scrotum and a woman has a rat-filled pipe hammered down her throat), it’s practically daytime television. I grew up scared and fascinated by the prospect of Zombie Flesh Eaters corrupting my mind. Now that I have actually seen it, I’m afraid to report that Zombie Flesh Eaters is no Zombie Flesh Eaters.Were all the banned films like that? Has society moved on so much that everything we once feared would undo society has become unimaginably hokey? I decided to watch some of the other 39 films to find out. I started with the most notorious, John Alan Schwartz’s Faces of Death.View image in fullscreenHarrowing … Faces of Death.Photograph: Courtesy: John FeliceNo film was arguably bolstered more by a banning than Faces of Death. A mockumentary that combines unaired news footage with material shot for the film, Faces of Death presented itself as a compilation of every kind of death: accidents, executions, suicide, cannibalism. Back when nobody could see it, it sounded like a kind of aggressively violent precursor to You’ve Been Framed. But that isn’t what it is at all. It is, in fact, a harrowing look at human suffering. There’s Holocaust footage. There are starving children. There’s violence against animals (staged) and footage of body parts scattered across the ground following a plane crash (real). It is, to put it lightly, an incredible bummer to watch.Despite its reputation, Ruggero Deodato’s Cannibal Holocaust was slightly easier to watch. You can understand the nerves around releasing it – it features graphic sexual violence, and more than one scene of animals being killed – but at least it had the benefit of having an identifiable point of view. The film is a satire about cultural appropriation and media sensationalism, in which an American documentary crew travel to the Amazon rainforest and get in over their heads. Which in terms of intent puts it above a lot of the other banned films, but the execution muddles the message. After all, if you have to kill an animal to make a point about media sensationalism, you’ve already lost the argument.And then there’s Meir Zarchi’s I Spit on Your Grave, a film that lacks either the intellectual rigour of Cannibal Holocaust or the fun of Zombie Flesh Eaters. It is one of the least enjoyable films I have ever watched.I Spit on Your Grave is a film in which a woman exacts revenge against a group of men who gang rape her. It was banned in the UK, as well as in Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and West Germany. This is likely due to the point of the film being the rape itself. So much time is dedicated to the rape sequence that the revenge part feels tacked on, as if it wants to trick you into thinking that it’s a feminist film. It’s worth pointing out that I Spit on Your Grave still hasn’t been released here uncut – some heavily eroticised rape scenes still contravene BBFC guidance – but the edited version available on Amazon Prime was still so unpleasant that it represents the only time I have ever welcomed the intrusion of interstitial ads.View image in fullscreenSickening … Slaughtered Vomit Dolls.Photograph: MUBIAnd yet by modern standards, even these video nasties pale next to what is now circulating online. For the purposes of this feature, my editor ushered me towards a 2006 film called Slaughtered Vomit Dolls, part of Lucifer Valentine’s Vomit Gore trilogy, along with ReGOREgitated Sacrifice and Slow Torture Puke Chamber. A surreal satanist film about a woman with an eating disorder, Slaughtered Vomit Dolls contains scenes of torture and several scenes in which people vomit various fluids, some of which are gobbled straight back up. It was awful. If this was 1983, it would have been banned in a heartbeat.Because time has rendered Zombie Flesh Eaters so quaint, my assumption was that all the other banned films would be equally silly and kitschy. After all, we’re talking about a government so jumpy that it also banned the third word in the title of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But that isn’t the case, since a lot of these films are still genuinely repellent. What has changed, though, is our attitude to them. Clearly, banning them only served to boost their reputation, whereas if they had been allowed to remain in public, I’m convinced that they would have all died in obscurity decades ago. In other words, less “BAN VIDEO SADISM NOW” and more “LET’S WATCH SOMETHING THAT’S ACTUALLY GOOD”.Zombie Flesh Eaters is available to stream onArrowand on Limited Edition 4K UHD from 28 JulyInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

As Lorraine Baines inBack to the Future, she falls in lust with her own son, Marty McFly, a teenage time traveller from 1985 who plunges into 1955 at the wheel of a DeLorean car.Back to the Future, released 40 years ago on Thursday, is both entirely of its time and entirely timeless. It was a box office summer smash, set a benchmark for time travel movies and was quoted by everyone fromPresident Ronald ReagantoAvengers: Endgame. It is arguably a perfect film, without a duff note or a scene out of place, a fantastic parable as endlessly watchable as It’s a Wonderful Life or Groundhog Day.It also, inevitably, reflects the preoccupations of its day. An early sequence features Libyan terrorists from the era of Muammar Gaddafi, a caricature wisely dropped froma stage musical adaptation. In one scene the young George McFly turns peeping tom as he spies on Lorraine getting undressed. To some, the film’s ending equates personal fulfilment with Reagan-fuelled materialism. It caught lightning in a bottle in a way that is unrepeatable.“If you made Back to the Future in 2025 and they went back 30 years, it would be 1995 and nothing would look that different,” Thompson, 64, says by phone from a shoot in Vancouver, Canada. “The phones would be different but it wouldn’t be like the strange difference between the 80s and the 50s and how different the world was.”Bob Gale, co-writer of the screenplay, agrees everything fell into the right place at the right time, including the central partnership between young Marty (Michael J Fox) and white-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The 74-year-old says from Los Angeles: “Oh man, the film wouldn’t even be made today. We’d go into the studio and they’d say, what’s the deal with this relationship between Marty and Doc? They’d start interpreting paedophilia or something. There would be a lot of things they have problems with.”Gale had met the film’s director,Robert Zemeckis, at the USC School of Cinema in 1972 and together they sold several TV scripts to Universal Studios, caught the eye of Steven Spielberg and John Milius and collaborated on three films. The pair had always wanted to make a time travel movie but couldn’t find the right hook. Then Gale had an epiphany.“We put a time travel story on the back burner until I found my dad’s high school yearbook and boom, that was when the lightning bolt hit me and I said, ha, this would be cool: kid goes back in time and ends up in high school with his dad!”Gale and Zemeckis pitched the script more than 40 times over four years but studios found it too risky or risque. But Spielberg saw its potential and came in as executive producer. After Zemeckis scored a hit withRomancing the Stone in 1984, Universal gave the green light.The character of Doc Brown was inspired by Gale’s childhood neighbour, a photographer who showed him the “magic” of developing pictures in a darkroom, and the educational TV show Mr Wizard which demonstrated scientific principles. Then Lloyd came in and added an interpretation based on part Albert Einstein, partLeopold Stokowski.Thompson was cast as Lorraine after a successful audition. She felt that her background as a ballet and modern dancer gave her a strong awareness of the movement and physicality required to play both versions of Lorraine: one young and airy, the other middle-aged and beaten down by life.“I was perfectly poised for that character,” she says. “I understood both the dark and the light of Lorraine McFly and understood the hilarity of being super sexually attracted to your son. I thought that was frickin’ hilarious. I understood the subversive comedy of it.”Thompson has previously worked with Eric Stoltz, who was cast in the lead role of Marty at the behest of Sidney Sheinberg, a Universal executive who had nurtured Spielberg and putJawsinto production. But over weeks of filming, starting in November 1984, it became apparent that Stoltz’s serious tone was not working.Gale recalls: “He wasn’t giving us the kind of humour that we thought the character should have. He actually thought the movie turned out to be a tragedy because he ends up in a 1985 where a lot of his life is different. People can argue about that: did the memories of his new past ripple into his brain, did he remember both his lives? That’s an interesting conversation to have and it gets more interesting the more beer you drink.”A quarter of a century for Back to the FutureRead moreEventually it fell to Zemeckis to inform Stoltz thathis services were no longer required. Gale continues:“He said he thought that possibly Eric was relieved: it was not like a devastating blow to him. This is just hindsight and speculation but maybe Eric’s agents thought that it would be a good career move for him to do a movie like this that had Spielberg involved. Who knows?”Stoltz’s abrupt departure came as a shock to the rest of the cast. Thompson says: “It was horrible. He was my friend and obviously a wonderful actor. Everybody wants to think that making a movie is fun and that we’re laughing for the 14 hours we’re standing in the middle of a street somewhere.“But it’s also scary because you need to feel like you’ve made a little family for that brief amount of time. So the minute someone gets fired, you’re like, oh wait, this is a big business, this is serious, this is millions of dollars being spent.”View image in fullscreenLea Thompson and Michael J Fox in Back to the Future.Photograph: Universal/AllstarStoltz was replaced by the young Canadian actorMichael J Fox, whom Zemeckis and Gale had wanted in the first place, and several scenes had to be reshot. Fox was simultaneously working on the sitcom Family Ties so was often sleep-deprived. But his boundless charm, frazzled energy and comic timing – including ad libs – were the missing piece of the jigsaw.Thompson comments: “He is gifted but he also worked extremely hard at his shtick like the great comedians of the 20s, 30s and 40s: the falling over, the double take, the spit take, the physical comedy, the working on a bit for hours and hours like the greats, likeLaurel and Hardyand Charlie Chaplin. Michael understood that.“Being a dancer, I was fascinated and kind of weirdly repelled because it didn’t seem like the acting that we were all trying to emulate: the De Niro kind of super reality-based acting that we were in awe of in the 80s, coming out of the great films of the 70s. I feel like Eric Stoltz, who is a brilliant actor, was trying to do more of that. Michael was the face of this new acting, especially comedy acting, which was in a way a throwback and a different energy.”It was this lightness of touch that enabled Fox and Thompson to carry off moments that might otherwise have seemed weird, disturbing and oedipal. When 1950s Lorraine – who has no idea that Marty is her future son – eventually kisses him inside a car, she reports that it is like “kissing my brother” and the romantic tension dissolves, much to the audience’s relief.‘What century are we in?’: Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson talk Back to the Future at 30Read moreThompson says: “It was a difficult part and it was a very dangerous thread to put through a needle.I have to fall out of love with him just by kissing him and I remember Bob Zemeckis obsessing about that moment. It was also a hard shot to get because it was a vintage car and they couldn’t take it apart. Bob was also worried about the moment when I had to fall back in love with George [Marty’s father] after he punches Biff.“For those moments to be so important is part of the beauty of the movie. These are ‘small’ people; these are not ‘great’ people; they’re not doing ‘great’ things. These are people who live in a little tiny house in Hill Valley and to make the moments of falling out of love and falling in love so beautiful with that incredible score is fascinating.”Back to the Future was the biggest hit of the year, grossing more than $200m in the US and entering the cultural mainstream. When Doc asks Marty who is president in 1985, Marty replies Ronald Reagan and Brown says in disbelief: “Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who’s vice-president? Jerry Lewis?” Reagan,a voracious film viewer, was so amused by the joke that he made the projectionist stop and rewind it. He went on to namecheck the film and quote its line, “Where we’re going, we don’t need roads,” in his 1986State of the Union address.Thompson, whose daughters are the actorsMadelyn DeutchandZoey Deutch, was amazed by Back to the Future’s success. “But when I look at the movie, I do understand the happy accident of why it’s become the movie it’s become to generation after generation. The themes are powerful. The execution was amazing. The casting was great. The idea was brilliant. It was a perfect script. Those things don’t come together usually.”And if she had her own time machine, where would she go? “If I could be a man, I might go back to Shakespeare but as a woman you don’t want to go anywhere in time. Time has been hard on women. So for me, whenever I’m asked this question, it’s not a lighthearted answer. I can only give you a political answer.”The film ends with Doc whisking Marty and girlfriend Jennifer into the DeLorean and taking off into the sky. But Gale points out that the message “to be continued” was added only for the home video release, as a way to announce a sequel, rather than being in the original theatrical run.Back to the Future Part II, part of which takes place in 2015, brought back most of the main characters including the villain Biff Tannen, who becomes a successful businessman who opens a 27-storey casino and uses his money to gain political influence. Many viewers have drawna comparison with Donald Trump.View image in fullscreenRobert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J Fox, Neil Canton and Steven Spielberg on the set of Back to the Future.Photograph: Amblin Entertainment/Universal Pictures/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockGale explains: “Biff in the first movie is not based on Donald Trump; Biff is just an archetype bully. When Biff owns a casino, there was a Trump influence in that, absolutely. Trump had to put his name on all of his hotels and his casinos and that’s what Biff does too.“But when people say, oh, Biff was based on Donald Trump, well, no, that wasn’t the inspiration for the character. Everybody has a bully in their life and that’s who Biff was. There’s nothing that resembles Donald Trump in Biff in Part I.”Back to the Future Part III, in which Marty and Doc and thrown back to the old west, was released in 1990. A year later Fox was diagnosed withParkinson’s diseaseat the age of 29. He went public with his diagnosis in 1998 and became a prominent advocate for research and awareness. He also continued acting, with roles in shows such as The Good Wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm, and in October will publish a Back to the Future memoir entitledFuture Boy.Thompson, whose brothers both have Parkinson’s, sees Fox twice a year.“He’s endlessly inspiring. He’s very smart and he’s done the spiritual work, the psychological work on himself to not be bitter about something awful happening to him but also be honest: this sucks.”‘I hate it. It sucks. But it didn’t defeat me’: Michael J Fox on pity, Parkinson’s – and a potential cureRead moreTime’s arrow moves in one direction but Back to the Future found a way to stage a comeback. One night after seeing the Mel Brooks musical The Producers in New York, Zemeckis’s wife Leslie suggested that Back to the Future would make a good musical. Gale duly wrote the book and was a producer of the show, whichpremiered in Manchester in 2020and has since played in London, New York and around the world.Gale says: “It was total euphoria. The first time I saw the dress rehearsal with the DeLorean, before we had an audience, I went out of my mind how great it was, and then to see the audience going completely out of their minds with everything was just such a joyous validation.“I’m so blessed to have a job where I get to make people happy. That’s a great thing to be able to do and get paid for that. I don’t ever take any of this for granted. I’m having a great time and the idea that Back to the Future is still with us after all these years, as popular as it ever was, is a blessing. I think about it all the time that if we had not put Michael J Fox in the movie, you and I probably wouldn’t even be having this conversation right now.”Why, indeed, are westill talking about Back to the Futurefour decades later? “Every person in the world wonders, how did I get here, how did my parents meet? The idea that your parents were once children is staggering when you realise it when you’re about seven or eight years old.“Your parents are these godlike creatures, and they’re always saying, well, when I was your age, and you’re going, what are they talking about, how could they have ever been my age? Then at some point it all comes together. If you have a younger sibling and you’re watching them grow up, you realise, oh, my God, my parents were once screw-ups like me!”And if Gale had a time machine, where would he go?“I don’t think I would go to the future because I’d be too scared,” he says. “We all see what happens when you know too much about the future. My mom, before she was married, was a professional musician, a violinist, and she had a nightclub act in St Louis called Maxine and Her Men. I’d like to travel back in time to 1947 and see my mother performing in a nightclub. That’s what I would do.”Explore more on these topicsBack To The FutureScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedy filmsComedyRobert ZemeckisMichael J FoxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Independent/AlamyAs his debut album Brown Sugar turns 30 this week, we look back on the relatively slim but astoundingly rich catalogue of the architect of neosoulByAlexis PetridisThu 3 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 09.17 EDTShare20. I Found My Smile Again (1996)For an artist no one could describe as prolific, D’Angelo has contributed a surprising number of exclusive songs to films. Good songs too, as evidenced by this, from the Space Jam soundtrack: a fine, funky, faintly Stevie Wonder-ish, mid-tempo example of his initial retro-yet-somehow-modern approach to soul.19. Another Life (2014)Questlovecompared D’Angelo’s third album Black Messiah to the Beach Boys’ Smile. More people heard Sly and the Family Stone’s There’s a Riot Goin’ On in its murky, moody sound, but Another Life was a relatively bright closer, a lovely hybrid of vintage Chicago and Philadelphia soul, decorated with sitar.18. Heaven Must Be Like This (1998)D’Angelo is better known as a songwriter than an interpreter of others’ material, but – quite aside from demonstrating his exquisite taste in vintage soul – his version of the Ohio Players’ 1974 slow jam is magnificent: live-sounding, respectful, but not too cowed by the original to prevent the singer injecting his own identity.View image in fullscreenD’Angelo (front row, centre), with musicians including Pino Palladino (back row, left) and Questlove (back row, centre) in 2000.Photograph: Lionel Flusin/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images17. Alright (1995)D’Angelo’s debut was the album for which the term neosoul was literally invented (as a marketing tool), but it offered more than merely harking back to a golden era. Alright is resolutely a product of the mid-90s – the harmonies are lush, but they’re set against a crackly sampled rhythm and subjected to dub-like echo.16. The Charade (2014)D’Angelo made his love for Prince explicit early on – covering She’s Always in My Hair – and his spirit hangs over The Charade, both melodically and in its hybrid rock-influenced style. But the sound is too smeared, distorted and strange to count as homage; its lyrics about the “systematic maze” of racism are glowering and powerful.15. The Line (2000)D’Angelo’s second album Voodoo took four years to make. Collaborator Questlove described the sessions as a “left of centre Black music renaissance”, but there’s a potent note-to-self quality about The Line’s lyrics, as if D’Angelo is urging himself to get the album done: “I’m gonna stick to my guns, I’m gonna put my finger on the trigger, I’m gonna pull it”.14. Unshaken (2018)The most recent D’Angelo track – released seven years ago! – was brooding, atmospheric and produced by U2 collaborator Daniel Lanois. It’s understated but fabulous, carrying a hint of swampy New Orleans soul in its rhythm. If he can come up with something this good for a video game soundtrack, what might a fourth album sound like?13. Africa (2000)Inspired by the birth of D’Angelo’s son – and co-written with his then-partner, the lateAngie Stone– Africa meditates on fatherhood and Black consciousness. It’s resolute lyrically but low-key, introspective and somehow fragile musically, its electric piano sounding fractured over the rumbling funk of Questlove’s drums. The overall effect is really moving.12. Till It’s Done (Tutu) (2014)The perfect example of what one critic called the “controlled chaos” of Black Messiah with funk so slippery the constituent elements feel as if they’re on the verge of sliding out of sync entirely. D’Angelo laments the state of the world in falsetto: “Tragedy flows unbound and there’s no place to run.”View image in fullscreenUnruffled falsetto … D’Angelo performing in 1996.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images11. One Mo’Gin (2000)The loverman side of Voodoo later gave D’Angelo pause – he was deeply uncomfortable with his sex-symbol status – but it’s pretty irresistible on this cliche-free slow jam. The vocals are reverb-free and mixed forward, as if he’s singingveryclose to you, the music moves drowsily along, the whole thing sounds like it’s dripping with sweat.10. Smooth (1995)From the opening torrent of dextrous jazz guitar to the bumping hip-hop beat (from Chubb Rock’s 1992 track The Big Man) via the meandering keyboard lines that suggest a band jamming live and the fine, but unshowy vocal, Smooth defines the new route for R&B laid out on D’Angelo’s debut. It’s also just agreatsong.9. Sugah Daddy (2014)If Black Messiah is the 21st-century There’s a Riot Goin’ On, maybe Sugah Daddy is its goofy Spaced Cowboy moment, its Princely lubriciousness undercut by its quirky tap-dancing rhythm, sudden key changes and warped swing-era evoking horns and backing vocals. The main piano and bass groove, meanwhile, is utterly, joyfully contagious.8. Devil’s Pie (1998)A collaboration with producer DJ Premier (who originally intended its beat to go to fleetingly famous rapper Canibus), Devil’s Pie is also liberally sprinkled with magic by an uncredited J Dilla. Its attack on hip-hop materialism is stripped-back, bass-heavy and strafed with vintage electronics (sampled from Pierre Henry). Idiosyncratic and marvellous.7. Cruisin’ (1995)Thegreat D’Angelo cover. Smokey Robinson’s original 1979 quiet-storm-classic is an incredible track but this version might be even better: a touch faster, a little more raw, the lush orchestration set over echoey funk. And D’Angelo’s unruffled falsetto may be the best vocal he’s ever recorded.6. Send It On (2000)Around Voodoo’s release, D’Angelo described modern R&B as “a joke”. The ensuing album was his alternative, “the natural progression of soul”, a description that fits Send It On perfectly: over the sample loops and elastic bass, the lovely song at its centre could easily have been sung by Otis Redding or Sam Cooke.5. Lady (1995)When it comes to D’Angelo’s biggest hit, take your pick from the original – a slow jam with a killer bassline courtesy of Raphael Saadiq – or the DJ Premier mix which is more hip-hop facing, with a guest verse from Nas-affiliated rapper AZ. Both are superb, carrying a faint undercurrent of darkness alongside declarations of love.4. Spanish Joint (2000)At the heart of Voodoo’s sound is incredible, virtuosic live-in-the-studio playing by D’Angelo and his fellow Soulquarians. It never sounds more incredible than the intricate, writhing groove of Spanish Joint: constantly shifting, always funky, the perfect backdrop for D’Angelo’s vocals (and the Afrobeat-influenced horns) to glide around.View image in fullscreen‘A faint undercurrent of darkness alongside declarations of love.’Photograph: Gregory Harris3. Really Love (2014)A slow-burning dream of a song, its gorgeous, cyclical melody stunningly orchestrated and decorated with flamenco guitar: an arrangement so imaginative it makes you realise how unimaginative most pop arrangements are. The mush-mouthed vocal adds an odd sense of intimacy, as if you’re hearing D’Angelo singing to himself.2. Untitled (How Does It Feel?) (2000)Untitled’s video was simple – a naked D’Angelo singing direct to camera – and perhaps too effective. Subsequent attention from female fans disconcerted the singer into derailing his own career. But the song itself is amazing, a rule-breaking Prince-inspired bedroom ballad that slowly builds to an astonishing psychedelic climax.1. Brown Sugar (1995)D’Angelo’s catalogue might be slender, but it’s rich, so much so that it feels almost unfair to pick his debut single as his best song. Doing so doesn’t imply that it was all downhill from there – all of his albums are equally good – but there’s no getting around the fact that Brown Sugar is a spectacularly great track. An ode to marijuana disguised as a love song, you could work out the real meaning just from its heady sound – like mid-70s Roy Ayers in a fog of smoke, plus snapping beats, ultra-cool organ, disorientating murmuring voices and a vocal with the rhythm of a rapper’s flow.Explore more on these topicsRankedD'AngeloSoulR&BPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the years that followed, Hollywood’s sweetheart would sound different in cinemas around the world but to native audiences she would sound the same.The voice actors would gain some notoriety in their home countries, but today, their jobs are being threatened by artificial intelligence. The use of AI was a major point of dispute during the Hollywood actors’ strike in 2023, when both writers and actors expressed concern that it could undermine their roles, and fought for federal legislation to protect their work. Not long after, more than 20 voice acting guilds, associations and unions formed the United Voice Artists coalition to campaign under the slogan “Don’t steal our voices”. In Germany, home to “the Oscars of dubbing”, artists warned that their jobs were at risk with the rise of films dubbed with AI trained using their voices, without their consent.“It’s war for us,” says Patrick Kuban, a voice actor and organiser with the dubbing union Voix Off, who along with the French Union of Performing Artists started the campaign #TouchePasMaVF (“don’t touch my French version”). They want to see dubbing added to France’sl’exception culturelle, a government policy that defines cultural goods as part of national identity and needing special protection from the state.Dubbing isn’t just a case of translating a film into native languages, explains Kuban, it’s adapted “to the French humour, to include references, culture and emotion”. As a result,AIcould put an estimated 12,500 jobs at risk in France: including writers, translators, sound engineers, as well as the voice actors themselves, according to a study by the Audiens Group in 2023.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t want my voice to be used to say whatever someone wants’ … a voiceover artist in a recording studio.Photograph: Edward Olive/Getty Images“Humans are able to bring to [these roles]: experience, trauma and emotion, context and background and relationships,” adds Tim Friedlander, a US-based voice actor, studio owner, musician, and president of the National Association of Voice Actors. “All of the things that we as humans connect with. You can have a voice that sounds angry, but if it doesn’t feel angry, you’re going to have a disconnect in there.”Since the introduction of sound cinema in the late 1920s and 1930s, dubbing has grown to be an industry worth more than $4.04bn (£2.96bn) globally. It was first adopted in Europe by authoritarian leaders, who wanted to remove negative references to their governments and promote their languages. Mussolini banned foreign languages in movies entirely, a policy that catalysed a preference for dubbed rather than subtitled films in the country. Today, 61% of German viewers and 54% of French ones also opt for dubbed movies, while Disney dubs their productions into more than 46 languages. But with the development of AI, who profits from dubbing could soon change.Earlier this year, the UK-based startup ElevenLabs announced plans to clone the voice of Alain Dorval – the “voix de Stallone”, who from the 1970s onwards gave voice to Sylvester Stallone in some 30 films – in a new thriller, Armor, on Amazon. At the time, contracts did not state how an actor’s voice could be re-used: including to train AI software and create synthetic voices that ultimately could replace voice actors entirely. “It’s a kind of monster,” says Kuban. “If we don’t have protection, all kinds of jobs will be lost: after the movie industry, it will be the media industry, the music industry, all the cultural industries, and a society without culture will not be very good.”When ChatGPT and ElevenLabs hit the market at the start of 2022, making AI a public-facing technology, “it was a theoretical threat, but not an immediate threat”, says Friedlander. But as the market has grown, including the release of the Israeli startup Deepdub, an AI-powered platform that offers dubbing and voiceover services for films, the problems with synthetic voice technologies have become impossible to ignore.“If you steal my voice, you are stealing my identity,” says Daniele Giuliani, who voiced Jon Snow in the Game of Thrones, and works as a dubbing director. He is the president of the Italian dubbers’ association, ANAD, which recently fought for AI clauses in national contracts to protect voice actors from the indiscriminate and unauthorised use of their voices, and to prohibit the use of those voices in machine learning and deep data mining – a proposal that’s being used as a model in Spain. “This is very serious. I don’t want my voice to be used to say whatever someone wants.”AI’s tentacles have had a global reach too. In India, where 72% of viewers prefer watching content in a different language, Sanket Mhatre, who voices Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 superhero film Green Lantern is concerned: “We’ve been signing contracts for donkey’s years now and most of these contracts have really big language about your voice being used in all perpetuity anywhere in the world,” says Mhatre. “Now with AI, signing something like this is essentially just signing away your career.”Mhatre dubs more than 70-100 Hollywood movies into Hindi each year, as well as Chinese, Spanish, French films; web series, animated shows, anime, documentaries and audiobooks. “Every single day, I retell stories from some part of the world for the people of my country in their language, in their voice. It’s special,” he says. “It’s such an inclusive exercise. In India, if you’re not somebody who speaks English, it’s very easy to be knocked down and feel inferior. But when you are able to dub this cinema into Hindi, people now understand that cinema and can discuss it.”He’s noticed a decline in the number of jobs dubbing corporate copy, training videos, and other quick turnaround information-led items, but he thinks his job is safe at the moment as it’s impossible for AI to adapt to cultural nuances or act with human emotion. “If the actor’s face is not visible on screen, or if you’re just seeing their back, in India, we might attempt to add an expression or a line to clarify the scene or provide more context.” When there are references to time travel movies in a sci-fi film, he explains, a dubber might list Bollywood titles instead.But as AI learns more from voice actors and other humans, Mhatre is aware that it is a whole lot quicker and cheaper for companies to adopt this technology rather than hire dubbing actors, translators, and sound engineers.“We need to stand against the robots,” says Kuban. “We need to use them for peaceful things, for maybe climate change or things like that, but we need to have actors on the screen.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAIFilm industryWorld cinemafeaturesShareReuse this content"

(referred to hereafter as Period) as “the first album I’ve made where I felt truly free”. It comes accompanied by a lengthy world tour, advertised by a photo in which the singer expresses her freedom – in what you have to say is a very Kesha-like manner – by riding a jetski while topless. Long-term observers of her turbulent career may note that this doesn’t seem so different from the way she framed her third album, 2017’s Rainbow, which she described at the time as “truly saving my life”, and featured her on the cover naked and was accompanied by a tour called Fuck the World.View image in fullscreenKesha: . (Period)Photograph: APBut it would be remiss to deny her the ability to make a similar point again. Rainbow was released at the height of her legal battle with her former producer “Dr” Luke Gottwald. Kesha had accused him of sexual assault and other allegations, which he denied, resulting in a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Although alternative producers were found to work on Rainbow, she was still legally obliged to release the album – and its two successors – on Gottwald’s Kemosabe label. The tworeached a settlement in 2023, her contract with Kemosabe expired shortly afterwards, and Period is now released on her own label.While Rainbow and its immediate follow-ups regularly mined the legal disputes and resulting trauma for lyrical inspiration – a dramatic shift from the screw-you hedonism that powered her big hits in the early 2010s – Period signals a fresh start by, more or less, bringing back the Kesha who boasted about brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel’s and took to the stage accompanied by dancers dressed as giant penises. Only the piano ballad closer Cathedral seems entirely rooted in recent events – “Life was so lethal … I died in the hell so I could start living again”. Elsewhere, the occasional hint of something dark in the author’s past (“I earned the right to be like this”) is drowned out by the sound of Kesha reverting to type in no uncertain terms: “take me to the sex shop”, “bartender pour me up some damn fluid”, “I like chaos, dripping head to toe”, “gimme gimme gimme all the boys”.And who can blame her? No one wants to be defined by trauma, and she’s doubtless keen to assert that the original Kesha persona was more to do with her than the svengali-like producer who discovered her.Furthermore, it’s a weirdly timely return. In 2010, Kesha’s hot mess persona made her an outlier, albeit an outlier whose debut single TiK ToK sold 14m digital copies worldwide. The critic Simon Reynolds smartly noted that if the era’s predominant female star Lady Gaga saw her work as high-concept art-pop in a lineage that included David Bowie and Roxy Music, Kesha was more like their glam-era rival Alice Cooper. Fifteen years on, we live in a pop world at least partly defined by Charli xcx’s last album. Perpetually half-cut and lusty, open about her messy failings (“I like the bizarre type, the lowlife … God, I love a hopeless bastard,” she sings of her taste in men on Red Flag), Kesha could make a fair claim to be a godmother of Brat. Certainly, you couldn’t accuse her of jumping on a latter-day trend, just as Period’s diversion into vogue-ish country-pop, Yippee-Ki-Yay, seems less craven than it might. Kesha has done past work in that area – from her 2013 Pitbull collaboration Timber to her duet with Dolly Parton on Rainbow.Yippee-Ki-Yay’s country-facing sound sits among a buffet of current pop styles: there’s synthy, 80s-leaning pop-rock you could imagine Taylor Swift singing on Delusional and Too Hard, and mid-tempo disco on Love Forever, while the spectre of hyperpop haunts the warp-speed Boy Crazy and Hudson Mohawke turns up glitchy Auto-Tune-heavy electro on Glow. It’s an album clearly intended to re-establish Kesha at the heart of pop, which means there’s no room for the appealing weirdness of her 2023 single Eat the Acid, and it’s only on the closing Cathedral that her voice really shifts into the full-throttle roar she unleashed covering T Rex’s Children of the Revolution at 2022’s Taylor Hawkins tribute concert.‘I would walk in and just cry for two hours’: Kesha on cats, court cases, and the dangers of ‘toxic positivity’Read moreThat said, the songs are all really strong, filled with smart little twists and drops, and funny, self-referential lines: “You’re on TikTok / I’m the fucking OG.” You get the sense of the massed ranks of collaborators – including everyone from regular Father John Misty foil Jonathan Wilson to Madison Love, who counts Blackpink and Addison Rae among her songwriting clients – really getting behind her to make Period a success. Kesha, meanwhile, plays the part of Kesha 1.0 to perfection: for all the lurid lyrical excesses, it never feels as if she’s trying too hard. And why would it: she’s returning to a role she originated.This week Alexis listened toLathe of Heaven – AuroraCognitive dissonance: Lathe of Heaven look weirdly like a new wave of British heavy metal band, but Aurora’s sound is equal parts smeary shoegazing and epic early 80s synth-pop. Great song regardless.Explore more on these topicsKeshaAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockCountryDance musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Just beneath the stereo was a Reader’s Digest atlas. “Anytime we put on a record, I’d get out the atlas,” Saunder recalls. “It was like a gateway to the world – a way to dream, explore and let your mind wander.”Decades later, music and maps have come together again, this time in a coffee table book: Maps onVinyl, a world-first survey of the cartographic influence on album sleeve design; an atlas of album cover maps. It’s the book most music fans – and map-makers – never knew they needed.View image in fullscreenMore than 415 records are featured in Maps on Vinyl: An Atlas of Album Cover Maps.Illustration: Damien SaunderSaunder is a cartographer by trade. Formerly director of cartography at National Geographic and head of cartography at Apple (“I can’t talk about what we do there,” he says), he also helped develop a system for “mapping” tennis matches using ball-tracking technology, which in turn led to him working with Grand Slammers including Roger Federer.‘When you use a Walkman all the memories come back’: the people still in love with old techRead moreBut music and album cover design have always been passions. While he was studying typography at the ArtCenter College of Design in the US, a lecturer recommended looking at album covers for inspiration. “That’s when I wondered: have maps influenced album cover design? Turns out, they have – though strangely, it hasn’t been studied in cartographic academia. So, I dove in.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe project became a four-year labour of love: 32,000 words and a collection of more than 415 vinyl records – some of them deeply obscure, some celebrated.Artists with sleeves in the collection include Oasis, Coldplay, Talking Heads, Devo, Bob Marley, XTC, MC5, Queen, New Order, James Brown and Weezer. Others you will not have heard of unless you’re into Belgian speedcore.View image in fullscreenLittle Creatures by Talking Heads features cover art by Howard Finster and design by Tibor Kalman.Photograph: Damien SaunderSome major names in the design and graphics world are there, too: Peter Saville (New Order etc), Curtis McNair (Motown’s in-house designer), Neville Garrick (Bob Marley’s art director), Roger Dean (maker of fantasy worlds for the covers of Yes and Asia LPs) and Pedro Bell (Funkadelic, etc).Saunder collected physical copies of each record and photographed all the sleeves himself. That was one job he grossly underestimated, he says. “I set up a light room in our lounge, photographed each one, made sure the white and black colours appeared as they should, cleaned them, colour-corrected them – three to four tasks per cover … times 415 covers. I pushed through, but I definitely had some moments of doubt.”Then there was the research. Where possible, Saunder tracked down the designer responsible for each sleeve design to ask them how their concept came about and what it means.View image in fullscreenThe Equatorial Stars by Fripp & Eno, with sleeve design by Brian Eno and Hugh O’Donnell.Photograph: Damien SaunderThe selection criteria for the book was strict: no landscape paintings; no satellite photography. “A map had to be an abstraction of a geographic form – real or fictitious – and show spatial relationships. That distinction helped narrow the collection.”While maps are often celebrated for their beauty, they can also contain layers of meaning, says Saunder. “Even the most basic shapes of countries can draw out a lot of feelings – positive and negative.”The reasons for using maps on album sleeves vary. Some reflect origins – the country or city a band or artist comes from – while others are more aspirational. Peter Barrett’s sleeve design for the UK pressing of Madonna’s 1983 album Borderline, featuring conjoined maps of New York and London, speaks of a star about to make it in the UK. (“Did Madonna sign off on it? I don’t know,” says Saunder. “Is she into maps? I don’t know, but that would likely be the story behind that particular one.”)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has three covers in the book – one of them created for Canada’s Martha and the Muffins based on a 1:150,000-scaled map from the National Topographic System of Canada.View image in fullscreenMetro Music by Martha and the Muffins, featuring sleeve design by Peter Saville.Photograph: Damien Saunder“I fired off an email thinking he [Saville] would be too busy or whatever, but … we ended up having a great chat.

He said: “My symptoms weren’t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks. Because of how rapidly everything progressed I haven’t been able to share this news personally with everyone I care about so this feels the clearest and kindest way to let you know what’s happening.”McIvor had cancelled several recent gigs as he underwent testing. He added: “I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.”Optimo, with McIvor alongside Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes), are icons of Scottish and indeed British dance music culture, with their punkish and passionate attitude to DJing resulting in sets of astonishing power. Hopping from techno to disco, industrial to soft rock, their sets cover huge stylistic ground, and their weekly Optimo Espacio residency at Glasgow’s Sub Club between 1997 and 2010 became a pilgrimage for global dance fans.View image in fullscreenMcIvor, left, with Jonnie Wilkes AKA JG Wilkes.Photograph: Ross GiilmoreThe pair are musicians in their own right, creating ambitious remixes for artists including Florence + the Machine and Manic Street Preachers; McIvor also remixed the likes of Primal Scream, Hot Chip and Nightmares on Wax.Optimo also created acclaimed DJ mix albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part 2), Optimo Present Psyche Out and an entry in the mix series by London nightclub Fabric.

He then faced the gallery and clapped, which led to the gallery responding with claps and cheers.Later on Wednesday, judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs’s request that he be released on bail, saying that he had demonstrated a “disregard for the rule of law and a propensity of violence”. Combs has been incarcerated in a federal detention facility in Brooklynsince his September arrest. The judge also proposed a sentencing date of 3 October, but said he was willing to move up the date at the defense’s request.“I’ll see you when I get out,” Combs told family members including his mother and children just before leaving the courtroom to return to jail. “We’re going to get through this.”Combs’s lawyer Marc Agnifilo called the verdict a “great victory” and said the jury “got the situation right – or certainly right enough” as he stood outside Manhattan federal court at a stand of microphones. “Today is a victory of all victories.”2:41Supporters and critics claim victory as Sean 'Diddy' Combs denied bail after mixed verdict – videoWith acquittals on the charges that could have seen Combs be put behind bars for life, he faces a maximum of 10 years each for the two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Assistant US attorney Maurene Comey confirmed on Wednesday that the government intends to seek a sentence of incarceration.Combs’s lawyers said that under federal sentencing guidelines, he would likely face about two years in prison. Prosecutors, citing Combs’s violence and other factors, said the guidelines would call for at least four to five years. Locked up since his September arrest, Combs has already served nine months.“We fight on and we’re going to win,” Agnifilo said. “And we’re not going to stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.”1:56Sean Combs's lawyer claims 'victory of all victories' after mixed verdict in trial – videoOn Tuesday evening, the jury announced that it hadreached a verdict on four of the five counts– two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution – but said that they were unable to come to a decision on the racketeering conspiracy charge. On Wednesday, the jury returned with the verdict on that remaining count.Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.Prosecutors accused Combs of operating his business empire as a criminal enterprise, dating back to at least 2004, to carry out and conceal various crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, arson, bribery, forced labor, drug distribution, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice, with help from employees and close associates.The government alleged that Combs used his power and wealth, as well as violence and threats of blackmail, to coerce women into complying and participating in what were described as drug-induced sexual marathons often involving one of Combs’s girlfriends and male escorts, referred to as “freak-offs”.Throughout the trial, which began on12 May, the defenseacknowledged past instances of domestic violence,but denied that any coercion or sex trafficking took place and maintained thatall sexual activity was consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. They claimed Combs was being wrongly prosecuted for his private sex life and also denied that any criminal conspiracy existed.Over seven weeks, the government called 34 witnesses, includingtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, multipleformer employeesand assistants,male escorts, hotel staff, law enforcement agents and public figures such asrapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richardand others. Combs did not testify.Central to the prosecution’s case were the accounts from the two former girlfriends and alleged victims: singerCasandra “Cassie” Venturaand awoman identified as “Jane”.Both delivered raw and emotional testimony, alleging that Combscoerced theminto participating in the frequent and sometimes days-long “freak-offs”.They both described thealleged “freak-offs” in graphic detail, and testified that Combs directed, watched, masturbated during the encounters and sometimes filmed.Ventura testified that over the course of their decade-long relationship, Combs subjected her tophysical abuseandblackmail.She also alleged that heraped her after theirbreakup in 2018, and testified that Combs would at times threaten to release explicit footage of her, threaten to cut off financial support or stifle her career if sheacted in ways he did not like.Jurors wereshown the2016 hotelsurveillance footageof Combs attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway. They also heard from several witnesses who testified that they saw Combs be violent toward Ventura.Jane echoed many of Ventura’s claims, and testified that she repeatedly told the music mogul that sheno longer wantedto participate in the “freak-offs”. She said that he was dismissive and would pressure her, and that she felt “obligated” to participate as he paid her rent. She said Combs wouldthreaten to stop paying when she voiceddiscomfort with the sexual encounters.During cross-examination, Combs’s attorneys sought toportray both Ventura and Jane as willing and consenting participantsin the “freak-offs”, pointing to explicit and affectionate text exchanges with Combs in which the women appeared to speak positively about the encounters. The defense also frequently asked about the role that jealousy and drug use played in their relationships.A third woman, a former assistant to Combs who testified under the pseudonym “Mia”, alleged that Combs physically and sexually assaulted her during her employment, and said that she felt“trapped”and feared retaliation.Defense attorneyssuggested that she fabricated the allegations, and cited social media posts and messages in which she praised Combs after the alleged assaults.A handful of witnesses testified under immunity deals, including several of Combs’s personal assistants who claimed that they were tasked with obtaining drugs for Combs.Some former employees also testified that they would stock hotel rooms with baby oil and condoms and other items ahead of the “freak-offs” and then clean up afterward and said thatprotecting Combs’s public imagewas “very important”.Throughout the trial, the defense sought to undermine the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses. They pointed to inconsistencies in witness testimony and suggested that financial motivation played a role among those who have filed civil suits against the music mogul.The government restedits case on 24 June. The defense followed suit later that day, opting to call no witnesses, instead submitting more evidence to the court and relying on its extensive cross-examinations.Closing arguments were delivered last week.Prosecutorsrecappedtheir case against Combs, revisiting key testimony and breaking down each charge against the music mogul, painting him as a “leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to take “no for an answer” and who used “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.They argued that Combs was powerful but that he “became more powerful and more dangerous because of the support of his inner circle and his businesses”.The defense countered,and urged the the jury to acquit Combs and rejectwhat they called an “exaggerated” and “false” case by the government.Combs’s lawyer challenged witness testimony from the trial, pushed back on the government’s allegations and charges, and disputed the prosecution’s portrayal of Ventura and Jane as sex-trafficking victims, describing them instead as women with agency who willingly participated in the “freak-offs”.Though Combs didn’t testify, he remained visibly engaged throughout the proceedings, frequently conferring with his legal team and reacting visibly to testimony.Separately, Combs stillfaces dozens of civil lawsuits accusinghim of sexual assault. He has denied sexually assaulting anyone.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

And some of the dialogue: oof!Jack SealeThu 3 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Jul 2025 02.21 EDTShareMorpheus, AKA Dream, AKA the Sandman (Tom Sturridge) might be the immortal overlord of a magical netherworld and the director of all our subconscious visions, but he is not immune to relationship problems. “Ten thousand years ago, I condemned you to hell,” he says to his other half, having sensed that she is annoyed about something. “I think perhaps I should apologise.”Damn right! We’re back in the chilly, clammy grasp of The Sandman, the show that looks at the fantasy genre and says: what if we got rid of nearly all the lush landscapes, epic struggles, pointed political allegories and delicious, disgusting monsters, and replaced them with a moody bloke in a long black coat who goes around annoying everyone in a self-pitying monotone? Season two, part one – the saga concludes with another handful of episodes later this month – sees Dream attempt to grow and atone, questing first to rescue his beloved queen Nada (Deborah Oyelade), who is miffed about the whole 10-millennia-in-hades cock-up.Sorting that mess out requires Dream to negotiate for access with Lucifer herself (Gwendoline Christie, playing Satan as a weary lifer who tires of tormenting), then host a gathering of assorted netherworld freaks and legends in his maddeningly underlit dream castle. After that, he is off to attempt reunions and rapprochements with some of the family members who he has, over the course of eternity, alienated.The Sandmanreally is a curious beast. Where other, similar series centre around a hero warrior, the main guy here is more of an emo worrier, for ever standing stiffly in the shadowy corner of the frame, evading other characters’ gazes as he sulkily delivers platitudes suffused with doom and – quite literally, given the production’s apparent lighting shortage, gloom. The rhombus-jawed Sturridge is physically ideal for the role of Morpheus, with his concave cheeks and a set of eyelashes that could have someone’s eye out. But while his impeccably backcombed barnet and swishy monochrome outfits suggest he is about to break into a chorus ofEcho and the Bunnymen’s The Killing Moonat any moment – someone in the design department enjoys their 1980s pop, because they have also styled Freddie Fox’s Loki to look eerily like Billy Idol – he is, by design, never that entertaining. Even when he is turning Thor’s throbbing hammer to dust or personally granting William Shakespeare creative immortality, what could be fantastic adventures are always shuffled through stroppily as if they are tedious obligations.It just about works as an elaborate analogy for teenage disaffection – a time when you feel as if you’re acquiring some sort of awful power, but everyone becomes angry when you try to wield it, and not knowing why makes you more peevish still. When the show co-opts Greek, Norse and Christian mythologies, though, it doesn’t do much with them. The back half of this batch of episodes concerns Orpheus (Ruairi O’Connor), who in the Sandman universe is Morpheus’s son: after a rote retelling of the myth of Eurydice in the underworld, the show spends time trying to fashion a fresh spin on the tale’s coda – but the suspicion is that this was merely because it involves a talking severed head, which looks cool. A visit to a transgender acquaintance in present-day New York, meanwhile, is a story with an admirable, heartfelt moral that’s undermined by being delivered with zero dramatic subtlety.And: some of the dialogue Sturridge has to say! Oof. As for Morpheus’s appreciation of the power of storytelling – “Tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot” is the sort of non-zinger that would sound flat even if it wasn’t coming from a character who says everything in a depressed gothic whisper. And the dream-shaper’s stint as the caretaker manager of hell ends with him opining: “Hell is heaven’s reflection. They define one another. Without hell, heaven has no meaning.” A million lifetimes spent feeding off the deepest fears and desires of humanity, and he’s still cursed to sound like a failed evangelical preacher’s Instagram posts.The Sandman is not short of ideas, but it smothers them all in a fug of pretension, missing every opportunity it creates for itself. The fact that Morpheus has the ability to access humans’ dreams – to mould them and make them real – barely features. Even the comic relief of a sarcastic talking dog offers little respite: they got Steve Coogan to do the voice, but the real challenge for him would have been behind the scenes, pretending the lines he was given were funny.The Sandman is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNeil GaimanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Under his stewardship, Condé’s roster of glossy publications – titles such as Vogue, GQ and Glamour – broadened to include Architectural Digest, a revived Vanity Fair and the New Yorker. Newhouse spent big in pursuit of clout, and his company’s extravagant approach to expenses became the stuff of legend. Condé positioned itself as a gatekeeper of high-end living but, as Michael Grynbaum explains in Empire of the Elite, its success in the 80s and 90s was down to its willingness to embrace “low” culture.Condé brought pop stars, television personalities and tabloid intrigue into the highbrow fold, reconstituting cultural capital to fit the sensibilities of an emerging yuppie class with little interest in ballet or opera. Several moments stand out, in retrospect: GQ’s 1984 profile of Donald Trump, which paved the way for The Art of the Deal; Madonna’s 1989 debut on the cover of Vogue; and the New Yorker’s coverage of the OJ Simpson trial in 1994. Tina Brown, appointed editor of the New Yorker in 1992 after a decade at Vanity Fair, said she wanted “to make the sexy serious and the serious sexy”. Purists bemoaned what they saw as a slide into vulgar sensationalism, but Grynbaum maintains Brown “wasn’t so much dumbing down the New Yorker as expanding the universe to which it applied its smarts”.One journalist believes she missed out on an editorship because she gauchely ate asparagus with cutlery rather than by handThat expansiveness was key to Condé’s mission, and it succeeded so comprehensively that today we take it for granted. Anna Wintour’s Vogue would “elevate the idea of street-style fashion, and presage the industry of stylists and celebrity brand ambassadors that have come to dominate lifestyle media”, and GQ’s preppy, “proto-Patrick Bateman materialism” popularised “the metrosexuality, dandyism and male self-care that have since saturated the culture”.The glory started to fade in the 21st century. The company’s acquisitive ethos looked out of touch after the 2008 crash (“Condé’s metier was privilege, and privilege had become a dirty word”), and its underwhelming record on race came under scrutiny with the advent of Black Lives Matter. Social media democratised the means of cultural curation, undercutting the authority of established taste-makers. The book ends on a wistful note as Grynbaum contemplates the decline of print media, and the end of an era of plenty.A similar sentiment is expressed in the poignant title of a recent memoir by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter,When the Going Was Good. Like Brown’sThe Vanity Fair Diaries(2017) before it, Carter’s memoir offers a vivid, first-hand glimpse of the Condé social whirl. Both books have been praised for their anecdotal brio, and criticised for their namedropping smugness. It’s a trade-off. Conversely, Empire of the Elite is a sober affair – an unflustered, chronological account of half a century’s comings-and-goings – but has the merit of relative objectivity. The author, a correspondent by trade, keeps his focus on events and his opinions largely to himself; he neither grates nor delights.Gossip junkies and vicarious bon vivants will have more fun with Carter, but Empire of the Elite is a lucid introduction to this rarefied milieu and the people who inhabited it. It sounds like an exhausting world to navigate, “a land of unspoken codes … The proper knotting of an ascot; the angle of a tie bar; how you dressed, how you spoke, where you went, who you knew – these considerations mattered deeply.” Grynbaum quotes one journalist who believes she missed out on an editorship because, during the interview lunch, she gauchely ate asparagus with cutlery rather than by hand.Tellingly, several of the key players in the Condé story were outsiders: Newhouse, who was Jewish, felt excluded from the Waspy top echelons of US society; Alex Liberman, the veteran editorial director who took Newhouse under his wing and schooled him in urbanity, had been a refugee from Soviet Russia; Carter was a pilot’s son from Toronto. These arrivistes understood status anxiety, and astutely monetised it, offering readers an empowering sense of in-group membership for the modest price of a magazine subscription. And, because the United States is a nation built on clambering ambition, it worked.Empire of the Elite: Inside Condé Nast, the Media Dynasty That Reshaped the World by Michael M Grynbaum is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

Lawrence – who goes by his first name only – said he couldn’t speak to any old bandmates. Furthermore, there could be no anecdotes or use of the word “just”. Asked what is wrong with “just”, Lawrence tells him: “I just don’t like it.”A simultaneously entertaining and melancholic account of an overlooked musician, Street-Level Superstar depicts the sixtysomething Lawrence as a pallid eccentric who passes his time walking around London, who lives on liquorice and milky tea and is fearful of cheese – “We know that in nature if something smells, it is dangerous to eat.” We learn that Lawrence hasn’t had a girlfriend for years. Reflecting on sex, he says: “I was a two-minute wonder. They’re not missing much.”Yet there is a reason why Hodgkinson, who is also our narrator, chose to spend time trudging the streets with this oddball figure. It’s because he is convinced of Lawrence’s musical genius – as is Lawrence himself – even if the rest of the world appears immune. And while Hodgkinson can’t resist mining his intractability for laughs, his book is underpinned by empathy and a laudable lack of judgment.Most music biographies follow familiar trajectories of failure followed by triumph and redemption. But this is a rare tale of a promising career undermined by bad luck, self-sabotage and the fruitless quest for a hit. The audiobook also includes a wonderfully warm Q&A between author and subject, where Lawrence reflects on his fantasy as a youth that he was living in the film of his life.Available via Nine Eight Books, 10hr 44 minFurther listeningRomantic ComedyCurtis Sittenfeld, Penguin Audio, 9hr 5minSally, a divorced comedy writer practised in skewering celebrities, catches the eye of a pop star who is known for only dating models.

Her latest show, Diamonds and Dust, feels like it could have been made back then, in that this wild west-themed floor show comes without much of the innovation, subversion, irony and identity politics that have happened on the burlesque scene in between, including in Von Teese’s own work.The show is actually led by Faye Tozer from Steps. She’s a likable front woman, playing saloon owner Kitty LeRoy, her story of hardscrabble life and multiple husbands interspersed with acts combining burlesque, circus and dance. It’s gorgeous girls draped in pearls and lacy layers (teasingly removed), with a bit of lasso brandishing, a cowboy swinging from a chandelier (Magic Mike vibes) andTosca Rivolaproving herself talented on the cyr wheel. But the overall effect? I think the word is basic. Pretty young women taking off their clothes in not-that-interesting ways.View image in fullscreenArtistically, this feels like a step backwards … l to r, Sienna Walker, Cristian Liberti, Faye Tozer as Miss Kitty LeRoy, Manny Tsakanika and Zinzile Tshuma in Diamonds and Dust.Photograph: Chris Davis StudioVon Teese’s whole appeal is retro, and her obsession with period glamour is taken to deliciously detailed levels, but there’s retro and there’s retrograde. Or is that the point, that it’s a throwback? There’s something Tarantinoesque about the setting, a fetishisation of American pop culture and iconography. But I also couldn’t help thinking of the return to stereotypical femininity seen intradwivesand Maga women in push-up bras.Dita Von Teese: ‘Even when I was a bondage model, I had big-time boundaries’Read moreThe real point of it all, of course, is Von Teese herself (beware, she’s not performing in every show). She appears at the end of each half, a vivid, otherworldly presence smothered in diamante, with sparkling red lips and tiny corseted waist. At 52 she’s the absolute doyenne and holds the stage with regal charisma. Whether in statuesque pose or exultantly riding a contraption that’s a cross between a bucking bronco and a pink velvet Chesterfield, she’s untouchable, and therein lies the appeal. There is no doubt she’s worth seeing, and it’s important to say this could be a perfectly fun night out, but artistically, it feels like a step backwards.AtEmerald theatre, London, until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsBurlesqueDanceTheatreCabaretCircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

Revolutions are made by people – and those people are idealistic and messy and flawed. This is the truth at the core ofNtombizodwa Nyoni’s ambitious new play marking the 80th anniversary of theFifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester, a crucial moment in the postwar fight against colonial rule.It’s a story that’s both global and firmly rooted in the city, making it an ideal fit forManchester international festival. Set in and around the Congress, Liberation follows the people behind the movement, including veteran activists George Padmore (Eamonn Walker) and Amy Ashwood Garvey (Pamela Nomvete) and future African politicians Kwame Nkrumah (Eric Kofi Abrefa), Jomo Kenyatta (Tonderai Munyevu) and Joe Appiah (Joshua Roberts-Mensah). We see their public speeches, their private discussions and their pub-room debates.Did the liberation of Africa start in Manchester? The biting play about a pivotal, forgotten momentRead moreThere’s a fizzing tension between solidarity and idealism on the one hand and ambition and interpersonal conflict on the other. Nyoni’s script is alive to nuance and difficulty, staging knotty struggles between different genders, generations and regional loyalties, as well as prodding at complex ideas around political change and allyship. As young social worker Alma La Badie (an impassioned Leonie Elliott) observes, the Congress is a space of egos as much as principles, where righteousness coexists with hypocrisy.It’s a play that is, by its nature, all talk. Yet Nyoni and directorMonique Toukomanage to inject the proceedings with some theatricality and verve, recognising that there is no true liberation without joy. Music (composed by Ezra Collective’s Ife Ogunjobi) is central, soundtracking the jubilant entrance of Congress delegates and returning at key moments throughout. With so many people involved, some figures are inevitably given more space than others, but Nyoni deftly juggles the large ensemble of personalities and the strong cast flesh out even the smaller roles.Like the attractive interlocking hexagons of Paul Wills’s set, evoking the worker bee designs found all over Manchester, the competing aims of the Congress eventually – if only temporarily – tesselate. In many ways, Liberation is a celebration of shared struggle, but one that makes vital room for complexity.AtRoyal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreManchester international festivalRoyal ExchangeEzra CollectivereviewsShareReuse this content"

Thirteen medieval churches rise above the old town, some in disrepair. Others are renascent: St Mary-le-Tower was recently redesignated as a minster in recognition of its value to the community and its 1,000 years of existence. That’s not so long ago in a town settled very early – perhaps as early as the fifth century, and established by the seventh – by the Anglo-Saxons.Seen from between the columns and arches of Lloyds Avenue, Ipswich’s medieval core could be Trieste or Venice, minus the overtourismYou have to rummage to find historical treasures, which lie scattered, disguised, buried, bullied. The town has one of the best-preserved medieval cores in the country, but local planners wrapped it in roads, houses and, latterly, retail and leisure centres. Things are revealed by walking: the Tooley’s Court almshouses; lemon-hued, half-timbered Curson Lodge; gloriously pargeted Ancient House; an opulent town hall; and an ostentatious former post office on Cornhill, the main square. Seen from between the columns and arches of Lloyds Avenue, it could be Trieste or Venice, minus the overtourism and rip-off cappuccinos.View image in fullscreenCurson Lodge dates to the 15th century.Photograph: Alan Curtis/AlamyErica, fromThe Friends of the Ipswich Museums, shows me around themansion in Christchurch Park. Only four families ever lived here – the Withypolls, Devereux, Fonnereaus and Cobbolds – each associated with their times’ trades and trends: Atlantic merchant-adventurers, titled nobles, Huguenot linen traders, brewers and bankers. A standout exhibit is a patinaed oak overmantel rescued from a house on Fore Street that belonged to Thomas Eldred, who sailed round the world with Thomas Cavendish on his1586-8 circumnavigation. The flagship Desire gave its name to a port on the Patagonian coast. In a corner hangs a portrait of Admiral Edward Vernon, who participated in theWar of Jenkins’ Earbetween Britain and Spain in the mid-18th century andthe capture of Portobeloin Panama; he wore grogram cloth and is thought to have introduced toasts of rum-and-water – or “grog” – to the navy.Ipswich traded with northern Europe from Saxon times, growing to become aHanseatic Leagueport, exporting wool and woollen cloth, and importing wine from Bordeaux.On the harbour front isIsaacs on the Quay, a pub carved out of an old maltings. Behind it, at 80 Fore Street, is – according toHistoric England– “the last surviving example of a 15th- to 17th-century Ipswich merchant’s house with warehouses at the rear opening directly on the dock front, where merchandise was unshipped, stored and distributed wholesale or sold retail in the shop on the street front”. The local council considered filling the harbour in to build houses, but a festival in 1971 showed the area could be a place of recreation as well as cultural preservation; the Ipswich Maritime Trust, still very active, grew out of this showdown.Things to see and do:Willis Building;river cruise on the sailing barge Victor;freeA Peep into the Past touratChristchurch Mansion;Blackfriarsmonastery ruinsRamsey, Isle of ManView image in fullscreenThe Manx Electric Railway to Laxey and Snaefell summit.Photograph: Allan Hartley/AlamyTravelling overland to Ramsey from Douglas, you have a premonition of how important the sea must once have been. The meandering road and heritage electric railway both scale a mountain on the journey. Doing the trip on foot or horseback must have been hell. The Isle of Man’s longest river, the Sulby, plummets and meanders down from the uplands to meet the sea at Ramsey. Vikings, as well as Scots, entered theIsle of Manhere. Its name derives from the Old Norse for “wild garlic river”.The small working port breaks up a shoreline of sand and pebble beaches backed by apartment buildings and grand-seeming hotels. Timber and aggregate are massed up on the wharves. A bulk carrier called Snaefell River is moored beneath a single tall crane. To the south is the long Queen’s Pier, once a landing stage. Victoria never disembarked, but the pier recalls her visit. Above town is the Albert Tower. The consort made landfall.Once Ramsey was a popular seaside resort, with Steam Packet ships to Kirkcudbright, Liverpool and WhitehavenOnce Ramsey was a popular seaside resort, with Steam Packet ships to Kirkcudbright and Garlieston in Dumfries and Galloway; Liverpool and Whitehaven (I can see the Cumbrian fells). A swing bridge – closed to motorised traffic – connects the northern beach to Ramsey town centre, a likeable mishmash of Victorian buildings housing pubs, food and drink outlets, antique and bric-a-brac shops – and a very 80s strip mall with a Tesco, a drycleaner, a model shop and tattooists.On the edge of town, I find myself at Grove House, now a museum. It was the holiday home of the island’s second most famous Gibb family. Duncan Gibb was a shipping agent from Greenock. The house reaches out to foreign climes. A tiger skin on the floor of the drawing room. A leopard skin in the bedroom. Mahogany furniture from a primeval forest. Curtains from India. A japanned backgammon set. When the men sailed away or died out, a matriarchy took over.The Trafalgar pub, on West Quay, must have seen so many deals and binges, squabbles and scuffles. I drink an Odin’s mild in the corner.

The former snakes north of the town centre, often behind buildings – supermarkets, an enterprise zone – and is cut off by the city’s notorious roads. The canal sneaks up from the south-west, hopping across the river near a McDonald’s. Anyway, the natural movement here for pedestrians is upward and inland.The Romans took the high road. Marching through north Lancashire, operating in conjunction with naval transports, they could look out for landing troop detachments. A Roman fort was built on the hill now occupied by Lancaster Castle. It dates from the 12th century, as does the name of Lancashire, and is infamous as the place the Pendle Witches were imprisoned prior to their trial, sentencing and hanging. A small exhibition in a dungeon of the Well Tower recounts the key points of the story, reminding us Jack Straw refused to pardon them in 1998. The castle housed a prison till 2011; its Shire Hall is still used as a courtroom.Lancaster was once England’s fourth largest slave port, with at least 122 ships sailing to Africa between 1700 and 1800Lancaster was once England’s fourth largest slave port, with at least 122 ships sailing to Africa between 1700 and 1800. Local merchants were involved in the capture and sale of around 30,000 enslaved people. Slave-produced goods from the West Indies included sugar, dyes, rice, spices, coffee, rum and, later, cotton for Lancashire’s mills. Fine furniture, gunpowder, clothing and other goods were produced in and around Lancaster and traded in Africa for enslaved people, or sent to the colonies.View image in fullscreenThe Ashton Memorial, in Lancaster’s Williamson Park, has views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland fells.Photograph: Rob Atherton/AlamyThe slave trade and abolitiontrail, revised by Lancaster University professor Alan Rice, takes in churches, with their memorials to merchants who made money from slavery; theSugarhouse, a nightclub on the site of a former refinery; Gillow’s Warehouse, which imported slave-harvested mahogany to make furniture; and 20 Castle Park, home of the slave-owning Satterthwaite family. On the abolition side are a Friends Meeting House (Quakers were among the earliest opponents of slavery) and, most poignantly, three benches in and near Williamson Park provided by philanthropists for the vagrant poor – including cotton workers laid off during thecotton faminecaused by anti-slavery measures taken by Lancashire firms.The small city of Lancaster, with its university campus and would-be genteel airs, looks and feels innocuous, and altogether unconnected to stormy seas.

More times a week than I feel comfortable disclosing here, I’d trundle down to the Tesco Express in Durham to score a bottle ofPlaza Centro proseccofor the sublime price of £5.50 (it’s now a princely £7). While many other wine writers’ careers begin with a unicorn bottle from a relative’s cellar, I’m proud to say that mine started here.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Why am I telling you this? Well, not only did I feel cool sipping my fizz from a plastic flute while my friends drank rum and orange juice mixed and swigged direct from the carton, but I also loved prosecco. Today, however, I’m more indifferent, which is not to say that prosecco has got any worse or changed in any way over time. But I have. When I was an 18-year-old concerned with getting as trollied as possible in the least amount of time and at little cost, I was drawn to sweetness, as many of us are when we’re younger, and most supermarket prosecco is rather sweet – even the confusingly named “extra dry” category allows for 12-17g sugar per litre.Nowadays, however, I crave acidity, salinity and all the punchy savoury flavours I can get. And, fortunately, there is so much Italian sparkling wine out there that isn’t prosecco. Nigh on every region in Italy has its own take. The Trento DOC, which, like prosecco, is in the north-east, producesmetodo classicowines from chardonnay and pinot nero (pinot noir), which are made using the champagne method with a secondary fermentation in the bottle (prosecco, on the other hand, is produced usingthe charmat, or tank, method). They can command fairly high prices, but they can still be had in your local supermercato for far less than champers.Then there’s moscato d’Asti, an off-dry, frizzante wine with a low ABV and a nose that leans towards bouquets of flowers and gentle stone fruit such as peach and apricot. I especially like it in cocktails for which you’d normally use prosecco: pornstar martini, bellini, any spritz you fancy. Franciacorta, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly popular, and also employs the metodo classico makeup of pinot nero and chardonnay. Moving down to Emilia-Romagna, you’ll find the previously-out-of-vogue-but-now-really-quite-cool lambrusco, which takes many forms and colours; the one you’re most likely to find in the UK is a deep currant colour with a vibrant effervescence. There are also many producers who feel inspired by certain vintages or regional styles and choose to make their own declassified sparkling wines.All that said, if prosecco is your bag, have at it. It’s an eternal crowdpleaser, widely available and suited to most palates – there’s a reason the UK is the drink’s biggest consumer outside Italy.

It was the beginning of our second long summer stay in my partner’s grandparents’ house in Gela, a city on the south coast. The previous year had been the first time in many years that the house had been opened up and (thanks to the practical skills of another cousin) made comfortable and pretty much fully functional. Not functional enough, though, to cope with being closed up for another eight months, so when we arrived in 2016 the oven, fridge and washing machine all had problems getting going. So much so that we replaced two of them, but decided to do all we could for the cooker. Also, because it really was and is an extension of my partner’s grandmother Sara, who (I’ve been told) would have hated me turning her into a caricature.We called a man who gave the 1970s cooker a thorough service and, after replacing the gas tubes and valves, gave it the all-clear, while making it plain that this was almost certainly a last reprieve. He left saying that while we should make the most of it, we shouldn’t make too many demands of it. Being June, and in a small house in the middle of an industrial city, demanding things from a gas ring, never mind an oven, was not a priority. So we used the oven only occasionally, and when we did only very early in the day, to make various things, including a few recipes for this column and the first incarnation of this week’s recipe,le scacce ragusane.Typical of Ragusa, which is about 70km from Gela, scacce means squashed, and refers to the way the dough is wrapped and squashed around a rich filling of tomato, onion and cheese. The traditional cheese isragusano, a firm cow’s milk cheese (part of thepastafilatastretched-curd cheese family) made in the provinces of Ragusa and Syracuse, and just as effective and tasty as cheddar, scamorza and provola. There is also no reason you couldn’t add a few anchovies to the tomato mix, too.In much the same way as a pop tart, the filling will be molten hot for quite some time, so leave them to cool a bit before biting into them,orleave to cool completely before stacking and wrapping up in a clean tea towel to take on a picnic. When they are unpacked, they can be eaten whole, Cornish pasty-style, or cut into thick slices.Folded flatbreads with tomato, onion and cheese (scacce)Makes410g dried yeast, or 20g fresh yeast50ml tepid milk1 pinchsugar500g durum wheat or plain flourOlive oilSalt400g ripe tomatoes2 large onions, peeled and sliced1 pinch dried oregano200g ragusano, or cheddar, grated or cut into small cubesStart on the dough by mixing the yeast with the milk and a pinch of sugar, then leave it to wake up for 10 minutes. Add the flour, 220ml water, two tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt, and bring everything together into a soft dough. Knead, then cover and leave to rest for two hours, or until doubled in size.Peel the tomatoes by plunging them first into boiling water for two minutes and then into cold water, so the skins pull away easily. Quarter the tomatoes, scoop out the seeds and cut the flesh into slender arcs.In a pan on a low heat, soften the onions in olive oil with a pinch of salt, then add the tomatoes and oregano, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the mixture is rich and thick.Cut the dough into four equal pieces, then, working on a lightly oiled surface, roll and press each quarter into a roughly 20cm x 30cm rectangle. Spread some of the tomato mix in the centre of each piece and leave clear a border all around the edge – 5cm at the long sides and 2cm at the top and bottom. Sprinkle over a quarter of the cheese, then bring in the long sides to cover the filling. Fold in half like a book, then pinch the top and bottom edges like a pop tart.Lift on to a baking tray, brush with oil and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 40 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool before wrapping.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPastryBakingSnacksPieCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"
